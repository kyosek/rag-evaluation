The initial copyright owner is the author of the work. In cases of employment, the \"author\" might be the natural person who authored the work, or the corporate person who employed the natural author.\n\nTo clarify your thinking about registration: copyright registration is a public record of authorship (or copyright ownership). Registration does not create a copyright, but is merely a recording of the copyright that was automatically created at the moment of original authorship.\n\nDepending on circumstances and jurisdiction, Alan might have a legitimate claim to copyright on his own work. However, he will be quite hard\\-pressed to find a convincing theory of law that allows him to publish the unpublished copyrighted work of *other people* without their permission.\n\nThis leaves him either to admit defeat \\-\\- he cannot possibly own the copyright of his coworkers' code, so he cannot have legally reproduced it \\-\\- or else make the baldfaced lie that the code has no other authors other than Alan himself. For your company to disprove such a claim, you may employ sworn testimony of your coworkers, you may employ code analysis to show differing coding styles (suggestive of multiple authors), or you may show code backups or version control history showing the progressive authorship of the work over time by many people.

This means that the startup's code is protected by copyright as soon as it's written, regardless of whether it's published or registered. Publishing the code first or having a signed commit on GitHub does not grant copyright ownership.

My permanent address is still my parent's place, as is my driver's license address and passport address. \n\n> Am I still eligible to vote in State A? Is it illegal to register to vote in State B unless I go through some process?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To vote in a state, you must be a resident of that state. While attending school out of state does not terminate your legal residency in A, establishing residency in B does. If you want to vote in B, become a resident and register in B; if you want to remain a resident of A and vote in A, don't do that.\n\nEstablishing residency in B generally boils down to intending to reside in B for more than a temporary period. I suspect that most states do not have a universal definition of \"resident\", so for example in Washington, each agency has its criteria for residency. To register to vote, you have to be a legal resident and live at the address for 30 days (prior to the next election). One way to establish residency is getting a drivers license, which has a [residency requirement](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.16A.140) that is satisfied by receiving state benefits (only available to residents), registering to vote (hmmm), getting, according to [Licensing](http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/moving.html), or \"Declaring residency for the purpose of obtaining a state license or tuition fees at resident rates\", according to the actual law, in\\-state tuition, or get any state license at resident rates (we see a pattern here). The Department of Licensing also accepts utility bills with address (excluding cell phone, internet, or satellite), bank statements, and so on. This, BTW, is the most common path to *establishing* residency: take a bank statement or similar with street address to the license office. For [hunting and fishing](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.08.075), you have to live in a permanent place of abode in the state for 90 days. There are a number of ways to show that: use a Washington address for federal taxes; run for public office or use a Washington address for some court papers; be a custodial parent of a child attending school in the state; register to vote, have a driver's license; register a vehicle in the state. The suicide law restricts the right to medical suicide to residents, proof of which includes (is not limited to) having a Washington driver's license (which is not the same as a state ID card), being registered to vote, or owning / leasing property in the state.\n\nThere is a [social services definition](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=388-468&full=true), based on either living in Washington intending to continue for an indefinite period, or entering the state looking for a job with a job commitment and it explicitly says \"A person does not need to live in the state for a specific period of time to be considered a resident\". But for [tuition purposes](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=28B.15.012), you have to have moved to the state for reasons other than tuition, and you have to have been here at least a year. Ohio similarly has an agency\\-by\\-agency approach to \"residency\". If you exclude financial benefits and focus on drivers license or state ID and voter registration, you can probably make a reasonable guess as to the requirements. There is no official registration or form to fill out to become \"a resident\" (as far as I know, in any state), so the law will say what could constitute evidence that you *are* a resident.

The administrative users of the school manage the school's base\\-data with it, meaning children, teachers, parents, classrooms, and the relationships between those\n2. Teachers may log in, an post homework, pictures to a timeline, and log absence or presence information of children\n3.

Am I right in assuming that in this case the school is the controller, and the SAAS\\-provider is the processor?\n2. This would mean that, under GDPR\\-law, the SAAS\\-provider needs to provide a DPA and sign it with the school?\n3. The responsibility of having the DPA signed lies with the school, and not with the SAAS\\-provider? The provider must provide it, and sign it if requested by the school?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Under GDPR the Controller is the party which has defined \"purpose\" and \"scope\", meaning what the Processor is supposed to do while Processing Personal Data within the scope of a Service being rendered by the Controller.\n\nSo, if the Controller has defined what the Software does and the other company has developed the software \"tailor\\-made\" as per the Controller's request and now makes it available for the Controller to use it as a Service, then YES, the SaaS Company is the Processor and the School the Controller.\n\nHowever, most likelly, the SaaS company has developed a Software on its own that addresses \"most common needs\" of schools, and that makes them also a controller, for they has defined WHAT the SW does... so on that case:\n\\- the School is a Controller under that Service Scope\n\\- the SaaS company is both a Co\\-controller and a Processor (since it enables the tool as a Service).\n\n2. Controllers, being the ones that define \"purpose\" and \"scope\" should also be the ones enabling their own DPA for the Processor to sign... if the SW was \"tailor\\-made\" at the request of the School, then the School must provide the DPA for the SaaS company to sign. On the other hand if the SW already existed, hence both act as Co\\-Controllers and since the SW scope is the one that bears most relevancy within the \"relationship\" and Shared Services, the SaaS Company should provide the DPA for the School to sign (similar to what happens with Cloud hosting companies line AWS or Azure).\n3. It's not a matter of \"responsibility\" but of \"risk mitigation\" for the Controller since under GDPR the Controller becomes liable for any non\\-compliance points on the Processor's side.\nAgain, if the School is the Controller and the SaaS company the Processor, then it is of the utmost interest of the School to have a DPA ratified between both.\nNevertheless, and since it is most likely that both act as Co\\-controllers, it is most relevant for both to have the DPA in order.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A school uses a cloud-based software (SaaS) for managing student data, teacher communication, and parent interactions.

If one party wants the police there, it is standard to wait. If **both** decide it not necessary, it is fine to leave. Either way, leaving or staying does not give rise to the avoidance of a finding of fault against one party or another. The state of Wisconsin is a Tort State (as opposed to a no\\-fault state). These are insurance related issues as opposed to legal issues, but utterly intertwined. The accident reports filed by each party, any police reports and other relevant data will be submitted to the DMV and the insurance, and the insurance companies will assign fault if the DMV or police haven't, either by agreement or inter\\-company arbitration.\n\nRelating to your question, however, you will see the processes required [HERE](http://www.dmv.com/wi/wisconsin/auto-accidents). In part, it states the following:\n\n> **REPORTING AN ACCIDENT TO THE WISCONSIN DOT** In **some** situations, you must report an accident to the Wisconsin Police.

In the event that another driver offers to pay\n>  for damages and asks you not to report an accident, you are still\n>  required to file the report in any of the situations outlined above.\n> \n> \n> Your report must include detailed and current information regarding\n>  your insurance coverage. The DOT will cross\\-check this information\n>  with the insurance company shown on the report. If you did not have\n>  liability insurance when the accident occurred and were unable to\n>  provide restitution for injuries or damages sustained due to your\n>  negligence, your driving privileges will be suspended.

You\n>  can mail the original directly to:\n>  Traffic Accident Section, Wisconsin Department Of Transportation,\n>  Po Box 7919,\n>  Madison, WI 53707\\-7919\n\nAs you can see, *from your interpretation/description*, you were not technically required to deal with the police, but you *were* required to exchange information, assess and give aid to the extent possible to the other driver, and so if the other called for emergency intervention it may be the other driver disagreed w/ one of these assessments (damage or injury).\\*\\*\n\nIf you did exchange information, took photos, etc., you are probably ok. If not, certainly that will be problematic. \n\n\\*\\*I know you are saying there was no damage or injury. However, while you are saying this is what the other driver acquiesced to, it may be that it is not the case either afterward or he/she wanted to avoid (potentially dangerous) interaction at the scene. That said, while you can clearly see the situations by which the police are necessitated, you also indicate the other driver called the police. In that case, you *probably* should have stayed once you were alerted to that fact, as leaving puts you in the precarious position of only the other driver's side being documented by the police, and your absence may lead the officer to find you at fault or with something to hide. \n\nThe officer will file a report, either way, of which you must get a copy. If he disagrees with your assessment of the damage/injury and feels you left in the face of those situations proscribed, you will know because you will be arrested or summoned for leaving the scene. That is to be determined by the reporting officer.\n\nIn the future, if there is an accident and one driver explicitly states the police have been called, you should wait. You don't have to say anything at all to the officer, if you don't want to. In most states, all you need to do is give the officer your driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. It always looks worse to leave the scene knowing they are coming, since it may lead to a determination that it was illegal to do so. Whereas, no additional harm can come from remaining present.\n\nSo far, I cannot find a state statute there whereby it is explicitly illegal to leave once one driver calls for emergency assistance.

I assume that the lease ended long ago, and you've been living there month to month.\n\nAssuming that we can read \"two rental periods\" as \"two whole months\" (if there is something else in the lease that indicates this, such as a rent due\\-date), then we can interpret the notice requirement as saying that you must give notice before the first of the month 2 months before the intended end of tenancy \u2013 that is *one* meaning of the lease. Another meaning is that you can give notice 58 days in advance. The lease has an ambiguity as to what the notice requirement is. Since you did not write the lease, and they did (well, someone, whose obligations they inherited, did), the ambiguity is construed against the party to wrote it. In the present circumstance, because you want to leave soon, you would not be held to the notice requirement that favors the landlord. It's entirely non\\-obvious why such wording would be used.\n\nIn [504B.135](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=504B.135), the statutes say\n\n> (a) A tenancy at will may be terminated by either party by giving\n>  notice in writing.

Vilsack](https://casetext.com/case/wynn-v-vilsack), a motion for preliminary injunction was granted (and the program was *not* ruled unconstitutional). In the ruling, the court found that the evidence \"does not support a finding that USDA continues to be a participant, passive or active, in discrimination\", and does find that there were past successful remediation efforts, thus \"the Court expresses serious concerns over whether the Government will be able to establish a strong basis in evidence warranting the implementation of Section 1005's race\\-based remedial action\", moreover \"Plaintiff has convincingly shown that the relief provided by Section 1005 is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest\". The court finds that there is a good\\-enough case that the law fails strict scrutiny. Incidentally, Congress repealed that law.\n\nOn the other hand, in Evanston, we have no facts or concrete legal allegations (e.g. drafts of a legal complaint).

There does exist at least one available [council action from 2019](https://www.cityofevanston.org/home/showpublisheddocument/90573/638249272128130000) which says that\n\n> The Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to divert all adult\n> use cannabis funds received by the Illinois Department of Revenue for\n> sales of adult use cannabis to a separate fund in a City account for\n> local reparations.

The [Program Guidelines](https://www.cityofevanston.org/home/showpublisheddocument/66184/637677439011570000) \u00a73 indicates that a person may be eligible for money if they are an ancestor, direct descendant, or \"other\" who has suffered from a \"City ordinance, policy, or procedure that served to discriminate against the Applicant in the area of housing\". It thus does not exclude Asian and Hispanic homeowners, LGBTQIA2S\\+, Catholic, Muslims or anyone else, except insofar as a Catholic was not demonstrably the victim of such discrimination.

I am neither the OP of that question nor in any way related to the OP, I'm asking this question out of personal curiosity. In brief, the situation is that the OP has a medical issue, but his boss (verbally) threatened to fire him if he went to the doctor. Various answers in that thread are suggesting getting written proof that the boss verbally denied the trip to the doctor to use in court later.\n\nNow, here's my question: Clearly, this boss is a jerk. Also, this boss is probably not an idiot. If he's being asked to provide in writing something that he said verbally, he's going to know something's up. Furthermore, he's probably smart enough to know that what he is doing is of questionable legal standing, so getting the boss to provide a written statement that the doctor visit was denied is easier said (written? Because webforum? Hah!) than done.\n\nA solution to the above problem was suggested in a comment on an answer:\n\n> In the very likely case that you submit your request in writing and your boss replies verbally, write back to your boss confirming his denial. \"This message confirms that on Tuesday 10am you verbally denied my urgent request for time off at X.\" Send a Cc to HR and Bcc yourself at a personal email address. Every time you have a \"conversation\" about this issue verbally, confirm back in writing.\n\nAssume that the boss does not respond to any of these emails to confirm or deny the content as stated, and the \"chain\" of emails, such as it is, is completely one\\-sided, with the OP emailing his boss various things of this nature. My question is:\n\n**To what degree are such emails admissable in court as evidence, and what weight do they carry?**\n\nI'm tagging this question as united\\-states because the original question on Workplace SE was about the USA, but insight into the legal systems of other countries would also be interesting for me, just out of curiosity. I am Canadian myself, so insight into the legal system in Canada would be of particular interest (I am not in such a situation myself, I just find it interesting out of curiosity).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> To what degree are such emails admissible in court as evidence, and\n>  what weight do they carry?\n\nYour own statement, when offered by you as evidence, is hearsay, unless it comes within an exception to that rule. [Recorded recollection](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional_Exceptions#Past_Recollection_Recorded) might be one of the better exceptions. There is also a chance that you could get it in as a [business record](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional_Exceptions#Business_Records) of the company if you were using a company email account and the company stores all of its email communications. The documents also sometimes come in to [provide fair context](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional_Exceptions#Narrative) for a conversation with a party\\-opponent's statements that are admissible.\n\nIt appears that Canada does not follow the modern British rule (which [repealed the hearsay rule in civil cases in 1995](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/38/section/1)), which if it were available, would come in without any difficulty at all. But, Canada does have what it calls a \"[principled exception](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Principled_Exception)\" (which is somewhat broader than the parallel U.S. residual hearsay exception) that is generally available if the document can be shown to be reliable and there is an unavailable witness, or if there proponent of the document can show that it is reliable and necessary for other reasons.\n\nEven if the document itself is not admissible since it is hearsay, you could still testify as to what the boss said from your own recollection, and then have your lawyer ask you why you are sure that this is what was said. You would answer that you contemporaneously wrote a confirming letter to the boss spelling out what was said and you reviewed it to refresh your recollection before testifying at the hearing or trial.\n\nThese kinds of confirming letters are used quite frequently in business and employment litigation. And, in my experience, these statements tend to be surprisingly effective and persuasive, because, while they do not foreclose the possibility that the person writing it was lying or inaccurate in the confirming email account, it does rule out the possibility that you forgot exactly what was said, and you provided the boss with an opportunity to dispute you which the boss didn't feel an obligation to correct.\n\nIf one party has a coherent account in confirming emails of what was said, and the other party is trying to remember what happened a year or two earlier without notes from the witness stand, the person with the coherent, documented account is almost always going to come across as more credible unless the other side can show that your confirming emails are not infrequently gross misrepresentations of what really occurred.

While they may not be automatically admissible as direct evidence, they could be used to support the employee's testimony by showing that they contemporaneously documented the conversations. The employee could testify about the conversations and use the emails to refresh their recollection.

In such cases, creditors can gain access to the assets of the company to which the assets were transferred (in this case, XYZ Inc.). This right typically exists for four years from the date of transfer or one year from the discovery of the transfer in the U.S. \n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that debt cannot be transferred without the creditor's consent. The proposal as described is fundamentally flawed, as it suggests transferring liabilities to a subsidiary, which is not possible without creditor agreement.\n\nIf XYZ Inc. were to attempt this, a bankruptcy trustee could exercise the right to pursue XYZ Inc.'s assets on behalf of all creditors. This makes option D the most accurate statement among the given choices."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50122/do-the-german-contact-restrictions-prohibit-any-form-of-celebrating", "docs_id": 50122, "title": "Do the German contact restrictions prohibit any form of celebrating?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Germany has enacted a general \"ban on contact\", effective starting today (Monday, 2020\\-03\\-23\\).

At least some of the above statements can be interpreted in such a way that it's about the *physically close group* aspect. That is, celebrations whose participants meet *in person in the same place* are prohibited.\n\nBut then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the \"serious situation in our country\" makes such a behaviour unbecoming.

But it is a really big channel.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Indiviual words and short phrases such as titles cannot be protected by copyright. However, they can be protected by trademark law. \"Android\" is a trademark in the US, in the EU, and I am pretty sure in most if not all other countries.\n\nTrademark protection is specific to a purpose or area. If you are writing an SF novel which contains an artificial being, you can describe that being as \"an android\" without infringing the trademark protection on the mobile phone OS. However, using the term \"android\" to describe a pieces of mobile phone software is likely to be an infringement. \n\nTrademark law is different in different countries. For example, in some countries, there is no protection unless a trademark is registered. In others, including the US, simply using a term to label a product or service in commerce can create protection, although registration can give additional rights to the trademark holder. The exact rights protected and the standards for measuring infringement will also vary, but there are many similarities in trademark laws across the world.\n\nOne can use a trademark to refer to the trademarked product or service, and this is not an infringement. For example, one can write a review of Android phones vs Iphones, and use the term \"Android\". This is called \"*Nominative use*\" or sometimes \"*Nominative fair use*\". One must be careful not to imply that the trademark owner has approved, endorsed, or sponsored the use. With a review, this is usually fairly obvious. But in other cases of nominative use it can be more of an issue. For example, one might write in an advertisement \"This software is compatible with Android phones.\" That is nominative use, but a reader might think that the software has been in some way approved by the trademark holder. The ad should therefore make it very clear that there has been no such approval, sponsorship, or affiliation. This is often do0ne with an explicit disclaimer, such as \"XYZ software is not produced by, approved, sponsored by, or affiliated with Android, which is a trademark of Google.\" \n\nIn general one should use no more of a trademark than is needed to identify a product under nominative use. It is generally better practice to sue the name, but not the logo. Use of a logo is more likely to appear to indicate some sort of affiliation. But this is not an absolute rule. For example, a product which is compatible with many other products might display a list of logos, provided it makes clear that this merely indicates compatibility. not approval.\n\nThe basic standard is that one may not use a trademark so that a reasonable person, a customer or potential customer, might plausibly be confused into thinking that a product or service comes from the trademark holder, or is in some way approved by, endorsed by, or is affiliated with the trademark holder, or that the reputation associated with the trademark properly attaches to the product that uses the trademark without permission. Also, one may not use a trademark so as to dilute it, treating it as a generic term for all products of a similar type. For example, one should not use \"Xerox\" as a synonym for \"photocopy\", as that dilutes the Xerox trademark. \n\nOne may offer training or instruction about a trademarked product, and one may use the trademark to identify the product about which instruction is begin offered. This is a form of nominative use, and like other forms, the user must make the lack of any affiliation clear, and avoid possible consumer confusion. This would apply to publicly posted videos.\n\nUsing a handle such as \"AndroidGuy\" to indicate that one is a fan of, or an expert with, Android phones could be a form of nominative use, but seems rather likely to create confusion. If others might reasonably think this indicates that \"AndroidGuy\" is some sort of official representative of Android, or has in some way been approved or authorized by Google, that would be infringement.\n\nA channel name, unlike a handle, comes with a description, that could help clarify the lack of affiliation. But again, if anyone might reasonably be confused into thinking the channel or the videos posted there are sponsored by Google, that might be infringement. If the videos are being sold, or are used to advertise commercial courses or any other products or services, one must be particularly careful to avoid any implied affiliation. \n\nTrademark infringement, like copyright infringement, is usually a civil matter, not a criminal one. That means that the trademark holder must bring a court case or other legal proceeding to stop the infringement, or to recover damages or penalties. Some holders are more aggressive about this than others. This also means that a holder can file suit even in cases that are clearly permitted nominative use, and it is up to the defendant to assert and demonstrate that the use is permitted under the relevant law.

I understand why the laws are in place, I don't understand what the minimum requirement is, and what is just trying to cover the bases just in case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is illegal to sell alcohol to a minor in Washington ([RCW 66\\.44\\.270](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.44.270)). The seller can get into various kinds of trouble, including losing their license, under [liquor board regulations](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-11). However, as long as the establishment follows the rules for [acceptable ID](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-11-025), they [escape liability](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.210) if in fact they sell alcohol to a minor: the license holder is [legally allowed](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.170) to accept an identification of the specific type. That is the sense in which this is required by law: the customer must have actually presented the identification, in order for the establishment to escape liability ([RCW 66\\.20\\.210](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.210)). Looking old enough is not the issue. It is legal to sell alcohol to a person who is over 21, and the law does not *require* presentation of identification as a condition for a sale. However, under [RCW 66\\.20\\.180](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.20.180) a person is require to produce ID \"upon request of any *licensee*, peace officer, or enforcement officer of the board\". The legal risk attached to sales in an age\\-marginal situation is very high, and actual presentation of ID is required to escape liability by the establishment, so in that sense, it is \"required by law\".\n\nAll requests to produce ID for liquor sales (at least in Washington, and leaving out deliveries which are governed by other laws) are driven by company policy. Typical policies are quite rational, being designed to protect the company's interest in not getting into a heap of trouble for an under\\-age sale. There is no law saying when you must ask, or when you are protected if you don't ask. Usually, store policy is to use \"common sense\" so that 90 year olds are not required to produce ID (they may be asked, jokingly).\n\nNon\\-compliance with RCW 66\\.20\\.180 carries no legal penalty, that is, there is nothing in the statute that says \"if the customer doesn't...\". The most obvious would be that the seller would refuse to sell, which the seller can arbitrarily do anyhow. There is no statutory penalty imposed on a licensee if they request ID of a person over 21 and the person fails / refuses to produce the ID. Obviously, the licensee cannot be punished if a customer fails to provide ID (and leaves), especially if they lost it. But the law \"requires\" them to provide an ID, with ne except \"unless you leave / put the bottle back\". Somewhat less obviously, if the legislature wants to, it can enact a provision that once a licensee requests ID, they are forbidden to sell alcohol to that customer until ID is provided. But there currently is no such law.\n\n\"The law\" also included regulations, such as [WAC 314\\-17\\-105](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-17-105). This regulation is a chart, and the relevant entry is\n\n> PERMIT: Failure to produce permit or identification upon request. See\n>  RCW 66\\.20\\.310 and 66\\.20\\.180\\.\n\nfor which the 1st offense consequence is \"5\\-day permit suspension OR $100 monetary option\". This is a problematic regulation (potential lawsuit fodder), since it can be interpreted in a number of ways. The question is, of whom is the permit or identification predicated? Only the licensee has a permit, but customers and employees can both have identification. If we interpret this regulation as meaning \"Failure by licensee or customer\", then we arrive at the absurd conclusion that if a customer fails to produce ID on request, the establishment is fined. It is important to note that this regulation is under a chapter about server training, thus the regulation can only reasonably be interpreted as being about licensee providing identification.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Washington State, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal requirements for selling alcohol and requesting identification?\n\nA) It is always illegal to sell alcohol without checking ID, regardless of the customer's apparent age.\n\nB) The law requires customers to provide ID upon request, but there is no specific penalty for non-compliance.\n\nC) Stores are legally required to ask for ID from every customer, regardless of company policy.\n\nD) If a customer refuses to show ID when asked, the store is legally obligated to refuse the sale.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Washington State law, customers are required to produce ID \"upon request of any licensee, peace officer, or enforcement officer of the board\" (RCW 66.20.180). However, there is no specific legal penalty for customers who fail to comply with this request. The law does not mandate that stores must ask for ID in every case, nor does it explicitly state that stores must refuse a sale if ID is not provided. Rather, checking ID is typically driven by company policy to protect against liability for underage sales. While it's in the store's best interest to verify age through ID, the law itself does not penalize customers for non-compliance or stores for selling without seeing ID, as long as the customer is actually of legal age."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83177/who-has-to-pay-restaurant-bill", "docs_id": 83177, "title": "Who has to pay restaurant bill", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Based on a story from another site: It\u2019s A\u2019s birthday.

So A is stopped from leaving the restaurant.\n\nQuestion: Is the restaurant entitled to ask *any* member of the group to pay (and since A is the only one still present they demand money from A)? If A explains the situation and the restaurant owner is sympathetic, would he be entitled to ask for payment from mum instead (who isn\u2019t there anymore, but A can provide name, address and phone number)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Who entered the contract with the restaurant?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn order for the restaurant to collect from a person, that person must have entered into a contract for the meal. That is, from the restaurant's point of view, they must have indicated that they would like some food and, since everyone knows how restaurants work, they know that the food will have to be paid for.\n\nWhether a given person entered a contract will depend on the specific facts. If they opened their mouth and said to the waiter something like \u201cI\u2019ll have the chicken\u201d, they almost certainly entered a contract and they are obliged to pay. This is even if they had an expectation that someone else would pay for them \\- the restaurant is not involved in any other contracts or arrangements you might have with third\\-parties. You ordered, you\u2019re on the hook.\n\nIn a situation where you didn\u2019t order, the answer is still probably yes, you have to pay. Again, because you know how restaurants work, by eating the meal that was placed in front of you rather than saying, \u201cJust so you know, your contract for this meal is with that guy over there, is that okay?\u201d, you probably entered a contract by your action of eating the meal.\n\nMore broadly, when a group collectively enters a contract with the restaurant, they are probably agreeing with the restaurant that they will be jointly and severally bound. That is, each is responsible for all and the restaurant can pursue any or all of the people they have a contract with.\n\nA minor dining with their parents is probably not entering a contract with the restaurant. Not because minors can\u2019t enter contracts (they absolutely [can](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/58279/344)) but because of the normal expectation that the parent is entering the contract.\n\nThis is because of a principle that contract terms may be implied by [custom](https://legalvision.com.au/different-types-of-implied-terms/). That is, if there is a general understanding that this is the way things are done, then that will be something the law will enforce. This is a simple expedient adopted in order to make the world work \\- if every term of every contract had to be explicitly detailed in advance this would be a) unworkable and b) impossible.\n\nEven if there is no contract, the restaurant has equitable remedies like unjust enrichment.

According to the legal principles outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. When a group dines together, there's often an implied contract that they are jointly and severally liable for the bill.\n2.

This is typically implemented without prior notice and often with an additional fee attached. Typically the landlord will have a preexisting clause in the lease that says the landlord may choose to amend the lease at a later date. The landlord then amends the lease to insist that rent payments are only accepted in the form of deductions from a landlord\\-issued debit card. The landlord then will not accept payments using traditional methods such as a check.\n\nWord of mouth seems to be that these policies are illegal, but I have had difficulty finding information on this topic that is not from the card\\-issuing entities.\n\nCan a landlord in Ohio (U.S.A.) legally impose a mandate on their existing residents that a bank account be opened in their name and used for rent payment? If landlords can or cannot, what section of the law defines who can and cannot compel a citizen into banking against the citizen's will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Typically the landlord will have a preexisting clause in the lease that says the landlord may choose to amend the lease at a later date.\n\nWhile that may be in contracts, I don't see that holding up in court. You can't unilaterally amend contracts to add new terms without acceptance on part of the lessee. Any clause in the contract like that will require notification of the lessee of the change and a chance for the lessee to terminate the contract without recourse on part of the lessor. Generally this must be done in the same format as the original lease (written). Most jurisdictions don't allow for a verbal amendment to a written lease.\n\nSo in a way, yes, it is legal for a landlord to require payment via a certain method (like a direct debit from a bank account). They cannot however change the payment terms unilaterally without notification and acceptance. They can use language such as sending the notification (via registered mail) and then saying that a failure to respond is acceptance (because you are, by actions, accepting the terms by continuing to live there).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Ohio, a landlord attempts to amend an existing lease to require rent payments only through a landlord-issued debit card.

While landlords can potentially change payment methods, they cannot do so unilaterally without proper notification and tenant consent. The landlord must inform tenants of the proposed change and give them a chance to either accept the new terms or terminate the lease without penalty. This ensures that tenants have a say in significant changes to their lease agreement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even if a lease includes a clause allowing future amendments, the landlord cannot unilaterally impose significant changes without tenant agreement.\n\nOption B is false because convenience for the landlord does not override the need for proper notification and tenant consent for lease changes.\n\nOption D is overly broad and incorrect.

The government can reasonably restrict such expressions to some extent, thus violent riots can be prohibited, and permanent vandalism with spray paint can be banned. Chalk can even be banned. Any bans must, however, be viewpoint\\-neutral.\n\nGovernment protection of public expressions must also be viewpoint\\-neutral, therefore the police cannot elect to de\\-police just one side of an issue (based on viewpoint, as opposed to different conduct of participants). Therefore they must protect protesters coming from one side of an issue from vigilantes from the other side, or protect neither side \u2013 the government cannot favor a particular viewpoint in law enforcement.\n\nChalk is a commonly used expressive medium, and municipalities have massive discretion to ignore it and wait for the next rain to clean it up, or else they may actively intervene to stop and remove such expressions \u2013 in a viewpoint neutral fashion. Furthermore, a municipality may rightfully tolerate voluntary civilian clean\\-up in the aftermath of a political outburst.\n\nThe (remote) possibility exists that the municipality is not viewpoint\\-neutral in protecting public expressions \u2013 preventing vigilante cleanups by one side while encouraging vigilante cleanups by the other side, and that would violate the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not require individuals to be viewpoint\\-neutral, only governments.\n\nYou might imagine that the drawer could file a lawsuit for damages. A possible scenario would be if the municipality set up a controlled and protected space for artistic expressions, somebody \u2013 with permission to create the work \u2013 labors over an elaborate display, and a vandal trashes it. The vandal could be sued. The difference between that and the above scenario is that you have warring ideologies, one involving the application of chalk without permission and the other involving the removal of chalk without permission.

While the government cannot favor one political viewpoint over another in allowing or removing public expressions, individuals are not bound by the same restrictions.

The vulnerability is further irresponsible because it leaves people's private data being transferred over the school network (such as private e\\-mail, logins) unsecured and open to packet sniffing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is more than a comment (too long), but not a definitive answer (since I am unfamiliar with the laws regarding this kind of thing). Please forgive me.\n\nFirst, there are some technical misunderstandings. They are not disabling SSL/TLS. Instead, they are inserting themselves in between these connections so they can make sure you aren't accessing material you are not allowed to access. They may actually be required to do this by law.\n\nHere is how it works. Typically when you connect to, say Google.com, you are given a certificate from Google.com that has a trusted chain all the way up to some trusted root. That trusted root is explicitly trusted by your web browser manufacturer. In order to be able to inspect these sorts of connections, security appliances will actually replace the certificate provided by Google.com with one that the appliance provides. It has to pretend to be Google.com so your browser doesn't freak out. The problem is, this certificate is no longer has a trusted chain to something that the browser manufacturer trusts. It is provided by the security appliance. So often, the appliance will have a root certificate that the administrators of the system must install on every machine they control. Then the browsers on these machines will not complain that the certificate is invalid.\n\nObviously, you are getting the error on your own machine because you have not allowed the administrator to install these certificates on your machine. Nor should you. **You should definitely not allow your school's network administrator to install these certificates on your personal computer.**\n\nYou say that \"leaves people's private data being transferred over the school network (such as private e\\-mail, logins) unsecured and open to packet sniffing\". This is not true. Any HTTPS website you visit is encrypted between your computer and the security monitoring appliance using the pretend certificate I mentioned above. Typically then, the traffic is decrypted and inspected by the appliance. Then it is re\\-encrypted using the real certificate, before being pushed out onto the internet. So, only at the security appliance is data turned back into the clear, only to be protected again before going out to the internet.\n\nSo, is this illegal?\n\nWell, I think you would agree that definitely on the computers that your school owns, they can do anything they want with them. The computers belong to them. Furthermore, the network belongs to them.

Voluntary communication from the dealership has been non\\-existent, and responses to my inquiries have been intermittent and lackluster at best. As of now, the dealership's claim to the status of the parts is that they were received (after roughly three months), assembled, and painted the wrong color by a third\\-party paint shop due to a \"transposed paint code.\" I was told by the parts manager that they would be ordering new parts, ensuring they would be painted the correct color the second time around.

Only a tiny share of modern pardons are granted to people who are currently serving sentences for the crimes of which they were convicted or to people who have not yet been convicted of crimes.\n\nMy understanding is that a pardon only effects that you no longer must bear the consequences of a conviction, it does not remove the conviction. Thus I want to ask for clarification on the part where it states that pardoned individuals \"*apply for a job not available to felons, or vote, or get a hunting license and use a firearm*\". I figure the three options are either:\n\n1. I am not entirely correct about what a pardon by the President does.\n2. The prohibitions on felons to applying for jobs not available to felons, voting, get a hunting license and using a firearm are part of the pardon\n3. The statement is not correct.\n\nWhat are the actual legal effects of pardons issued by the President of the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on your location. A felony conviction can limit your rights in various ways, and those rights may or may not be restored at the state level. See [this article](http://alanellis.com/federal-felony-conviction-collateral-civil-disabilities/) for discussion of federal convictions and collateral civil disabilities. The [Dept. of Justics says](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions) that \"a presidential pardon will restore various rights lost as a result of the pardoned offense and should lessen to some extent the stigma arising from a conviction, it will not erase or expunge the record of your conviction\", and \"most civil disabilities attendant upon a federal felony conviction, such as loss of the right to vote and hold state public office, are imposed by state rather than federal law, and also may be removed by state action\".\n\n[This article](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/pr/195110.pdf) surveys civil disabilities of convicts on a state by state basis, as well as at the federal level. For example, voting rights are set at the state level, so a state has to have statutes restoring rights upon a pardon if you are to get your voting rights back. Service on a federal jury would be restored per [28 USC 1865(b)(5\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1865); the federal felon in possession crime has [an exception encoded in it](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921) in the definition of \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" which says\n\n> What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in\n>  accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings\n>  were held.\n>  Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a\n>  person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be\n>  considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such\n>  pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides\n>  that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\n\nSo if you are a state felon, you need a state pardon (or other state procedure) and if you are a federal felon, a state pardon does no good, you need a federal pardon. However, [21 USC 862](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/862) makes mandatory the ineligibility for federal benefits after a third conviction for drug trafficking (either state of federal law), and there is no \"rights restoration\" clause that restores such rights after a pardon even if the convictions are all federal. I have not located any case law establishing whether federal benefits rights restoration for federal convictions flows automatically from a federal pardon (not many 3\\-time drug dealers get federal pardons). A federal felony conviction can also be used as a factor in granting a security clearance (applicable to certain jobs), and current law does not say that a pardoned conviction *cannot* be considered in deciding on a clearance.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John, a federal felon convicted of drug trafficking three times, receives a presidential pardon.

While it would restore some federal rights, such as the ability to serve on a federal jury (per 28 USC 1865(b)(5)), it does not guarantee the restoration of all rights. Notably, under 21 USC 862, ineligibility for federal benefits after a third conviction for drug trafficking is mandatory, and there is no clear provision for rights restoration in this case, even with a pardon. State-imposed restrictions may still apply, as many civil disabilities are determined by state law. The pardon also does not expunge the record, so it may still appear in background checks.

As his solicitor put it:\n\n> \"Based on previous experience in other cases, laser speed detection devices can produce erroneous results and in this case Mr Herron was convinced he was not speeding as alleged and stated he had telematics data to support that view. When confronted with failings in court the prosecution determined to offer no evidence.\"\n\nThis doesn't really set a legal precedent that \"GPS beats Laser speed gun\" though \\- because the CPS chose not to present evidence.\n\nAs others have commented though there's quite a few potential pitfalls with doing this \\- GPS data carries a certain level of uncertainty, it's pretty accurate these days, to quote GPS.gov:\n\n> GPS\\-enabled smartphones are typically accurate to within a 4\\.9 m (16 ft.) radius under open sky.

In Canada, spouses typically own property through tenancy by the entirety, which would automatically transfer full ownership to the surviving spouse upon death, bypassing the will. To ensure that the wife's share goes to her son as per her wishes, the couple needs to hold the property as tenants in common. This way, the wife's share becomes part of her estate and can be distributed according to her will. Option A is incorrect because the will alone may not be effective if the property is held in tenancy by the entirety. Option C is false; Canadian law does not prohibit such arrangements.

Thus reasonable searches and seizures, especially those authorized by a warrant, are constitutional.\n\nFurthermore, even in light of a constitutional right of privacy derived from this statue, depending on how the \"search history\" is compiled, the 4th Amendment might not even apply, due to the *Katz* doctrine, also known as the \"open fields\" doctrine. Basically, the 4th amendment (as far as searches goes) does not apply to things that are publicly observable; while this would protect a literal \"search history\" compilation (baring a reasonable search), the searches themselves are public queries, broadcasted over the internet.

There is no explicit, absolute right to privacy in the Constitution. The 4th Amendment, which comes closest to addressing privacy, allows for reasonable searches and those authorized by warrants. Additionally, the \"open fields\" doctrine (derived from the Katz case) suggests that information openly broadcast over the internet, like search queries, may not be protected by the 4th Amendment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no explicit constitutional right to privacy.\n\nOption B is partially true but overly restrictive.

It is more than likely that if you refuse to answer the questions of customs officials in ANY country, you will be denied admittance. The same is true if you refuse or balk at being searched (personally or your possessions), and keep in mind that this is without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The best thing to do is to answer the questions honestly and accurately, but also as narrowly as possible to completely answer. Trying to argue with them will only send up red flags and you will be there longer. Remember it is a privilege, not a right, to enter a sovereign nation of which you are not a citizen.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., customs reserves the right to detain for questioning, search you, your car, your children, your bags, packages, purse/wallet, or any other travel item with full legal authority to do sol they can even examine your electronics (content and hardware). You place your stuff on the exam station and open it. (After the exam is completed, you will be asked to repack and close the baggage.) If you are unhappy with the way you are being treated, you do have the right to ask to speak to a CBP supervisor, but I cannot see anything good coming of it, unless they were super rude without provocation or broke something of value.\n\nThe authority to delay and speak with travelers derives from the United States Code (section citations below) enables CBP to prevent the entry of persons who are inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and to prevent the smuggling of merchandise, including narcotics and other contraband items, into the United States.\n\nSpeaking with travelers and examining merchandise coming into or leaving the United States is just one of the mechanisms used to identify illegal or prohibited items, and to determine whether or not someone is trying to enter the U.S. for unlawful or fraudulent purposes. Unless exempt by diplomatic status, all travelers entering the United States, including U.S. citizens, are subjected to routine Customs examinations. At times, people make the mistake of thinking their civil rights are being violated by being asked questions about their trip, personal background and history, etc. That is not the case.

The term \"medical status\" is not precisely defined in HIPAA regulations, but it generally refers to a patient's current condition and relevant medical history, not just current treatments (ruling out D). The key points are that the disclosure must be relevant to the specific situation and that more detailed information should accompany such authorization forms to explain the circumstances under which information might be shared with government agencies.
