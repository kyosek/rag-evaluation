Here the prosecutor think that Ahok is guilty of one verse in KUHP and recommend a probation. However, the judge declares that Ahok is guilty anyway.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Indonesia Law uses Civil Law structures which use an Inquisitorial Trial. The chief difference is that in the United States (which has a Common Law Structure) the judge usually does not decide the case, but interprets the law (Trier of Law) and with a few exceptions, will determine the sentence once guilt is found. The Jury decides the case (Trier of Fact) and pronounces guilt (It is the right of the defense to request a Bench Trial, which gives the Judge both roles. The prosecution cannot object to this request).\n\nIn a Civil Court, the big difference is that their is no Jury and the Judge has both roles (Trier of Law, and Trier of Fact). As the name suggests, rather than two sides fighting each other (adversarial), the two sides are answering questions posed to them by the Judge or usually a panel of Judges are used and the Judge may initiate further investigation in the evidence.\n\nThe United States does use Inquisitional Trials from time to time, but they are often seen in misdemeanors, traffic courts, and small claims courts. The latter is a popular daytime TV genre (think Judge Judy) while misdemeanors and traffic court decisions are often time funny and make great Youtube videos. There are not many great Adversarial media as many throw out rules for time sake (real U.S. trials have many long boring periods during testimony) and story/drama sake.

To what extent to they substitute for a signature?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally in the U.S., states have laws that require some contracts to be signed by a party in order to enforce the contract against the party. These requirements are generally set out in a law commonly known as the Statute of Frauds. *See* the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_frauds).

A failure to return the object for 1000 days means the entire amount due is payable, in addition to the fee for replacement.

The crux of the procedural dance is their receipt of official notices and counter notices, and their responses. The trigger is a sworn statement by the copyright holder: in the scenario that you describe, there is no such take\\-down notice. A take\\-down notice is directed at a specific infringement (delivered to Youtube), and the required remedy is that the content host must remove the copied material. This was done in the particular case, so there is no further issue.\n\nThe copyright owner would have to separately serve notice on MeTube or FreeTube for distributing the same work. SE or similar platform is not even close to the liability ballpark until it gets served with notice. YouTube, on the other hand, could be liable if they restored the content after taking it down (this is covered via the counter\\-claim and put\\-back provisions). The copyright owner's whack\\-a\\-mole department has to dilligently find all of those infringers.\n\n\"Infringing\" boils down to copying, not to \"referring to\", and in the cases you are asking about, there is no copying of the content \u2013 there is a reference (link) to allegedly infringing material. The case [Intellectual Reserve, Inc. v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry, Inc.](https://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/cjoyce/copyright/release10/intres.html), 75 F. Supp. 2d 1290 gives indications of what actions *other than* actual copying might be deemed \"contributory infringement\". The court points out that browsing anything requires copying \u2013 \"in making a copy, even a temporary one, the person who browsed infringes the copyright\" \u2013\nalthough if the person browsing \"was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages\". So yes, there is always potential for end\\-users to be sued for infringement, and usually an escape hatch for innocent infringers.\n\nThe other question raised in this case, about the platform's liabilities, is somewhat mooted by the apparent age of the would\\-be infringement which sees to predate DMCA. But the case does include an element of infringement\\-by\\-link, and the court found in that instance that \"defendants have actively encouraged the infringement of plaintiff's copyright\", citing various facts where the host overtly directed users to infringing sites, for example \"Please mirror these files . . . . It will be a LOT quicker for you to download the compressed version . . . Needless to say, we need a LOT of mirror sites, as absolutely soon as possible\". This is markedly different from what happens on SE. Inline linking is generally considered safe (the burden of stopping copyright infringement is on the actual host).

Companies which do not trade are known as dormant companies and are defined at [Section 1169 of the Companies Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1169). It is perfectly legitimate to create and own a dormant company for as long as you wish, so long as you comply with annual filing requirements. That includes the duty to [file an annual confirmation statement](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/853A) and to [file annual (dormant) accounts](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/441).\n\n> I also found Ownr which let's me pay CAD $49 (one time fee) to\n> register a sole proprietorship\n\nA sole proprietorship is not a company; it's merely you as an individual operating as a business.

Do I need to worry about filing taxes even if I don't\n> get any revenue/expenses as I won't really be doing any business\n> activities?\n\nYes, there is a pitfall. The parties to the contract will be the service provider, and your company. Therefore your premise that there are no \"*revenue / expenses as I won't really be doing any business activities*\" is wrong. It will be the company purchasing the services and then reselling them (or gifting them) to you. Accordingly, your company will no longer be dormant and will be subject to the usual accounting and tax rules that apply to trading companies.\n\nThere are ways around this; for example the company can act as your agent for the purposes of entering into the contract and, provided that you pay for the services from your personal funds, the company may still be able to remain dormant. You would probably also need to inform the service provider of the agency arrangement as undisclosed principals can result in a deemed contract between the service provider and the agent.

This is true regardless of whether the defendant has requested an appeal or can afford to pay for it. The inability to pay for an appeal does not prevent legal consequences for the original offense.

A cheaper inheritance process when there is wide confidence debts are low compared to goods and rights? A way for creditors to mate with notaries in order to trick naive inheritors not using inventory benefit? Both?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a tradeoff between the delay and administrative costs associated with the Spanish equivalent of a probate proceeding, and the limitation of liability for the debts of a decedent that the proceeding can provide.\n\nIf you take the assets \"pure and simple\" you have to assume all of the decedent's debts with them, even if it might turn out that those debts exceed the value of the assets that you inherited. This is much cheaper and faster.\n\nBut, if you do not, and insist on an inventory and formal administration, if the estate is insolvent (i.e. if it is not able to pay all of the decedent's debts with the proceeds of the decedent's assets), then the worst case scenario for the heir is that you get no inheritance and the creditors of the decedent don't get paid to the extent that the decedent's assets aren't sufficient to pay them in full.\n\nIf you know that the estate is insolvent, or if the insolvency is a close thing or the insolvency is hard to evaluate because the debts of the decedent are unliquidated (e.g. a potential lawsuit for a personal injury the decedent caused) or complex (e.g. for a decedent with complex business deals), you would not want to take \"pure and simple\" and risk being exposed to those debts unless you felt a personal moral obligation to pay those creditors from your own funds anyway.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Juan's wealthy uncle has passed away, leaving behind a complex estate with numerous assets and potential liabilities.

By accepting the inheritance with benefit of inventory (a beneficio de inventario), Juan can protect himself from potential unknown debts that may exceed the value of the inherited assets. This approach allows him to:\n\n1. Limit his liability to the value of the inherited assets\n2. Preserve his rights and actions against the estate\n3.

The university has an obligation to ensure that all participants in pre-hiring interviews, including students, know what kinds of questions are legal versus illegal.

The practice of selling franchises only to members of a particular religious group is not prohibited by federal law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, the primary federal non-discrimination law applicable to franchise contracts, does not cover discrimination based on religion. As stated in the information provided, \"discrimination on the basis of religion in franchising contracts is not prohibited by federal law.\"\n\nHowever, the legality of this practice can vary at the state level.

This says that statehood doesn't depend on recognition by other states; it merely requires four things:\n\n* A defined territory\n* A permanent population\n* An effective government\n* The capacity to enter into relations with other states.\n\nYou immediately run into issues around the defined territory (you don't really have one) and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. But let's ignore those for a second. Meeting these requirements in some abstract world doesn't mean you get *treated* like a state. If no one else agrees with your claim to statehood and they act inconsistently with it, you have little recourse. You might get them not caring enough to do anything about it, but if they decide you're not a country you're out of luck.\n\nYou have some misconceptions about statehood as well. A country is allowed to forbid trade with any foreign country, even ones it recognizes as sovereign states. See: US embargo on Cuba. It is also entitled to deny foreign ships access to its ports. Ships flying the flag of a sovereign state are entitled to innocent passage through territorial waters of another state, but not to the use of that state's ports.\n\nA country can certainly allow people to be killed and still be a country. See: the US, which has the death penalty for certain crimes. But if you're killing nationals of a foreign country, that foreign country is likely to take a keen interest in your activities. If the killings are judicially\\-ordered executions based on violations of your penal laws, that's one thing \\-\\- Australia might consider it awful that an Australian citizen was shot by Indonesia for drug smuggling, but they recognize that Indonesia is a real country with its own laws that it has a right to apply. If it's just lawless there, the keen interest might culminate in a travel warning.

While the Montevideo Convention outlines four basic criteria for statehood (defined territory, permanent population, effective government, and capacity to enter relations with other states), meeting these criteria alone does not guarantee recognition or treatment as a sovereign state by the international community. The answer highlights that practical challenges in gaining recognition and establishing relations would likely persist, even if theoretical criteria are met.\n\nOption A is incorrect because meeting the Montevideo Convention criteria does not automatically result in universal recognition.\n\nOption B is inaccurate because registration with the UN is not a prerequisite for statehood or recognition.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even recognized sovereign states can face trade restrictions or embargoes from other nations, and unrecognized states would face even greater challenges in establishing unrestricted commerce."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70819/does-the-u-s-constitution-place-any-limitations-on-how-long-a-u-s-president-ca", "docs_id": 70819, "title": "Does the U.S. Constitution place any limitations on how long a U.S. President can be on vacation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am curious to know if the U.S. Constitution places any limitations on how long a U.S. President can be on vacation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not directly\n------------\n\nHowever, a President who is unable to discharge their duties (by being on vacation or otherwise) can be dealt with by either:\n\n* the vice\\-President and Cabinet invoking the 25th amendment and declaring the President unable to perform their duties,\n* by the House impeaching the President for the \u201chigh crime and misdemeanour\u201d of not doing her job.

One of the fundamental requirements for registering a trademark is originality. In this case, the logo is based on an existing open-source design with only slight modifications. The fact that it was already in use by others (as evidenced by the T-shirt seller in Colombia) further demonstrates its lack of originality.

What matters is when it was *delivered*. The rebuttable presumption is that the notice is effective when it would have been \"delivered in the ordinary course of post\" (e.g. next day for first class, etc.). To rebut that, the burden of proof shifts to the recipient, who must prove (on balance of probabilities in a civil case) that it was delivered late or not at all. In practice that will be extremely difficult in the majority of cases.\n\nYou might try to make an argument that \"letter containing the document\" implies an envelope. However, in my view, the ordinary meaning of the word letter means a piece of paper with some written words on it. A letter is still a letter even when it isn't inserted in an envelope. \"Contains the document\" suggests to me that the document is found within the words written on the piece of paper.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nThe phrase \"unless the contrary intention appears\" means that if a particular Act contains its own rules of service which contradict Section 7, then Section 7 will be overridden.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Interpretation Act 1978 in England and Wales, which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal service of documents by post?\n\nA) Service is only deemed effective if the document is sealed in an envelope to ensure privacy.\n\nB) The recipient can easily contest service by claiming they didn't bother to open the mail.\n\nC) Service is presumed effective at the time the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, unless the contrary is proved.\n\nD) Posting a document as a postcard automatically invalidates the service attempt.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978, service is deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre-paying, and posting a letter containing the document. It is presumed to have been effected at the time the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, unless the contrary is proved. This creates a rebuttable presumption of effective service based on normal delivery times.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Act doesn't specify that documents must be sealed in envelopes. Option B is wrong because the recipient's choice not to open mail doesn't affect the legal presumption of service. Option D is incorrect as the Act doesn't invalidate service for documents sent as postcards - what matters is proper addressing, pre-payment, and posting.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the key principle of presumed delivery timing and the burden of proof shifting to the recipient to prove otherwise, making it the most accurate statement based on the provided information."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17753/can-former-president-obama-sue-president-trump-for-defamation", "docs_id": 17753, "title": "Can former President Obama sue President Trump for defamation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: President Trump has made assertions that former President Obama \"wire tapped\" him and Trump has claimed that he has evidence of this.

To the contrary, it has adopted General Recommendations that clarify that the protections apply to particular groups of people without stating which of the listed categories they are best captured by. See [this Introductory Note](https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cerd/cerd.html):\n\n> CERD has adopted General Recommendations to clarify that the ICERD protections in article 1 include groups not explicitly named but who fall within the Convention\u2019s broad criteria, such as women (G.R. 25\\), indigenous persons (G.R. 23\\), the Roma (G.R. 27\\), Dalits (G.R. 29\\), non\\-citizens including refugees (G.R. 30\\), African descendants, particularly those in the diaspora (G.R. 34\\), Muslims subjected to Islamophobia, and more generally persons whose religious identity has been \u201cracialized,\u201d that is used as a basis for discrimination (G.R. 32\\).\n\nIn fact, the use of the term \"race\" was and is a contested aspect of the convention, as revealed through the [*travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travaux_pr%C3%A9paratoires) (Patrick Thornberry, *The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\nDiscrimination: A Commentary*, Oxford University Press, 2016\\).

Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for\n>  tax evasion in 1930\\. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after\n>  being convicted in a two\\-week trial over which Wilkerson presided.\n>  Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially,\n>  during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer\n>  stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various\n>  years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance.\n>  Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a\n>  letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable\n>  income for certain years. On March 13, 1931, Capone was charged with\n>  income tax evasion for 1924, in a secret grand jury. On June 5, 1931,\n>  Capone was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 counts of income tax\n>  evasion from 1925 through 1929; he was released on $50,000 bail. A\n>  week later, Eliot Ness and his team of Untouchables inflicted major\n>  financial damage on Capone's operations and led to his indictment on\n>  5,000 violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition laws).\n> \n> \n> On June 16, 1931, at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of\n>  Judge James Herbert Wilkerson, Capone plead guilty to income tax\n>  evasion and the 5,000 Volstead Act violations as part of a \u200b2 1\u20442\\-year\n>  prison sentence plea bargain. However, on July 30, 1931, Judge\n>  Wilkerson refused to honor the plea bargain, and Capone's counsel\n>  rescinded the guilty pleas. On the second day of the trial, Judge\n>  Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his\n>  client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so\n>  at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal\n>  authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for\n>  Capone.

The defendant will be Trump. Is it Trump's constitutional right to demand fairness or the right of those who want to prosecute him?\n\nIn short, you should be awarded fairness when you are defending yourself or when you are prosecuting someone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Due Process is for defendants:** \n\nThe \"fairness\" provisions in Amendments 4\\-8 do not \"typically\" apply to defendants. They *explicitly* apply *only* to defendants. For instance, the 5th Amendment says: \n\n> No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...\n\nThe basic idea is that the public is best served by having a fair, impartial trials under law. As Paul Johnson notes in his excellent comment, the general presumption is that the state has much more power than defendants, and hence is more likely to pervert justice for its benefit. The \"fairness\" provisions aim to reduce the power imbalance by requiring the state to follow certain procedures, such as getting warrants, and so on. \n\n**Fairness and prosecutors**\n\nIt is bad when either side perverts justice. That is why even prosecutors have some ability to challenge trial procedures that seem biased in favor of defendants. Thus, prosecutors cannot generally ask for a change of venue, but they can object to particular jurors. The idea, again, is that given its resources, allowing the state to move a trial would hurt defendants. \n\nAs Paul Johnson notes, the analogy of impeachment to regular trials breaks down at this point. The Constitution imposes only a few bare\\-bones requirements on the impeachment process. This lack of structure, when combined with the Constitutional provision that each House can make its own rules, [makes it easier](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46730/in-the-trump-impeachment-process-what-is-the-legal-status-of-notes/46731#46731) for House and Senate to do things that would not be allowed in regular trials, such as delay bringing charges (which would violate the \"[speedy trial](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment)\" clause), or seat admittedly \"[not\\-fair](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lindsey-graham-not-trying-to-pretend-to-be-a-fair-juror-here/2019/12/14/dcaad02c-1ea8-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html)\" jurors. \n\n**What is fair?**\n\nThe obvious response to charges that the process is \"unfair,\" is to ask, \"Unfair by what standard?\" After, all the rules of impeachment are what they are. It is hard to see how using these rules to one's advantage is unfair. \n\nIt is important to remember, that as in regular trials, both sides are busy trying to put their spin on what is going on. If either side believes they will get more support by talking about \"basic fairness,\" that is how they will talk. But this spin should not hide the reality that the impeachment rules are what they are. As with any rules, whether some tricky manuever within the rules is fair depends on whose ox is being gored.

Or am I missing something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For a large organization, software licensing compliance is a very broad and intractable problem. The licensing environment is very different for the big company than it is for little tiny you. Many large companies are subject to audits by software vendors (i.e. Adobe, Oracle, etc.) in which they have to show licenses purchased for each active seat. There's a whole new INDUSTRY around maintaining license compliance. An employee bringing in their own software and installing it on a company computer complicates this vastly.\n\nThat is the environment that the question should be considered within. The large company makes the decision somewhere along the way that your individual efficiency in performing your individual tasks is less important than maintaining auditable software licensing compliance. Since they own the computer/laptop/server, it's their decision.\n\nMany times it seems that corporate policies as they apply to the individual worker are obstructive and limiting, but there's a bigger picture to the situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A large company prohibits an employee from using their personally-licensed software on company computers, even though the software could improve the employee's productivity.

Large organizations often face complex software licensing compliance issues and may be subject to audits by software vendors. Allowing employees to use their own licensed software on company computers can significantly complicate license management and auditing processes. While options A, B, and D might seem plausible, the documentation specifically highlights the challenges of maintaining \"auditable software licensing compliance\" as the primary concern for large companies in this scenario.

That's not allowed in Germany. Further, a clause that gives custody to the father by default is **also** Sittenwidrig in Germany, and thus void under [\u00a7138 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__138.html). So would be a clause that gives it to the mother by default by the way.\n\nIn a case of controversy, only a court order can assign guardianship. And only the court can take guardianship away. When the kid is born its guardianship gets assigned to the parents as guardians by [\u00a71626 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626.html). While it is possible to give your partner guardianship if you're not married under [1626a BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626a.html) it is **explicitly** impossible to assign guardianship for **any** compensation to either party (e.g. the mother or the new guardian may not receive anything other than the guardianship in the specific paper) under [1626b BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626b.html). Thus a contract that does anything else in addition to guardianship, like a prenup, voids at least the guardianship clauses. And you have to tell the court about that assignment of guardianship under ([$1626d BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626d.html)). Now comes the kicker: [\u00a71628 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1628.html) forces the parents to apply to the court to solve any problems of huge impact, such as guardianship: So technically, mediation results are fully non\\-binding and you can not mandate it.\n\nAlso, since all marriages are through the state, it needs a formal instrument of the state to be dissolved. The only three ways that the state ever allowed this to be done after WW2 were a) annulment through a court, which only was possible till 1998, or b) divorce through a court, c) death of one of the marriage partners. Yes, it takes a judge to divorce a marriage under [$1313 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1313.html) or one of the two married to die.\n\nBecause you can't divorce without a filing in court, a clause that demands to divorce in some way that is *not* including \u00a71313 BGB, that clause would be void.

In any way, it is just against the US as the state, not any person.\n\n[Price Gouging](https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/price-gouging-state-statutes.aspx)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn many state laws, Price Gouging is fixed in some way or another. Price Gouging is the term of art used for the act to \"take advantage of spikes in demand by charging exorbitant prices for necessities\". The term does not apply to normal increases of prices due to shifting economies or dissimilar prices for products. Commonly, many are also restricted to emergency situations such as natural disasters, war, or even [covid\\-19](/questions/tagged/covid-19 \"show questions tagged 'covid-19'\").\n\nGenerally, these laws punish people who increase prices in an unreasonable manner but they also don't prescribe what reasonable is.\n\nAn example of Price Gouging is the salesman, who knowing a hurricane will hit Florida, buys up all generators in Detroit that cost below 2000 USD and gets a truck there to sell them the moment it has passed. Now he sells each generator for 20000 USD, while the normal market price outside of the hit area is just a 10th of that. In addition, have him sell 5\\-gallon cans of fuel for 500 USD. Both items \\- equipment to make electricity to fix the homes and fuel \\- are under [Fla. Stat. \u00a7501\\.160](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0500-0599/0501/Sections/0501.160.html) 1(a) and the prices are clearly matching 1(b). So our Detroid salesman in Florida is violating the law on Price Gouging.\n\n### Non\\-emergency laws?\n\nOnly very few laws are not concerned with an emergency situation and thus more broad and general. The most likely broadest of them is [Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7445\\.903](https://law.justia.com/codes/michigan/2006/mcl-chap445/mcl-445-903.html) (z). It reads:\n\n> Charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\n\nHere, grossly in excess is the requirement, but also the similarity of the products. So, it does not take dissimilar products into account, especially not if the two items cost you very dissimilar to acquire them.\n\nTo take a less emergency example, let's say we have a shop. We sell two types of toilet paper: one is 1\\-ply and costs 10 cents a roll. The other is imported german, extra soft 4\\-ply with Aloe\\-Vera and vanilla smell and we demand 5 USD per roll. The price difference is harsh (50 times!) but the two products are not similar, and we can prove that the import paper did cost us something like 4 USD to get to our shop in the first place. Now, one day we just put the 5 USD label from our import paper onto the cheap one for whatever reason. Only now we grossly overprice our cheap toilet paper and violate that provision: we charge 50 times what the item's fair price is.\n\n#### [When goods don't *appear* dissimilar but are](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84656/alices-restaurant-profiteering-from-those-with-allergies)\n\nA baker might make a pie for 50 USD in basic fixed costs (tools, wages, electricity) to run the shop, and 25 cents per pie in ingredients if he bakes 100 of them. That's 75 USD for 100 pies in costs, or 75 cents a pie. He wants to sell them at 1 USD a piece, that's a 1/3rd markup and a somewhat normal price.\n\nThe same baker can also bake gluten\\-free pies. The ingredients cost him 50 cents a pie and the same basic fixed costs to make a batch. But he also has to clean the shop top to bottom for 3 hours before to get any gluten flour out of it, costing him another 100 USD in wages. He also only has a demand for 10 pies, so those pies cost him 160 USD per batch or 16 USD per pie. To make a profit, he sells them at 21,33 USD, which is again a 1/3rd markup. At first glance, a gluten\\-free pie might appear a *very* similar product, but it isn't even similar under the Michigan law, because manufacturing costs are disproportional higher for the market. Even *if* he could sell 100 pies and then made a 100 pie batch, he'd still pay 200 USD for 100 pies, and the *fair price* for a single pie from a 100\\-item batch would be 2,66 USD. But from the 10\\-item batch, it's 21,33 USD.\n\nBecause the two pies are so dissimilar in manufacturing prices, they can not be used as \"similar\" under Michigan law.

Discuss using the examples above?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ticker symbols are too short to be protected by copyright (and the copyright would in any case belong to the exchange and not the company, since the exchange creates them). It is also not functional, so it could not have a utility patent, and is not secret, so it could not be a trade secret.\n\nSo far as I know, none of the ticket symbols are registered as trademarks under the Lanham Act (the federal trademark law in the United State). But, a company could argue that it acquired a common law trademark in its ticker symbol if it used the ticker symbol in association with the sale of goods or services.\n\nEven if it was a trademark, however, this would not prevent it from being used in the usual way that ticker symbols are used, as a nominative use identifying a company with an abbreviation of its legal name or of a trade name, rather than in a manner that conveys the impression that one is authorized to sell goods and services under the name of the company.\n\nIn the example posed, I don't think that you could determine whether there was an infringement of common law trademark rights in a vacuum.\n\nFirst, it would be necessary to determine if a particular ticker symbol had acquired a secondary meaning (i.e. an association with the company) in the relevant part of the general public. For example, \"A\" without some context identifying it as the ticker symbol for Agilent Technology, would obviously not be entitled to common law trademark protection.\n\nSecond, it would be necessary to examine the manner in which the ticker symbol was used.\n\nThe gravamen and gist of trademark infringement is that one misleads someone to think that you have an affiliation with a company in connection with a use of that trademark in commerce. If one is doing that, I could see a common law trademark infringement case prevailing.\n\nFor example, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and was selling goods competing with those produced by \"Americansource Bergen Corp\" to people who would otherwise have brought Americansource Bergen Corp's goods, I could easily see a common law trademark infringement action prevailing with the domain name suggesting that you were a licensed affiliate of Americansource Bergen Corp who was marketing its goods, rather than the company itself.\n\nOn the other hand, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and you were a neighbor or former employee of Americansource Bergen Corp or a family member of an employee or a customer, then there would be no basis for a common law trademark infringement action.\n\nAnd, there are some cases, such as the \"whathappened.EFX@xyz.com\" email for Equifax which on its face could almost never be construed as an attempt to mislead someone into thinking that you were authorized to sell goods or serves of Equifax.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is no such thing as a \"facial\" trademark infringement except perhaps when a trademark is placed directly on a good not manufactured or licensed by the trademark owner.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation?\n\nA) Apple has a clear-cut case of trademark infringement because they own the rights to their ticker symbol AAPL.\n\nB) The blogger is completely protected by free speech and can use any ticker symbol in any context without legal repercussions.\n\nC) The legality depends on whether the blog gives the impression of being affiliated with or endorsed by Apple, not solely on the use of the ticker symbol.\n\nD) Ticker symbols are too short to be protected by any form of intellectual property law, so their use is always permissible.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legality of using a ticker symbol in an email address or other context depends on whether it creates confusion about affiliation or endorsement, not just on the use of the symbol itself. Ticker symbols are not automatically protected as trademarks, but companies may argue for common law trademark protection if the symbol has acquired a secondary meaning associated with the company. The key issue is whether the use misleads people into thinking there's an official affiliation. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because owning a ticker symbol doesn't automatically grant trademark rights. \n\nAnswer B is overly broad; while there are free speech protections, they don't cover misleading commercial speech. \n\nAnswer D is partially true about the length of ticker symbols, but oversimplifies the legal landscape by ignoring potential common law trademark claims."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56807/why-is-my-gdpr-a-17-request-not-fulfilled", "docs_id": 56807, "title": "Why is my GDPR (a.17) request not fulfilled?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For over a year, I'm trying to get \"wordpress.org\" to delete my personal data from their [bugtracker](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/) (the pseudonym is linked to my full personal address).\n\nAccording to <https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/> The website states GDPR compliancy and appropriate rights are theoretically granted.

Patients are free to take whatever medicines they want if they can find them, and if they are not on the Controlled Substances list. Hence it's legal to take DMSO, but it's not legal to peddle it as a cancer cure.\n\nThe prescription regime for covid vaccinations seems to be somewhat relaxed, in that it is likely that many people get a vaccine without a (meaningful) doctor's exam, instead, you show up and get the shot.

The FDA, not the CDC, is responsible for authorizing vaccine distribution in the United States. Off-label use of approved medicines, including vaccines, is generally legal. The FDA provides guidelines for off-label use, which allows medical professionals to use approved drugs in ways not specifically authorized, as long as it's within their professional judgment. Patients are generally free to take medicines they can obtain, except for controlled substances. Option A is incorrect because the CDC doesn't authorize shots.

This is represented by option B.\n\nThe answer mentions that these are the only known legal options. Option C (subscribing to a streaming service) is not mentioned as a legal way to convert an existing CD collection.

I say this because your incredulity does not seem to extend to the notion that appellate courts can bind lower courts.\n\nYou ask:\n\n> why are prior judges\u2019 powers of interpretations automatically seen to be more capable and robust than, so as to bind and prevail over, subsequent judges\u2019 interpretative abilities?\n\nThis is not the rationale for horizontal *stare decisis*. The doctrine is not at all based on the premise that the first court or judge to answer got it correct. Justification was given in a concurring opinion in *R. v. Kirkpatrick*, [2022 SCC 33](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2022/2022scc33/2022scc33.html):\n\n> Stare decisis promotes: (1\\) legal certainty and stability, allowing people to plan and manage their affairs; (2\\) the rule of law, such that people are subject to similar rules; and (3\\) the legitimate and efficient exercise of judicial authority (citations omitted).\n\nAnd horizontal *stare decisis* is not absolute. Common\\-law jurisdictions have developed limited avenues for departure. For example, in Canada, a lower court can depart from previous decisions of courts of coordinate jurisdiction when (*R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do)):\n\n> 1.

The earlier decision was reached per incuriam (\u201cthrough carelessness\u201d or \u201cby inadvertence\u201d); or\n> 3. The earlier decision was not fully considered, e.g. taken in exigent circumstances.\n\nEven apex courts have developed a sense of internal obligation to follow their own precedents. But departure from previous decisions may be justified where (see the *Kirkpatrick* concurrence [at para. 202](https://canlii.ca/t/jr3vx#par202)):\n\n> 1. The Court rendering the decision failed to have regard to a binding authority or relevant statute (\u201c*per incuriam*\u201d);\n> 2.

The documentation explicitly states that the justification for horizontal stare decisis is not based on the assumption that earlier judges are more capable.

Meaning the entire collection, was of their own idea, and creation.\n\nOutfits were purchased by these four people, and needed some modification, (modifications being some illustrations applied). so under recommendation from a friend an individual (The Designer), offered this service without any discussion or need for payment.\n\nThe Designer was provided with all materials needed to do this, as to not incur any cost to themselves, also given a brief and reference images to use to ensure the end result was as excepted and fitted with the overall collection.\n\nThese outfits (and now modifications), became part of the final 'collection', which is owned by that of the 4 who orchestrated it.\n\n**My question is:**\n\nWhere the work is of the designers hand, but was only created by them after being provided all materials, and a brief with reference images, not of their own ideas. Do they own any rights/copyright to the clothing items?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright\n---------\n\nCopyright subsists in original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, sound recordings, films or broadcasts, and the typographical arrangement of published editions \\[*Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988*, [s1]](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/1). Specifically, fashion is a \"work of artistic craftsmanship\" \\[[s4](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/4)].\n\nThe author (\"the person who creates \\[the work]\" \\[[s9](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/9)]) is the first owner of the copyright \\[[s11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/11)] unless it is made by an employee in the course of their employment which is not the case here.\n\nThe 'designer' is *definitely* an author although it is arguable that the work is actually one of joint authorship [s10](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/10) between the 'designer' and the 'four people'. An alternative is that the 'four people' hold copyright in the \"reference images\" and that the 'designer' holds copyright in the fashion items; I think this is more likely.\n\nHowever, if the information provided to the 'designer' amounted to a design such that the fashion items are merely a 3D realisation of the design with no creative input by the designer then the fashion items are a copy of the design with no independent copyright. From the description, this seems unlikely \\- a design would require a fully detailed pattern such that multiple craftspeople using it would produce essentially the same output.\n\nAs there has been no transfer of copyright, whoever had it originally still has it \\- probably the designer.\n\nThe physical items\n------------------\n\nThese belong to whoever owned them originally \\- a mechanic does not take ownership of your car if they work on it so similarly a dressmaker doesn't take ownership of your clothes.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario of the fashion show collaboration, who likely holds the copyright for the modified clothing items?\n\nA) The four organizers who provided the materials and brief\nB) The designer who made the modifications\nC) Both the organizers and the designer jointly\nD) No one, as the modifications are not copyrightable\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe designer who made the modifications to the clothing items is likely to hold the copyright for the modified designs. This is because:\n\n1. Copyright subsists in original artistic works, which includes works of artistic craftsmanship like fashion items.\n\n2. The author of a work is generally the first owner of the copyright, unless it's created by an employee in the course of employment (which is not the case here).\n\n3. While the organizers provided materials and a brief, the actual creative work of modifying the clothing was done by the designer. This creative input is likely sufficient to establish copyright.\n\n4. The scenario doesn't indicate that there was any agreement to transfer copyright to the organizers.\n\n5. While joint authorship is possible, it seems the designer's role was distinct enough to create a separate copyright in the modifications.\n\n6. Owning the physical items (which the organizers do) is separate from owning the copyright to the designs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because providing materials and a brief doesn't automatically grant copyright. Option C could be considered but is less likely given the distinct roles.

The UDHR is not a penal code (ruling out option A), but many of its principles, especially those related to criminal procedure and basic rights (Articles 3-12), have been incorporated into national constitutions and legal systems. While the UDHR does include positive entitlements and general principles, it also significantly addresses criminal justice issues (contrary to option C).

They can consider factors such as justice, achievability, and worthwhileness when deciding how to respond to lawbreaking. In this case, it was deemed reasonable for the police to conclude that enforcing social distancing laws would be arbitrary and not worthwhile given the circumstances.

In some jurisdictions and in federal court, it arises as a matter of common law case precedents. In other jurisdictions, it is a statutorily created right. But all of them would agree that it includes all confidential communications in the course of the professional relationship. Most of the variation pertains to the extent of the crime\\-fraud exception (not applicable here).\n\nAttorneys are expressly authorized by the rules of professional conduct to offer advice to their clients in the course of their professional relationship with a client that extends beyond advice that is strictly legal. [Rule of Professional Conduct 2\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_1_advisor/) (which has been adopted verbatim in almost every U.S. state) says:\n\n> In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent\n> professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a\n> lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as\n> moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to\n> the client's situation.\n\nThen there is a very complicated part of this issue:\n\n> such that the lawyer had inadvertently waived privilege?\n\nGenerally, a lawyer's unilateral inadvertent action does not waive the privilege. The typical fact pattern is inadvertent inclusion of an opposing party in a \"reply all\" email meant to be only a \"reply\" to or \"forward\" to a client, or inadvertent inclusion of privileged material in a discovery response (e.g. due to failing to wipe metadata).\n\nWhen another lawyer receives inadvertently disclosed privilege material there is a protocol to be followed.\n\nThe consequences in this case are less clear. The tweet probably wouldn't be admissible as evidence in court, unless the client ratified the disclosure. But once it is out there it isn't illegal for the inadvertent recipient, if the recipient is a non\\-lawyer, to share it further as was done in this case. This could even lead to a malpractice case against the errantly tweeting lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An attorney accidentally texts a journalist with advice for their client on how to respond to a news article.

The attorney's accidental disclosure does not automatically waive this privilege, as generally, a lawyer's unilateral inadvertent action does not constitute waiver. However, once the information is accidentally shared with a non-lawyer third party (in this case, the journalist), that party is not bound by legal ethics rules and can share the information further without breaking any laws, even though the information itself remains privileged in legal contexts. This situation could potentially lead to a malpractice case against the attorney, but it doesn't negate the underlying privilege between the attorney and client."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24/why-cant-a-party-raise-new-arguments-in-united-states-court-of-appeals", "docs_id": 24, "title": "Why can&#39;t a party raise new arguments in United States court of appeals?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the [Lavabit judgement](https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/16/lavabit_opinion.pdf), I saw this:\n\nsee also **Agra, Gill \\& Duffus, Inc. v.

The basic idea, under common law, is that you can lose rights by failing to assert them. This is generally important for many reasons, but specifically in the case of appeals:\n\n* The argument should have been brought before the trial court. Justice is not a game, but it's important to recognize that the party trying to raise the argument had an opportunity to do so already. They have given up their right to raise this argument, and extending them the *privilege* of doing so is (for the following reasons) not good for the system.\n* Courts of appeals are typically not well\\-equipped to evaluate factual evidence. It is not their area of expertise. Witnesses or evidence may be less available. It's just not practical to try to adjudicate factual issues on appeal, most of the time.\n* If anyone could get an appeal by bringing new factual arguments, then *everyone* would do that. You'd bring your strongest argument before the district court, and then if that fails, bring the second strongest before the circuit court. That way, you get an extra trial. This is inefficient.\n* Allowing factual arguments on appeal would encourage attorneys and their clients to strategically bring different facts before different courts. This kind of forum\\-shopping is harmful because it has little to do with who has the stronger overall case, and more to do with who has the better lawyer.\n\n\\* \"Congruent with\" is not the same as \"an instance of\"; this rule is *not* formally an application of *laches*. It just happens to share the same justification.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why courts typically refuse to consider new factual arguments on appeal that were not raised in the district court?\n\nA) To prevent attorneys from strategically withholding stronger arguments for appellate courts\nB) To ensure that all relevant evidence is presented at the initial trial\nC) To avoid overburdening appellate courts with additional witness testimony\nD) To maintain the distinct roles of trial and appellate courts in the judicial system\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) While this is a consequence of the rule, it's not the primary reason.

Appellate courts are designed to review legal errors, not to act as a second trial court. Allowing new factual arguments on appeal would blur the distinct roles of trial and appellate courts, potentially leading to inefficiencies, encouraging forum-shopping, and undermining the finality of trial court decisions.

While the company likely cannot prevent the former employee from contacting colleagues, there are potential legal risks to consider. Making untrue statements about the company could lead to defamation claims. Additionally, if the former employee signed a contract with a non-disparagement clause, they could face legal action for violating it. Therefore, while the employee can generally communicate with former colleagues, they should be careful about the content of their statements and review any contractual obligations they may have.
