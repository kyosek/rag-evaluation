I know there is a line, how and where is that \"line\"\n> defined?\n\nThis distinction captures the key point. If your sign stating \"Active Mine Field\" would, in the overall context, be understood as humor and not as a true statement of fact, it will be protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIf, however, someone is basically defrauded by a sign, because it appears to a reasonable person to be making a true statement of fact upon which a person reasonably relies to their detriment (or perhaps could reasonably rely to their detriment for criminal law purposes), then it is probably not protected.\n\nFor example, suppose that your \"Active Minefield\" sign causes the fire department, when responding to a wildfire next door to your property, to take the long way around your property or to call in the bomb squad at great expense. You could have civil liability as a result. Similarly, if the fire department refused to respond to a fire on your property due to such a sign, your insurance company might have a ground to deny your insurance claim for damages that a prompt fire department response could have prevented.\n\nAnd @user6726 points out circumstances where there could be criminal liability, although there, as in the civil case, the First Amendment would require those criminal statutes to be employed in enough of a common sense fashion to only be invoked in cases where a reasonable person would believe the sign to be purporting to be a true statement of fact in the overall context of the situation, in order to withstand an \"as applied\" constitutional challenge to a facially valid statute.\n\nSo, a \"space lasers\" sign (at least as of 2022 when there are no such things) would probably not give rise to legal or civil liability, but an \"Active Minefield\" sign without something involved in the presentations to clearly indicate that it is a joke (or a fictional depiction for temporary theatrical purposes, for example) to a reasonable person, could result in civil or criminal liability.\n\nSimilarly, if the sign was very artistic and also had pictures of Bugs Bunny and Coyote chasing each other, and images of obviously fake \"land mines\", or if the sign were accompanied by a picture of cow turds everywhere that made clear that the \"minefield\" was a field full of excrement rather than high explosives, it wouldn't be actionable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landowner puts up a sign on their private property that reads \"Danger: Active Minefield.\" Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal implications of this sign?\n\nA) The sign is protected by the First Amendment and cannot result in any legal consequences, as it is on private property.\n\nB) The sign could potentially lead to civil liability if emergency services alter their response due to believing the sign, but criminal charges are not possible.\n\nC) The sign is illegal and will certainly result in criminal charges, regardless of context or intent.\n\nD) The sign could lead to both civil liability and criminal charges if a reasonable person would interpret it as a true statement of fact in the given context, rather than as an obvious joke.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

If so, how recently (has it been used in this century, for example)? Under what circumstances would it hypothetically apply following the abolition of slavery?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not aware of it invoking, but a careful read of the 13th Amendment will find there's an exception to the slavery ban:\n\n> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\nThis means that prisoners can be forced to work for the government for no pay if they are duely convicted for their crimes (often seen as a chain gang, which you can see from countless films, mostly exist so someone can escape from them in the story). Obviously these days the issue is largely moot as most prison work programs pay the prisoners, though this may be cents for labor otherwise netting above minimum wage, and chain gangs are no longer used (work details beside the roads are usually paid and its only for model prisoners.

In modern use there is no practical difference between not guilty and not proven: the defendant is acquitted in both cases.\n\nHas there ever been a case where a verdict of *not proven* ended up having a different practical effect on the defendant than if he had been found *not guilty*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There actually **is** a practical effect to a \"not proven\" v. \"not guilty\" verdict in Scotland, but it is mostly sociological or social in nature rather than legal. If your question is, are there future legal concerns, than no. Not proven *is*, to be sure, an acquittal. However, it is an acquittal that the tells the public something important: that the trier(s) of fact *thought the person likely guilty*. That's a fairly substantial distinction.\n\nIn Scotland, a criminal case may be decided either \"*in solemn procedure*\", which is simply the Scot term for a jury trial v. \"*in summary*\" or in \"summary procedure\" which is the U.S. equivalent of a bench trial. The difference between the two (and the divergence from the U.S. procedural vehicle) is that for lesser crimes the accused doesn't have an automatic right of a jury trial for any criminal matter. \n\nIn some ways this lesser included makes up for the fact that the Scottish accused is without absolute right to choose jury or bench trial, which in the U.S. can be very meaningful from a tactical perspective. Think of how important the make\\-up and emotional proclivities of juries are to both convictions and acquittals. A bench trial can be beneficial to the truly unlikable defendant, or in especially brutal crimes, where juries may convict out of fear or sympathy for the victim, even if the case is weak. At the same time, they may nullify the conviction for the sympathetic defendant. Juries are notoriously emotional and bias driven. Being able to choose a bench trial where the judge will follow the evidence and avoid the emotional response of a jury can be invaluable. Just as a sympathetic defendant can appeal to the emotions of the jury for acquittal or jury nullification, on the opposite spectrum. \n\nIn Scotland, lesser crimes are always (with limited exclusions) tried by a judge, while more serious allegations always (again w/ limited exclusions) get a jury trial, automatically. The d*efendant does not choose* the type of trial he is afforded. Hence, a defense or a prosecution cannot fiddle with the balance of proof based on emotion or lack there of. They get what they get. There are various rules procedurally that differ in comparison, but since this isn't the question that is the general rule and should suffice for background.\n\nAlso hugely important is the fact that in Scotland, jurors decide a case by *majority vote* (like a civil trial in the U.S.); hence, there are no hung juries and they don't need a consensus. So, one way or another the verdict *will be given* in a Scottish criminal action. Scots also get comparatively huge juries to any other country (15 jurors) and they *only need 8 in agreement* to reach a verdict.\n\nTactically, the \"not proven\" is a lesser included verdict (like U.S. uses lesser included charges in cases that are weaker for the prosecution). This lesser included finding can be used by choice when the Prosecution has a sympathetic defendant or when the defendant is probably guilty or unlikable. If the jury thinks the defendant (called \"accused\") probably did the crime, but the prosecution has failed to prove the elements, they can/will issue a \"not proven\" verdict. This sends a big message. This, again, is typically only reserved for those cases when there is strong but not conclusive proof that someone committed a crime. They don't want to profess their innocence with a not guilty verdict, so they are still acquitted, but with he stigma of the \"not proven\" verdict attached.\n\nSome estimates have from 1/5 to a full 1/3 of all acquittal verdicts by Scottish juries as \"not proven\" as opposed to \"not guilty\". Not proven can also be used by judges in the bench trial (summary procedure), however it's much less common. The proportion of 'not proven\" acquittals in general is higher in the more severe cases; but so then are the proportion of acquittals versus convictions. These would likely be hung juries in the U.S..\n\nBoth in the \"solemn\" and the \"summary\" acquittals, not proven is interpreted as indicating that the jury or judge, respectively, is not convinced of the innocence of the accused; in fact, they may be morally or even factually convinced that the accused is guilty, but do not find the proofs sufficient for a conviction under the elements of the crime on the jury instruction/verdict form. \n\nI look at this as similar to the adage oft used in the U.S., which is an acquittal, despite the fact that the verdict is termed \"not guilty\" does by no means indicate the person is in fact \"not guilty\", it just means the prosecution couldn't prove its case. Sociologists in the U.S., as well as legal scholars, have studied the phenomenon, and it appears that most not guilty verdicts in fact let go a guilty person. This can be intuited by the evidence the jury never saw, either by suppression from bad searches, by the exclusion of witness testimony due to procedural rules like hearsay, privilege, etc., and other forms of keeping relevant evidence from the jury to protect the rights of the accused. But in the U.S. the person can go forth and say, \"Hey, I was proven not guilty!\"\n\nScotland also has another interesting rule of criminal procedure, whereby a criminal can't be convicted without corroborated evidence. What this means is that if all the prosecution has is the victim witness, by way of proof, testifying, and no physical or corroboration testimony, Scottish law requires acquittal, but often will be so by the verdict \"not proven\". This is huge, if you think about it. Use, for example, a rape trial. A woman testifies, saying that Joe Schmoe climbed through her window and raped her. She knows Joe \\- he's her neighbor. Nobody saw him climb in. But she knows it's him. He leaves no physical evidence, having shaved his entire body and used appropriate protection (gloves, condemn, etc.). She has a rape kit done. Rape is obvious, but the only proof is her testimony. Joe goes free. But in Scotland, he goes free with a stigma attached. He's found \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty\". I think this corroboration rule has a lot to do with why this verdict system still exists. In the U.S. the trier of fact would weigh the testimony and decide if one person was substantially more believable than the other, and a verdict would issue. That is a substantial difference, procedurally.\n\nSince Scotland doesn't have the hung jury because there is no consensus required they use the \"not proven\" in the same way a U.S. jury uses the hung jury when one or more jurors thinks the prosecution didn't prove their case but it's fairly clear the defendant is, in fact guilty. Then, you will often get a \"hold out\" juror, and since the U.S. requires a unanimous verdict, the hold out hangs the jury. It's sort of the opposite of jury nullification. The person knows that the evidence fell short, but their conscience can't reconcile letting the person go free, so they will vote guilty to hang the jury, almost ensuring the prosecution gets another shot.\n\nThere has been a lot of debate about this three verdict system in comparative law circles, with many legal scholars saying it's antiquated. But I think it serves an important purpose. It carries the stigma of likely guilt for those people who probably committed the crime but got off. Further, the hung jury cost tax payers millions of dollars in the U.S., and this is often the side effect of people not wanting there to be absolutely no recognition of the fact that the accused probably committed (especially serious) crime(s). The Scots, on the other hand, have found away to accomplish this without the cost and emotional toll multiple trials takes on all the players involved, from witnesses and victims, their families, the accused, and even the lawyers and the prosecutions, who have to put in all the work of a trial just to start anew. \n\nHere is a really good scholarly article that deals with this interesting phenomenon not seen in (I don't believe) any other country:\n\n<https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/iiclr/article/viewFile/17848/18019>", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the Scottish criminal justice system, what is a key difference between the \"not proven\" and \"not guilty\" verdicts, and what practical effect does this have?\n\nA) The \"not proven\" verdict allows for a retrial, while \"not guilty\" does not.\nB) \"Not proven\" results in a lesser sentence, while \"not guilty\" leads to full acquittal.\nC) \"Not proven\" carries a social stigma suggesting likely guilt, despite legal acquittal.\nD) \"Not proven\" is only available in jury trials, while \"not guilty\" can be used in both jury and bench trials.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key difference between \"not proven\" and \"not guilty\" verdicts in Scotland is the social stigma attached to the \"not proven\" verdict. Both verdicts result in legal acquittal, but a \"not proven\" verdict suggests that the jury or judge believes the accused is likely guilty, even though there wasn't enough evidence to convict. This has a practical effect on the defendant's reputation in society, as it implies guilt without legal consequences. The other options are incorrect: both verdicts allow double jeopardy protection (no retrial), both result in acquittal (no sentencing difference), and both can be used in jury and bench trials."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6795/legal-issues-of-a-website-such-as-businessnamesucks-com", "docs_id": 6795, "title": "Legal issues of a website such as [businessname]sucks.com", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *What kinds of legal issues do websites such as \\[businessname]sucks.com have in terms of copyright infringement, libel and defamation, and/or other issues?*\n\nLet's say there is a website called \\[businessname]sucks.com.

The HOA has a reasonable suspicion based on the car's apparent lack of movement, which aligns with the concept of \"preponderance of evidence\" mentioned in the answer. The HOA can request the resident to demonstrate the car's operability to address this suspicion. However, the HOA cannot impose penalties solely for the resident's refusal to provide proof, as this would infringe on the resident's rights. The HOA would need to gather more concrete evidence of a rule violation before imposing penalties. This approach balances the HOA's responsibility to enforce rules with the resident's rights and the need for fair processes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it sets too high a standard for the HOA, requiring \"conclusive evidence\" which is not necessary for HOA actions. Option B goes too far in favoring the HOA, allowing immediate penalties without sufficient evidence. Option D is overly restrictive on the HOA's ability to enforce its rules, as 24/7 surveillance is not a reasonable requirement for rule enforcement."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22674/is-it-possible-to-sue-a-uk-based-company-from-the-us-regarding-debt-collection", "docs_id": 22674, "title": "Is it possible to sue a UK based company from the US regarding debt collection?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a US\\-based LLC.

But my understanding is at least one side will always remove them before trial. Why would it always be the case that at least one side would not want someone with legal training on a jury?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically anyone can sit on a jury. Lawyers are not automatically excluded from juries anymore, as being called for jury duty is a right and a duty that the law abhors automatically excluding people from. That is the official line on this. However, in reality, lawyers will always be stricken from serving by one of the lawyers trying the case. Each lawyer has a certain number of preemptory strikes (the ability to get rid of a juror for any reason, aside from those protected by law, such as race, religion, etc). They also have unlimited \n\"for cause strikes,\" which are when a juror is biased in some way. \n\nLawyers trying the case almost always try to use a cause strike to get a lawyer off, saying that they are biased toward either Defense or Plaintiffs based on the type of law they practice. The judge will usually not let them use a cause strike, saying that an attorney is ethical enough to apply the facts to the law and not sway the jury based on their personal biases that everyone has; plus, we're officers of the court so we have a duty to be ethical. Hence, they are typically forced to use a preemptory strike to get a lawyer off, but they will, every time. (If the lawyer just tried a similar case, then they'd get to use *for cause*.)\n\nThe real reason that the lawyer from one side or the other definitely wants a lawyer off is that the jury instructions presented by each side to the judge are crafted in a way that each word carries specific meaning and, with that, is designed to lead to a certain way of thinking. Once the lawyers have fought over the instructions and the judge decides what will be presented, the jury only gets them in writing...in some states not even in writing, they only get them read to them without a copy to take back to the room.\n\nIf a lawyer is in the jury, that person will undoubtedly be able to explain exactly what the law requires for a finding, or exactly why a certain finding should be had. They will advocate one way or another; this is undeniable. The instructions are purposefully confusing. The reason is this: when we fight over jury instruction, inherently, one of us will want an instruction that is hard to understand, for a lay person. This is because we want them to apply the law as it is commonly (mis)understood, not as it truly is, because that's not good for our case. \n\nTo have a lawyer on the jury would defeat the finely crafted instruction and its potential to confuse. They would undoubtedly explain the instruction to the jury. One may think this would be helpful, however, juries are told that any special knowledge they have about anything pertaining to the case shall not be shared as it could sway the jury. This is most true when it comes to a lawyer sitting. When a jury doesn't understand a jury instruction, their *only* recourse is to send a question to the judge. In states where they have the instruction in writing, all he can say is \"read carefully;\" he cannot give his interpretation of what the instruction means. If a judge did give his own interpretation that is grounds for a mistrial or an appeal at least. A lawyer on the jury would be able to explain, \"Oh, what this really means is X,\" and this is bad from one side's perspective, almost always. We all have biases, and even finely determined rules of law can be subtly pushed toward one direction or another with the use of a certain word over another, or the placement of one element before another. \n\nGenerally, unless the side who would most want the attorney off had exhausted their preemptory strikes, and lost the argument to remove for cause, there is very little chance a lawyer will serve. The fact of the matter is that both sides are very likely to want a lawyer stricken from the jury pool, (even from the side who may believe the lawyer to have leanings in their favor). It is *essential* to control as many factors as possible in a jury trial, and an attorney on the panel is just a wild card. The potential always exists that if a lawyer ends up on the jury, they could explain the elements of the case to their fellow jurors, who may then not rely as fully upon the carefully crafted language in the instruction(s). This could backfire on either side when certain portions of the language used may be intentionally vague or difficult to parse though for someone who doesn't practice law.\n\nAnyone interested in the process of choosing and striking jurors (in the U.S.), through the process of *voir dire*, [this](http://www.rotlaw.com/legal-library/what-does-it-mean-to-strike-a-juror/) is a fairly comprehensive article on the topic.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An attorney is called for jury duty in a complex civil case.

While an attorney's knowledge might complicate proceedings, there's no indication this would specifically lead to more mistrials.\n\nThe key point is that both sides want to control how jury instructions are interpreted, and an attorney-juror could disrupt this strategy by explaining the true meaning of complex legal language to other jurors."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33127/is-sabrina-child-pornography", "docs_id": 33127, "title": "Is &quot;Sabrina&quot; child pornography?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many years ago I recall hearing (can't exactly remember where/when, but I believe it had to do with a then still very young Brooke Shields) that \"Child Pornography\" laws applied, even if the actor/actress was actually over 18, but the character was NOT.

In [Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/535/234), the Supreme Court held that the law violates free speech and was overbroad, with a lengthy discussion of the threats it posed to legitimate artistic works:\n\n> Under the CPPA, images are prohibited so long as the persons appear to be under 18 years of age. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2256(1\\). This is higher than the legal age for marriage in many States, as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations. ... It is, of course, undeniable that some youths engage in sexual activity before the legal age, either on their own inclination or because they are victims of sexual abuse.\n> \n> \n> Both themes\\-teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of children\\-have inspired countless literary works. William Shakespeare created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13 years of age. See Romeo and Juliet, act I, sc. 2, 1\\. 9 (\"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years\"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays the relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not juvenile. The work has inspired no less than 40 motion pictures, some of which suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship.\u00a0E.\u00a0g., Romeo and Juliet (B. Luhrmann director, 1996\\). Shakespeare may not have written sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but were modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach, that fact alone would not compel the conclusion that the work was obscene.\n> \n> \n> Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's Academy Awards featured the movie, Traffic, which was nominated for Best Picture. See Predictable and Less So, the Academy Award Contenders, N. Y. Times, Feb. 14, 2001, p. Ell. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16year\\-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before, American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture. See \"American Beauty\" Tops the Oscars, N. Y. Times, Mar. 27, 2000, p. El. In the course of the movie, a teenage girl engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, and another yields herself to the gratification of a middle\\-aged man. The film also contains a scene where, although the movie audience understands the act is not taking place, one character believes he is watching a teenage boy performing a sexual act on an older man.\n> \n> \n> Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring fascination with the lives and destinies of the young. Art and literature express the vital interest we all have in the formative years we ourselves once knew, when wounds can be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and mistaken choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self\\-fulfillment are still in reach.\n> \n> \n> Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value.\n> \n> \n> This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See\u00a0Book\u00a0Named \"John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v.\u00a0Attorney General of Mass.,\u00a0383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966\\) (plurality opinion) (\"\\[T]he social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness\"). Under\u00a0Miller,\u00a0the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive.

According to the Supreme Court's ruling in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, while the law does define child pornography broadly to include depictions of minors in sexual situations (even if the actors are over 18), there are important First Amendment protections for artistic works. The Court emphasized that artistic merit must be judged by considering the work as a whole, not just isolated scenes. This means that works exploring themes involving young people and sexuality can be protected if they have overall artistic value, even if they contain individual scenes that might be considered explicit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the nuanced approach required by the First Amendment. Option B, while partly true in terms of the broad definition, fails to account for the First Amendment limitations on applying the law. Option C goes too far by suggesting complete exemption, which is not the case \u2013 works must still have artistic merit when considered as a whole."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51359/how-to-convince-google-to-fix-a-problem-that-caused-few-thousand-damage", "docs_id": 51359, "title": "How to convince Google to fix a problem that caused few thousand $ damage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Edited for less mystery.

Which leads to the first two questions: Is quietly cutting off the revenue, without letting the affected party know about, a righteous behavior according to the legal conception in California? Doesn't this require at least some form of communication?\n\nAfter contacting 11 (!) support staff members, one was found who started to work on the problem. But for three weeks, nothing has changed.

Long story short, by today a full month of revenue is lost, while communication with all the support staff was a total waste of time. \n\nConsidering that we're talking about Google, this appears to be a extraordinary long chain of persistent incompetence.

On the day of the viewing, but before my appointment, the estate agent informed me that two offers had already been made that same day, and both had been accepted. Although he couldn't reveal the amount of these offers for legal reasons, it was \"not worth me making an offer below the asking price\". So, I make an offer for \u00a3407k, and this was accepted. After thinking this through, I am now wondering how likely it is that these two other offers were genuine, and how likely it is these two offers never actually existed, but were made up to encourage me to make an offer over the asking price.\n\nAs another anecdote, after a previous viewing at a different property, the estate agent informed me that an offer for the asking price had just been accepted, and asked whether I would like to make an offer to myself. I replied that I was not interested in making an offer, but then only to find out a few days later that an advert for the same property was re\\-listed at \u00a310k below that original asking price. Yes, I know that often the finances don't work out and the buyer has to back out, but it certainly seems possible that in that case too, this other offer was fake.\n\nSo, my questions are (and relating specifically to the UK, but other comments welcomed):\n\n1. When estate agents state that other offers have recently already been made and accepted, is it common for these to be fake? If anybody has any real insider knowledge about this (e.g. if you are / have been an estate agent yourself), comments would be welcomed on how often estate agents make up other offers when trying to get a buyer to increase their offer.\n2. Is it actually defined in law that it is illegal for estate agents to suggest that other offers have been made, when this is completely untrue?\n3. If I was suspicious about the estate agent faking an offer, how could I go about finding out the truth? If I were to ask the estate agent, he would certainly say to me that it was not within his capacity to reveal the details of his other clients who made these offers. So it seems difficult to ever know, even if you were very suspicious.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Yes, I believe it is common in *some* cases for people to lie about alternative offers in order to drive up asking price or encourage a quicker offer. But there are also brokers who would never consider it. People are night and day. How common it is depends on the culture of real estate transactions in a particular region and the particular person you are dealing with.\n2. Legality depends on your jurisdiction, and there is a distinction between illegality and what can be done about it. Technically it may be fraud or in violation of ethics regulations. Consult an attorney in your jurisdiction who does not regularly work with this broker.\n3. You can't necessarily know. You have to assume a selling agent is lying about everything and protect yourself by ignoring most of what he says and having a good attorney. I would especially do that when the agent tells you he has already accepted two offers on the same house, because that means he has already broken a deal today and is planning to break the second if you give him more money.\n\nThe best approach is probably, practically, to mostly ignore the claim about the competing offer and take it as a price change. If you'll pay more and be happy, fine. If you aren't willing to pay more, walk away. If they're faking the offer, they'll almost definitely come back to you and then you can even potentially negotiate a price cut. \n\nHowever, check with a local real estate attorney first about whether this increases the risk of litigation over the property that you won't want to get involved in.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK real estate market, an estate agent informs a potential buyer that two offers have been made and accepted on a property before the buyer's viewing.

So discussing the facts of a tough case with a supervisor is not going to be as problematic as idly gossiping about clients with custodial staff.\n\nBeyond the permitted disclosures, there are also situations in which counselors are *required* to disclose confidential information, including cases where the counselor suspects child or elder abuse or where the counselor believes the client poses a danger to herself or others.\n\nIf the disclosure was truly not permitted, then it may be that the client has a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. In Georgia, proving that case requires evidence that:\n\n1. That the counselor had information relating to the client that she knew or should have known was confidential;\n2. That the counselor communicated the client\u2019s confidential information to third parties;\n3. That the client did not give informed consent to the counselor\u2019s conduct;\n4.

They have an existing problem that reads: \"A pipe at the top of a 100L tank fills it at a rate of 8 liters per minute, while a drain at the bottom empties it at 3 liters per minute. If both are open simultaneously, how long will it take to fill an empty tank?\" Which of the following actions would most likely be considered legally safe from copyright infringement?\n\nA) Change the numbers to: \"A pipe at the top of a 200L tank fills it at a rate of 10 liters per minute, while a drain at the bottom empties it at 4 liters per minute. If both are open simultaneously, how long will it take to fill an empty tank?\"\n\nB) Rewrite the question as: \"A faucet fills a 100L bathtub at 8 liters per minute, while the drain loses 3 liters per minute. If both are open, how long until the tub is full?\"\n\nC) Create a new question from scratch about filling a swimming pool, using different rates and volumes, but following a similar concept.\n\nD) Use the exact same question but change \"tank\" to \"container\" and \"pipe\" to \"hose\".\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most legally safe approach. By creating a new question from scratch, even if it follows a similar concept, the publisher avoids directly copying or deriving from the existing problem. This aligns with the advice that there is no copyright on the idea behind a question, and developing your own from scratch would not be considered derivative.

But I cannot recall the name of the case, and I have not been able to find it using Google searches.\n\nThe facts as I recall them: A man, in fact a former slave, had been accused and convicted of murder, or perhaps manslaughter, in West Virginia. An appeal was filed on the grounds that the judge who tried the case and imposed sentence had been a Virginia legislator during the Civil War, and had voted for the act of secession and for acts funding the Confederate forces, thereby \"engaging in rebellion\". The appeal claimed that the judge was therefore subject to removal under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and his sentence was thereby invalid.\n\nShortly after the Civil War (or perhaps in its latter days) the former legislator had been appointed to be a county judge in the newly organized state of West Virginia.\n\nThe court ruled that the section was not self\\-executing, that no process had been brought to remove the judge, and that to collaterally invalidate otherwise valid court judgements would lead to chaos.\n\nThe case occurred after the ratification of the 14th, and before the passage of the Amnesty Act in 1872\\.\nCan anyone provide the name and proper citation for this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a factually similar impeachment case.

It is also not mentioned in a law review article looking a WV civil war era jurisprudence up to 1872 when WV's new constitution was adopted.\n\nI suspect that the case you are looking for is a pair of related cases (neither of which involves West Virginia), one tried by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court alone on a habeas corpus petition when riding circuit, and a related decision of the Texas Supreme Court involving the same defendant. *[Griffin's Case](https://cite.case.law/f-cas/11/7/?full_case=true&format=html)*, 11 F.

April 1869\\).\n\nThe official summary of the fact and procedural posture of the main case on point was as follows:\n\n> Caesar Griffin, a negro, was indicted in the county court of\n> Rockbridge county, for an assault with intent to kill. He removed his\n> case as under the law he had the right to do into the circuit court\n> for that county, and was there tried by a jury which found him guilty\n> and assessed his punishment at imprisonment for two years in the\n> penitentiary. He was accordingly sentenced by the court to that\n> imprisonment While on his way thither, in the custody of the sheriff\n> of Rockbridge county, he sent out this writ which was served on the\n> sheriff. That officer produced the petitioner in the district court\n> then in session in Richmond, and made return to the writ that he held\n> him by virtue of the conviction and sentence of the circuit court for\n> Rockbridge county, making the record of the trial and conviction there\n> a a part of his return. This return the petitioner traversed, denying\n> that there was any court or judge in Rockbridge county as pretended by\n> said pretended record, and that the paper exhibited was any record as\n> alleged. The state of Virginia appearing by the attorney\\-general,\n> Mr., Judge H. W. Sheffey, the judge of the circuit court for\n> Rockbridge by Bradley T. Johnson, Esq., and the sheriff by James\n> Neeson, Esq. they joined issue on this traverse. The petitioner then\n> proved that Judge Sheffey had been a member of the house of delegates\n> in 1849\\. That in 1862, he was speaker of the house of delegates, and\n> that his votes were recorded for affording men, money and supplies to\n> support Virginia and the Confederate States, in the war then flagrant\n> with the United States. It was admitted that he was duly appointed on\n> February 22, 1866, by the then government of Virginia, to be judge of\n> the circuit including the county of Rockbridge; that he immediately\n> entered on the duties of that office, and that he has ever since and\n> still is discharging the functions of the same.\n> \n> \n> The cause was argued at great length in the district court, before the\n> district judge in December, 1868, who ordered the discharge of the\n> petitioner, whereupon an appeal was prayed by the sheriff under the\n> habeas corpus act of 1867 \\[14 StaL 385], to the circuit court, and the\n> petitioner admitted to bail. Before the circuit court could meet other\n> writs of habeas corpus were sued out by other parties convicted of\n> felonies, two of them of murder, on the same ground as in this case,\n> and the petitioners were discharged. A motion was then made by James\n> Lyons, Esq. in the supreme court of the United States for a writ of\n> prohibition against the district judge, to restrain him from further\n> exercise of such power.

In consequence of the failure to oust the state officers\n> disfranchised under the fourteenth amendment by these and similar\n> judicial proceedings, congress in February, 1869, passed a joint\n> resolution directing that all such officers should be removed by the\n> military commanders of military districts into which the late\n> Confederate States had been divided. Thus all the old officers of the\n> state government of Virginia were removed except a very few, and new\n> ones appointed not obnoxious to the denunciation of the federal bar \u2014\n> the supreme court of appeals of Virginia; the judges thereof having\n> been removed by the major general commanding, he appointed as judges\n> in their stead, a colonel of his staff, and two others, who had held\n> or did then hold commissions in the United States army.

The court ruled that without a formal process to remove the judge (who had previously supported the Confederacy), his judicial acts remained valid. This decision aimed to prevent chaos that would result from invalidating all decisions made by potentially disqualified officials.

The GDPR requires that you have *a* legal basis for processing per Art 6\\. Here, there might be a *legitimate interest* for processing, in particular the legitimate interest of the party planner. Before relying on legitimate interest as a legal basis, you must do a balancing test to ensure that the legitimate interest outweighs the affected rights and freedoms of the data subject. You should also implement safeguards to limit abuse.\n\nHowever, a key GDPR principle (Art 5\\) is transparency. Putting up a privacy policy on your website is not good enough, and Art 14 lists various information that you must provide to the data subject if you didn't obtain their personal data from the data subject themselves. You must provide this information within a reasonable period, but at the latest:\n\n* within one month\n* at the time of the first communication with the data subject\n* when the information is disclosed to a third party\n\nHere, it seems likely that your system would send out invites to all involved persons.

A data processor is bound by some contract per Art 28, which is common/necessary in a B2B context. You could structure your signup flow so that such a contract is formed with the party planner, and the party planner would then be the sole data controller who would be responsible for selecting a suitable legal basis and providing information to data subjects.\n\nBut don't do that. Such terms would likely run into consumer protection issues and might be unenforceable. Being a processor is also not a get\\-out\\-of\\-jail\\-free card, because you still have substantial compliance obligations towards the controller.\n\nMore reasonably, you and the party planner are *joint controllers* per Art 26\\.

The law in California as it deals with prescriptions ([Controlled Substances Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=10.&title=&part=&chapter=4.&article=1.&goUp=Y), or [general pharmacy regulation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=9.&article=2.)) does not imply a requirement for a \"prescription\". If we switch to \"doctors orders\", then perhaps there is a requirement. This comes up in [this letter](https://www.lsbme.la.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Advisory%20Opinions/Self-Referred%20MRI%20Testing.pdf) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20170126044242/https://www.lsbme.la.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Advisory%20Opinions/Self-Referred%20MRI%20Testing.pdf)) from the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, who take the position that self\\-referral for MRI is the practice of medicine, which is illegal without a medical license. A radiologists who performs the procedure would exceed the scope of their license. However, there is no specific statute that says \"You must have a doctors orders to perform an MRI\", instead that follows from more general laws. They do point out that MRIs often entail injections which cannot be administered except under a doctor's orders. MRI technology is regulated under Louisiana law (start [here](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2014/code-revisedstatutes/title-37/rs-37-3200/)).\n\nX\\-ray technicians are similarly regulated in [California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=104.&title=&part=1.&chapter=4.&article=5.), but that article does not apply to MRI. You must be licensed to perform an x\\-ray, acting within the scope of that license, and under the supervision of an appropriate licentiate of the healing arts.

Under copyright law, you must have permission of the copyright holder to copy any protected work (original creative work not created as a work of the US, as an example under US law). This is true whether or not the copyright holder tells you that copying requires permission.\n\nA matter for more concern is \"false permission\", where a person without the right to grant permission utters something that the courts would usually interpret as being \"permission\", for example releasing a Harry Potter book under CC\\-0\\. The legal requirement is that you have actual permission, not that a prohibition was not communicated to you.\nIt is in your interest to know whether the actual person making available a work under some license actually has the right to grant a license. But there is no way to know for certain who holds copyright. You can, however, attempt to determine that a work has been registered with the US copyright office, looking [here](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First). Works are still protected when not registered, so failing to find a copyright registration does not guarantee that the work is \"open access\".

According to copyright law, permission from the copyright holder is required to use any protected work, regardless of where it was found or what statements are attached to it.

Nothing that you describe resembles the kind of emergency situation that allows a warrantless search. In order to get a warrant, you have to have a good enough reason.\n\nSuppose that campus police found a suspicious object at the scene which was evidence of a crime and which had an identifiable connection to his home. Campus police might get a warrant to search the home, to find evidence related to the possiblity that this was a murder. That evidence could be evidence that he had uncovered a terrorist plot to bomb Needles CA, and he was killed because of that. His home computer might contain records of contact between him and the terrorists: so the judge might grant a warrant.

Is it a mandate to get a vaccine? A mandate not to serve an unvaccinated individual in a public place? A mandate to vaccinate children that attend public schools? A mandate to serve unvaccinated individuals at public accommodations? Or what?\n\nThe details of the mandate, how it was enacted, and the circumstances under which it is being challenged, are all critical to determining its legal validity.\n\nAs noted in the linked answer (text reordered for clarity):\n\n> Under the US Constitution, a public health authority could even make\n> vaccination mandatory, and this was done in some historical epidemics.\n> \n> \n> In *Jacobson v.

The core language of that Act which sets forth the substantive standard in those cases states that:\n\n> SEC. 3\\. FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION PROTECTED.\n> \n> \n> (a) IN GENERAL.\u2014Government shall not substantially burden a person's\n> exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general\n> applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).\n> \n> \n> (b) EXCEPTION.\u2014Government may substantially burden a person's exercise\n> of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to\n> the person\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n> \n> \n> and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n> governmental interest.\n> \n> \n> (c) JUDICIAL RELIEF.\u2014 A person whose religious exercise has been\n> burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a\n> claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate\n> relief against a government.

Generally, private businesses do not have an affirmative duty to serve anyone.\n\nCertainly, it could do so as a matter of company policy, if the law did not forbid discrimination specifically on vaccination status (which it currently does not in most or all places in the U.S., although there may be recent legislation on this of which I am not aware).\n\nFor example, it is legal to operate a restaurant that only serves bacon cheeseburgers and operates 7 days a week, all year long, without holidays (in many places that lack blue laws for restaurants), even though this effectively denies service to strictly observant Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and (on Fridays during Lent) to observant Catholics, and could make it an uncomfortable place for such workers to work.\n\nThe harder question is whether the restaurant could serve an unvaxxed individual when the business and the customer both want to do so, and both have sincere religious beliefs that cause them to feel that they must do so (the business owner might have sincere beliefs about serving everything, the customer might have sincere beliefs about being unvaxxed for religious reasons).\n\nEven then, when religious people aren't singled out for being religious, this requirement might be upheld if there was no alternative that meets the public health goals of the requirement, although the case that there could be some alternative that is less restrictive might be pretty good.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A local government enacts a law requiring all restaurants to check customers' vaccination status and refuse service to unvaccinated individuals.

You would need to get permission to use that trademark.\n\nThe artwork of the game is copyrighted and cannot be duplicated without violating that copyright.\n\nIn general, the labels meaning phrases like \"Go to Jail\" and \"New York Avenue\" are probably copyrighted and some court decisions have decided that labels are a copyrightable element. However, there is some gray area.\n\nThe game mechanics are not copyrightable and can be duplicated.\n\nWhat this means is that if you clone the game and use new labels (like new property names and card titles) then you are probably fine. You would have to make a novel board design.\n\nIf you clone the game, but use the game's labels, then you could potentially lose in court.\n\nOf course, remember that corporations will sometimes sue just to intimidate people, even if they have a losing case. Just because your clone is non\\-infringing doesn't mean they won't sue you.\n\nIt costs them money to sue people, so if your clone is obscure or not used by many people it could fly under the radar and be ignored by the company. If your clone was a success and became widely used, that would significantly increase the chance you could get sued.\n\nIn most cases a company will threaten infringers before they sue them, because it is a lot cheaper to threaten somebody than sue them. Therefore, you could make your clone and just plan on discontinuing it if they threaten you. Of course, there is a small risk they would sue you anyway. If you made no money then you are probably safe because it would be a lot harder for them to argue that you commercially damaged them if you made no money.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small indie game developer wants to create a digital board game inspired by Monopoly.

Using new property names, card titles, and board design avoids copyright infringement on the original game's artwork and labels.\n3.

Since no papers were given to the driver and nothing was signed, no official ticket was issued. The officer likely decided to give only a verbal warning. Option A is incorrect because California does not typically mail tickets after traffic stops. Option C is unlikely without a formal citation. Option D is incorrect because, without a signed ticket, there is no official record of the violation to appear on the driving record.

According to the documentation, it's not possible to stop other countries from claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction over content uploaded to a global platform. However, the effectiveness of enforcing such claims can vary greatly depending on factors like the creator's home country (India in this case), the countries they might visit, and the nature of the content. Many countries routinely ignore jurisdictional claims from others, especially for content that isn't highly controversial. While the creator can't prevent claims, the practical enforcement of such claims may be limited, particularly if the creator doesn't travel to countries that might take issue with the content.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that you cannot stop the claim of jurisdiction.\nOption B is too limiting, as countries may attempt to claim jurisdiction regardless of formal extradition treaties.\nOption D is incorrect because educational content isn't automatically exempt from jurisdictional claims."}}
