Say country X considers the age of consent 16, recognizes dual citizenship, and has an extradition treaty with the US...\n\nHowever, Alice happened to have been born on a cruise while the cruise ship was sailing through US territorial waters, thus making her a US citizen. She has never done any of the things which can cause someone to officially lose their US citizenship.\n\nFederal law states [it is illegal for a US citizen to have sex with an individual under the age of 18 in a 'foreign place'](http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC02423.html)\n\nI'm wondering what, of any of these scenarios, would be illegal due to the above law and could theoretically lead to either extrication, or to arrest when/if they ever visited the US at some later date (and if one is possible but not the later).\n\n1. Alice never realizing she was born actually born in US waters and never thinking of herself as a US citizen, and she never visited the US or engaged in any of the activities that cause her to lose citizenship\n\nIf the above would not be sufficient would any of the below situations potentially lead to prosecution:\n\n\t* Knew she was also a US citizen and had once claimed some minor right or privileged due to being a US citizen.\n\t* Occasionally visits a friend or relative within the US for brief periods, using her US citizenship to allow easier entry to the US, without going through the steps of the VWP.\n\t* Once stayed in the US with said friend/relative for slightly more then 90 days (beyond the length a regular tourist can stay) many years ago\n\t* Had just spent spent 91 day summer vacation with her family relative before returning to her home country and having sexual relations with Bob.\n2. Alice and Bob both live in and were citizens of X but originally met when both were on a vacation to the US, ultimately having a sexual relationship in their home country.\n\nWould Alice potentially face prosecution, if not would this change if: \n\n\t* The couple had (legally) engaged in sexual activity in the US prior to traveling back home\n\t* The couple originally met in a state where sexual intercourse would have been illegal and so waited until returning home before having a sexual relationship?\n\t* Alice bought bob plan ticket home, so she is officially 'transporting' bob? (section a of the above law applies)\n\t* Alice and bob did have a relationship prior to their visit to the US which continued during their US visit.\n\nI realize that prosecutor discretion would usually result in no one choosing to prosecutor most if not all of the above cases, despite any legal right, but I'm asking rather they could face charges if a prosecutor did choose to move forward for some reason. I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung\\-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...\n\n\\*Edit:\nLooking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed. However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference. For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question? I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.\n\nps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right? That's something I really didn't need to know about. I knew I shouldn't have used that particular law as my example for this...\n\npps. Also the definition of \"any person can be charged with a\n criminal offense\" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Ignorantia juris non excusat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can say I didn't know: it won't keep you out of jail.\n\nRather than delving into the specifics of your question, I will keep my answer general. If you break the law, you break the law.

The state of mind of the person is, in most jurisdictions, irrelevant; the common law doctrine of *mens rea* or \"the guilty mind\" has almost universally been done away with.\n\nNow specific offences have specific defences.

Her ignorance of the law or her citizenship status is not a valid defense.

According to [Circular 34](http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf) lists are generally not subject to copyright. In addition keep in mind that to be copyright the subject matter has to be one that is result of creative effort, ie [\"...original literary, musical, pictorial, or graphic expression.\"](http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf) I would think that a price list does not fall under that category because a listing of numbers and items is not such an expression.\n\nHowever, keep in mind how easy it is for anybody to file a DCMA take\\-down notice.

I spoke with multiple sources including lawyers and can't get a clear answer. The contractor claims they NEVER waive or modify the clause. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A contractor would agree because it basically it comes close to restating the state of the law in the absence of any agreement between the parties.\n\nSo contrary to the answer of ShazamoMorebucks it probably would be enforced. Sometimes contracts that waive liability that would otherwise exist in the absence of an agreement are viewed as objectionable. But, a requirement in a contract that simply places upon a party the liability that they would have in the absence of an agreement is usually enforced.\n\n> The Subcontractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless \\[the\n>  contractor] and the United States Government, and their respective\n>  officers, employees and agents (the \"Indemnities\"), from and against\n>  any and all liabilities, of whatsoever kind or nature, arising out of\n>  or in any way connected with the Subcontractor's performance under\n>  this Agreement, excepting only (i) liability arising from affirmative\n>  acts, done with intent to cause loss, damage or injury, by the\n>  Indemnities; (ii) liability arising from the sole negligence of the\n>  Indemnities; or (iii) any express liability as may be specified\n>  elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\nThe big limiting factor here is that the liability must arise out of or be connected with the Subcontractor's performance under the Agreement.\n\nUsually, if liability arises from the Subcontractor's performance, the Subcontractor would be, at least, jointly and severally liable for the liability in any case, where liability does not arise from the other party's intentional acts, or from the other party's sole negligence.\n\nLiability for defects in goods sold is generally a matter of strict liability. \n\nIf the Subcontractor did defective work, and the general contractor simply purchased that work and did nothing else to contribute to the liability, why should it be on the hook?\n\nThe only case where this may modify the default rule is when both the subcontractor and the general contractor are at fault. For example, maybe the subcontractor made a defective good but the defect was so obvious that the general contractor should have noticed a returned the goods before using them in a larger project. This puts full liability on the subcontractor, even when the general contractor is also negligent.\n\nBut, in practice, the general contractor will still be on the hook for most of the liability that the general contractor is forced to pay, because the subcontractor will generally be almost judgment proof and will go bankrupt before it pays a small portion of the amount that it owes to the general contractor in the event of the subcontractor's fault giving rise to a major liability (e.g. if goods it supplied caused a multi\\-million dollar project to have to be done over from scratch).\n\nAlso, subcontractors routinely can and do insure against this risk and figure the cost of the insurance into their prices.

The documentation explains that such indemnity clauses often restate the existing legal obligations that would apply even without the clause. While the clause may seem broad, it's limited to liabilities arising from the subcontractor's performance. Additionally, subcontractors typically manage this risk by obtaining insurance and factoring the cost into their pricing. The clause doesn't create new liabilities beyond what would likely exist under normal legal principles, and accepting it can be a strategic business decision to access government contract work.

Both the harmful and offensive contact varieties of battery require a bad intent: \u00a713 \"An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if (a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact...\", and per \u00a716, \"If an act is done with the intention of inflicting upon another an offensive but not a harmful bodily contact...the actor is liable to the other for a battery although the act was not done with the intention of bringing about the resulting bodily harm\". \u00a718 Battery: Offensive Contact says more or less the same thing with \"offensive\" inserted. Furthermore,\n\n> \u00a718(2\\) An act which is not done with the intention stated in Subsection\n>  (1,a) does not make the actor liable to the other for a mere offensive\n>  contact with the other's person although the act involves an\n>  unresonable risk of inflicting it and, therefore, would be negligent\n>  or reckless if the risk threatened bodily harm.\n\nSo, if A throws a dart at a dartboard while B is right next to it, and hits B in the eye, it would seem that this is not battery, and poor B might be out of luck.\n\nI *think* this would be generic negligence, where \u00a7281 \"The actor is liable for an invasion of an interest of another, if: (a) the interest invaded is protected against unintentional invasion...\". The problem is, the description of the interest in freedom from harmful bodily contact only protects against the interest w.r.t. intentional contact, so where does the protection of that interest come from in terms of *unintentional* contact. Specifically: is there a general rule that every protection against an intentional invasion of interest entails a protection against *unintentional* invasion of that interest? (I assume the \"duty\" is a generic and universal one).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generic negligence. In most United States jurisdictions, Negligence is a tort requiring (1\\) duty, (2\\) breach of that duty, (3\\) but\\-for and proximate causation, and (4\\) harm. In most human interaction, one person has a duty to act as a reasonable person to avoid harming another person. So if you do something a reasonable person would not do, and that causes harm, you can be liable for the resulting harm. The reason for this is that you have the ability to control your activity, and you should be willing to engage in reasonable activities without risking civil liability. Thus it discourages unreasonable behavior if you have to pay for the harm that results from your lack of reasonable care.\n\nBecause negligence requires breach of duty under a reasonable person standard rather than requiring intent, it necessarily creates a sphere of protection around the invasion of interests recognized by intentional torts that also have harm as an element. However, that sphere of protection does not protect against all unintentional invasions, just against those unintentional invasions which are sufficient to support a case for negligence in a given jurisdiction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A group of friends are playing darts at a local bar.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential liability?\n\nA) John is liable for battery because he intended to throw the dart, even though he didn't intend to hit Sarah.\n\nB) John cannot be held liable for either battery or negligence because he didn't intend to hit Sarah and was engaged in a lawful activity.\n\nC) John is liable for battery only if it can be proven that he had a specific intent to cause Sarah harm or offense.\n\nD) John may be liable for negligence if it's determined that his actions fell below the standard of care expected of a reasonable person under the circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is correct because this scenario best fits the elements of negligence rather than battery. John's actions (throwing a dart while intoxicated with people nearby) likely fall below the standard of care expected of a reasonable person, which could constitute a breach of duty. The harm to Sarah was caused by this breach, satisfying the causation and harm elements of negligence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because battery requires intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, which John lacked towards Sarah specifically.\n\nOption B is incorrect because even without intent to harm Sarah, John can still be held liable for negligence if his actions were unreasonable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the intent requirement for battery. Battery doesn't require specific intent to harm, but rather intent to cause contact that turns out to be harmful or offensive.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the distinctions between intentional torts (like battery) and negligence, as well as the elements required for each."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41776/license-ambiguity-when-license-version-is-not-specified-by-author", "docs_id": 41776, "title": "License ambiguity - When license version is not specified by author?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am tasked with making a due diligence of legacy software.

We told him that we are 15, and he said that we needed a parent with us, so we ran back to the car and had my friend's dad come back with us and they said he needed to be in the theater with us. He bought a ticket and walked to the theater with us and then left.\n\nA few minutes later before the movie even started, the ticket collector came into the theater and asked where our parent was, we replied he left, and the guy escorted us out of the theater and said that we couldn't come back that day, when we asked for a refund he said we couldn't have one.\n\nSo I was just wondering if they broke any laws or if they were in the clear.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At a minimum, what the theater did was not a crime. When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a \"license\" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.\n\nAs a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.\n\nWhether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.\n\nIndeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.\n\nThere is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R\\-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.\n\nAnother fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non\\-discriminatory manner.\n\nI don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined. I would give you at least a 20% chance of prevailing if you took the issue to court although I would agree that it is more likely than not that you would not prevail if you took the issue to court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario where underage teenagers are removed from an R-rated movie after their adult guardian leaves, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications?\n\nA) The theater definitely committed a crime by removing the teenagers without a refund.\n\nB) The teenagers have a clear-cut case for breach of contract against the theater.\n\nC) The theater's actions were likely legal, but the contract terms between moviegoers and theaters are often ambiguous.\n\nD) The teenagers breached the contract by attending without an adult, giving the theater undisputed right to remove them.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. The documentation suggests that the theater's actions were likely not criminal, as they have the right to revoke a moviegoer's \"license\" to be present.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. A website contains several types of works (literary, artistic, software), each requiring a separate application for registration.\n2. Copyright registration is not mandatory in India. Copyright is automatically acquired as soon as a work is created.\n3. However, registration provides prima facie evidence in court for copyright disputes.\n4. The registration process involves filing separate applications for different types of works, paying the prescribed fee, and following the procedure outlined by the Copyright Office.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the registration process for websites.

I am wondering if this is permitted because these casinos are constructed within the sovereign territory of tribal nations within states, or, if it is because that ruling itself loosened regulations for all gaming institutions, Native or not. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two general federal restrictions on gambling are in [18 USC ch. 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-50), against off\\-shore gambling ships, and wire communication for transmitting information that assists interstate / international gambling on sporting events and competitions. Interstate lotteries are legal and internet sales of lottery tickets is legal (until Congress or SCOTUS says otherwise). These laws have the usual commerce clause justificational language.\n\nIn addition, the [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-120/pdf/STATUTE-120-Pg1884.pdf) says that you can't use the internet to engage in otherwise\\-illegal gambling, so if your state prohibits lotteries or bingo, you can't use the internet to gamble (in\\-state or across state/tribal lines). The definitions section ([31 USC 5362(10\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362)) narrows the term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" so that an online wager is legal if made exclusively within or between the land of one or more tribes, and follows applicable Indian gaming regulations, see below.\n\nGambling on tribal land is covered by [25 USC ch. 29](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-29) which was passed in response to California v. the Cabazon, and there are three classes of gambling. Traditional and social games with minimal reward are unrestricted; bingo, cards (not games where you play against \"the house\") and other stuff is class II which requires tribal approval etc. The broader 3rd class requires a compact to be negotiated between the state in which the venue is located and the tribe. Section [2710(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/2710) address the most stringent (and most generally\\-relevant) restrictions. The federal \"take\" on these matters is mediated via the Indian Gaming Commission under Interior (and not, for example, the DOJ), and 2 of the 3 commisioners must be registered tribe members. The law is framed in terms of location on tribal land which is \"within the reservation\" or \"on tribal trust land\", thus an operation owned by a tribe but located on other land is not covered by this act (and would be covered by the relevant state law).\n\nNo specific law is required to permit anything pertaining to gambling, instead a specific law would be necessary to prohibit it. The federal government prohibits very little, leaving that to the states. A state has authority to regulate gambling, but it has no authority to regulate gambling on tribal land, unless Congress gives it such authority (and Congress has not).

Do I give up my rights to the proper agreement we had?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### The Company is performing wage theft\n\nI have never heard of a wage method that pays a salary according to hours but doens't pay for hours over 40\\. Monthly **Salary**, by definition, is paid regardless of hours. Your contract doesn't give hours, it just gives a monthly total. That's a contract, and you should be paid according to the contract. In terms of fairness, it certainly isn't right to dock pay for weeks you worked less than 40 but not give you credit for weeks you wored more than 40\\.\n\nNow, it's not clear if you moved to direct employment for the second month. If you did, the first month would be a contract violation, and the second would be a violation of wage \\& labor law. A company can't pay you salary as an exempt (exempt from hourly wage laws, like management) employee and also dock you pay according to hours worked.\n\nSo what can you do? If you are still a contractor and actually want the job, not much more than arguing with payroll. Since you (why?) decided to be a contractor instead of a direct hire, you have exactly zero protections to getting let go. If you are a direct employee, you have protections from bringing action about being paid fairly, though your long\\-term prospects there would be problematic if you have to take the company to task using the government.\n\nAny HR rep should know all of the above. But never just go to HR without talking to your manager first. Remember that HR works for management, and working against your manager is generally a bad career move.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee receives an offer letter stating an annual salary of $115,000, paid monthly. After working for two months with varying weekly hours (some weeks over 40 hours, some under), the employee receives less than the expected monthly amount. The employer claims they don't have to pay the full salary when the employee doesn't work 40 hours every week. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employer is within their rights to adjust the salary based on hours worked, as long as they also pay overtime for weeks exceeding 40 hours.\n\nB) If the employee is classified as an exempt salaried worker, the employer must pay the full monthly salary regardless of hours worked, unless specific conditions for salary deductions are met under FLSA regulations.\n\nC) The employer can legally reduce the salary for weeks under 40 hours but is not required to pay extra for weeks over 40 hours.\n\nD) As long as the average hours worked per month meet or exceed 160 hours (40 hours/week), the employer is justified in paying the full salary amount.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. For exempt salaried employees, employers are generally required to pay the full salary regardless of the number of hours worked in a week. Deductions from salary are only permitted in specific circumstances outlined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). If the employee is truly classified as exempt and salaried, the employer cannot dock pay for working fewer than 40 hours in a week while also not compensating for weeks worked over 40 hours. This practice would violate the salary basis requirement for exempt employees. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the rules for salaried exempt employees and could potentially violate labor laws."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/75192/ownership-of-a-collectively-created-object", "docs_id": 75192, "title": "Ownership of a collectively created object", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Imagine an art event, where participants contribute to the creation of a piece of art.

What is it like in other countries?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> In European anti\\-monopoly law, does that not represent some kind of\n> abuse and monopoly of communications?\n\nAs a general rule, governments are allowed to award monopolies to individuals or private firms, or to governmental entities, and governmental entities are not, in general, subject to anti\\-trust liability.\n\nFor example, governments may nationalize a particular industry, government may authorize a firm that is regulated as a utility to have a monopoly in lieu of using private competition between firms to provide utilities, governments can award patents to inventors which are monopolies, governments can establish a national health service, and so on.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is a create of statute and only prohibits what national governments decide to prohibit by statute, which rarely includes their own activities.\n\nIn the E.U., this is somewhat complicated by the fact that the E.U., generally speaking, tries to put government contracts from within the E.U. but outside the country offer government contracts on an equal footing. But that does not, in general, prevent the government from nationalizing a good or service and making it an exclusively governmental function. The Postal Service is a governmental entity and/or regulated utility, so this would seem to be proper.\n\nIn the same vein, across Continental Europe, notaries public have transferrable, non\\-exclusive license to a particular territory in the country (that can be bought and sold between licensed notaries) and only a small number are allowed in any jurisdiction. Anyone who wants to do business transactions that require notaries must deal with one of them and in low population areas there may well be a monopoly.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is generally directed at preventing unregulated anti\\-competitive conduct by private firms.\n\nAlso, as noted in the original question, the use of means other than mail to cancel contracts isn't mandated, it is a choice of the parties in the context of laws that allow for alternatives. And, while the statutes disfavor electronic communications, the statutes do not, as a comment notes, state that contracts may not be terminated by a letter delivered by hand, signed in person and in presence, or delivered by another carrier providing traceability. The government post office means is presumably less expensive than a private courier providing hand delivery, but termination by hand delivery or courier of a signed dead tree paper letter appears to be allowed to cancel a contract without counter\\-party consent. So, it isn't a true monopoly.\n\nIn the same vein, the law does not mandate that apartment leases require payment of a security deposit, but the prevailing legal rules create an incentive that makes this practice very widespread.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under European Union law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the French government's policy on contract cancellations via postal service?\n\nA) The policy violates EU anti-monopoly laws because it creates an unfair advantage for the French postal service.\n\nB) The policy is legal because governments are generally allowed to award monopolies or establish nationalized services.\n\nC) The policy is illegal because it prevents free market competition in the communications sector.\n\nD) The policy violates EU regulations on equal footing for government contracts within the EU.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, governments are generally allowed to award monopolies or establish nationalized services without violating anti-trust laws. Anti-trust legislation is primarily directed at preventing anti-competitive conduct by private firms, not government entities or regulated utilities. The French postal service, being a governmental entity and/or regulated utility, falls under this exception. Additionally, while the policy may create barriers to digital cancellations, it does not constitute a true monopoly as alternatives (such as hand delivery or private couriers) are still legally permissible, even if less convenient or more expensive."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26741/what-is-the-type-of-a-contract-where-one-party-of-the-contract-promises-to-pay-i", "docs_id": 26741, "title": "What is the type of a contract where one party of the contract promises to pay in the future?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm searching for the name of a contract where one party of the contract promises to pay or perform in the future for monies, labor, goods, services etc. When Debtor receives what they want, all future repayments are null and void sort of like when Wimpy \"will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.\" I think the word begins with a p\\_\\_\\_\\_ contract.

And of an authority that recognizes and enforces such.\n\nHistorically, debtor\u2019s prisons with penal labor effectively enabled that in most countries, and which is still the practice in some.\n\nThe clearest rationale for the existence of such a right is in any country with a formal security classification system. A person holding a security clearance becomes subject to certain limits on their future actions, beyond that of that of the regular citizenry, which they cannot unilaterally remove even after leaving the position that required it. This appears to be quite close to contracting oneself into an indefinite, limited, servitude.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **NO** (mostly).\n\nServitude means that the employer, or owner of the indenture, or whatever, can use physical force to make the indentee carry out the work given.

If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third\\-party notices normally appear.\n\nSo if whoever is reusing your software is distributing the source code but without your name and copyright notice, it would seem that they are violating the license.\n\nYou mention a README file, but do not mention the NOTICE file which is listed in the Apache license. If you included a NOTICE file, and your software, or a modified version based on your software, is being distributed in object code form (only) without either a NOTICE file listing you, or a visible display by the program listing you, it would seem that they are violating the license.\n\nThe license specifically mentions a NOTICE file. It is not clear that attributions or restrictions in a README file will have the same effect. I would suggest that you add a NOTICE file to your distribution (if you did not already have one), and include one in any future distributions under this license.\n\nIf someone distributes a modified version of your software in object code format only, and you did not include a NOTICE file, it is not clear to me that the creator of the modified version must include **any** credit to you. However, the modified files must include a statement that they were modified from the original, and indicate who did so. Absence of that statement would also seem to be a violation of the license.\n\nIf it seems that the license has been violated, AND if you know or can find out who is distributing the modified version, you can send a letter (or email or other communication) indicating that the modified software is derived from your work, and should carry attribution to you. You could request or demand that they stop distributing copies that do not carry proper attribution. You may want to ask a lawyer to draft or review any such letter.\n\nIf the modified software is posted on a site subject to US law, you could send a DMCA takedown notice about the issue. This is fairly simple, and should not require a lawyer. However, if the other party files a counter\\-notice, the site could put the software back up if, after 10 days, you haven't filed a copyright infringement suit. Some sites restore challenged content quickly if a counter notice is filed, some just ignore counter\\-notices.\n\nUltimately, if the person does not restore proper credit voluntarily, and if a takedown is not available, or doesn't get the results you want, you would need to file a copyright infringement suit. To do this you would want to be sure that you have a good case. You would need to consider upfront costs and requirements, and possible damages should you win, to decide if it makes sense to file suit. Often it does **not** make economic sense. I would urge you to consult with a lawyer experienced in copyright issues before making a decision to file suit. Such a lawyer could help you estimate your chances of success, and the probable award if you win the suit. (Note that if all you are seeking is attribution, available damages may be limited, unless you can prove that lack of attribution harms you in a specific, economic way.) Such a lawyer could advise on needed pre\\-requisites (if you are in the US, you may need to register the work before filing suit).

If there was authorization, there would be no need to resort to the defense of fair use.\n\nThe article discusses the commercial use of short sections of musical works used for commercial purposes. It points out that the idea that any use of an excerpt of less than 30 seconds is permitted is a myth. In this it is correct. While the amount of a copyrighted work used is one of the four factors to be considered in deciding wither a use is a fair use, it is not the only one, and no specific amount is always permitted. In [*Harper \\& Row v. Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) The US Supreme Court held that quotes amounting to about 3\\-400 words from a 500\\-page book were an infringement, and were not a fair use, because they were the \"heart of the book\".\n\nThe linked article says that one should ask \"Was the work obtained from a legal source, in a lawful manner?\" and asserts that \"taking a copy from an unapproved source invalidates fair use.\" Nothing in 17 USC 107 says this, and I don't know of any authoritative source for such a statement. The article also says that \"Commercial, for\\-profit use is not fair use, while commentary or criticism may be.\" This is simply incorrect. While a commercial purpose tends to weigh against fair use, it does not preclude it, and commercial use has been held to be fair use in some cases. Even in the case of *Harper \\& Row v. Nation Enterprises* linked above, fair use was seriously considered, and was not denied simply because the use was commercial. No one o0f the four fair use factors is final taken alone. I do not think the linked article is a reliable guide to US copyright law.\n\nIn the case described by the question, an unreleased game has been distributed without authorization over the internet, and reviews written based on that unauthorized copy. Whoever copied the game committed copyright infringement, but a suit might not provide substantial damages unless actual economic harm could be demonstrated. (And, of course, the identity of the infringer would need to be proved.) But a review based on such a leaked copy would not necessarily be an infringement. If the review described the game, but did not quote any of its dialog or other text, and did not reproduce any sounds or images from the game, there would be no infringement. If the review did quote from the unauthorized copy, the usual fair use analysis would apply. The fact that the copy had been unauthorized would not determine the outcome.\n\nFair use is defined by [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). This provides:\n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use\n> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or\n> phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for\n> purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching\n> (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or\n> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether\n> the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the\n> factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use\n> is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to\n> the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of\n> the copyrighted work.\n> \n> \n> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of\n> fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above\n> factors.\n\nNote that criticism is one of the specified purposes for which fair use is designed, and an unpublished work is still subject to fair use. If the review quoted so much of the game that the potential market for it was harmed, that would weigh against fair use, but it is hard for me to see how a mere review could do that to an interactive game.\n\n(17 USC 107(4\\)) is normally applied when an infringing copy serves as a replacement for the authorized version, and sales are lost as a result. I suppose it might be argued that a bad review that was a direct result of an infringement came under this provision, but it is a strech at best, and US First Amendment considerations would tend to prevent such a ruling.\n\nIn short, it seems unlikely that any normal review would be an infringement, and that the game was leaked would not make it one.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer's unreleased video game is leaked on the internet.

Fair use is determined by analyzing four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the potential market. The fact that the review is based on an unauthorized copy doesn't automatically disqualify it from fair use protection. Similarly, being criticism doesn't automatically guarantee fair use protection. The unpublished status of the work is a factor to consider but doesn't bar a finding of fair use. A court would need to weigh all these factors to determine if the use qualifies as fair use."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55383/license-agreements-if-i-can-use-x-by-doing-y-can-i-use-x-without-doing-y", "docs_id": 55383, "title": "License agreements: if I can use X by doing Y, can I use X without doing Y?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: To hopefully make this question more clear, here is an example:\n\nSoftware company X creates software product Y under the freemium business model \u2014 the user of Y is allowed to use it at no cost with some restrictions, but must pay for extra features.\n\nIn the license, it is stated that by purchasing the extra features of Y, the user is allowed to use the extra features.

The documentation indicates that there are no publicly available operational guidance procedures for issuing 33D(2) notices. Instead, the decision to issue such a notice is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account various factors including the landlord's information, the occupiers' immigration status, and the public interest in terminating the agreement.

After that a mark may become incontestable, but even then prior use can be a defense to an infringement action.\n\nIt is a defense under [15 USC 1115](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1115)(b)(5\\):\n\n> That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an infringement was adopted without knowledge of the registrant\u2019s prior use and has been continuously used by such party or those in privity with him from a date prior to (A) the date of constructive use of the mark established pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title, (B) the registration of the mark under this chapter if the application for registration is filed before the effective date of the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, or (C) publication of the registered mark under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title: Provided, however, That this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which such continuous prior use is proved;\n\nRegistration furnishes evidence presumed to be valid under 15 USC 1115(a) that the mark registered is valid and the rights to it are owned by the registrant, (subject to any limitations listed in the registration, such as known concurrent use). This evidence can be overcome by proof of prior use, but the burden of proof is on the person who challenges the registration.\n\nIn short a later registrant could bring and win a suit if the earlier user could not prove contentious use from before the registration, but not otherwise.\n\nPrevious Use or Registration by Another\n---------------------------------------\n\n> Or am I only at risk of accidentally infringing an already\\-existing trademark (such as if I didn't conduct my trademark search correctly).\n\nIn that case you may be at risk. Use of a mark that is identical or confusingly similar to an existing mark, for the same category of goods or services, in the same market area is infringement. This is true even if the infringer was unaware of the other mark, although that may reduce the damages.\n\nRegistration is evidence of the ownership of the mark, and may be conclusive. It also acts as evidence that the infringer should have known of the mark, and makes \"innocent infringement\" harder to establish.\n\nBenefits of Registration\n------------------------\n\nRegistration forces a through and professional search for possibly conflicting trademarks. It establishes that such a search was done. It establishes that the registrant had no knowledge of any prior use of the mark, nor, could the USPTO find any.

John is personally responsible for addressing the lawsuit. This is because the contract was made with John as a self-employed individual before the formation of the LLC.
