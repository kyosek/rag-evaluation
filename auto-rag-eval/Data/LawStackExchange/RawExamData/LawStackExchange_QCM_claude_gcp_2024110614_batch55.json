But Person A has an online intimate relationship on an online service with Person B. Both persons conceal the relationship from each of their spouses.\n\nDuring the course of the long relationship a lot of intimate, incriminating personal information regarding Person A and Person A's spouse is revealed to Person B.\n\nPerson A decides to end the relationship, ghosting Person B.\n\nWhat legal repercussions might Person B get into if Person B copied every message onto a thumb drive or paper and gave them all to Person A's spouse?\n\nAssuming everything is true and correct and was copied without modification directly from the online service?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Extortion**\n\nB might be subject to prosecution for second\\-degree extortion, in Washington state. [RCW 9A.56\\.110](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.110) defines \"extortion\" as\n\n> knowingly to obtain or attempt to obtain by threat property or\n>  services of the owner, and specifically includes sexual favors\n\nand second\\-degree extortion relates to the nature of the threat \u2013 it includes \"To reveal any information sought to be concealed by the person threatened\". However, the prosecution would have to establish that B attempted to obtain something from A, which would presumably be the continuation of the relationship.\n\nUnder the comment\\-modified scenario where the spouse knows of the relationship, the threat would be to reveal whatever the criminal activity is that the A's are engaged in. In that case, there is a potential defense under [RCW 9A.56\\.130(2\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.130):\n\n> In any prosecution under this section based on a threat to accuse any\n>  person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against\n>  any person, it is a defense that the actor reasonably believed the\n>  threatened criminal charge to be true and that his or her sole purpose\n>  was to compel or induce the person threatened to take reasonable\n>  action to make good the wrong which was the subject of such threatened\n>  criminal charge.\n\nThe question then would be, how believable it would be that B's action was solely an attempt to get A to stop their criminal behavior? There is a path leading to a criminal conviction, but whether B is taken down that path depends on a lot of facts (and impressions) to be established at trial. Since A's spouse seems to know about the relationship and is unaffected by the information, giving over the thumb drive would not have any of the consequences outlined under the definition of \"threat\" in the law, such as revealing secrets, or harming a relationship. \n\n\"Threat\" is defined ([RCW 9A.04\\.110(27\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.110)) as \"to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent to...\" (list then follows, including \"do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person threatened or another with respect to his or her health, safety, business, financial condition, or personal relationships\"). That means that a threat is communicating an intent to do something: it is *not* doing the thing. In order to constitute a threat against A, B would have to communicate to A the intent to reveal, rather than just directly revealing. If we assume that that did not happen, the act would not fit the description of a threat.\n\n**Wiretapping**\n\nThere is also [Ch. 9\\.73](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73&full=true#9.73.030), which includes the \"wiretapping\" law. (RCW 9\\.73\\.030, labeled \"Intercepting, recording, or divulging private communication\"). Washington is an all\\-party consent state meaning that all parties have to consent to a recording. Since email is an electronic means of communication and that is all that is required to be within the scope of the law, it might seem that this could be a violation of the wiretapping law. Nevertheless, the law says that\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for\n>  any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or the state of\n>  Washington, its agencies, and political subdivisions to intercept, or\n>  record\n\nand notice that the word \"divulge\" is not included in the law. Both parties clearly know that the conversation is being \"recorded\". The section does eventually include \"divulging\" as a permitted (not prohibited) acts:\n\n> (4\\) An employee of any regularly published newspaper, magazine, wire\n>  service, radio station, or television station acting in the course of\n>  bona fide news gathering duties on a full\\-time or contractual or\n>  part\\-time basis, shall be deemed to have consent to record and divulge\n>  communications or conversations otherwise prohibited by this chapter\n>  if the consent is expressly given or if the recording or transmitting\n>  device is readily apparent or obvious to the speakers.\n\nThe section has a number of places where it is specified that one can legally divulge a communication, and nowhere does it prohibit divulging information (recording and intercepting are prohibited, but not divulging). Consequently, those parts of the statutes are without effect. In such a case, the courts are likely to re\\-interpret the wording of the statute so that it is sensible to talk about \"divulging\" (the court always find an intent underlying the words of a legislative body). It might then turn out that the court would find that the statutes also prohibit divulging without consent. One [local attorney](https://rhodeslegalgroup.com/recording-conversations-and-communications-in-washington/) claims that the law \"punishes you if you publish the recording\", without explaining the authority for that conclusion (anyhow, passing on a copy of the emails is not \"publishing\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An online intimate relationship between two married individuals, Person A and Person B, ends abruptly when Person A ghosts Person B. Person B, feeling scorned, considers revealing all the intimate messages to Person A's spouse. Which of the following legal scenarios is most likely to occur if Person B proceeds with this action in Washington state?\n\nA) Person B would be immediately guilty of second-degree extortion for revealing private information.\nB) Person B could face wiretapping charges for divulging electronic communications without consent.\nC) Person B might be prosecuted for extortion only if they first threatened to reveal the information to obtain something from Person A.\nD) Person B would be protected under free speech laws as long as the information shared is factual and unaltered.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires careful analysis of Washington state law regarding extortion and wiretapping. The key points are:\n\n1. Extortion: Under RCW 9A.56.110, extortion involves obtaining something by threat, including the threat to reveal concealed information. However, the mere act of revealing information doesn't constitute extortion without an attempt to obtain something.\n\n2. Threat definition: RCW 9A.04.110(27) defines a threat as communicating an intent to do something harmful, not the actual act of doing it.\n\n3. Wiretapping: While Washington is an all-party consent state for recording communications, the law (Ch. 9.73) doesn't explicitly prohibit divulging information that was willingly shared in the first place.\n\n4. Consent: Both parties were aware their communications were being recorded (stored) by the online service.\n\nOption A is incorrect because revealing information alone doesn't constitute extortion without a prior threat and attempt to obtain something. Option B is unlikely because the wiretapping law focuses on intercepting and recording, not divulging already shared information. Option D oversimplifies the legal complexities involved.\n\nOption C is the most accurate because it aligns with the legal definition of extortion in Washington. If Person B first threatened to reveal the information to compel Person A to continue the relationship or provide something else of value, that would fit the criteria for potential extortion charges. The act of revealing information itself, without prior threat or attempt to gain something, would not meet the legal threshold for extortion.\n\nThis question requires integrating multiple legal concepts, applying them to a real-world scenario, and distinguishing between similar but legally distinct actions."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84491/if-i-became-a-naturalized-uk-citizen-would-i-lose-my-irish-citizenship", "docs_id": 84491, "title": "If I became a naturalized UK citizen, would I lose my Irish citizenship?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was born in the United States, as were both of my parents.

(I don't care if I lose my US citizenship, but I am not willing to naturalize in the UK if it costs my me Irish citizenship)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In summary:\n\n1. Statute law allows Ireland to revoke your naturalisation on the grounds of acquiring another citizenship.\n2. But this law has recently been found unconstitutional.\n3. In practice, the government does not do this anyway.\n4. In the case of the UK, it is particularly unlikely.\n5. As an Irish citizen, there is no particular reason to pursue UK naturalisation.\n\nThe law\n-------\n\nAs of now, the possibility deprivation of Irish nationality for any reason is unclear, because of a ruling of the Supreme Court (*Damache v Minister for Justice* \\[2020] IESC 63\\) that declared the statute allowing for this to be unconstitutional. That was because the law (section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956\\) did not provide enough procedural safeguards. The Minister would initiate the process and make the final decision after expert advice, but was not an \"independent and impartial decision\\-maker\". It is now for the legislature to replace section 19 so as to cure the defect.\n\nUnder section 19, the grounds for revoking a certificate of naturalisation include:\n\n> (b) that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State\n\nand\n\n> (e) that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership, acquired another citizenship.\n\nThe issue in *Damache* was (b) following the appellant's conviction for terrorism offences in the United States. Regarding (e), it would seem on its face that acquiring UK nationality might trigger the possibility of revocation. However, in the scenario envisaged, that would leave you without any EU nationality, and in the *Tjebbes* case of 2019 (ECLI:EU:C:2019:189\\) the European Court of Justice found that such deprivation would only be possible after consideration of the specific consequences for the person concerned and their family. This point was not reached in *Damache* but would also tend to rule out any \"automatic\" loss of nationality; it would have to be the result of some longer and more involved process. Whatever replaces section 19 would have to be of this kind.\n\nSpecial considerations also apply if loss of Irish nationality would leave you stateless, but that is not the issue in question.\n\nThe policy\n----------\n\nAside from cases of immigration fraud and terrorism, the State has rarely initiated processes under section 19\\. In fact, official guidance on immigration and nationality admits a policy of dual nationality being allowed.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, there are many people who are dual British and Irish nationals. The understanding between the governments with respect to the Common Travel Area, the Good Friday Agreement, and the general historic situation, would make it very unlikely that Ireland would treat acquisition of British nationality as a problem. The British\\-Irish Agreement of 1998 includes that both governments respect the \"right to hold both British and Irish citizenship\" for the people of Northern Ireland. Even if you are not a person of Northern Ireland, any action by the government of Ireland that would be seen as potentially touching on this right is politically untenable.\n\nIrish citizens have full rights in the UK anyway\n------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder UK law, an Irish citizen can enter without a visa, live there as long as they want, get a job, claim benefits, vote in elections, be elected as an MP, and do everything that a UK citizen can normally do. There may be a vanishingly few exceptions for national security jobs.\n\nBecause of this, there isn't much reason why being naturalised in the UK would be worthwhile. You could do so for sentimental reasons but as far as the UK's concerned, you already hold a status that's just as good.\n\nExtra note: UK honours\n----------------------\n\n(In response to a comment below.)\n\nThe British Crown does grant honours, including knighthoods, to non\\-UK citizens and dual/multiple citizens, in some circumstances. It depends on whether the other nationality has King Charles III as head of state, and the attitude of the foreign government. Therefore, Canadians do not get knighthoods (Charles is King but the Canadian government would rather not), Belizians do (Charles is King and the government is fine with it), and Americans can get it as an honorary award that does not come with the Sir/Dame title.\n\nFor Ireland, Terry Wogan is an example of how this works. He was an Irish citizen who lived and worked in the UK for many years. In order to receive a British knighthood, he had to take up British citizenship (which was granted on an expedited basis), becoming Sir Terry. On the other hand, Bob Geldof is an Irish citizen (only) who holds an honorary British KBE, and is not formally entitled to be Sir Bob \\- much like American recipients such as Rudy Guiliani. The Irish government does not object to either possibility, although some individuals do.\n\nAn American\\-Irish\\-British triple citizen would be able to receive a UK knighthood and use the title Sir, assuming that the British government was willing to grant it, and unless there were some foreign legal blocker (e.g. the U.S. government does not allow federal officeholders to receive overseas decorations).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An individual with dual US-Irish citizenship is considering naturalization in the UK.

The Irish law (section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956) that previously allowed for revocation of citizenship upon acquiring another citizenship has been declared unconstitutional in the Damache v Minister for Justice case.\n\n2. Even before this ruling, the Irish government had a policy of rarely initiating processes to revoke citizenship for acquiring another nationality, especially in non-fraud, non-terrorism cases.\n\n3. The special relationship between Ireland and the UK, including the Common Travel Area and the Good Friday Agreement, makes it particularly unlikely that Ireland would take issue with an Irish citizen acquiring British nationality.\n\n4. The European Court of Justice ruling in the Tjebbes case suggests that any potential loss of EU citizenship (which would occur if Irish citizenship were revoked) would require careful consideration of the consequences for the individual.\n\n5. Irish citizens already enjoy extensive rights in the UK, nearly equivalent to those of UK citizens, making naturalization largely unnecessary from a practical standpoint.\n\nGiven these factors, the most likely outcome (C) is that the individual would retain their Irish citizenship with no practical changes to their rights. Options A and D are incorrect because automatic loss or required renunciation of Irish citizenship is not supported by current law or policy. Option B is also incorrect, as there's no indication that voting rights would be affected by acquiring UK citizenship.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze the likely outcome based on legal, policy, and practical considerations."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29558/who-is-responsible-for-posts-on-internet-forums-particularly-in-russia", "docs_id": 29558, "title": "Who is responsible for posts on Internet forums, particularly in Russia?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are users or is the site owner responsible for posts on the forum?\n\nCould it be different:\n\n* with or without a license agreement available on the site?\n* with or without a registration?\n\nMy concern is about Russian law primarily.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When users sign up for forums they agree to the site's terms.

As per Recital 32 of the GDPR, \"Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.\" Additionally, the European Data Protection Board guidance clearly states that \"The use of pre-ticked opt-in boxes is invalid under the GDPR.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because a pop-up confirmation doesn't negate the initial invalid consent from a pre-ticked box. Option C is problematic because it assumes GDPR only applies to EU users, which is not always the case, and could lead to compliance issues. Option D is incorrect because sending a confirmation email after registration doesn't address the fundamental issue of invalid consent at the point of data collection.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from GDPR (consent, affirmative action, pre-ticked boxes) and apply them to a business scenario, requiring critical thinking about compliance and user experience considerations."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82247/gdpr-blocking-eu-visitors", "docs_id": 82247, "title": "GDPR &amp; Blocking EU Visitors?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently chatted with a colleague who is preparing to launch a social networking and forum website which targets a relatively narrow audience (for discussion, let's say it is a dating site that solicits personal information to help find potential matches.)\n\nHe was primarily asking for my feedback on his technical design (which I provided), but I also noted he is planning to blacklist/block ALL connections from the EU due to GDPR regulation.

I posted another follow\\-up question:\n\n[Why is the onus for adhering to privacy directives (e.g. GDPR, CCPA, etc.) on a host and not the user?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82310/why-is-the-onus-for-adhering-to-privacy-directives-e-g-gdpr-ccpa-etc-on-a)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If GDPR applies, then no one can opt out. If it doesn't apply, then an IP block is superfluous.\n\nWhether GDPR applies is determined by Art 3 GDPR. For this, we must distinguish where the data controller is operating from. It is irrelevant where the site is hosted, but primarily relevant where the data controller (your colleague) has an \u201cestablishment\u201d, e.g. where he resides or typically works from.\n\n* Per Art 3(1\\), GDPR applies to all processing activities in the context of an European establishment, regardless of where the users are.\n\nSo if your colleague were running this site from Europe, they wouldn't be able to circumvent GDPR by blocking European users. However, if your colleague is running this site from outside of Europe, then Art 3(1\\) doesn't trigger.\n* Per Art 3(2\\), GDPR can apply to processing activities where there is no European establishment.\n\nThere is the Art 3(2\\)(a) \u201ctargeting criterion\u201d: if your colleague \u201coffers\u201d goods or services to people who are in Europe, regardless whether paid or gratis, then GDPR applies to all processing activities related to this offer. I'll discuss this more below.\n\nThere is also the Art 3(2\\)(b) criterion: if your colleague monitors the behaviour of people that occurs in Europe, then GDPR applies. For example, an app collecting geolocation information or a website creating interest profiles for ad targeting might trigger this criterion.\n\nAn IP block can help to establish that no offering/monitoring related to people who are in Europe is happening, but it might not be necessary.\n\nIt may be worth talking a bit more about the targeting criterion.\nThe GDPR explicitly says that mere availability of a website in Europe doesn't imply that GDPR would apply. Instead, it is necessary to establish the data controller's *intention* \u2013 are they soliciting users from Europe, or otherwise expecting that people from Europe might use those services? Recital 23 gives a couple of non\\-exhaustive factors that can be considered here, for example:\n\n* the site uses a language or currency used in the EU but not used in the controller's own country\n* the site mentions users or customers from Europe, e.g. in testimonials\n\nThis means that a lot of US websites, written in English or Spanish, only mentioning payment in USD (if any), not mentioning any European countries, will not be subject to GDPR.\n\nThen, occasional European visitors are irrelevant. It wouldn't be necessary to IP\\-block potential European users. However, such an IP\\-based block would help establish that the data controller really doesn't intend for those services to be offered to people who are in Europe. My personal opinion is that it's wasted effort to block users from foreign countries in case their foreign laws claim to apply, but if such a block brings peace of mind that might be worth it.\n\nWhile geoblocking might not be *necessary*, is it *sufficient*? There is no clear guidance on this subject, but it seems to be generally accepted that IP\\-based geoblocking is fine, even though it is trivially circumvented using VPN services. Of course, if a website were to block European IP addresses but were to also advertise that people in Europe can use their services via VPNs, that would probably still be an \u201coffer\u201d and might defeat the point of doing any geoblocking.\n\nThe Art 3(1\\)(a) targeting criterion is most easily applied to things like ecommerce where physical goods are shipped to the customer in return for payment \u2013 so essentially whenever the data controller participates in the EU Single Market. This is roughly similar to the concept of a Nexus in US tax law. But in principle the targeting criterion can also apply to other kinds of websites or apps such as blogs, even if they are gratis. GDPR does not just apply to for\\-profit commercial activity, and doesn't distinguish between controllers that are entities/LLCs and controllers who are natural persons.\n\nThings are slightly more complicated due to the Art 3(2\\)(b) monitoring criterion and the pervasive use of online trackers on websites, but this aspect of the GDPR is difficult to enforce and frequently ignored.\n\nIn this answer, \u201cEurope\u201d means the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), and the United Kingdom (UK).

Which of the following strategies would be most effective in achieving this goal while remaining legally sound?\n\nA) Implement a strict IP-based geoblocking for all EU countries and mention in the Terms of Service that EU users are prohibited\nB) Allow EU users but require them to explicitly waive their GDPR rights before creating an account\nC) Use English-only content, USD as the only currency, and avoid mentioning European users or customers in any marketing materials\nD) Host the platform exclusively on US-based servers and state that the service is intended only for US residents\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple GDPR concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer, C, is the most effective strategy because:\n\n1. It avoids triggering the \"targeting criterion\" in Art 3(2)(a) of GDPR. By using only English and USD, and not mentioning European users, the platform doesn't show an intention to offer services to people in the EU.\n\n2. Unlike option A, it doesn't unnecessarily restrict potential users or risk losing valuable EU traffic. The documentation states that \"occasional European visitors are irrelevant\" and IP-blocking is not necessary if the site isn't targeting EU users.\n\n3. Option B is incorrect because users cannot waive their GDPR rights; the regulation applies regardless of individual consent if the criteria are met.\n\n4. Option D is insufficient because the location of servers is irrelevant for GDPR applicability, and merely stating the intended audience doesn't prevent GDPR from applying if other factors suggest targeting EU users.\n\nThis strategy allows the startup to minimize GDPR compliance efforts while still potentially allowing EU users to access the platform, as long as the company doesn't actively target or monitor EU users' behavior.

However, they ultimately lost. As reported by [CDAS](https://cdas.com/einstein-publicity-rights-deemed-expired-by-california-federal-court/):\n\n> United States District Judge A. Howard Matz rejected Hebrew University\u2019s claim that New Jersey common law provides for an indefinite duration of the postmortem right of publicity, or that it alternatively is coextensive with copyright law and lasts for a minimum of 70 years after a person\u2019s death. Instead, the Court ruled that New Jersey common law postmortem publicity rights endure for no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. Because Einstein died in 1955, the Court\u2019s ruling means that Einstein\u2019s publicity rights are now in the public domain.\n\n...\n\n> Judge Matz concluded that the New Jersey Supreme Court would likely limit the postmortem right of publicity under New Jersey common law to endure no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. He noted that the New Jersey Legislature has twice declined to enact a statutory postmortem right of publicity, and given the sparse New Jersey case law on the issue, \u201cit is likely that the New Jersey Supreme Court would perceive pitfalls in allowing an unlimited or lengthy term to the right of publicity.\u201d Comparing the right of publicity to New Jersey\u2019s common law right of privacy, the Court recognized that 50 years was a \u201creasonable middle ground\u201d to allow a deceased celebrity\u2019s heir to benefit from the right of publicity, while still respecting the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in free expression.\u201d\n\n[*Mercury News*](https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/10/18/gms-use-of-einstein-image-tasteless-but-not-illegal-judge-says/) reported on the same case, saying:\n\n> But the judge said descendants\u2019 right to control someone\u2019s image after his death must be balanced with the public\u2019s right of expression.\n\n> He also ruled any right Hebrew University had to sue expired in 2005 \u2014 50 years after Einstein\u2019s death \u2014 because that was the limit on copyright law in 1982, when Hebrew University acquired Einstein\u2019s right of publicity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating an educational philosophy card game featuring both historical and contemporary philosophers.

In 1876, the second Sword Abolishment Edict followed, banning even former samurai from wearing swords in public. As a result, carrying swords in public became reserved for either current military or police personnel or a small select group of people that retained samurai status (mostly ex\\-daimyo).\n\nNowadays, carrying swords in public is regulated by the [Japanese Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_and_Sword_Possession_Control_Law) (\u9283\u5200\u6cd5\u5263\u985e\u6240\u6301\u7b49\u53d6\u7de0\u6cd5).

The correct answer, B, accurately reflects the complex legal evolution of sword possession laws in Japan. The 1876 Sword Abolishment Edict (Hait\u014drei) was not directly replaced by the 1958 Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law.

One of these explicit exceptions involves [Public Law 280](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Law_280), which grants certain states civil and criminal jurisdiction for certain matters that may involve Native Americans.

We're in Boulder County, Colorado.\n\nA representative from one of those construction companies pointed out some damage and offered to meet with the insurance adjuster, which he did. Our insurance company wrote us a check to cover some of the hail damage.\n\nAfter emphatically explaining how amazing his replacement windows are, he produced an iPad and asked me to \"sign\". I foolishly squiggled on the screen. Here's what it said:\n\n> * Quote is valid until ADD DATE HERE\n> * CCC has a \"no return policy\" on windows, doors, glass, and sashes.\n> * Project time line \\- Window delivery \\- 8 weeks, Prefinish work \\- 2\\-3 weeks, Install \\- 2 weeks.\n> * Standard Payment Terms are 50% down at time of order, 25% due upon delivery to CCC shop, and remainder due upon completion of work.\n> * Pricing based on payment by check or cash. 3% will be added for payment by credit card.\n> * If job cannot be completed (i.e. due to backordered items, remakes, etc) customer will be responsible for full payment for portion of job completed up to that point.\n> * If acceptable, please sign and return along with 50% down payment. Thank you!\n> * I confirm that my action here represents my electronic signature and is binding.\n\nAt the time I did not write him a check because I wanted to discuss the scope of the job with my wife. The windows in our house are a bit old, so it would make sense to replace them all at once, and not just the ones that sustained hail damage.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know much about windows (or the legal ramifications of squiggling on an iPad screen). That evening, as a sanity check, I looked at Google/Yelp reviews for the window make/model and saw that almost every review had the lowest possible rating. I reached out to the guy and explained that we could not move forward with his recommendation, and I asked him to quote products that rated highly in Consumer Reports, which he did.\n\nAt that time, he had not ordered any windows from his supplier, so things weren't yet set\\-in\\-stone (even though I had stupidly squiggled on the iPad). A few hours later, we received a quote that was almost twice the previous estimate. Because of the large amount of money at stake, I decided to get a second quote. His quote was 76% more expensive than Lowes for exactly the same product. In cash terms, Lowes was $10k cheaper.\n\nSo, regardless of the squiggle on the iPad, I decided *not* to move forward with the exorbitant quote. When I mentioned this, he sent me an email saying:\n\n> in order to break out of the contract we think it would be fair to charge for the time we have put into all of this. Heath ran the numbers and it came to $1,000\n\nSo, he knocked on our door, pointed out some damage, met with the insurance adjuster, (over) quoted the job, and is now asking for $1,000 (as a sort of \"inconvenience fee\"). Even though I screwed up by squiggling on the iPad, I think this is a somewhat predatory sales practice. From my perspective, he tried to rip me off and then sent me a bill for the trouble.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, is my position defensible? I did squiggle, after all.\n\nupdate\n------\n\nI took another peek at the electronic document I squiggled on and notice that it's in my wife's name. My name doesn't appear anywhere on the document. Presumably, I do not have the authority to sign legally binding documents on my wife's behalf. I wonder if that alone would invalidate the contract.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Like a paper signature in ink or blood, a finger squiggle is merely evidence that you have agreed to the terms of a contract. You have agreed, and now you are know the downside of that agreement. However, Colorado law gives you a special privilege to cancel certain contracts, and this may be one: [here is the law](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2017-title-05.pdf).

These are two core [ethical principles](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/news_pub_judicialconduct_Principles_en.pdf) set out by the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC). (However, the CJC is clear that these principles \"do not set out standards for defining judicial misconduct.\")\n\nDepending on what is leading the judge to such a high rate of appellate intervention, the underlying cause may warrant removal. The possible reasons that the CJC can recommend a judge to be removed are listed at [s. 65(2\\)(a) to (d) of the *Judges Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/j-1/page-10.html#h-337775):\n\n> Where, in the opinion of the Council, the judge in respect of whom an inquiry or investigation has been made has become incapacitated or disabled from the due execution of the office of judge by reason of\n> \n> \n> (a) age or infirmity,\n> \n> \n> (b) having been guilty of misconduct,\n> \n> \n> (c) having failed in the due execution of that office, or\n> \n> \n> (d) having been placed, by his or her conduct or otherwise, in a position incompatible with the due execution of that office,\n> \n> \n> the Council, in its report to the Minister under subsection (1\\), may recommend that the judge be removed from office.\n\nFor some examples where the CJC recommended removal of a judge, see:\n\n* the [Report to the Minister of Justice re: Paul Cosgrove (2009\\)](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/Report_to_Minister_Justice_Cosgrove.pdf) (in which the CJC declined to consider whether serious incompetence could be a ground for removal; instead basing the recommendation for removal on serious misconduct that was damaging to the administration of jusice and the public's confidence in the judiciary);\n* the [Report to the Minister of Justice re: Robin Camp (2017\\)](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/Camp_Docs/2017-03-08%20Report%20to%20Minister.pdf).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A Canadian judge has been overturned on appeal in 95% of their cases over the past year.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The extremely high reversal rate (95%) suggests a serious issue with the judge's performance, beyond mere differences in legal interpretation.\n\n2. The consistent citation of \"failure to properly apply legal principles\" indicates a potential failure in the due execution of the judge's office, which is one of the grounds for removal listed in s. 65(2)(c) of the Judges Act.\n\n3. The Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) has the authority to recommend removal of a judge if they have \"failed in the due execution of that office.\"\n\n4. While reversal rates alone may not be grounds for removal (as suggested in option C), this extreme case, combined with the specific reason for reversals, points to a more serious issue that the CJC would likely investigate.\n\n5.

I contacted (by phone) the insurance and they answered by email afterward:\n\n> We regret to inform you that your policy does not cover the loss reported to us.

Your insurance covers damage caused by fire, explosion, water damage or smoke. The \"premise\" is the place you're renting, and some examples of content that you are renting would be whatever furnishing came with the place, carpets, and curtains. By the written contract (based on their email summary), you are not covered for damage to rented carpeting owing to wine spillage. However, to be certain, you should look for the relevant portion of the contract to see if the language of the contract matches their conclusion about non\\-coverage. There is a tiny chance that the wording is actually ambiguous and they interpret the wording in a way favorable to them, but to make any progress if that is the case, you'd have to sue them, and hope that the court rules in your favor. \n\nOral amendments to contracts are sort of possible, but I think there is no chance that they would agree to your contention claim that that you have an oral modification of the contract. You would need to prove exactly what you asked and how they responded (something better than fervently maintaining that you asked X and they said Y because *nobody* actually remembers conversations verbatim from 2 years ago). Contracts usually have clauses saying that \"this contract is the whole contract\", explicitly denying that there can be oral amendments. This is a general rule for contracts in Canada: see [Gainers Inc. v.

The couple recalls being told verbally two years ago that such damage would be covered. What is the most appropriate course of action for the couple to pursue?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against Square One for breach of contract based on the verbal assurance\nB) Demand coverage based on the definition of \"premises\" in the insurance policy\nC) Review the exact policy wording and seek legal advice if ambiguities exist\nD) Report Square One to the insurance regulatory body for misleading sales practices\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of contract law and insurance practices. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The email from Square One cites a specific policy section (7.3.1 (e)) that apparently excludes coverage for this type of damage. However, the couple should verify this by examining the exact policy wording themselves.\n\n2. Oral amendments to contracts are generally not enforceable, especially when contracts typically include clauses stating that the written contract is the entire agreement. The case law cited (Gainers Inc. v. Pocklington Financial Corporation) supports this principle.\n\n3. There's a slim chance that the policy wording might be ambiguous. If so, seeking legal advice could help determine if there's a basis for challenging the insurer's interpretation.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because proving an oral modification from two years ago would be extremely difficult and likely unsuccessful given contract law principles.\n\n5.

His body of work would presumably fall under current copyright laws internationally, e.g. [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), etc. since all his compositions were published in the 20th Century.)\n\nFirst example:\n\n[Andr\u00e9 Previn](http://www.andre-previn.com/) conducts a studio performance of Shostakovich's [8th Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._8_%28Shostakovich%29) with the [London Symphony Orchestra](http://lso.co.uk/), recorded for EMI/Angel records. The record label [releases the album](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0013F46YW) for commercial sale.\n\n1. Does the composer receive any royalties from the sale of this recording?\n2.

This performance is presumably for a paying audience, of which the trio is expected to earn some performance royalties as a \"...life raft for the three of us.\"\n\n3. Does the composer receive any royalties from this particular performance? Or, from any contemporary public performance of his compositions still falling under copyright protection?\n4. If not from particular public performances, then is the composer's only source of royalties from publishing the written work (i.e. sheet music score)?\n\nPlease note that I'm using the present tense wherever I can here to inquire about how copyright protection and performance royalties work in the modern sense. I already have a *pretty* good idea (still unclear on some parts) how royalties work for contemporary popular rock/country/R\\&B music, etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All that has changed is the identity of the copyright holder which has passed on to other(s) through the relevant laws for inheritance.

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the complexity of the situation:\n\n1. The orchestra must pay performance royalties for the live concert, as the composition is still under copyright protection.\n2.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. Contracts are generally transferable without requiring agreement from both parties, unless explicitly prohibited in the contract or if it's a personal service contract.

To summarize, they imply that they would be legally protected from civil suits from former members who are being disciplined. Would this actually work?

Church of Christ](https://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/1989/10494.html), plaintiff withdrew from the church after an internal investigation of her conduct. The church apparently held as a matter of religious doctrine that she must repent of her sins, also that withdrawing from the church is doctrinally impossible. The transgressions were widely publicized within the church; a lawsuit over outrage and invasion of privacy ensued. The upshot of the appeal is that the church can be held liable for post\\-withdrawal actions, but before that, the church has a privilege to communicate such transgressions (the church is not subject to secular judicature of its actions w.r.t. its members).\n\nContract law is not relevant here, what matters is that a person can knowingly and intelligently waive their right to litigate against a party, and while one is a member of the church which has such a waiver as part of their disciplinary doctrine, one cannot sue the church for its doctrinary actions as long as the actions do not constitute a threat to public safety which would justify state interference. Although the church argued that church membership is irrevocable, the court found that \"Just as freedom to worship is protected by the First Amendment, so also is the liberty to recede from one's religious allegiance\". Given that plaintiff had withdrawn consent yet the church subsequently announced the transgressions without her consent, the church was thus found to be liable.\n\nIn [Stepek v. Doe](https://casetext.com/case/stepek-v-doe), the court similarly affirmed that a church enjoys a privilege against charges of defamation, when the plaintiff continues to operate within the church, not having left the church.\n\nSo it can \"work\", to some extent. The person can always withdraw consent; the person has no legal recourse in case consent has not been withdrawn.

Church of Christ case. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Guinn case established that churches have a privilege to communicate transgressions of members while they are part of the church, based on religious freedom principles.\n\n2. However, the court also affirmed that individuals have the right to withdraw from religious affiliations, stating \"Just as freedom to worship is protected by the First Amendment, so also is the liberty to recede from one's religious allegiance.\"\n\n3.

This question tests the application of IRS regulations in a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts. The IRS requires reporting the total amount paid to a contractor, regardless of how that contractor then allocates the funds. In this case, even though $80,000 was passed through to foreign entities, the entire $150,000 was paid to the lawyer, who is responsible for reporting their own expenses.\n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially illegal, as it underreports the total payment made to the contractor. Option B misunderstands the purpose of the 1099-NEC, which is to report payments to the contractor, not to itemize the company's expenses. Option D incorrectly assumes that payments can be split across different forms based on their end use.\n\nThis scenario highlights the importance of accurate reporting, the relationship between the company and its contractors, and the principle that the full amount paid to a contractor must be reported, regardless of how that contractor then uses the funds.

The most likely scenario by far.\n* There was a security breach on the **site of the game company**, either revealing your credentials or allowing direct access.\n* There was an accidental software bug on the site of the game company which affected your inventory.\n* There was a deliberate software change on the site of the game company which affected your inventory, e.g. to improve play balance.\n\nThe latter three options are all *possible*, but the first option happens much more frequently.

Option C is the most prudent approach because:\n\n1. Accepting the offer \"with reservation\" preserves your right to pursue further legal action. This is critical, as simply accepting the offer could be construed as a new agreement, potentially nullifying your claim to the original terms.\n\n2. By explicitly documenting your reservation of rights, you create evidence that you did not intend to waive your claim to the full amount.\n\n3.

It avoids the higher costs and time investment of going directly to civil court (as in option B), while still keeping that as a future possibility if needed.\n\n5. Unlike option A, it doesn't risk the judge ruling that by accepting the offer without reservation, you've forfeited your right to the remainder.\n\n6.

The organization is quite informal. Although it has many regular meetings, all these meetings are open to the public. As such, most of those who attend, even many regular attendees, are not officially registered members of the organization.\n\nThe organization would like to keep track of those who attend for follow\\-up purposes. I have three related questions about what the GDPR permits. In the first two cases, the organization does not make any formal announcement that it is tracking the attendance of whom attends. (However, attendance numbers are occasionally mentioned informally, so it is not a secret, either.)\n\nFirst, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to take a count of how many people attend without recording any names? In this case, the organization groups the counts by the general age (child, teenager, or adult) and gender (male or female) of the attendees, but no names are recorded. These attendance numbers are shared among the organization members and are occasionally announced to all meeting attendees. (I would think that this is authorized.)\n\nSecond, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to record the attendees by name, including their general age and gender as mentioned above? The names are obtained through informal contact with the attendees during meetings; attendees are never explicitly asked if they want their attendance recorded. These attendance lists with names are shared only among organization members on follow\\-up committees. (This is the main case that I have questions about under the GDPR.)\n\nThird, in case either or both of the above cases are not authorized under the GDPR, is there any legal way that attendance by name can be recorded and shared among designated organization members? The primary hesitation to formally requesting authorization is that the organization wants attendance records to be as accurate as possible and if some attendees do not grant authorization, then the records will never be accurate. I have heard that one way to accomplish this would be to verbally announce at the beginning of each meeting that attendance is recorded, or to conspicuously post a written notice to this effect at the entrance. Would either of these fulfill GDPR obligations? Or is there an alternative solution?\n\nIn any answer, I would appreciate it if you could cite specific relevant sections of the GDPR so that I can learn the law better.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The scope of the GDPR is entered when personal data is being processed in a structured manner.\n\nPersonal data is any information relating to identifiable data subjects (definition in Art 4(1\\)). \"Peter attended the meeting on the 14th\" is personal data. \"That woman with the blue handbag said she wanted to return on the 25th\" is personal data. However, aggregate statistics do not relate to individuals, and are typically not personal data. \"On the 14th, we had 25 attendees\" is not personal data.\n\nNot all use of personal data is within the scope of the GDPR. For example, the GDPR would not apply if two organizers talk about who attended the meeting. However, Art 2(1\\) says the GDPR applies when personal data\n\n* is processed wholly or partially with automated means (e.g. computers, smartphones), or\n* forms a filing system or is intended for a filing system (e.g. keeping notes on attendees, keeping attendance lists)\n\nIf GDPR applies, the organization would be responsible for ensuring compliance with its rules and principles, summarized in Art 5\\. Primarily, this means:\n\n* having a clear purpose for processing\n* selecting a suitable Art 6 legal basis for that purpose (e.g. *consent* or a *legitimate interest*)\n* only processing the minimum data necessary for achieving that purpose\n* determining and implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of the processing activities\n* preparing for data subject rights, in particular by providing an Art 13 privacy notice when collecting data from the data subjects\n\nThere are of course some complexities in the details. When the legal basis is \"consent\" (opt\\-in), the organization would have to ensure that this consent was freely given and sufficiently informed. Per Art 7(4\\), consent would not be freely given if that consent was a condition for access to the meeting. Using \"legitimate interest\" (opt\\-out) can be more flexible, but it requires performing a balancing test to show that the legitimate interest isn't outweighed by the data subjects' interests, rights, and freedoms. Roughly, relying on a legitimate interest is appropriate when the data subjects can reasonably expect the processing activity to occur.\n\nRegarding **point 1**, keeping general counts and aggregate statistics about attendees is probably OK since it wouldn't be personal data. If you are very conscientious about this, you could round all counts and use categories like \"0\\-4 attendees, 5\\-9 attendees\" for each facet, which makes it more difficult to make inferences about individuals. But the fundamental point is that all your data should relate to attendees as a whole, never to individuals.\n\nRegarding **point 2 and 3**, this is a question of legal basis. Since you gather names through informal conversations, I think that attendees would be weirded out if they learned that you kept detailed records on their attendance. So I think that you probably wouldn't have a legitimate interest here. However, being upfront with this and offering an opt\\-out could change this.\n\nOn the aspect of keeping detailed notes on data from informal conversations, I'd like to point out H\\&M's EUR 35 million fine back in 2020 (summary on [GDPRHub.eu](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=HmbBfDI_-_H%26M)). In a callcenter, managers used to have conversations with employees. These conversations touched on anything from vacation experiences to health problems, marriage problems, and religious beliefs. All of that is fine. What was not fine is that the managers went full Stasi and kept detailed notes about all of this on a shared drive and used that information for management decisions. This went on until a configuration error made those files accessible to all employees. This violated all the points in the basic compliance process outlined above: the records had no clear purpose, no suitable legal basis, contained way more data than necessary (and even Art 9 special categories of data like information on health or religious beliefs which have extra protection), did not have appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, and did not fulfill data subject rights like the Art 13 right to be informed.\n\nIn case this non\\-profit is a church or religious organization that had its own comprehensive data protection rules before the GDPR came into force in 2018, those can continue to apply per Art 91\\. This could probably address some issues of legal basis, but cannot circumvent the GDPR's general principles.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small non-profit organization holding public meetings wants to keep attendance records.

It is also common for foreign attorneys to take the New York bar exam \\- several thousand people do that each year \\- in which case they have a springboard to appear *pro hac vice* in other states. The NY exam is well\\-understood in this way, in terms of training and support that might be offered in the country of origin. But one\\-off appearances, particularly by in\\-house counsel, also take place routinely.\n\nMany states, including California, also have a category of \"foreign legal consultant\", someone who is retained to advise on the law of the specific foreign jurisdiction in question, but who isn't allowed to appear in court.\n\nIn the current version of the California Rules of Court, *pro hac vice* is covered in [Rule 9\\.40](https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=nine&linkid=rule9_40). On its face, this rule only applies to attorneys who are \"eligible to practice before the bar of any United States court or the highest court in any state, territory, or insular possession of the United States\". There is a broad exception in 9\\.40(h),\n\n> This rule does not preclude the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal from permitting argument in a particular case from a person who is not a licensee of the State Bar, but who is licensed to practice in another jurisdiction and who possesses special expertise in the particular field affected by the proceeding.\n\n\"Another jurisdiction\" is not facially limited to U.S jurisdictions, so it may be that the higher state courts could admit a foreign attorney. I do not know of an example either way.\n\nIn general, California's licensing requirements for lawyers have often been strictly interpreted. The State Bar Act (Business and Professions Code, 6000\\-6243\\) says that:\n\n> No person shall practice law in California unless the person is an active licensee of the State Bar.\n\nAn attorney appearing *pro hac vice* is temporarily registered with the State Bar once their application has been approved by the court. This general licensing regime, which aims to protect the public against dishonest or incompetent practitioners, has been held (e.g. in *Birbrower v. Superior Court* 17 Cal. 4th 119 (1998\\)) to imply\n\n> a strong public policy favoring the practice of law in California by licensed State Bar members.\n\nOccasional admission *pro hac vice* does not extend to doing regular legal work of other kinds, including giving legal advice, preparing documents, and so on \\- and certainly not to maintaining a permanent physical office in California, or advertising to the public. If you would like to do those things then the state would like you to take their own bar exam, in which case (if you pass!) you are in the same situation as any other California lawyer.\n\nThere is a fairly recent exception for international commercial arbitration (*not* applicable to normal arbitration about things like disputes over personal property). The Code of Civil Procedure, 1297\\.185, now says that if you are a\n\n> member of a recognized legal profession in a foreign jurisdiction, the members of which are admitted or otherwise authorized to practice as attorneys or counselors at law or the equivalent,\n\nand meet various other conditions, then you can participate in arbitration work on a \"fly in, fly out\" (FIFO) basis. You don't need to register or pay a fee. (But, per 1297\\.187, you still need *pro hac vice* permission to appear as counsel in an actual court.)

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Rule 9.40 generally doesn't apply to foreign attorneys not licensed in U.S. jurisdictions, eliminating option A.\n2.

In that context, saying lewd and suggestive things about the courier whom a member employs over a poker game with the people who run all of her main stops in connection with her job might have a causal nexus for harassment case purposes with her job, effectively enlisting everyone she has to do business with in her job in a campaign of harassment against her.\n\nIn contrast, suppose that someone who is engaging in iffy conduct that doesn't quite cross the line of harassment at work towards this courier goes to that Pessimists Club meeting and targets his crass comments not at the courier but his ex\\-girlfriend towards whom he has engaged in lots of harassing conduct. His comments about his ex\\-girlfriend would not have a causal nexus to the courier's workplace and probably wouldn't be something that could be considered to determine if he was engaged in workplace harassment. This would be true even though small town gossip made his harassment of his ex\\-girlfriend common knowledge which make the courier take otherwise ambiguous conduct from him much more seriously knowing his modus operandi and capacity for escalating the situation.\n\nBut, ultimately, one has to make a rather holistic evaluation of the entire situation to determine if there is a causal nexus or not between non\\-workplace behavior and alleged workplace harassment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A senior manager at a large corporation frequently attends local community events where he encounters several of his subordinates.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the explanation provided in the documentation that there isn't a bright line dividing personal behavior that does or doesn't constitute a causal nexus for harassment. \n\nThe manager's actions at the community event, while occurring outside of work, could potentially be considered to have a causal nexus to workplace harassment if combined with related conduct in the workplace.

I'm wondering how judges decide what is \"reasonable\" when the way the law is written is so subjective . \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judges do not decide, jurors do (however, if a judge is the fact\\-finder, then the judge makes such a determination). The main input that the decision\\-maker gets is a jury instruction. In order to unify \"reasonable doubt\", \"reasonable price\", \"reasonable delay\" and so on, appeal is often made a mythical being, \"the reasonable man\", so reasonable force would be the degree of force the reasonable man would use in a given situation. I will draw from California criminal instructions ('cuz I have them) but similar instructions can be found across jurisdictions. For example, one instructions says \"A natural and probable consequence is one that a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes\". Or from a negligence instruction \"A reasonable person would have known that acting in that\nway would create such a risk\". More detailed appeal to The Reasonable Person is found in the justified homicide instruction:\n\n> Defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and (he/she) must have\n>  acted only because of that belief. The defendant is only entitled to\n>  use that amount of force that a reasonable person would believe is\n>  necessary in the same situation. If the defendant used more force than\n>  was reasonable, the \\[attempted] killing was not justified.\n> \n> \n> When deciding whether the defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable,\n>  consider all the circumstances as they were known to and appeared to\n>  the defendant and consider what a reasonable person in a similar\n>  situation with similar knowledge would have believed. If the\n>  defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have\n>  actually existed.\n> \n> \n> The defendant\u2019s belief that (he/she/ \\[or] someone else) was threatened\n>  may be reasonable even if (he/she) relied on information that was not\n>  true. However, the defendant must actually and reasonably have\n>  believed that the information was true.\n\nThere is no explanation of what it means to be \"a reasonable person\". Since nobody believes that they themselves are unreasonable, a simple and also wrong way of judging the matter is to subjectively judge whether *you yourself* would do the same thing, if you were in that situation. \n\nVery often, instructions do not even bother to say what \"reasonable\" means, so (re interpreting expert testimony) \"You may disregard any opinion that you find unbelievable, unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence\"; (re *corpus delicti*) \"That other evidence may be slight and need only be enough to\nsupport a reasonable inference that a crime was committed\"; \"Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to find the\ndefendant guilty, you must be convinced that the only reasonable\nconclusion supported by the circumstantial evidence is that the\ndefendant is guilty\", \"when considering circumstantial evidence, you must accept only reasonable conclusions and reject any that are unreasonable\"\n\nThe closest the law has come to articulating an objective characterization of \"reasonableness\" is in \"reasonable doubt\" instructions. One characterization is in [People v. Feldman, 71 N.E. 2d 433](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1293&context=faculty). \n\n> It is not a doubt based upon sympathy or a whim or prejudice or bias\n>  or a caprice, or a sentimentality, or upon a reluctance of a\n>  weak\\-kneed, timid, jellyfish of a juror who is seeking to avoid the\n>  performance of a disagreeable duty, namely, to convict another human\n>  being of the commission of a serious crime\n\nA somewhat improved characterization is the Calcrim instruction\n\n> Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an\n>  abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not\n>  eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to\n>  some possible or imaginary doubt\n\nThere is room for improvement, but it points in the right direction.\n\nOn rare occasions, a law is written that actually includes a definition. [The Gas Price Spike Act HR 3784](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3784/text) said\n\n> The term \u2018reasonable profit\u2019 means the amount determined by the\n>  Reasonable Profits Board to be a reasonable profit on the sale.\n\nIt is then up to the board to subjectively determine what that profit is. (BTW this did not become law). \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nIt's actually very difficult to determine what reasoning judges use in those cases where they are the determiners of fact.

The following is only as an \"example.\"\n\nIf you set up an LLC in the Seychelles, you could, in theory, avoid American tax by accruing income there. In practice, if you did nothing but \"banking\" in the Seychelles, America would look at your lack of \"value added\" there, and could tax you on Seychelles income as if your corporation was American.\n\nThe way to make such a claim stick (typically in a place like Ireland), is to set up a manufacturing or operating facility (e.g. call center) there so that you were shipping goods or services from your offshore operation.

The real person sues the author, and during discovery, finds private emails confirming the character was indeed based on them. Prior to the lawsuit, no one except the author had made the connection between the character and the real person.

A partition fence is one built on or near the property line that is owned jointly by the owners of the properties it divides.\n\nA fence near the property line is probably a partition fence if:\n\n* The two property owners jointly built or paid for the building of the fence;\n* Parts of the fence are on each side of the property line;\n* The owners have agreed that the fence is common property; or\n* Both owners \"use\" the fence, as by connecting it to another fence running in a different direction, or by relying on it to contain domestic animals.\n\nA Fence is probably not a partition fence if:\n\n* It is entirely clear of the property line;\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests maintains it; and\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests uses it.\n\nThe owner of one of the properties may not remove, demolish, or modify a partition fence without permission from the other. Removing or modifying a partition fence without the permission of the owner of the adjacent property is a tort, and can lead to damages for the value of the fence begin awarded.\n\nThe owners must each maintain a partition fence, often each caring for his or her side. Failing to do so may be a tort.\n\nIf a fence is not a partition fence, the owner of the land is also the sole owner of the fence, and may modify or remove it without permission from, or notice to, the owner of any adjacent or nearby property.\n\nHowever, the above common\\-law rules may be modified by local laws, and one would be wise to check, or consult a lawyer who knows how to check, before making any demands.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The page [\"Removal or Destruction of Fences\"](https://fences.uslegal.com/removal-or-destruction-of-fences/) from US legal reads:\n\n> A fence is an enclosure creating an adequate blockade around a particular land for the purpose of prohibiting intrusions from outside. A landowner can remove a fence, separating his/her land from that of his/her neighbor, when such fence is located wholly upon his/her own land. However, a landowner is not empowered to remove a partition fence without the adjacent landowner\u2019s consent. A partition fence is the joint property of adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> A fence erected on the line between the lands of adjoining owners generally belongs to the parties as tenants in common. Generally, a partition fence is built equally on both sides of the line. Until the contrary is shown, the partition fence is presumed to be the common property of both owners. An owner of adjoining land can remove a partition fence upon formal notice to adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> For an improper removal of a partition fence, an aggrieved party can bring an action for damages. The standard for measuring damages for such removal or destruction is its value at the time. The value is determined by replacement costs minus depreciation for age and use. Moreover, when someone builds a fence on another person\u2019s land without any authority to do so, the landowner can remove or destroy such fence. A person is liable for removing, destroying, or injuring a fence belonging to another person just as one who commits such acts against any kind of property belonging to another is liable\\[i]. Such person is considered a tortfeasor. However, an individual cannot remove or destroy a fence on another individual\u2019s land without his/her consent.\n\n* The page [\"Property Line and Fence Laws in Maryland\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/maryland-law/property-line-and-fence-laws-in-maryland.html) from FindLaw reads, in relevant part:\n\n> Maryland doesn't have specific rules dealing with fences. Instead, the state follows the common law practice that a fence built along a boundary line is owned in common by both property owners when both use the fence, unless otherwise agreed. A property owner is said to use a fence when they \"hook\\-up\" to the fence with another row of fence, or keep animals in the enclosure created by the fence. A fence built and used only by the builder is that person's sole property. When you purchase a new home, you take a property with an existing fence built and used by prior owners. Simply put, if you buy a property with a co\\-owned fence, you likely need to continue your maintenance of the fence.\n\n* The page [\"Is it legal for the neighbor to remove a fence on our shared property line?\"](https://answers.justia.com/question/2019/05/28/is-it-legal-for-the-neighbor-to-remove-a-693710) from Justia's \"Ask a Lawyer\" feature reads:\n\n> If both landowners paid to install a fence directly on a property line in the past, then yes, they need your permission to remove or replace the fence. Many fences are not built on a property line, but are instead just on one property or the other.\n> \n> \n> If you have had your land surveyed, you may be able to determine your exact property line. You or your neighbor are free to build new fences without permission as long as neither the fence nor any construction or excavation encroaches on the other's property.\n> \n> \n> Fences are a common property dispute, and can have long term effects. If a fence encroaches significantly on someone else's land for many years, this can actually become the new legal property line in some cases.\n\nAccording to the \"Fences\" section of the page [\"Disputes between your neighbours\"](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/for-the-public/common-legal-issues/disputes-between-your-neighbours/) from th New Zealand Law Society:\n\nIn New Zealand this is regulated by the Fencing Act 1978\\. Except where modified by individual agreements:\n\n> * Fences must be on the boundary line, though there is provision for give and take where the true boundary is difficult to fence.\n> * The cost of building or repairing a fence is borne equally between adjoining owners, unless one owner damages it, in which case the cost of repairs will fall on that owner.\n> * You can compel your neighbour to contribute to the cost of the fence bordering your two properties by following the procedures set out in the Fencing Act ...\n> * Developers of new subdivisions usually exempt themselves from contributing to the cost of a fence.\n> * Under the Property Law Act 2007, it is possible to apply to a District Court for an order to remove or alter a fence that is detrimentally affecting land or obstructing a view. Usually the cost of any removal falls on the person applying for the order.\n\n* The Booklet [\"Fences and the Law](https://Flsc.sa.gov.au/resources/FencesandtheLawBooklet.pdf) from the Legal Services Commission, South Australia states, on page 2:\n\n> Fences should be regarded as a joint\n> asset between neighbours.

According to the common law rules outlined in the documentation, a fence is likely to be considered a partition fence if it is built on or near the property line and both owners \"use\" the fence, such as by relying on it to contain domestic animals. In this case, both neighbors have been using the fence to keep their dogs in their yards, and it's located directly on the property line.\n\nThe doctrine states that partition fences are owned jointly by the owners of the properties it divides. Importantly, \"the owner of one of the properties may not remove, demolish, or modify a partition fence without permission from the other.\" Removing a partition fence without permission is considered a tort and can lead to damages.\n\nOption A (Adverse possession) is incorrect because this situation doesn't involve one party claiming ownership of the other's property through long-term use. Option B (Easement by estoppel) is not directly relevant as this doesn't involve a right to use another's property.

Is there any law suggesting that such an inference *should* or *should not* be made?\n\n(Interested in common law jurisdictions; U.S. in particular.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Silence itself does not generally imply consent, but in the context of a history of transacting, silence in the face of continued actions by the other side can indicate consent. Here's a fun little example (*Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd.*, [\\[1964] S.C.R. 614](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1964/1964canlii88/1964canlii88.pdf)).\n\nThe plaintiff was a tug boat company who was providing tug services for the defendant who operated an oil refinery. The large crude oil tankers coming into the refinery needed tug guidance and the plaintiff provided this. There was an undisputed verbal acceptance of a written offer for services from June 13, 1961 to July 13, 1961\\. The agreement was expressly extended twice, each for two weeks, into August 1961\\. No further authorization for extension was made.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff continued to provide tug service for the incoming tankers and continued sending monthly invoices to the defendant until February 1962\\. The defendant did not pay and denied liability for all charges after the middle of August 1961\\.\n\nThe trial judge said:\n\n> I find that the defendant knew that the *Ocean Rockswift* continued after August 1, 1961, in commission on call to assist and did assist the large tankers during the period in question, and that the plaintiff expected payment on a rental basis for its being kept in commission. The defendant had ample opportunity to notify the plaintiff that it did not accept any liability on that basis, but did not do so. **The defendant acquiesced in the tug being so employed**.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada quoted from Anson on Contracts:\n\n> So if A allows B to work for him under such circumstances that no reasonable man would suppose that B meant to do the work for nothing, A will be liable to pay for it. The doing of the work is the offer; the permission to do it, or the acquiescence in its being done, constitutes the acceptance.\n\nAnd from Williston on Contracts:\n\n> Silence may be so deceptive that it may become necessary for one who receives beneficial services to speak in order to escape the inference of a promise to pay for them.\n\nBut the Supreme Court of Canada clarified:\n\n> ... mere failure to disown responsibility to pay compensation for services rendered is not of itself always enough to bind the person who has the benefit of those services. The circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.\n\n---\n\nThis answer shows how silence can play a role from a pure common law contract perspective, without considering equitable principles.

Alice presents emails she sent to Bob stating agreed rates and work completed. Bob claims he never agreed to these terms but cannot produce any contemporaneous objections. Given the legal principle of \"qui tacet consentire videtur\" (silence implies consent), how should a judge or jury interpret Bob's lack of objection at the time?\n\nA) Bob's silence should be interpreted as definitive proof of consent, automatically ruling in Alice's favor.\nB) Bob's silence is irrelevant and should be disregarded entirely in the court's decision-making process.\nC) Bob's silence can be considered as one piece of evidence suggesting possible consent, but must be weighed against other factors and circumstances.\nD) Bob's silence legally absolves him of any responsibility, as he had no obligation to respond to Alice's emails.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct interpretation aligns with the nuanced view presented in the documentation. While silence alone does not definitively imply consent in legal matters, it can be a factor considered by the court. The Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in the Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd. case provides guidance here. The court stated that \"the circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.\"\n\nIn this scenario, Bob's lack of contemporaneous objection to Alice's emails about rates and work completed could be seen as acquiescence under certain circumstances. However, it's not automatically conclusive. The court would need to consider the full context of their business relationship, any prior agreements, industry norms, and other relevant factors.\n\nOption A is too absolute, as silence is not definitive proof of consent. Option B incorrectly suggests that silence is completely irrelevant, which contradicts the legal principle that silence can sometimes play a role in inferring consent.

Paragraph 15 states that rent increases are not allowed if notice is not given at least 5 days before the 60-day move-out notice deadline (which the landlord failed to meet).\n3. Paragraph 15 also indicates that the lease continues month-to-month with increased rent or changes when proper notice is given.\n4. The landlord's late notice (Sept 14) doesn't allow for immediate rent increase, but it does serve as notice for future months.\n\nTherefore, the tenant can stay at the original rent for one month (Nov 17 - Dec 16) due to the landlord's late notice. However, the increase would take effect from Dec 17, as by then, the landlord's notice will have been in effect for more than the required 65 days (5 days before the 60-day notice period).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the landlord's failure to provide timely notice. Option B overstates the tenant's rights, as the late notice doesn't permanently invalidate increases.

If you own a hotel with a water slide in the US, you pay through the nose for insurance because it's practically a given that at some point, there will be an accident, someone will get hurt, and you will likely get sued over it regardless of whose fault it may have been. That's why the few that do have water slides have limited hours and charge you extra to use it. The slides always empty into a special pool or at least a roped\\-off area in the main pool that is off\\-limits to regular swimmers. There is usually a lifeguard posted to shoo people toward the exit so that the pool is clear for the next rider. There are also signs *everywhere* warning swimmers about how dangerous it can be. This is just the kind of thing Americans expect to see at a water park.\n\nWhat was peculiar to me is that the slides I encountered in Canada generally just emptied right into the main pool where other people are swimming. There were no lifeguards, few warning signs, and they were free to use as long as the pool was open. I used them a few times and you come out of them pretty fast. Very fun, but I thought it was strange that it was entirely up to me and my wife to keep our kids away from the slide so they didn't get hit by people coming down (which I'm fine with by the way \\-\\- it's called *parenting* and I'm totally OK with that).\n\nMy point is that it's a common criticism in America that we are a sue\\-happy country where we just expect that there will be a lawsuit when somebody gets hurt, whereas in Canada I got the distinct impression that people are fully expected to take their own personal responsibility to not be stupid around the water slide.\n\nIs this impression correct? Are Canadians less litigious than Americans are? If so, why?

This is implemented by many organisations (eg. [cifas](https://www.cifas.org.uk/dsar)) by requiring the subject to provide documents such as photo id (driving license or passport) and one from a list of documents of which I only have a bank statement.\n\nThese documents contain a lot of personal information that I THINK the organisation does not have and I do not want to provide without good reason.

What can a data subject do to prevent further distribution of PII when trying to access data from a potentially untrustworthy data controller? Is there actually a solution that both provides for data security for the subject and verification of identify to the data controller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe GDPR requires data controllers (DCs) to exercise reasonable care when responding to an access, modification, or deletion request, to ensure that it comes from the actual Data Subject (person whose data is involved, here a DS). The GDPR does not specify just what methods must or may be used to ensure that an access (or other) request comes from the DS. It does say, in Article 12, that \"additional information\" may be requested from the DS by the DC for this purpose that is \"necessary to confirm the identity\" of the DS.\n\nIf a DC receives data for identification purposes, it must be used only for those purposes, and retained no longer than needed.\n\nPersonal Data (PD) in general must be limited according to article 5, so that data is used only for the purposes it was collected for, retained for no longer than needed, adn appropriately secured against unauthorized use or access. The DC is responsible for adhering to these limitations. Recitals 57, 59, and 77 (quoted below) confirm this, and discuss identification.\n\nIf a DC violates these restrictions, it is subject to the same enforcement as it would be for violating any other GDPR provision.\n\nIf a DS thinks the data requested to support identification of the DS is excessive, the DS may first complain to the DC, and then to the relevant supervisory authority if the response from the DC is not acceptable (allow at least 1 month for a response). But perhaps knowing that the GDPR forbids the DC from distributing or using this data except for the purpose it was collected, that is, to identify the DS, and from retaining it longer than need be, might offer some reassurance.\n\nA DS could also ask the DC what is the minimum data needed for identification, and redact data beyond this. The DC might need more than name and address, but not all that is on a bank statement or other ID document.\n\nGDPR Sources\n------------\n\n[Article 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) (section 6\\) of the GDPR reads:\n\n> Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\n\nThat includes access requests.\n\nParagraph 1 of [Article 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/) reads:\n\n> If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.\n\nParagraph 1(b) of [article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) specifies that personal data shall be :\n\n> collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;\n\nParagraph 1(c) of art 5 specifies that such data shall be:\n\n> limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ...\n\nParagraph 1(e) of art 5 specifies that such data shall be;\n\n> kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for **no longer than is necessary** for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; \\[emphasis added]\n\nParagraph 1(f) of art 5 further specifies that such data shall be:\n\n> processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing\n\n[Recital 59](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-59/) reads:\n\n> Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object.

But all these patterns are at least derivative of the original work. But in fact, they *full encode* the message, only in a different format, and are reversible.

They provide a tool with legitimate uses, such as transmitting messages in a secure way. Encoded files inside other images are for example used by journalists to get files out of oppressive regimes. The liability araises only at the user who uses it illegally.\n\n> But if so, would it then make a difference if the offline program decodes the file into system RAM only, and not to a file on disk?\n\nNo. Think about an ISO file. ISO files are 1:1 copies of how a CD is written. They can be burned 1:1 onto a CD without any extra preparation, which is their legitimate use: be easy to distribute and verify copies of for example installation files. ISO files can also be mounted in a virtual CD drive, which emulates a CD drive.\n\nIf you legitimately got the Windows ISO from Microsoft (or a licensed retailer) directly, you can mount it or burn it, or use it for all legitimate purposes.

The user who encoded and uploaded the copyrighted movie is clearly liable for copyright infringement, as they created an unauthorized copy of the work, regardless of its encoded form. The act of encoding does not negate the fact that it's a full copy of the original work, just in a different format.\n\nEnd users who download and decode the image are also potentially liable for copyright infringement. By decoding the image, they are creating a copy of the copyrighted work on their devices. The fact that they may not have known the content was copyrighted before decoding doesn't necessarily absolve them of liability, especially if they retain the decoded file.\n\nThe software developer, however, is likely not liable in this scenario. The program itself has legitimate uses (such as secure communication) and isn't specifically designed for copyright infringement. This is similar to how creators of file-sharing software or encryption tools aren't typically held liable for how users choose to employ their products.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overlooks the potential liability of end users. Option B incorrectly places primary liability on the software developer. Option D is incorrect because the encoded nature of the work doesn't negate copyright protection or liability.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple concepts from copyright law, including derivative works, copying, and the responsibilities of various parties in a complex technological scenario.

This is separate from the copyright on a recording of a performance of the work.\n\nIf you reuse a musical passage, the new work may be a *derivative work*, that is a work based on an earlier work. Or an extended musical quotation could be considered to be copyright infringement.\n\nIf this is in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the use of a section from a previous work **might** be considered to be a *fair use* ([fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\")). This is a specifically US concept in copyright law, although several other countries have a concept of *fair dealing* which is somewhat similar, although narrower.\n\nWhether a use is a fair use is an inherently fact\\-based determination. There is no clear and simple bright line for what is and is not a fair use. US law ([17 USC 197](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107)) specifies four factors which are to be weighed by a court in considering the matter:\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use**. If your use is commercial that weighs against fair use, but does not at all preclude it. This factor also includes whether the use is *transformative* or not. A transformative use is one that takes the part used for a very different sort of purpose than the original. Parodies are normally transformative, for example. A quote for purposes of commentary and analysis, or criticism is normally transformative. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work**. Creative works such as fiction and *music* are more strongly protected than works such as textbooks and news stories. This probably weighs against fair use in the case described.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole**. If only a short section of a longer work is used, that weighs in favor of fair use. However very short quotes can still fail, to be held to be fair uses. In [*Harper vs Nation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) a quote of about 300 words from a 500 page book was held not to be fair use because it was \"the heart of the book\".\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** A use that significantly harms the market value of the original, or serves as a replacement for it, weigh strongly against fair use. This was a major factor in *Harper vs Nation*.\n\nEach case of claimed fair use is evaluated by looking at all four factors, and the specific facts of the case.\n\nFrom the description in the question, such a use might well be held to be fair use. Musical quotations often are. But there is no way to be sure unless a court evaluates the specific case. A lawyer specifically experienced in not only copyright law, but copyrights on music, might be able to give more specific advice.\n\nOr you could, of course, seek permission from the copyright holder, quite likely the original composer or artist. If you get permission, there is no further issue. There might be a charge, but when the use is minor, and has no commercial effect, the charge might be small or even zero provided that the source is acknowledged.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A musician wants to incorporate a distinctive riff from a popular song into their own composition, significantly altering it and using it in a completely different context. Which of the following factors would most strongly support a claim of fair use in this scenario?\n\nA) The musician plans to use the riff in a commercial recording\nB) The original song is a well-known creative work\nC) The riff is considered the \"heart\" of the original song\nD) The new composition transforms the riff's purpose and character\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of fair use in copyright law, particularly as it applies to musical compositions. The correct answer is D because the transformative nature of the use is a key factor in determining fair use. \n\nAccording to the documentation, the first factor in fair use analysis is \"The purpose and character of the use.\" It specifically mentions that transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses. The question describes a scenario where the musician is \"significantly altering\" the riff and using it in a \"completely different context,\" which aligns with the concept of transformative use.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while commercial use can weigh against fair use, it doesn't preclude it entirely and is less significant than the transformative aspect in this scenario.\n\nOption B is actually a point against fair use. The documentation states that creative works like music are more strongly protected, making this factor weigh against fair use.\n\nOption C is also incorrect. If the riff is considered the \"heart\" of the original song, this would likely weigh against fair use, similar to the Harper vs Nation case mentioned in the documentation.\n\nOption D best represents a factor that would support a fair use claim, as it focuses on the transformative nature of the new work, which is a key consideration in fair use analysis, especially for artistic and creative works.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from copyright law and fair use doctrine, applying them to a specific musical scenario, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of analysis and application."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46998/how-can-nasa-images-videos-not-be-copyrighted", "docs_id": 46998, "title": "How Can NASA Images/Videos Not Be Copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> NASA content \\- images, audio, video, and computer files used in the rendition of 3\\-dimensional models, such as texture maps and polygon data in any format \\- generally are not copyrighted.\n\n* <https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html>\n\nAren't works automatically protected by copyright upon creation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a special exception in [17 USC 105](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105):\n\n> Copyright protection under this title is not available for any work of\n>  the United States Government, but the United States Government is not\n>  precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by\n>  assignment, bequest, or otherwise.\n\nIn the [definitions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101),\n\n> A \u201cwork of the United States Government\u201d is a work prepared by an\n>  officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that\n>  person\u2019s official duties.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A private space exploration company wants to use NASA's high-resolution images of Mars in their promotional materials and virtual reality simulations.

Of course this doesn't affect an organization in Uruguay, but it's very clear that such an Uruguyan entity is not the FSF that wrote the GPL.\n\nThe interesting questions is what happens if the FSF is dissolved.

They already know the contents of the email, because they are either the sender or the receiver, so the only additional information the tracking pixel gives them is the timestamp of your access to the email.\n\nYou could perhaps stop this by instructing your browser or other email program not to download images, or to prompt you for permission on each image.\n\nSince the Irish company you are doing business with is in the EU (and you are also), the GDPR should apply. Thus they ought to have a lawful basis to process any personal data (PD) relating to you under GDPR [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/). Under \\[Article 13], when a Data Controller (DC) obtains Personal Data (PD) from the data subject, it is supposed to notify the subject that it has done so, and provide certain information to the subject. Article 13 paragraph 1 states:\n\n> Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:\n> \n> \n> * (a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller\u2019s representative;\n> * (b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;\n> * (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;\n> * (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1\\), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;\n> * (e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;\n> * (f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1\\), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.\n\nArticle 13 paragraph 2 states:\n\n> In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:\n\n> * (a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n> * (b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;\n> * (c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 9(2\\) \\[consent], the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\n> * (d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n> * (e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;\n> * (f) the existence of automated decision\\-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1\\) and (4\\) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\nNote that the DC need not provide this information if the DS already has it. It might be buried in a long ToS document or privacy policy.\n\nThere is a somewhat similar set of information, albeit different in detail, to be provided under [Article 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) when the DC obtains PD from a third party. The obligation under article 14 does not apply when the DS already has the information, when it is impossible or unreasonably hard to comply, or in any of several other conditions.\n\nYou could request of the Irish DC that they supply you with the information required under article 13 or 14\\. You could make the same request of the \"third party company\" but they are probably acting as a Data Processor (DP) in which case the obligation is on the DC.\n\nYou could also make a data access request under [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) winch states:\n\n> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:\n\nThis is followed by a list of the details to be provided by the DC.\n\n> 2. Can the third\\-party, which is based in the UK, collect this data\n\nIf the third\\-party is acting as a Data Processor, in accordance with a contract with the DC, they have to same right to collect the information as the DC would have if the DC did this directly, and must abide by the same restrictions, They may share this data with the DC, and with others only at the DC's direction, for which direction the DC is responsible.\n\nUnder [article 27](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-27-gdpr/) a Processor not established in the EU must appoint a representative within the EU to with requests and complaints may be addressed.

Indeed many countries will permit the student to vote by absentee ballot during the period of study.\n\nUnless the student has done something that the laws of the birth country consider to be a reason for losing voting rights or citizenship, there is no issue here. No such thing is mentioned in the question as it now stands. Indeed since the question asks about the student acquiring dual citizenship, it implies that the student has retained citizenship in the birth country, and so presumably voting rights there. The motive suggested for dual citizenship thus does not seem to make sense.\n\nTo acquire citizenship in the country of study the student would need to go through whatever process that country's laws specify. In most countries that includes a statement of intention to remain permanently in that country, and some evidence supporting that intention. The process is also likely to take rather longer than a typical course of graduate study. It is unusual for a student to gain citizenship in a country of study while still a student. It is still more unusual for a student to gain such citizenship and then return, not for just a visit, to the student's birth country.\n\nSome countries allow people being naturalized to retain citizenship in another country, some do not. Some countries allow a person who gains citizenship in another country to retain his or her birth citizenship, others do not.\n\nIf the country of study permits migrants to retain another citizenship while being naturalized, and the birth country permits a citizen to retain citizenship while being naturalized elsewhere, **and**, the student complies with the laws of the country of study for gaining its citizenship, then the student will have obtained dual citizenship. This is unusual, but it is perfectly possible if the laws om the countries involved permit it, and a good many do. But obtaining citizenship in a new country with which one had no previous connection is generally not a simple or quick process.\n\nNow, if one of the student's parents had been a citizen of the country of study, then the student might be able to obtain citizenship there by inheritance.

The correct answer is D because it's the only scenario that could realistically result in dual citizenship given the information provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because applying for U.S. citizenship typically requires a longer period of residence and an intention to remain in the U.S. permanently, which conflicts with the student's plan to return to India.\n\nOption B is implausible because U.S. citizenship generally cannot be applied for remotely, and living in India for 5 years would likely disqualify the student from U.S. naturalization.\n\nOption C is a common misconception. Marrying a U.S. citizen doesn't automatically confer citizenship, especially if the student is leaving the U.S.\n\nOption D is correct because some countries, including the U.S., allow citizenship by descent. If one of the student's parents was a U.S. citizen at the time of the student's birth, the student might be eligible for U.S. citizenship regardless of their place of birth or residence. This aligns with the documentation's statement: \"if one of the student's parents had been a citizen of the country of study, then the student might be able to obtain citizenship there by inheritance.\"\n\nThis scenario would allow the student to potentially claim U.S. citizenship while retaining their Indian citizenship, assuming India permits dual citizenship in this case.

Streaming services purchase licenses to distribute music, but these licenses typically don't extend to creating derivative works or using the music in interactive media like games. \n\nThe correct answer (A) reflects this limitation. Streaming services lack the specific rights to allow their music to be used in games, which would require additional licensing for derivative works.\n\nOption B is incorrect because antitrust laws aren't directly relevant to this licensing issue. \n\nOption C is incorrect because using streamed music in a game wouldn't likely qualify as fair use, especially in a commercial context. \n\nOption D, while partially true, doesn't capture the core legal issue.

Graduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana\\-Champagne had their union recognized when the Illinois Court of Appeals held that they were entitled to unionize under state laws related to public employees' unions. This was one of the first cases to successfully recognize a graduate student's union after a long lull in campuses organizing.\n\nThe Wikipedia article claims that this was a 2002 decision (this could be the date that the University and the union [reached an agreement](https://www.uigeo.org/2002/06/) ([stipulations](https://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/AHR/Stipulations.pdf)) regarding who was covered by the union), but the case in question appears to be *Graduate Employees Org. v.

Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer is using Google's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service to generate audio files for their application.

The correct answer is C because it directly violates the terms stated in the documentation. Specifically, the terms prohibit using the Services to \"create, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) a similar or competing product or service.\"\n\nOption A (public performance) and B (selling the app with cached audio) are not explicitly prohibited. The terms suggest that the generated content belongs to the customer, stating \"Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data and the Application or Project.\" This implies that using the generated audio in performances or as part of a sold app would likely be permitted.\n\nOption D (exceeding free tier limits) would require payment but is not a violation of the terms of service. It's a normal progression from free to paid usage.\n\nThe distractors represent common misconceptions:\n- A and B test the understanding of intellectual property rights for generated content.\n- D tests knowledge of service tiers and pricing, which is relevant but not the most serious issue.\n\nThis question assesses the ability to interpret legal terms, understand their implications for real-world application development, and identify the most significant restrictions in a complex set of guidelines."}, "72": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85412/subject-to-clause-on-the-warranty-deed", "docs_id": 85412, "title": "&quot;subject to&quot; clause on the warranty deed", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the effect of the following language on the deed?\n\n> subject to all permitted exceptions raised in the title commitment ABC\n\nHere, title commitment ABC is the title commitment associated with the transaction.\n\nIn the area of the transaction, the customary practice for title insurance is that a title commitment with broad standard exceptions is first issued.

The correct answer is C because the clause \"subject to all permitted exceptions raised in the title commitment ABC\" creates a potential gap in coverage between what's in the initial title commitment and what's ultimately covered by the extended coverage policy.\n\nThe documentation states that the title commitment typically has more exceptions than the later-issued extended coverage policy. By making the deed \"subject to all permitted exceptions\" in the initial commitment, the seller is potentially creating a loophole where claims that would have been removed in the extended coverage policy might still be valid against the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the clause doesn't prevent obtaining title insurance; it just potentially limits its effectiveness.

This is not unusual with professional or managerial workers.\n\nHowever, even where both employer and employee might acknowledge this as the reality in a particular case, the courts tend to reject this analysis as too complicated and uncertain to adjudicate upon.\n\nInstead, the courts impose law upon the parties, holding that the primary obligation for which a salaried worker is remunerated are the hours of attendance, and a \"day's pay\" is reckoned accordingly.\n\nEmployers are free to use salaries as an alternative to hourly pay or per\\-diems, but when pro\\-rating disputes come to be adjudicated by the law, the employers have a clear understanding for how the calculation will be performed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based company is restructuring and needs to terminate several employees who work 5 days a week (Monday to Friday).

(I'm not trying to defame or slander people or use the images in a negative light.)\n\nRelated if they say no but I've already taken a picture of them, is there any legal action they can take against me, if I do post it, or even have the image but never use it? (I wouldn't do this out of politeness but I'm curious. I'm also not trying to harass them for a picture after if they say no.) In a more general sense, do people who either know they are being photographed and pose for the camera or are indifferent to the camera have the same legal actions after their picture is taken, that is to saw a person may like their picture but later on realize they don't want to be in an article?\n\nIn the above cases, all images posted are NOT for commercial use and again are used for blogging or related purposes only.\n\nRelated\n-------\n\n* [Do people generally have the right not to be photographed on private property?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/660)\n* [How do laws affect photography of non\\-humans in public when people may be in the frame?(AU)](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/659)\n* [Is it legal to post a photograph that I captured of a stranger in the street?(AU)](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3540)\n* [Model release for image without faces(AU)](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4617)\n* [What are the legal repercussions of taking a stranger's picture in public?(US)](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/247)\n* [What is considered \u201cpublic\u201d in the context of taking videos or audio recordings?(CA)](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1369)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S., you can legally photograph anything you want that is visible from the public.

Which of the following best describes the legal situation and ethical considerations?\n\nA) The photographer has no legal obligation to remove the image, but may consider doing so as a courtesy.\nB) The subject has a right to privacy that supersedes the photographer's rights, requiring immediate image removal.\nC) The photographer must obtain written consent before publishing any identifiable images, regardless of the event's public nature.\nD) The subject can pursue legal action for emotional distress if the image remains published against their wishes.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. In the U.S., there is generally no expectation of privacy in public spaces, as stated in the documentation: \"people should not expect any privacy rights, when out in public.\"\n\n2. The documentation explicitly states: \"If you take photos of someone and it's not for commercial use, you can do anything you want with them.\" This applies to the scenario of using images in a non-commercial blog.\n\n3.

(Or at least you couldn't find any...)\n\nYou need to name all the defendants on the front page of your superior court complaint (including Doe defendants and people under a DBA or with a fictitious business name or a once business now forfeited, suspended or dissolved etc.).\n\nWhen naming actual businesses, it looks something like this: \"ONE ROUND PEACH, INC., dba PEACH, a corporation\" or \"TWO SMALL CHERRIES, LLC, dba CHERRIES, a limited liability company\", or in the case of Doe defendants, for example, simply put at the end \"and DOES 1 through x, inclusive\" where \"x\" is whatever number of Doe defendants are referenced in the complaint or may be referenced in the future.\n\nFor e.g.:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FY2vT.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FY2vT.png)\n\nHow does a defendant look like among the named defendants of the first page here who you only know by their DBA or fictitious name or they don't even have anything else?\n\nMaybe \"dba S.H. LONG BANANA, a fictitious business\" or what is the best practice? *What's the spiel?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, one quick bit of terminology. The top of the front page of a summons and of a legal complaint (which also usually appears at the top of the front page of every other document filed in a case, although sometimes in abbreviated form) in a civil lawsuit is called the **caption** of the case.\n\nSecond, it doesn't sound to me like the business is \"fictitious\". If it truly didn't exist, you wouldn't be suing it, because you could never serve anyone associated with it with process and couldn't collect or enforce a judgment against anyone if you won the lawsuit.\n\nInstead, it is fair to assume that there is a real business that someone or some group of people conduct business under that has a certain name, which isn't registered with the Secretary of State or other appropriate official in the state in which you are bringing suit, or in any other state known to you.\n\nSuppose that that name under which business was conducted by this firm was \" S.H. LONG BANANA\".\n\nYou could sue **\"S.H. LONG BANANA, a business doing business in California that is not registered with the Secretary of State in the State of California.\"** or simply **\"S.H. LONG BANANA\".**\n\nThis would be agnostic over whether it is a sole proprietorship operating under a trade name not registered in California, a general partnership, an unregistered trust doing business under an unregistered trade name, or an unincorporated nonprofit association, or formally formed entity registered in another state that is doing business in California without authorization to do so.\n\nAn unregistered business owned and conducted by one person is, by default, a sole proprietorship unless some other business form is registered, or there is a trust conducting business through its trustee.\n\nA group of two or more people who conduct a business for profit that is not registered is by default a general partnership.\n\nA group of two or more people who conduct the affairs of an unregistered organizations not for profit, are by default an unincorporated association.\n\nAlso, your inability to find a registration of an entity in the State of California means that an entity is not authorized to do business in the State of California, but does not not mean that it isn't registered as a corporation, limited liability company, non\\-profit corporation, cooperative, limited partnership association, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability limited partnership, or some other kind of entity (e.g. a GmbH under German law) in some other jurisdiction unknown to you.\n\nIt isn't that uncommon for a business from another state to fail to register with the state as a foreign business operating in the state. The main penalty for a foreign business not registering in a state is that it isn't allowed to bring lawsuits in that state's courts until it is registered.\n\nIf you know that one or more of the principals is James Wyn (a name I chose from a character in a work of fiction lest I defame anyone), you might instead, or in addition, sue **\"James Wyn, dba S.H. LONG BANNANA\".**\n\nUsually, you are going to need at least one natural person to sue so that you can deliver a summons and complaint to that person.\n\nIf you aren't close to the statute of limitations, you may be able to sue that natural person who you can identify, get preliminary disclosures or discovery, and then amend your complaint to state the true defendants.\n\nThe Racketeering and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) also recognizes the possibility of bringing suit against a group of people who comprise a *de facto* criminal enterprise, and you could look at examples of how lawsuits brought under that statute (which authorizes private civil causes of action as well as criminal charges) in that manner are captioned.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner, Sarah, is planning to sue a company she believes has been infringing on her intellectual property.

LONG BANANA, a business doing business in California that is not registered with the Secretary of State in the State of California.'\" This format is the most precise and legally sound way to describe an entity that exists and conducts business but lacks official registration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the business isn't truly \"fictitious\" - it exists and operates, even if not officially registered. Option B is problematic because it assumes a corporate structure without evidence. Option D, using \"DOES,\" is typically reserved for unknown parties, which doesn't apply here since we know the business name.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding of business entity types, registration requirements, and legal naming conventions in lawsuits.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Suing in small claims court is the most appropriate legal recourse for recovering a relatively small amount of money owed. It's mentioned directly in the documentation as the recommended course of action.\n\n2. Filing a fraud complaint (option A) is not appropriate because this is a civil matter, not criminal fraud.

What is the situation in the USA? Should I split my question into two questions, one asking about EU and the other one about USA?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, nothing that you describe is clearly a parody. Parody is different from making a reference or allusion to another work or including an homage to another work. As a good rule of thumb it is very hard to parody something that is already in the light/comedy genre, and simply reimagining someone else's work in a new context is not a parody. Instead, a parody generally makes a point that the author of the original work would find unpleasant or distasteful rather than being honored by it. The main point of the parody exception is that the targets of it would rarely consent to let you use their works for that purpose.\n\nSecond of all, you don't have a \"right\" to do anything of these things. Almost everything you describe is a derivative work which infringes a known copyright. The question is whether you have a defense to the claim of infringement.\n\nThe things that you describe may or may not be fair use. The fair use defense to a claim of derivative work copyright infringement is something that is evaluated in a rich factual context on a case by case basis, usually enriched by testimony from expert witnesses regarding what is commonly accepted and not accepted as permissible in this context and genre. Nothing you suggest is 100% certain to escape infringement liability, and nothing you suggest is 100% certain to be infringing. You are in a gray area and you are rolling the dice.\n\nIn addition to the \"fair use\" defense, you might also be able to resort to the \"scene a faire\" doctrine which states that elements of a work which would otherwise be infringing are permissible if they are pervasive conventions of a genre of work.\n\nFor example, the fact that your dark stormy castle in a gothic horror work looks like every other dark stormy castle in the genre, because that is what \"gothic horror works\" do, is a defense to a derivative work infringement claim. \n\nSimilarly, lots of standard cord progressions in popular music in a song you wrote would be protected by this doctrine. \n\nTo the extent that works in the genre you are creating in are almost always awash with references to other works in the genre, this would be a helpful boost to your argument that a defense would apply to your infringement of a derivative work because \"fair use\" is a matter of community custom and standards.\n\nOn the other hand, to the extent that you go beyond mere references to other works in the genre and instead are really just writing fan fiction, you are probably infringing and the fair use defense would not apply.\n\nIf you were sued you could probably not be able to get the case resolved one way or the other without a full presentation of all of the relevant facts by both sides in the case. These examples would not be amenable to summary resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, on the merits, I think that there is a good case to be made in each of the examples that you identify that it is a \"scene a faire\" or is \"fair use\". But, you have to understand that you are appealing to community indulgence of technically illegal activity, rather than truly doing so as a matter of \"right\" which is not a helpful way to think about what you are doing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An independent game developer is creating a fantasy role-playing game and wants to include several pop culture references and homages to other works.

The correct answer, B, is most likely to be considered fair use because it involves a brief reference to another work without directly copying substantial elements. This aligns with the \"scene a faire\" doctrine mentioned in the documentation, where common genre elements or brief references are more permissible.\n\nOption A, while attempting to parody a well-known character, may be too close to the original and could be seen as creating a derivative work. Option C involves direct copying of substantial dialogue, which would likely infringe copyright. Option D, recreating exact replicas of copyrighted characters, would almost certainly be considered copyright infringement.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking about the nuances of fair use and copyright law in creative works, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation such as derivative works, fair use defense, and the \"scene a faire\" doctrine.

Which of the following outcomes is most likely based on current U.S. federal law?\n\nA) The business owner will be found guilty of discrimination because political affiliation is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act.\n\nB) The business owner will win the case as refusing service based on political beliefs is protected under the First Amendment.\n\nC) The case will be dismissed as political affiliation is not a federally protected class, but the business owner may face penalties under state law.\n\nD) The court will rule in favor of the Democratic Party, citing the precedent set by Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Political affiliation is not listed among the federally protected classes mentioned in the documentation. Unlike race, religion, sex, or national origin, political beliefs are not covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or other federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\n2. While the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and assembly, it doesn't explicitly grant businesses the right to refuse service based on political beliefs. The amendment primarily restricts government action, not private business decisions.\n\n3. The case would likely be dismissed at the federal level due to lack of statutory grounds, as political affiliation is not a protected class under federal law.\n\n4. However, some states or localities may have laws that extend protection to political affiliation. This is why the business owner may still face penalties under state law, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\n5. The Masterpiece Cakeshop case involved sexual orientation, which is interpreted as part of the protected class of \"sex\" by the EEOC. This case is not directly applicable to political affiliation discrimination.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of knowledge about protected classes, the limitations of First Amendment protections, and the distinction between federal and state laws.

I'm trying to figure out in which state I can vote. I was born in Pennsylvania and lived there until the age of 21, then moved to Maryland for 4 years, then I was a graduate student in New Jersey for a little over a year, and then I moved abroad. So New Jersey was the last state in which I lived in the US, but I don't really consider myself a New Jerseyan; I have much stronger ties to Pennsylvania or even Maryland.\n\nThe website [www.votefromabroad.com](https://www.votefromabroad.org/faqs/15) gives the following advice on the matter:\n\n> As U.S. citizen living abroad, your voting address is usually your\n>  last residence address in the U.S.\\-\\- but if you have new or strong\n>  ties to another state, you may be able to vote there. It is up to the\n>  Local Election Official (LEO) to determine whether to accept your\n>  voter registration application. You can explain your situation to your\n>  Local Election Official (contact information here) and ask what their\n>  decision would be, or you can try to submit the Federal Post Card\n>  Application (FPCA)\u2013which you can produce here\u2013and see if it is\n>  accepted.\n\nSo I took their advice, sent in my Federal Post Card Application in order to vote in Pennsylvania, and it was accepted, and I should be receiving some \"balloting materials\" in the mail. So does this mean it's legal for me to use these balloting materials to vote in Pennsylvania as long as I don't vote in any other state?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This website](https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/additional-info) from the Federal Voting Assistance Program gives a good overview. As it says, \"Your voting residence is your address in the State in which you were last domiciled, immediately prior to leaving the United States.\"\n\nLaws about domicile vary from state to state, and sometimes for different purposes; in one state, the law about domicile for state income tax might be worded differently than the law about domicile for getting a driver license. The general idea is it is the place you intend as your permanent home, and intend to return to when you are temporarily absent.\n\nSo if, while you were in Maryland, you thought of it as a temporary absence from Pennsylvania, then Pennsylvania was still your domicile. Likewise for New Jersey. And since it's about your intent, if you tell all the government officials you encounter or correspond with that even on your last day in New Jersey, you always intended to return to Pennsylvania, the government would be hard\\-pressed to prove otherwise.\n\nKeep in mind that whichever place in the US was your last domicile is now your voting residence. It may be that the place is no longer your domicile. Reasons why it may not be your domicile could be that you now intend to stay in your current overseas home permanently. Or perhaps the US place has been torn down and an office building built on the site.\n\nA voting residence is a different concept from a domicile, because if you move permanently overseas, you might not be entitled to a US driver license, you probably don't have to pay income tax to any state\\*, but you're always entitled to vote in US elections.\n\n\\*You still have to file US income tax returns, and possibly pay tax.\n\nAs the web page linked above mentions, a person who never lived in a state may not be able to vote in federal elections, because the people elected in federal elections, like representatives, senators, and electors of the electoral college, all represent a particular place.

They have lived in Pennsylvania until age 21, Maryland for 4 years, and New Jersey for a little over a year before moving abroad. Their Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to vote in Pennsylvania was accepted.

The documentation states that for U.S. citizens living abroad, their voting address is usually their last residence address in the U.S. However, it also mentions that strong ties to another state may allow voting there.\n\n2. The concept of domicile is crucial here. As explained in the answer, domicile is based on the individual's intent to return to a place as their permanent home. If the person always intended to return to Pennsylvania, even while living in Maryland and New Jersey, Pennsylvania could still be considered their domicile.\n\n3. The acceptance of their FPCA by Pennsylvania officials indicates that the state has recognized their right to vote there.\n\n4. Once established, a voting residence remains valid for overseas voters, even if it's no longer their current domicile. This allows Americans living abroad to maintain voting rights in U.S. elections.\n\n5. The question specifies that the FPCA was accepted, which legally establishes their right to vote in Pennsylvania.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the last state of residence isn't necessarily the determining factor if the individual has stronger ties to another state.\n\nOption B is incorrect because once the FPCA is accepted, no additional evidence of ongoing ties is required.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while they can only vote in one state, they don't have the option to freely choose between all three states mentioned.\n\nThis question tests the applicant's ability to integrate multiple concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuances of voting rights for U.S. citizens living abroad."}, "86": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48969/are-email-agreements-and-already-move-in-enough-to-form-landlord-tenant-relation", "docs_id": 48969, "title": "Are email agreements and already-move-in enough to form landlord-tenant relationship?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently rented a bedroom from a home owner in California.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. In California, a valid landlord-tenant relationship can be established through email agreements and actual occupancy, even without a formal lease.

In [Michaels v. McPherson Kansas](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/kansas/ksdce/6:2013cv01128/91570/149/0.pdf), the appellate court refers to and upholds a lower court ruling that plaintiff suffered employment discrimination under the ADA (among other things). The appeal does not discuss the core issue in ADA law, whether the condition significantly limits a person's life, which strongly suggests that defendant accepted the conclusion that sleep apena can be a disability. On the other hand, in [Taylor v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/55/604/2376460/), a discrimination case involving sleep apnea was dismissed \u2013 but crucial to the dismissal was that he was successfully treated (also relevant was the lack of notice given the the employer).\n\nFinally, in [Keyes v. Catholic Charities](http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/101543np.pdf), federal court found that plaintiff's condition was not a disability under the meaning of the term in ADA. This does not mean that sleep apnea is \"not a disability under the law\", it means that \"defendant is not disabled under the law\", that is, the conclusion is based on the particulars of the individual condition, which is why the answer is \"maybe yes, maybe no\". There is a two\\-prong inquiry into the condition. First is a determination whether the person is \u201csubstantially limited in any major life activity other than working, such as walking, seeing, or hearing\u201d, compared to the general population.

The correct answer, C, is the factor that would most strongly support an ADA discrimination claim based on the documentation provided.\n\nThe key considerations are:\n\n1. The disability status under ADA depends on whether the condition substantially limits a major life activity.\n2. Successful treatment can undermine an ADA claim, as seen in the Taylor v.

Catholic Charities case shows that delays in seeking treatment can weaken an ADA claim.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee's condition is untreated due to circumstances beyond their control (back-ordered medical device), which differentiates it from cases where treatment was available but delayed or where the condition was successfully managed. This factor most strongly supports the notion that the sleep apnea is currently substantially limiting a major life activity (sleep and punctuality), which is crucial for establishing disability status under the ADA.\n\nOptions A and B, while relevant, are less powerful in establishing the legal basis for an ADA claim.

For example, can a contract define a term \"Image\" (as in a picture) to mean any computer file, or to mean any image showing a red flower?\n2. When the defined meaning is completely incompatible with the common sense meaning.

What matters is that the contract be clear enough for the parties to be aware of the terms and conditions to which they are committing. Both of the scenarios you outline seem lawful. They are binding to the extent that the definitions \\& language therein duly inform the parties of the substance of the contract. Definitions in a contract are most pertinent where the meaning of a term is intended to supersede and replace the commonplace meaning thereof.\n\nA contract would become null and void if the substance of that contract contravenes legislation. If legislation outlaws not only the effect of a clause but also its meaning, then the \\[un\\-]lawfulness of that clause is not altered simply by crafting definitions of terms. In other words, laws or legislative intent cannot be elluded by relabeling concepts in a contract.\n\nWhenever lawful, the attempt to trick a party with tactics (such as the use of uppercase you mention) is likely to be voidable by that party. The rationale is the same: The draftsman's attempt to confuse the user contravenes the contract law tenet that the parties *knowingly* enter the contract at issue.\n\nNotice that in the preceding paragraph I wrote \"*whenever lawful*\" rather than \"*although lawful*\". The reason for that choice is that, in some contexts, the draftsman's tricky attempts might constitute a *deceptive practice* and thus be in violation of the law (for instance, consumer protection laws).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software company includes the following clause in its End User License Agreement (EULA) for a photo editing application:\n\n\"For the purposes of this agreement, 'Image File' means any computer file with a .txt extension, and 'Text File' means any computer file with a .jpg, .png, or .gif extension.\"\n\nA user inadvertently agrees to this EULA and later discovers that the application is deleting their text files (with .txt extensions) while claiming to be \"cleaning up unused Image Files.\" The user sues the company for damages.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Generally, contracts can define terms in ways that differ from common usage, even if counterintuitive. This means the contract itself is likely valid.\n\n2. However, the deliberate use of misleading definitions in a EULA, where users typically don't have the opportunity to negotiate terms, could be considered a deceptive practice under consumer protection laws.\n\n3. While the contract may be valid, the company's actions in deleting files based on these misleading definitions likely violate consumer protection laws against deceptive practices.\n\n4. The user's inadvertent agreement doesn't negate their rights under consumer protection laws, which are designed to protect consumers from such tactics.\n\n5.

While options A and D touch on aspects of contract law (implied acceptance and counter-offers), they oversimplify the situation. Option B, suggesting clear-cut fraud, is too extreme given the nuances of the case.\n\nThe correct answer, C, best captures the legal complexity. In contract law, a valid agreement requires a \"meeting of the minds\" (consensus ad idem) where both parties have a shared understanding of the terms. In this case, the customer's deliberate manipulation of the price creates a significant discrepancy between what the company intended to offer and what the customer purported to accept.\n\nThis scenario likely falls under what's known as \"unilateral mistake\" in contract law, where one party (the company) is mistaken about a fundamental term (the price) due to the other party's actions. Courts often find that no valid contract exists in such cases, as there was no true agreement on essential terms.\n\nMoreover, while the company's automated system processed the order, this doesn't necessarily constitute legal acceptance of the modified terms. Automated processes are generally considered to operate based on the company's predefined rules and intentions, not as independent agents capable of accepting radically altered terms.\n\nThis answer aligns with the documentation's mention of \"willing declaration\" (Willenserkl\u00e4rung) in German law, suggesting that the company's true willingness to enter into this specific agreement is absent due to the customer's manipulation.\n\nWhile the customer might not face criminal charges, they could be liable in civil court for the difference in price or for restitution of the goods, as they received a benefit (the products) without providing the agreed-upon consideration (the full price)."}, "97": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29655/if-police-dont-know-which-apartment-has-criminal-evidence-can-they-search-all", "docs_id": 29655, "title": "If police don&#39;t know which apartment has criminal evidence, can they search all of them?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose the police have probable cause that there is evidence of a crime in an apartment that is part of a complex, but they can't figure out which apartment it is.

Has anyone proffered a better term?\n\n> OBJECTS the persons who may benefit from\n> property on the exercise of a distributive\n> power or discretionary trust.\n\n*Pearce and Stevens' Trusts and Equitable Obligations* (2022\\) 8th edn, page lxiii.\n\n> Another form of express trust is the discretionary trust under which the trustees have discretion to \u2018appoint\u2019\n> (meaning \u2018to distribute\u2019) the property as they wish to people from a particular class of potential\n> beneficiaries, known as the **objects \\[emphasis added]**.\n\nPaul Davies, *Equity \\& Trusts: Text, Cases, and Materials* (2019\\) 3rd edn, page 30\\.\n\n> 3\\.7 The result of the trustees having a discretion to select only some of the possible beneficiaries\n> means, of course, that some might not receive any money at all, in which case\n> they will not really be \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 of the trust. For this reason, the term **\u2018objects\u2019 \\[emphasis added]** is\n> used, and the group of objects among whom the trustee may select is called the \u2018class of\n> objects\u2019. \u2018Objects\u2019, then, is the compendious term that covers beneficiaries under a fixed\n> trust, possible beneficiaries under a discretionary trust, and possible recipients under a\n> power of appointment, to which we now turn.\n\nJames Penner, *The Law of Trusts* (2022\\) 12th edition, page 52\\.\n\n> But trusts need not work in this way.

Consider the sentence *Alice likes Bob.* Grammatically, *Bob* is the object of the sentence. Apart from grammatical analysis, we can also say that Bob is the object of Alice's affection.\n\nIn other words, a more general sense of *object* is \"something toward which something else is directed.\" (In modern idiomatic English, you will probably more likely hear *objective* used for that, especially when the object/objective is an abstract goal.)\n\nThe concept at use here is defined in Black's law dictionary (second edition) under the phrase *objects of a power:*\n\n> Where property is settled subject to a power given to any person or persons to appoint the same among a limited class, the members of the class are called the \"objects\" of the power. Thus, if a parent has a power to appoint a fund among his children, the children are called the \"objects\" of the power.\n\nAnalogous to Bob being the object of Alice's affection because the affection is directed toward Bob, the children in the example are the objects of the power because the power is applied to the children.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about trust law and the concept of \"objects,\" here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy philanthropist wants to set up a trust to benefit either medical research institutions or educational charities, leaving the specific distribution to the trustees' discretion. In drafting the trust deed, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal status of the potential beneficiaries and the trustees' responsibilities?\n\nA) The medical research institutions and educational charities are the beneficiaries of the trust, and the trustees must distribute funds equally among them.\n\nB) The medical research institutions and educational charities are the objects of the trust, and the trustees have no obligation to distribute funds to any specific entity.\n\nC) The medical research institutions and educational charities are the subjects of the trust, and the trustees must select at least one from each category to receive funds.\n\nD) The medical research institutions and educational charities are the recipients of the trust, and the trustees must distribute all funds within a specified timeframe.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of discretionary trusts and the concept of \"objects\" in trust law. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The term \"objects\" is used in trust law to refer to potential beneficiaries of a discretionary trust, as explained in the provided documentation. This term encompasses both fixed beneficiaries and potential recipients under a discretionary arrangement.\n\n2. In a discretionary trust, trustees have the power to choose how to distribute the trust property among the defined class of objects. They are not obligated to distribute to all potential beneficiaries or to distribute equally.\n\n3. The question describes a scenario where the trustees have discretion in distribution, which is a key feature of discretionary trusts.\n\n4. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they impose specific obligations on the trustees (equal distribution, mandatory selection from both categories, or distribution within a timeframe) that are not typically present in discretionary trusts.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from trust law, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about the nature of discretionary trusts and the legal status of potential beneficiaries as \"objects\" rather than just testing memorization of terms."}}
