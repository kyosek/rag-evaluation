            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My uncle passed away a few years ago, and owed quite a bit of money, I believe he owed on the house and perhaps on a loan. He did not leave any money in his will, and we ended up paying for his burial. Somehow the collection agencies got my mom's address and are sending her all sorts of bills. Obviously we are not responsible for the money he owed, but how do we get them to stop sending them? It's stressing her out. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, when a person has unpaid debts and dies, those debts are to be paid from any assets of the estate (as in, *any* assets). The executor has the responsibility to use those assets to pay the debts. Presumably the executor did that, and there are no co\\-signed accounts or anything like that, so your mother isn't responsible for these debts in some obscure way. The [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](http://bankruptcy.findlaw.com/debt-relief/the-fair-debt-collection-practices-act.html) has a provision that you can tell a collection agency to stop communicating with you, and they must then stop communicating with you except to say they are stopping attempts to collect, to indicate possible remedies (i.e. lawsuits), or notify of an actual remedy (they have actually filed suit). Since they are no longer allowed to discuss anything with you once you give them the go\\-away notice, one should probably hire an attorney to exercise the nuclear option. \nYou can also request proof that you owe the money: they are suppose to notify you of the right to dispute the debt with 5 days of first contact, which gives you 30 days to dispute the debt. Persuading a debt collector that they are pursuing the wrong person is probably easier than persuading a jury in a lawsuit.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When a person dies with unpaid debts, which of the following statements is NOT correct according to US law and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)?\n\nA) The executor of the estate is responsible for using the deceased's assets to pay off any debts.\nB) Family members are automatically responsible for paying the deceased's debts if the estate cannot cover them.\nC) Debt collectors must stop communicating with you if you send them a written request to do so, except for specific circumstances.\nD) You have the right to request proof of the debt within 30 days of the debt collector's first contact.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: The executor does have the responsibility to use the deceased's assets to pay off debts.\nB is incorrect: Family members are not automatically responsible for the deceased's debts unless they co-signed on the debt or are otherwise legally responsible.\nC is correct: Under the FDCPA, debt collectors must cease communication upon written request, with limited exceptions.\nD is correct: The FDCPA gives you the right to dispute the debt within 30 days of the first contact from the debt collector.\n\nThe correct answer is B because it's a common misconception that family members automatically inherit the debts of their deceased relatives. In reality, debts are paid from the estate, and if the estate cannot cover the debts, the creditors generally must write off the remaining balance unless there are specific circumstances making others responsible (like co-signing)."

He was sent to Earth in a rocket by his (now dead) parents, then placed up for adoption and legally adopted by two US citizens from the state of Kansas.\n\nWe are trying to determine whether this adoption was legally valid, specifically **whether there is anything in US Citizenship law, US Adoption law (or US law in general) that states that a \"person\" or \"citizen\" specifically needs to be human.**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is longstanding and well\\-established legal non\\-uniformity in defining \u2018person\u2019, and in stating laws in terms of \u2018persons\u2019. The [RICO statutes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1961) (18 USC 1961 (3\\)) states that a person \u2018includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property\u2019. A corporation is a person for the purposes of access to the federal courts, for purposes of forming contracts, and enjoyment of First and Fourth Amendment rights, but not for purposes of voting or 5th Amendment immunity. [1 USC 8(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/8) states that \n\n> the words \u201cperson\u201d, \u201chuman being\u201d, \u201cchild\u201d, and \u201cindividual\u201d, shall\n>  include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born\n>  alive at any stage of development\n\nwhich states a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one.\n\nIn Washington state, [RCW 1\\.16\\.080](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=1.16.080) says that \n\n> The term \u201cperson\u201d may be construed to include the United States, this\n>  state, or any state or territory, or any public or private corporation\n>  or limited liability company, as well as an individual.\n\nWashington does not define \u2018individual\u2019, but we can call on Black\u2019s Law Dictionary to learn that\n\n> this term denotes a single person as distinguished from a group or\n>  class, and also, very commonly, a private or natural person as\n>  distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association; but it\n>  is said that this restrictive signification is not necessarily\n>  inherent in the word, and that it may, in proper cases, include\n>  artificial persons.\n\nAnd finally, Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113, 157 holds that an unborn instance of *homo sapiens* is not a person for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. In short, there is no clear and settled answer to the question.\n\nCourts do not always refuse to hear ground\\-breaking cases, and in case this issue is ever realized, I am confident that cert. will be granted. The point of law is, after all, to state general principles regarding what is forbidden or allowed in a society, thus it must be capable of addressing novel situations. We will have to await that case, but the prospects for your client are good. It is obvious that \u201cpersons\u201d have a special position under the law, it is recognised that they have both rights and responsibilities that other things do not have. Summarizing over millenia of jurisprudential thinking, we can see that the special status of persons (when not reduced to divine gift: not applicable under current US law) derives from the fact that persons have a capacity to reason, and to choose actions based on their reasoning. In the context of our current knowledge, this is mostly coextensive with being an instance of *homo sapiens*, though in case of severe or complete limitation of those faculties, an instance of *homo sapiens* may not be legally accorded the full set of rights and responsibilities of *homo sapiens*.\n\nIn fact, the law does not have a definition of *homo sapiens*. Before objecting that science teaches us that only earthlings can be *homo sapiens*, we should be remember that courts do not always hold that terms as defined in a scientific discipline are to be interpreted that way under the law, which is how SCOTUS in [Nix v. Hedden 149 U.S. 304](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/149/304/case.html) was able to hold that a tomato is not a legal fruit. The plain meaning of *homo sapiens* is completely consistent with extending legal coverage to Kryptonians.\n\nThus it will be the finding of the court that petitioner, not a member of the species *homo sapiens* but endowed with the faculty of reason and free will, has all of the rights and responsibilities of a \u2018person\u2019 under Kansas law, and has the right to be adopted.",

The documentation provides several examples showing that the legal definition of \"person\" is not uniform across US laws and can vary depending on context. For instance:\n\n1. RICO statutes define a person as including \"any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.\"\n2. Corporations are considered persons for some legal purposes (e.g., contracts, certain Constitutional rights) but not for others (e.g., voting rights).\n3. State laws, like in Washington, may include various entities (including corporations and the government) in the definition of \"person.\"\n4. The definition can change based on the specific legal context, as seen in cases like Roe v. Wade regarding unborn humans.\n\nThe document also suggests that the law might be flexible enough to potentially include non-human entities (like extraterrestrials) if they possess reasoning capabilities, although this has not been tested in court.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they suggest a uniformity or restrictiveness in the definition of \"person\" that is not supported by the provided information."

It states, in subsection 2, that\n\n> Every citizen of Canada and every person who has the status of a permanent resident of Canada has the right to pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province.\n\nDoesn't the arrivecan app (and subsequent forceful quarantine, and/or fine) infringe upon this right?

While there are arguments that these measures might infringe on rights outlined in Section 6 of the Canadian Charter, it's also generally accepted that governments have some authority to implement quarantine measures during epidemics. The issue is complex and open to interpretation, which is why a legal challenge has been filed in federal court. The ultimate determination of the app's legality will likely depend on how the court interprets the Charter rights in the context of public health measures. Options A and B are too absolute in their claims, while D incorrectly suggests that only provincial governments have authority over quarantine measures."

Given that you had a lease, a simple offer to have another one would be enough as \u201con the same terms\u201d is implied.\n\nSecond, she must have accepted your offer unconditionally. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll put together some documents to sign\u201d is an unconditional acceptance even if the documents never appear. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll put together some documents to sign first\u201d or \u201cYes, I\u2019ll put together some documents with the terms\u201d aren\u2019t.

Sarah's response indicates that she would draft a new lease agreement, which suggests that the text exchange itself was not intended to be the final agreement. Without a formal lease document signed by both parties, John's tenancy would default to the existing month-to-month arrangement. This allows John the flexibility to move out with proper notice as per month-to-month tenancy rules in Ohio. Options A and C are incorrect because text messages can form a contract in some cases, but here the exchange lacks sufficient detail and the clear intent for it to be the final agreement. Option D is incorrect because the binding nature of the agreement doesn't depend on Sarah's actions after the text exchange, but rather on the content and intent of the messages themselves."

What is the most likely current status of this patent?\n\nA) The patent has been invalidated by the court\nB) The patent application is still pending approval\nC) The patent is active and enforceable\nD) The patent has been abandoned by the applicant\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C, the patent is active and enforceable. The information provided can be misleading without proper context. The USPTO status \"Application Involved in Court Proceedings\" doesn't mean the patent is invalid or unapproved. The court dismissal mentioned likely refers to a lawsuit regarding the patent, not the patent's validity itself. \n\nThe timeline shows that a company (United Industries Corporation) challenged the patent's validity, but the court found the claim to be invalid and that UIC failed to show unpatentability. An appeal was later dismissed by mutual agreement of both parties. This sequence of events actually reinforces the patent's validity.\n\nThe Google Patents status of \"Active\" is the most current and accurate representation of the patent's status. The conflicting information is a result of complex legal proceedings that ultimately did not invalidate the patent. Therefore, the patent remains active and enforceable."

The [various portals](https://vsc.gsa.gov/marketing/advantageOptions.cfm) for relaying such information to GSA don't indicate that there's any kind of meaningful restrictions on how vendors handle the data they submit.\n\nI suspect this is a reflection of the idea that there's no real point forcing businesses to spend more money protecting their own information than they think is cost\\-efficient. A hospital or credit\\-card company with lax security endangers the private information of thousands or millions of customers who expect privacy, but a vendor who fails to secure his inventory data generally risks exposing only his own information, which may not even be secret in the first place.

Unlike HIPAA for health data or PCI for payment information, inventory data is generally considered the vendor's own information and doesn't involve sensitive customer data. The lack of regulation is likely because vendors are expected to protect their own business information as they see fit, and the exposure of inventory data primarily affects the vendor rather than individual privacy. Additionally, much of this information may already be public as part of the vendor's marketing efforts. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they imply the existence of regulations or uniform guidelines that are not supported by the given information."

This person lives on a main road and the billboard is visible to cars travelling on it. He hasn't received permits or licenses to do so.\n\n1. Is this legal on a federal level according to U.S. laws?\n2. Is this legal in all states or do some states prohibit this?\n3. What about county and local laws?\n4. Do some counties and cities have ordinances that prohibit\nresidential billboards?\n5. Or is a person allowed to construct signs on their own personal\nproperty as it is their right to do so with their land as they please?\n6. If this is unlawful, what are some of the potential consequences\nthat the landowner could face? Would they just be fines and how\nlarge might those fines be?\n7. Should this person be researching all local county and city\nordinances to see if this is legal in his area, or should this be\nconsidered fine anywhere within the USA?\n8. Does it matter what size the billboard is? For instance, does a 7'x7' billboard carry less lawful risk than a 30'x30' billboard?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Laws regarding billboards and advertising are very local in nature and are typically handled under city/county zoning ordinances. Start with calling your local county zoning office. They will tell you the city/county laws regarding your particular residential zoning overlay, if city or state laws supersede county laws, and recent changes in law that might matter and if the sign might be grandfathered.\n\nThere can be different types of \"residential\" zoning and the city/county will tell you this; some allow limited commercial use and signage, and some don't. The housing subdivision you are in may also have covenants; you'll know if there are covenants if you received information when you bought property in that subdivision.\n\n**1,2,3,4,8:** These depend on local laws.\n\n**5:** Very generally speaking, land owners typically do not have absolute rights to land usage; that is the rationale behind zoning laws (among others, like health and public safety, building codes, national defense, etc.), because some types of land usage impact adjacent users and the general public.\n\n**6, 7:** Potential consequences include fines and requirements to take the billboard down, but again, those possibilities are very localized. The size of the billboard could come into play; again, this will be very localized. Some signage may be grandfathered, too.\n\nIn order for the city/county to look at the situation and possibly take action, you may have to file a written protest with the zoning office; they would help with the process. You may have to present your case at a public city council or county commission meeting, but that basically involves saying such and such is happening and you want the city/county attorney to look into relevant laws. It would help your case if you had a list of names of others in the area who are also unhappy about the billboard. I doubt you will need legal representation to lodge a protest, but if it comes to that, Google for free legal aid in your area.\n\nIf the city/county attorney *won't* take action (which is possible, as this involves prosecutorial discretion as to if the city/county wants to press the issue with the landowner), you can look for free legal aid in your area and consider your options.",

There is no federal law that universally prohibits billboards in residential areas. While property owners have certain rights, these are not absolute and are subject to local zoning restrictions. The size of the billboard may be a factor, but this is also determined by local regulations, not a universal rule. To determine if the billboard is legal, the homeowner would need to research their specific local zoning laws and potentially obtain necessary permits."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had a dental appointment this morning, and the dentist (as per usual) insisted that I get an NTI night guard and a Philips Sonicare. I politely said 'no' as I have the last 6 visits, but the insistence is starting to creep me out a bit. \n\nI had a previous dentist who sold me a night guard for $500 that really messed up my jaw. When I confronted him on why he was pushing something so hard that the insurance didn't cover (for good reason!), he flatly told me \"I don't make a dime selling night guards, this is just an option we provide to customers who would benefit.\" I found this very hard to believe, \\- obviously there's some lack of specificity in the terms \"I\" and \"make money\" \\- so I let it go. \n\nSo what I want now is a polite way I can ask my current dentist (or possible future dentist) a question such that they can either 1\\) decline to answer or 2\\) answer it clearly and unequivocally. \n\nEDIT: I'll try to be more specific: I want to ask my dentist : \"Is Philips paying you to sell me their product?\" in a way that will put them on the hook for fraud if they intentionally equivocate. (They could say \"Well, technically, I don't get paid directly by Philips, but this information is reported to the dental management company, which has a contract with Philips, and the management company gives me quarterly performance reviews which affect my salary\") If they lie, and I buy the product, and later discover that they lied, then they have committed fraud (this is my understanding.) I'm not sure the exact form of the answer I'm looking for, but certainly reading the language of the standard conflict of interest forms is not something I'm about to do to a dentist. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no law that helps you. The dentist is under no obligation to tell you about the business and has no duty to be honest with you about such questions. Unless you have a private agreement, for example:\n\n> Dentist: Would you like to buy a toothbrush?  \n> \n>  You: Yes I will, but only if you do not profit from it.  \n> \n>  Dentist: I do not profit.  \n> \n>  You: OK, I will buy it.\n\nIf the dentist is lying, this would constitute fraud in the inducement, which you can research if you like. Keep in mind that your remedy is litigation.\n\nThe nightguard is a different question. Unnecessary appliances and procedures have their own set of consequences, but that is not your question.",

For criminal cases, terms like \"convict\" and \"guilty\" are used, but these are not appropriate for regulatory violations. In civil infractions, the term \"responsible\" is often used. However, for violations of federal regulations specifically, such as FCC rules, the correct terminology is \"found in violation\" or \"not in violation.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"convicted\" is a term used in criminal cases, not regulatory violations.\nOption B is incorrect because \"guilty\" is also a criminal law term and \"infraction\" is more commonly used in civil cases, not federal regulatory matters.\nOption C is close, as \"responsible\" is used in civil infractions, but it's not the most precise term for federal regulatory violations.\nOption D is correct, as it uses the specific terminology \"found in violation\" which is appropriate for FCC and other federal regulatory matters."

The subject has no living heirs.\n\nI've requested documents from the California Department of Consumers Affairs regarding a license held by this individual when they were alive. \n\nThe state has returned many valuable documents but much of the useful info has been redacted. For example, the individuals employer names and the individuals work/home addresses have been redacted. \n\nThe state is citing California Civil Code sections 1798\\.1 and 1798\\.3 as to why the information may not be released.\n\nI've read the code and it defined the protected individual as a \"natural person\" \\- but I'm unable to determine if a deceased person is still considered a natural person. \n\nIn short, is there any legal argument for requesting that the information, which is nearing 100 years old, should be released?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Dead people are \"natural people\" (the term is used to distinguish corporations and so on). There does not seem to be any exception made in the case the individual is dead or has been dead for some time, other than to conservators, beneficiaries, or for statistical purposes (etc.), or with permission of next of kin.\n\nThe [Public Records Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&division=7.&title=1.&part=&chapter=3.5.&article=1.) limits disclosure of personal information but has an explicit exemption\n\n> If the subject whose privacy is to be protected is deceased, an heir,\n>  beneficiary, designated immediate family member, or authorized legal\n>  representative of the deceased subject whose privacy is to be\n>  protected.\n\nThat means, protection of privacy of a dead person was a legislative concern 9 years before the Information Practices Act was enacted.

There is no automatic time limit for when this protection expires after death. The Public Records Act, while a separate law, demonstrates that the legislature was concerned with protecting the privacy of deceased individuals. The lack of living heirs does not change the application of these privacy protections. While there are some exceptions for release of information to specific parties (like heirs or for statistical purposes), these are limited and do not allow for unrestricted public release of personal information, even many years after an individual's death."

That is, are the carriers somehow immune from an action when they carry illegal calls on their network?\n\nThe changing tide and specific details are (1\\) carriers are accepting and completing calls from known robocallers and other miscreants, and (2\\) the FTC's 2017 ruling that carriers can block the traffic at the network level.\n\nThe insight for (1\\) is, carriers have available lists of some robocallers and other miscreants. Two lists are (a) the [FTC Do Not Call](https://www.ftc.gov/site-information/open-government/data-sets/do-not-call-data) data files, and (b) reports of harassing calls from some robocallers and other miscreants via Unlawful Call Centers (i.e., \\*57\\).\n\nThe change for (2\\) is from the FTC. It is Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls, CG Docket No. 17\\-59, published in FCC\\-CIRC1703\\-01\\. Specifically (D)(8\\) states:\n\n> To aid the Strike Force and other providers\u2019 call blocking efforts,\n>  the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (Bureau) released a\n>  Public Notice on September 30, 2016 clarifying that voice service\n>  providers may block calls using a spoofed Caller ID number if the\n>  number\u2019s subscriber requests that they do so.\\[26] The 2016 Guidance PN\n>  built on the Commission\u2019s earlier clarification,\\[27] which, among\n>  other things, clarified that nothing in the Communications Act\n>  prohibits voice service providers from offering call blocking tools to\n>  those consumers who request such services.\\[28] Following from that\n>  initial guidance, the Strike Force Report sought additional\n>  clarification regarding the permissibility of certain\n>  provider\\-initiated call blocking.\\[29] Specifically, it sought\n>  clarification that 1\\) providers may block calls where the Caller ID\n>  shows an unassigned number, and 2\\) providers may block calls that the\n>  provider has determined to be illegal robocalls, so long as the\n>  provider takes reasonable steps to confirm that the calls are illegal.\n\nAnd to state the obvious, some of the robocalls violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009\\. Additionally, if the inbound call is carried over a person's or business' VoIP or computer network, then it could violate Computer Fraud and Abuse Act also.\n\nAnd I am also aware of the [illegal spying campaign carried out with the US government](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying). However, it literally took an act of congress to let the carriers off the hook for that illegal activity.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes. As a utility, telephone carriers (both landline and cell carriers) are immune from unlawful communications crossing over their networks. The responsibility of any illicit form of speech (such that there is in the United States. The most common is falsely calling 911 (true threat doctrine)), though I'm sure someone somewhere has discussed criminal actions over the phone as well.\n\nBecause the public would be disserviced from utilities discriminating against customers who might abuse the system to communicate illicit messages (if for no other reason than they may have to call 911 for an actual bona fide need), the governments will usually grant immunity from responsibility from illicit use of the service by a user. Just as one would not hold a phone company liable for a bomb threat that used their network infrastructure to reach it's recipient, an electric company or water company is not responsible for the use of their services to create artificial sunlight or water plants in a drug grow house.",

According to the information provided, US landline carriers generally have safe harbor protection and are immune from legal action for illegal calls transmitted through their networks. This immunity is granted because utilities like telephone carriers are not expected to discriminate against customers who might abuse the system, as this could potentially prevent legitimate use of the service (such as emergency calls). The immunity can only be revoked through explicit acts of Congress, as evidenced by the case of the illegal spying campaign mentioned in the text. Options A and B are incorrect because they state that carriers have no immunity, which contradicts the information given. Option D is incorrect because the carriers' immunity is not conditional on them taking active steps to prevent illegal calls, although recent FTC rulings have clarified that they are allowed to block certain types of calls if they choose to do so."

In it, I talk about how I see it as problematic that the identities of LEOs investigating an active case can be publicized. If that case concerns a serial killer, or perhaps members of organized crime, it seems like the investigators could become the target of assassination, threats, blackmail and bribery.\n\nAccording to [this article](https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-law-enforcement-officers-refuse-identify-themselves), LEOs are not mandated by federal or state law to disclose their identity, though this may be mandated at a municipal level.

This includes normal interactions, like buying a sandwich for lunch and actions that might be thought of as \"police work\": investigation, surveillance, and undercover work. However, when they are executing a \"police power\", like entering premises subject to a warrant or probable cause, making an arrest, or issuing an order they need to identify themselves as a police officer \\- not doing so can lead to confusion: always a bad thing where firearms might be involved.\n\nAs to lying, a police officer has no general duty to be truthful except in very narrow circumstances. They must tell you if you are under arrest if you ask and they must read you your rights if they place you under arrest. Aside from that, they can lie their asses off.\n\nA police officer could use a fake badge if the circumstances warranted it.

Some basics:\n\n1. Have a good command of the facts about your finances, your ex's finances, and the children's schedules and needs (assuming that there are children). For example, it would be good to have school calendars as far forward as they are available, to know the children's medical providers, and to have a firm command of their extracurricular activities, their friends and the requirements of any childcare providers. Often child support worksheets will be mandatory for a settlement to be approved, so get those worksheets and fill in the facts you know already. Bring a calculator so you can consider new assumptions and evaluate financial proposals accurately.\n\nIf you think you have received inaccurate disclosures, be prepared to explain in detail what you think is inaccurate and why you think that this is the case.\n\nIf domestic violence has been an issue, there are restraining orders that are or have been in place, there are abuse or neglect allegations present (including emotional abuse of a spouse or children), or the co\\-parents have had trouble coordinating and reaching decisions without outside assistance, be prepared to explain these situations in factual detail so you can avoid summarizing the situation in a vague way.\n\nBring anything you might need to refresh your recollection about relevant facts with you to mediation.\n\n2. If you haven't received full disclosure of your spouse's finances, insist on receiving that, ideally before going to mediation and absolutely before reaching a deal.\n3. Spend time considering possible resolutions of property, maintenance and parenting matters in advance. Very early on in mediation each of you will be asked what you want and mediation shouldn't be the first time that you have thoughtfully considered the question.\n4. Spend time thinking about what you need on a non\\-negotiable basis to survive \\- to be able to meet basic needs for food, shelter, clothing, health care, etc. for you and your children, and also about what your ex needs and how your ex can achieve it. Proposing ways to achieve objectives that your ex hasn't considered that are viable is a good way to get a resolution.\n5. Ideally, attend a parenting class (mandatory in many jurisdictions before getting a divorce that involves children) before attending mediation. Keep in mind that children are not prizes or bargaining chips and that you need to consider their needs as well as your own. Your kids love both of you even though you can no longer manage to live with each other.\n6. Do not utilize the children as sounding boards for mediation stances and do not try to use them as decision makers or conduits for communication between the co\\-parents.\n7. Recognize that in most states, marital fault is irrelevant, and that starting a new relationship is natural and routine, even if it makes your skin crawl that your ex is starting a new relationship. Take an attitude of focusing on what the deal does for you rather than what the deal does for your ex. This is about you getting what you need, not about making your ex worse off.\n8. Be prepared to walk away from mediation without a deal if necessary, because your ex won't accept a reasonable deal. Maybe half of mediations end without a settlement.\n9. Recognize that it may be possible to reach partial resolution (e.g. splitting up tangible personal property; figuring out how holidays will be handled with the children; agreeing on schools that children will attend; figuring out who, if anyone, will continue to live in a marital residence; stipulating to the value of particular assets; stipulating regarding each party's income; stipulating regarding what is and isn't separate property where you can agree; agreements to disclose information), without resolving all issues. Partial resolutions reduce uncertainty and make it easier to prepare for and conduct a permanent orders hearing on the remaining issues.\n10. Even if you can't afford to hire a lawyer to represent you in the entire case, pay for an hour or two of a lawyer's time to evaluate what kind of property division, maintenance award and parenting arrangements are within the range of the possible and likely if you go forward to a permanent orders hearing.\n11. Be prepared to put the terms of anything that is agreed to at mediation in writing.\n12. Mediators will usually tell you if they need forms signed, payments made, or a \"mediation statement\" in advance. Do everything required on time. A \"mediation statement\" is a summary of the key facts and your position on a fair resolution and could be a couple to a dozen pages depending upon the complexity of the case. Be clear in a mediation statement about what is O.K. to share with the other side and what is for the mediator's information only. When a mediator asks for a mediation statement the main reason for doing so is to save time that the mediator is charging you per hour for 50\\-50\\. A mediation statement can make getting the mediator up to speed on the facts more efficient and less likely to omit important facts and the mediator needs to learn the key facts to be effective.",

How many indictments does it take for Donald Trump to be imprisoned?\n2. Can a person who is indicted, before running for president, become president?\n3. What's the purpose of indicting Mr. Trump if indictments are only an accusation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> 1. How many indictments does it take for Donald Trump to be imprisoned?\n\nAn unlimited amount. Imprisonment is usually authorized as a result of a conviction rather than from an indictment.\n\nPretrial detention following an indictment but prior to a conviction is permitted, but discretionary in the judgment of the judge. Also, there is a right to post a judicially determined reasonable bond to obtain release from pretrial detention after one is indicted and before one is convicted in the vast majority of cases (including the ones that President Trump is facing).\n\n> 2. Can a person who is indicted, before running for president, become president?\n\nYes. Indeed, the majority view of legal scholars (it is has never been tested in a real case) is that someone who is convicted and serving prison sentence can still become President if that is who the voters choose.\n\n> 3. What's the purpose of indicting Mr. Trump if indictments are only an accusation?\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzUnW.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzUnW.png)\n\nAn indictment is a pre\\-requisite to trying someone for a felony in federal court. To convict someone of a crime one needs to first indict them, then have a jury trial, and then have a jury unanimously vote to convict a person, before they can be convicted of a crime and sentenced for it. Even after conviction, there is a statutory (but not a constitutional) right to a direct appeal of that conviction to an appellate court.\n\nAlso, an indictment is more than a mere accusation. An indictment in a determination of a [grand jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States#Rubber_stamp_for_the_prosecution) that probable cause exists to believe that the person indicted committed the crime charged. In the federal court system grand juries are composed of 16 to 23 members and 12 members of the grand jury must concur in a decision to indict a defendant on a charge for there to be an indictment on that charge.\n\nThis prevents people from enduring criminal prosecutions on charges that a majority of a grand jury finds are so baseless that there is not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the defendant committed that crime. The grand jury must base its decision to indict or not on actual evidence in support of the charges in the form of sworn witness testimony and exhibits, not just the allegations of the prosecutor.\n\nAs a practical matter, the standards of professionalism in federal criminal prosecutions is so high that [almost all charges sought by federal prosecutors from grand juries result in indictments on those charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/24/the-rarity-of-a-federal-grand-jury-not-indicting-visualized/) (federal grand juries refuse to indict approximately one in 16,000 times).\n\nBut, in state courts that use grand juries, which can't pick and choose only the best cases to prosecute, grand juries routinely refuse to indict defendants on a substantial share of charges brought to them by prosecutors (on the order of one in 20\\). One source [notes](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2020/b2019_20/committees/ctte_s_jud_1/documents/testimony/20200123_04.pdf):\n\n> Statistical figures showing a higher prevalence of grand jury\n> reluctance to follow the government in ages past are almost\n> nonexistent. However, a table of felony arrests in New York County\n> between 1900 and 1907 found on page 111 of the 1926 book The Prisoner\n> at the Bar by Arthur Train provides some rare illumination. In those\n> seven years, some 5,214 out of 57,241 people were arrested by the\n> police on felony charges whom New York state grand jurors decided not\n> to indict.\n\nGrand juries are especially likely to decline to indict defendants in cases involving [celebrities](https://www.nfl.com/news/second-texas-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-browns-qb-deshaun-watson-on-criminal-), [politicians](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2020/b2019_20/committees/ctte_s_jud_1/documents/testimony/20200123_04.pdf), [law enforcement officers](https://abcnews.go.com/US/breonna-taylor-case-sparks-renewed-scrutiny-grand-juries/story?id=73438566), and other [high profile cases with political implications](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mississippi-grand-jury-declines-indict-woman-emmett-killing-rcna42274). *See also* Kaeleigh Wiliams, \"[Grand Juries Should Not Hear Police Misconduct Cases: Grand Juries will Indict Anything, but a Police Officer](https://scholarship.law.slu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=lawjournalonline)\" *SLU Law Journal Online* 79 (2021\\).",

In fact, the majority view among legal scholars is that even a convicted felon serving a prison sentence could still become president if elected by voters. The document states that \"someone who is convicted and serving prison sentence can still become President if that is who the voters choose.\" Additionally, an indictment is merely an accusation and a determination of probable cause, not a conviction.

Generally assault is considered fighting someone who did not want to fight you. So does this mean if two people agree to a fight, it's legal? This seems to be the case with MMA where they wear virtually no safety equipment.\n\nWhat if an aggressor gets up in another persons face, then would the person be able to hit first? I saw this in a YouTube video: a police officer responded to a 911 call. The person who he called was a army drill sergeant and started yelling at the police officer and getting up in his face (like in movies like *Full Metal Jacket*). Though the drill sergeant technically didn't touch the police officer, the officer hit him in the face, pinned him and arrested him. Though there were other factors like the drill instructor seemed to be on drugs.\n\nIf a person does something minor like throws water at a person or shoves a person would that count as assault? For example in sports games you occasionally see a player or coach shove someone. If there was a prank like shoot someone with a water gun, could this be assault if they didn't agree to it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> An [assault](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault) is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.\n\nThere is no need for physical contact in an assault, all that is needed is the *threat* and the *apparent, present ability*. The drill sergeant was behaving in a threatening manner and had an apparent, present ability to cause harm; he was guilty of assault.\n\nConsensually engaging in a *legal* contact sport lacks the threat of bodily harm; that is to say that the bodily harm is a risk of the sport but it is not the object of it. Of course, an *illegal* sport where death or maiming is an inherent part would leave the participants open to assault (and battery) charges \\- you cannot agree to do illegal things.\n\nWhat is necessary to constitute the threat and the apparent means depends on the whole of the circumstances. A person throwing water when they had threatened the victim with acid is most certainly assault. Pointing a replica pistol at someone who doesn't know it is a replica constituted the threat and apparent means in one action.",

I went and was there for 5 \\- 6 hours deliberating with other jurors whether or not this guy should've gotten a speeding ticket or not (really trivial stuff). Anyway, we made our ruling and I headed home.\n\nI wake up the next morning and went to work and was discussing this with my coworker and he brought up people who couldn't serve in a jury. Now, I've been living in the US for 15\\+ years and I am only a permanent resident (not a citizen) I looked into this further and found that in Texas, non US citizens could not serve in a jury. What are the consequences (as I did not know at the time) for serving in a jury if you are not a citizen? Should I call the court house and tell them? I thought they only picked citizens!\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nI wanted to update you guys on this strange insistence. Didn't want to leave you guys guessing lol. Anyway I explained the situation at the court house and I was forgiven without any penalties but they did declare a mistrial on the case I was involved in \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The potential problem is if there is a form which you had to sign which says \"I am a US citizen\", and you signed the form (who reads the fine print, anyhow?). Unfortunately, that statement is false, and there are consequences for making a [false statement](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.37.htm). However, that law penalizes false statements with the intent to deceive, not mistaken statements. Nevertheless, this is a matter that a professional really needs to deal with. If there was no form and they didn't verbally ask you to assert that you are a citizen, then there is less of a problem (for you), but still one needs to be extremely cautious in dealing with the court.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nIt is highly likely that the form contained wording like \"swear\" or \"certify\" and mentions \"perjury\", so the error would be in the ballpark of perjury. Perjury is making \"a false statement under oath or swears to the truth of a false statement previously made and the statement is required or authorized by law to be made under oath\". Aggravated perjury is perjury which \"is made during or in connection with an official proceeding and is material\". The term \"material\" means \"matters; is not inconsequential\". The consequence of a non\\-citizen improperly serving on a jury is that a mistrial has occurred, which is not inconsequential. Aggravated felony is a third degree felony. The [penal code](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/PE/htm/PE.12.htm) says that\n\n> An individual adjudged guilty of a felony of the third degree shall be\n>  punished by imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\n>  for any term of not more than 10 years or less than 2 years.\n> \n> \n> (b) In addition to imprisonment, an individual adjudged guilty of a\n>  felony of the third degree may be punished by a fine not to exceed\n>  $10,000\\.\n\nI must emphasize that an essential element is \"intent to deceive and with knowledge of the statement's meaning\", an element that cannot be present if there is no awareness of such a statement. Thus an innocent mistake could be legally excused. When you become aware that a statement made under oath was false (assuming such a statement was made), then in maintaining the falsehood, that would be intentional deceit. This is why it is necessary to consult with a lawyer.\n\nOn the Houston form, you would have to check the \"are a US citizen\" box. The Fort Bend county form has you certify and sign on the front page: it does not require you to certify that you are a US citizen, only to certify (and sign) if you are *not* \u2013 so if you failed to read the back side, that isn't a literally false statement. I can't locate an online form for Tarrant county, so dunno if that out is available.",

The documentation highlights that making false statements on court forms, especially under oath, can potentially be considered perjury or aggravated perjury, which carries severe penalties. However, the intent to deceive is a crucial element, and an innocent mistake might be legally excused. The form's exact wording and whether the permanent resident signed any declarations of citizenship are critical factors. Given the potential for serious legal consequences (up to and including felony charges) and the nuanced nature of the law regarding intent and false statements, consulting with a lawyer before taking any action is the most prudent course of action.

[(Source.)](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Top_tips#Getting_to_the_nearest_city) And it's harder to hitchhike at night than during the day. [(Source.)](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Hitchhiking_at_night)\n\nBut buses can be infrequent at night. It may sometimes be faster to hitchhike. Also, hitchhiking is free.\n\nAt a traffic light, the [standard hitchhiking strategy](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Traffic_light_hitchhiking) is to get drivers to open their window a tiny bit, then to ask them for a lift. If there's an empty bike lane between you and the car, this is probably more difficult.\n\nIt may not be wise to step into the bike lane. (Bicycles are fairly quiet, and a cyclist may be text messaging instead of watching for pedestrians in his lane.)\n\nBut I still wonder whether or not it's legal to step into the lane, in order to ask for a ride.\n\nThe relevant laws\n=================\n\nHere are the relevant excerpts from the Ontario [Highway Traffic Act](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-h8/latest/):\n\n* 1 (1\\). In this Act:\n\n\t+ \"roadway\" means the part of the highway that is improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular traffic, but does not include the shoulder.\n\t+ \"vehicle\" includes a ... bicycle.\n* 177 (1\\). No person, while on the roadway, shall solicit a ride from the driver of a motor vehicle other than a public passenger conveyance.\n\nMy questions\n============\n\nA) If almost no cyclists use a bike lane, is the lane still considered \"ordinarily used for vehicular traffic\"?\n\nB) In Ontario, is it legal to step into a seldom\\-used bike lane in order to solicit a ride from a car driver?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Ordinarily used\" means its ordinary use. The usage that is normal for a bicycle lane is to ride bicycles in it. That remains true even if no bicycles are ever actually ridden on it.\n\nThe law you quote directly states that it **is** part of the roadway. The definition doesn't require the bicycle lane to meet all of the conditions listed, just at least one of them.\n\nSince a bike lane is designed not just for vehicular traffic but a specific kind of vehicular traffic, it would be considered roadway \u2014 again, even if nobody ever used it for cycling at all.\n\nSince doing so is explicitly disallowed, it would be a breach of law to do it.",

According to the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, a roadway is defined as \"the part of the highway that is improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular traffic.\" Bike lanes are specifically designed for vehicular traffic (bicycles are considered vehicles under the Act) and are therefore part of the roadway. The Act also explicitly states that \"No person, while on the roadway, shall solicit a ride from the driver of a motor vehicle other than a public passenger conveyance.\" The frequency of use does not change the legal status of the bike lane as part of the roadway. Therefore, soliciting a ride while standing in a bike lane is illegal, regardless of how often it is used.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legal definition of roadway is not dependent on frequency of use. Option C is incorrect because the act of soliciting while on the roadway is illegal, regardless of how long one remains there. Option D is incorrect because the presence or absence of cyclists does not affect the legal status of the bike lane or the prohibition on soliciting rides from the roadway."

It is smaller than a GmbH and requires less work/money to stay in compliant operation, but it's larger than a sole proprietorship and allows for both protection of personal assets and future growth. From what I understand, many people find UG entities good for small businesses \\-\\- think of a few employees, with the possibility to expand to a few dozen.\n\nIs there an equivalent entity type in Ireland?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are likely looking for a *private company limited by shares* (Ltd).\n\nThe German UG and GmbH are certain kinds of limited companies. Here, \"limited\" means that liability is limited to the company's capital, thus protecting the company's owners. This is in contrast to a sole proprietor, who is liable with all their assets. In order to protect customers and business partners, German law expects the limited company (GmbH) to have a capital of at least EUR 25\\.000\\. The UG is a baby\\-GmbH, with equivalent bureaucracy requirements and similar liability protection, but requiring only a peppercorn as starting capital (at least EUR 1, typically at least a few hundreds so that it can actually start operations). The UG will however eventually convert to a GmbH because 25% of profits must be accumulated until the GmbH starting capital is reached.\n\nIrish Ltds do not have comparable minimal capital requirements, though public companies (PLCs) do. Ireland alternatively allows liability to be limited by a guarantee rather than having to invest money up front for shares.",

A sole proprietorship does not offer liability protection, unlike the German UG which limits liability to the company's capital.\n\nB) Incorrect. Public limited companies (PLCs) in Ireland have significant capital requirements, which is unlike the German UG that allows for minimal starting capital.\n\nC) Incorrect. While a private company limited by guarantee does offer liability protection, it doesn't involve shares, which is a key feature of the German UG.\n\nD) Correct. The private company limited by shares (Ltd) in Ireland most closely resembles the German UG. It offers liability protection for owners, similar to the UG, and does not have comparable minimal capital requirements like the German GmbH. This makes it suitable for small businesses looking for asset protection and the possibility of future growth, much like the UG in Germany."

[Reporter's privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter%27s_privilege) is well\\-established in the case law, and every state except Wyoming has [shield laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_laws_in_the_United_States) on the books.\n\n[Branzburg v. Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branzburg_v._Hayes) however established that journalists *can* be compelled to reveal confidential information or sources, provided certain conditions (the [Branzburg test](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/740/branzburg-v-hayes)) are met, and I'm trying to figure out whether the conditions of the test are *de facto* met whenever classified information is published.\n\nAccording to [*The First Amendment Encyclopedia* (Middle Tennessee State University)](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/740/branzburg-v-hayes), the conditions of the Branzburg test are as follows:\n\n> \u201c(1\\) show . . . probable cause to believe that the newsman has information that is clearly relevant to a specific probable violation of law;\n\n> (2\\) demonstrate that the information sought cannot be obtained by alternative means less destructive of First Amendment rights;\n> and\n\n> (3\\) demonstrate a compelling and overriding interest in the information.\u201d\n\nThe clear argument for the above in *any* case of journalists revealing classified information, picking off the requirements of the test one by one, is:\n\n1. Disclosure of classified information is in itself a specific probable violation of law\n2. This one is case specific, but the presence of alternative means of acquiring this information would obviate the court case in the first place, implying this condition to be true and likely defendable\n3. Information is classified [only for reasons of national security](https://fas.org/sgp/library/quist2/preface.html#:%7E:text=Information%20is%20classified%2C%20that%20is,as%20it%20comes%20into%20existence.), making the source revealing such information a threat to national security, which demonstrates a compelling and overriding interest in the information\n\nDoes this mean that in *any case* in which classified information is revealed by a journalist, that fact alone is enough to compel the journalist to reveal the source of the classified information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\n1. There are many ways for classified information to be disclosed that do not involve a violation of the law. For example, classified information could be left in a filing cabinet which is sold at auction to a national broadcaster \\- as happened in [Australia](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/9393008). While careless and embarrassing, it\u2019s not illegal for the government to sell its secrets on the open market.\n2. Government has (or should have) many ways of keeping track of where their information is and who has access to it. The government has to demonstrate not that other ways are hard, time\\-consuming or expensive but that they literally **do not exist**.\n3. Bullshit. Many, many things are over\\-classified because the person doing the classification has every incentive to be overcautious with every piece of information. \u201cShould the officer\u2019s club menu be classified? Well, they are having curry on Friday and that could easily hide poison so ... better to be safe than sorry.\u201d Example deliberately taken to extremes for comedic effect \\- but you get the idea. I\u2019ve held Secret clearance in the past and the amount of stuff I\u2019ve seen marked \u201cSecret\u201d or, even more so, \u201cClassified\u201d that leaves you asking \u201cwhy\u201d is mind\\-blowing \\- manufacturer\u2019s spec sheets for water coolers, say.",

Disclosure of classified information does not always involve a violation of law (e.g., accidental disclosure through government actions).\n2. The government must prove that there are absolutely no alternative means to obtain the information, which is a high bar to meet.\n3. Not all classified information truly relates to national security, as many items are over-classified out of caution rather than necessity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the application of the Branzburg test.

How can a judge behave like this to public?\n2. Is she a public servant?\n3. How can a judge say what ever they want and nobody can react? Is that the law? Nobody over the judge in the court?\n\nI saw another real court video, a girl said \"adios\" to the judge and the fine amount was doubled.\n\n4. Any where written how to behave in the court and what all things anyone can say?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, Judge Judy is not a real court. Judith Sheindlin *was* a real judge, but then she retired to be on TV. The show depicts arbitration proceedings, which both parties agreed to. If both parties want it, and if he agrees, you can have arbitration proceedings where R. Lee Ermey presides and keeps order by means of screaming at you and ordering calisthenics on the spot (where failure to comply means you lose automatically). Judge Judy is not a public servant on the show; she's a TV personality.\n\nThat said, real judges have *substantial* power to keep order in the courtroom and to enforce proper decorum. Part of proper courtroom decorum is that you respect the authority of the court, and that you respect the judge. Failure to do so can be criminal contempt of court. Contempt of court in the presence of the judge is the only situation I'm aware of in American law where you can do something wrong and be pronounced guilty of a crime and sentenced to jail on the spot without the ability to even say anything in your own defense beforehand (some places require opportunity to be heard before sentence is imposed or the order becomes final, but not all do). Part of the point of this is that courts only have authority because people are willing to obey them; one of the actual reasons for summary direct criminal contempt is to vindicate the authority of the court. If you're acting like the court can't tell you what to do, the court can send you to jail to make the point that they absolutely can tell you what to do (in practice, jail sentences are often commuted when the contemnor apologizes).\n\nWith the \"Adios\" thing, that wasn't a fine: it was *bail*. Bail is the amount you pay to guarantee you'll show up in court later (if you show up you get it back; if you don't the court keeps it). Disrespecting the court means they're less convinced you will show up because of a sense of obligation, so they can increase bail to add financial incentive.\n\nIn his personal capacity, a judge can be criticized like anyone else. In his courtroom, a judge is *not* the peer of anyone else in the room. The judge is the court; he represents the law (judges used to be stand\\-ins for the King; now that the US is based on the rule of law rather than the rule of a King, judges are stand\\-ins for the law). A phrase sometimes used is that you may or may not respect the judge, but you respect the robe.\n\nSo, yes. If you think a judge is disrespecting you, you are expected to take it and not show disrespect right back. You are expected to show respect to the judge, to the proceedings, and to the other people in the courtroom. Judges occasionally abuse this; there are stories of \"black robe fever,\" in which a judge goes off on someone in the courtroom for no good reason. But that doesn't excuse anyone else in the room from their duty to show respect to the judge while in court.",

Judges have substantial power to maintain order and decorum in the courtroom. Showing disrespect to the judge or the court, even through non-verbal cues like eye-rolling, can be considered contempt of court. This power exists to uphold the authority of the court and ensure respect for legal proceedings. Contempt of court in the presence of the judge is one of the few situations in American law where a person can be found guilty and sentenced immediately without a formal trial. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while free speech is protected, there are limitations in a courtroom setting where maintaining order is crucial. \n\nAnswer B is too narrow; contempt isn't limited to only explicit profanity or threats.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because contempt rulings, especially those made for direct contempt in the courtroom, are often difficult to appeal and are not typically overturned immediately."

However, I need to describe my claim in details to see what you think of my claim *legally*:\n\nI'll file for asylum based on: \n\n1\\) Religion \n\nI embraced a different religion than my society which damaged my relationship with it. I face discrimination that's really unbearable. Seeking protection from the government isn't a choice as I describe in the second point below that relates to political opinion. The discrimination that I face isn't limited to the social life, but also legally. Local courts won't recognize my religion in order to process marriage documents for example as I have to undergo religious rituals, there's no civil marriage for citizens. In addition to all of that, I have been always looked at as being unwanted in my society and I found it hard to integrate and swallow their religious practices. So far I didn't receive any sort of death threat other than minor offences (insults and humiliation). The issue relates to the strong religious ties of my society, even children are forced to memorize religious mottos, in other words (indoctrinated).\n\n2\\) Poilitical opinion \n\nIn my country there's a political mayhem going on. Because of my family I'm considered to be the same as their religion. The government has a well\\-documented history of human right abuses towards our social group, this includes torture, discrimination in jobs, unfair trials and so on. All of that is well documented by independent human right organizations that are recognized internationally like Amnesty International for instance. Of course, naturally I'm counted as a member of this social group and thus what the government is doing to them applies to me as well. Seeking protection from the government will be a funny thing to say based on what I witnessed with my own eyes and the documents that include videos and pictures of how police treat people with extreme violence. I have members in my family jailed and torture in prisons based on their peaceful political opinions.\n\nGoing to the legal questions: \n\n1\\) According to the Canadian immigration law, is my claim for asylum valid? \n\n2\\) Does the Canadian law grants the refugee claimant the right to access a lawyer during the hearing procedure if the claimant financially unable to afford it? \n\n3\\) Some of the facts are available publicly and can be proven very easily by (news, reports, videos,...), others are personal.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the user's rights and options?\n\nA) The user legally owns all data they've uploaded and can demand its release without payment.\nB) The user can easily win a lawsuit against the website for withholding personal data.\nC) The user is bound by the Terms of Service they agreed to when creating the account.\nD) The user's ownership of the data changes if they upgrade to a paid plan.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When users create an account on a website, they typically agree to the site's Terms of Service (TOS), which is a legally binding contract. The TOS usually outlines the conditions under which users can access or download their data. If the TOS stipulates that data can only be downloaded with a premium plan, the user is bound by this agreement. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ownership of data is determined by the TOS, not automatically granted to the user. \n\nOption B is misleading; while the user could attempt legal action, it would likely be costly and challenging to win if they agreed to the TOS. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the ownership status of the data doesn't necessarily change with a paid plan; rather, the access rights might change as per the TOS.\n\nThis question tests understanding of digital rights, Terms of Service agreements, and the legal implications of using online platforms."

There are almost certainly numerous things you signed to become a student, as well as various policies you agreed to in first gaining access to the computer services, which would apply here.\n\nI can tell you with certainty that the school where I was a student had a policy that I agreed to that they would make certain information available to other students unless I chose for it to be restricted. However, my university did not have any photos of students that were viewable by other students in a directory.\n\nThat said, there were also times I participated in extra\\-curricular activities where I was required to sign release forms giving the school the rights to video tape, record, and photograph me, and to do what they wished with those things.

Universities typically have their own policies and terms of service that students agree to when accessing such systems. These policies often restrict the use of directory information for personal projects or republishing without explicit permission.

Assume there is no malice or racism component to the shooting and that she thought she had the non\\-lethal taser, when in fact she had a lethal firearm.\n\nWhat is the range of charges she would face? What if any defense does ***qualified immunity*** provide in a case of such a serious error?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Federal Civil Rights Liability**\n\nQualified immunity is a doctrine that applies to lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking compensation for an intentional violation of constitutional rights under color of state law.\n\nThe qualified immunity inquiry is not reached in the first place if the prima facie case is not established because the conduct allegedly violating a constitutional right under color of state law, even if it is a well established constitutional right (i.e. one memorialized in a reported and controlling appellate court decision that is factually similar), if the action was merely negligent rather than intentional.\n\nThus, most likely, there is no federal civil remedy to the victim, unless even the use of the taser would have been a violation of a well established constitutional right under color of state law. Non\\-deadly force, like a taser, is subject to a lower threshold of justification than deadly force, like a firearm.\n\nOf course, under general Fourth Amendment principles applicable to the states, an attempted arrest which appears to be what the OP describes, must be supported by probable cause that a crime was committed for which an arrest would be authorized. So, if this is the violation of rights alleged, there may be a federal civil rights remedy. But, further examination of the facts show that there was apparently a warrant for the arrest of the person shot outstanding. So the officer probably has a legal basis to use non\\-deadly force to make an arrest pursuant to the outstanding warrant, but probably did not have a legal basis to use deadly force to make an arrest.\n\n**Federal Criminal Liability**\n\nThe most common charge under federal criminal law for excessive use of force by a police officer, is a criminal violation of civil rights. But this, like the civil remedy, requires a showing of an intentional violation of civil rights which the OP tends to suggest is absent unless the officer lacked probable cause to make an arrest.\n\n**State Law Civil Liability**\n\nAt the state level, law enforcement officers acting under color of state law are immune from civil liability except as authorized by state law in an exception to sovereign immunity. Generally, there is no exception to sovereign immunity for a negligent use of force by a police officer.\n\nSo, the police officer probably can't be sued successfully by the victim's estate under state law.\n\n**State Criminal Law Considerations**\n\nFor criminal law purposes, whether or not the law enforcement officer's actions were a crime under state law would dependent upon both the elements of the offense: probably manslaughter or negligent homicide in this case, and the scope of force authorized under state law in the case of a law enforcement officer seeking to arrest a fleeing suspect.\n\nUsually, under state law, the use of reasonable force to make an arrest supported by probable cause is allowed and the use of deadly force to make an arrest support by probable cause is allowed only if there is a threat to the public based upon probable cause to believe that a particularly serious violent felony was committed.\n\nQualified immunity is not applicable to state criminal law liability, although express statutory defenses in a state criminal statute might be similar in some cases.\n\n**Caveat**\n\nOf course, all of that analysis assumes that the story of the officer's motive and intentions was truthful. There is very good reason to be skeptical of this fact and to believe that the use of a firearm was not a negligent mistake, and that race was a motivating factor. Simply saying that one's motives were good is not a free pass and a jury doesn't have to believe the law enforcement officer.",

Under what circumstances would John be legally justified in shooting the mountain lion?\n\nA) John can shoot the mountain lion immediately to protect his property and pet.\nB) John can shoot the mountain lion only if it comes within 10 feet of his house.\nC) John can shoot the mountain lion if he reasonably believes it's about to attack his dog and he has no safe way to retreat or protect the dog otherwise.\nD) John cannot shoot the mountain lion under any circumstances without first obtaining a hunting license.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Utah rule cited in the passage, a person is legally justified in killing a threatening wild animal when they reasonably believe such action is necessary to protect themselves, another person, or a domestic animal against an imminent attack that will likely result in severe injury or death. The rule also states that factors such as the nature and immediacy of the danger, the probability of attack, and the ability to safely retreat should be considered. \n\nOption A is incorrect because mere presence on property or potential threat to property alone does not justify killing the animal. \n\nOption B is arbitrary and not supported by the law. \n\nOption D is incorrect because self-defense against wild animals does not require a hunting license. \n\nOption C is correct because it aligns with the legal justification outlined in the Utah rule, considering the imminent threat to the domestic animal (dog) and the inability to safely retreat or otherwise protect it."

If a negotiable document with one owner (such as a check or promissory note or negotiable bond or stock certificate) is signed (i.e. \"endorsed\") in the proper place on the original document by that owner, then the person who is in physical possession of the endorsed document (the \"holder\" of the endorsed document) is now its true owner. There is a body of statutory and case law setting forth which documents may and may not be negotiated in this manner (in the United States, this is located mostly in the Uniform Commercial Code). \n\nIf the endorsement is made on a separate piece of paper attached to the negotiable document it is called an \"[allonge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allonge)\", and it could fairly be called either an endorsement or an assignment.\n\nAn \"assignment\" would be a transfer of ownership concluded in some manner other than negotiation of the original document by endorsing it, for example, by a bill of sale document signed by the owner declaring that the new owner is the person who is now presenting the stock.",

An endorsed certificate is typically signed directly on the original document, usually on the back, which allows for negotiation and transfer of ownership to the holder of the endorsed document. This is a form of negotiation governed by specific laws, such as the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States.\n\nOn the other hand, an assigned certificate involves transferring ownership through a separate document, such as a bill of sale, rather than by endorsing the original certificate itself. This method of transfer is called an assignment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the ability to transfer to different parties is not the distinguishing factor between endorsed and assigned certificates. Option C is false because notarization is not a defining characteristic of either method. Option D is incorrect as the value of the stock is not determined by whether it's endorsed or assigned."

By filing the claim with the court before the statute of limitations expires, the claimant preserves their right to pursue the case. This action complies with the limitation period, as the case is considered \"brought\" when it is filed with the court. Simultaneously proceeding with the Pre-Action Protocol demonstrates good faith and adherence to court expectations, even if it's not completed before filing. This approach balances legal compliance with procedural expectations.\n\nOption A risks non-compliance with the PAP and could be seen as unreasonable. Option C is incorrect because in most jurisdictions, courts cannot extend statutes of limitations in civil cases (though there may be exceptions). Option D is unnecessarily drastic and forfeits the claimant's rights when legal options are still available."

Who would authorize that, if anyone? What are the legal bounds of this organization/militia? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no laws restricting a number of people forming a group and calling themselves a militia or similar sounding military name. The factors that limit the activities of any militia or similar group are the same that oversee all of us: state and federal laws.\n\nTo begin with, any such militia or group may run afoul of laws if they are perceived to be attempting to confuse the public and state/federal governments of their legitimacy and actual command. And, of course, the federal government will not allow an ad\\-hoc militia group to subvert their own authority. \n\nA self\\-organized militia of ex\\-military types could self\\-assign \"missions\" of any nature, as long as they did not break applicable state and federal laws for firearms, applicable laws that require permits for assembly and parades in public spaces, laws regarding threats and intimidation while in public, and laws regarding [Sedition (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition), among others.\n\nThese \"missions\" could be patrolling cities and reporting crimes and helping old ladies cross the street, like an armed version of the [Guardian Angels (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Angels). But more aligned with current events, some possible examples are the [Oath Keepers (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_Keepers): they gather at request (or by their own mission directive) and \"provide security\" (their description) for other groups \\- during public rallies and demonstrations \\- that have (typically right wing) political views aligned with their own. They appear in military garb and are heavily armed, but are allowed to assemble and \"operate\" (their term), as long as they are within the bounds of state and federal laws. (There are instances of laws being \"bent\" by law enforcement to allow militias to \"operate\" i.e. [Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge); but typically, federal authorities supersede). But a militia could also claim to be non\\-partisan, or even left wing, such as the [Redneck Revolt (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Revolt).\n\nSuch militias organize and authorize their own \"missions\", much like any group, like the Boy Scouts. The only outside authorizations they may need are legal permits, where required, for their activities, such as assembling and parading in public, among others. If a militia is run as a [501(c) organization (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization) they are also bound by those financial and governing laws.\n\nThe *legal* bounds of how a militia operates in public (and in some cases, within private spheres) are \\- like anyone else \\- the applicable state and federal laws: for firearms (open carry, concealed carry, long guns, automatic weapons, etc.), laws regarding threats and intimidation (since they are usually armed and their modus operandi is intimidation) and assault, as well as any laws regarding assembly and parades, and sedition.",

According to the documentation, militias are subject to the same state and federal laws that govern all citizens. These include laws related to firearms, public assembly, threats and intimidation, and sedition. The militia cannot operate freely without restrictions (ruling out option A), nor are they governed solely by federal law (ruling out option B). They do not need specific authorization from local law enforcement for all their activities (ruling out option C), but rather must comply with existing laws and obtain necessary permits for certain public activities. The militia can self-assign \"missions,\" but these must remain within the bounds of applicable state and federal laws."

I am currently trying to find opportunities to use this instructional permit for the very purpose it was issued to me, namely to practice driving with an individual holding a valid driver's license before the real deal.\n\nAt the DMV, I was advised to find a \"friend\" who could allow me to use their car to practice and then bring this \"friend\" as well as their vehicle to the DMV. The DMV does not provide vehicles on test day. I have two major problems with this:\n\n1\\) \"Bring a friend\" is not very professional or rigorous legal jargon. What if none of my friends have cars? What if I have no friends? \n\n2\\) It so happens that some of my friends do have cars. However they all have the same legitimate reaction when I ask for help.There reaction is unanimously \"What about insurance?\" Their name is on the insurance, so if something happens to the car during our practice or even during the driving test at the DMV, they are ultimately responsible. Is the challenge of finding someone who is willing to jump in head first to a possible legal entanglement part of the driving test?\n\nSomeone please help as this makes no legal sense to me. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I know in the United States, no DMV provides test vehicles. \n\nYou need a vehicle to take the driving test.\n\nSince you are *not* currently licensed, you *can not* legally drive yourself to the test alone... \n\nSo logically, you *must* bring someone... anyone... willing to drive you to the test and provide a vehicle for you to test in. As others have stated in the comments above, worse case scenario is the hiring of a driving instructor.\n\nIf you read the written instructions (and I remember correctly), it does state something along the lines of \"must be accompanied by a licensed driver and provide an insured, registered, vehicle\". Which is a bit more formal than the \"bring a friend\". Most people just naturally use more casual terms when speaking. I don't know your age, but it's probably more common to hear \"bring a parent\" than \"bring a friend\" when *speaking* face to face with the DMV staff. \n\nAlso, not all insurance policies are driver limited. Some policies are on the vehicle regardless of driver. **Typically Liability\\-only insurance is vehicle specific, not driver specific**. [\\[\\*1]](http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2014/06/05/249762.htm) You'd have to review the policies or call the insurance agents to confirm this. \n\nYou may even do something as simple as add you to the current insurance for a month or two while you're practicing and testing. Just reimburse your friend for any increase in premiums during this time. Contact the insurance company/agent. The cost may be minimal. \n\nIn addition, there are **[non\\-owner insurance policies](http://www.insure.com/car-insurance/non-owners-policy.html)** which cover you even if you do not own a vehicle. This would provide insurance if none of your friends has a policy which would work.\n\nRealize that *most* people taking the test for the first time have probably already been added to a policy owned by their parents. So, your situation is a bit more unique. It's not meant to be inherently confusing but if you're \"outside the norm\" you have to do some deductive reasoning on your own.\n\nAnd finally, if an accident or damage were to happen during *your* practicing or testing, it would *still be your responsibility*. **If you are in control of the vehicle, you are responsible for any damage to it or damage caused by the vehicle due to any negligence on your part, regardless of any insurance policy.** You'd be a pretty bad \"friend\" if you caused damage and didn't financially make restitution leaving your \"friend\" holding the bag, so to speak. Restitution could be something as simple as paying the deductible on your friend's policy. Of course, if you are *not* covered by insurance any claim may be denied \\-\\- leaving *you* responsible for everything. The mindset that just because your friend owns the car they are totally responsible for anything that happens while ***your*** driving seem very, very self\\-serving and, well, I'd be apprehensive about loaning you my vehicle as well. In fact, I absolutely would *not*.",

Does it cost money?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that the question is how one creates a site on which to sell apps created by others to the general public, this depends on how the app has been released.\n\nApps are pretty much always creative works, and as such are protected by copyright. The initial owner of the copyright is the developer, or in some cases the developer's employer. However the copyright may be sold, given, assigned, left, or otherwise transferred to another.\n\nThe copyright owner has the exclusive right to make, or authorize the making of, copies of the protected work. The copyright owner also has the exclusive right to distribute the work to the public, or authorize its distribution. In US law these are protected by [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106). In other countries such rights are protected by the various local copyright laws. These rights are also guaranteed by the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) Specifically, Article 9, paragraph 1 of the convention reads:\n\n> (1\\) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form.\n\nA website that allows the public to download apps, whether for a fee or for free, involves both making copies of the apps, and distributing them to the public. As such it requires permission from the copyright owner. In the absence of such permission, the site operator is engaging in copyright infringement.\n\nSome apps have been released by their owners under permissive licenses which allow others to copy and distribute them for a fee. A site could legitimately host any app whose copyright owner has so released it.\n\nIn the absence of such a permissive release, the distributor must obtain permission. There is no standard method of doing this. One must find some way to communicate with the owner, or some authorized agent of the owner, and ask. If one cannot find the owner, or the owner does not respond, this must be treated as a refusal, and the app may not be distributed. Some owners list contact info in their apps or the documentation.\n\nThe copyright owner may demand a fee for such permission. This could be a fixed advance fee, or a per\\-copy or percentage fee royalty, or both, or some other fee structure. The owner may also require some specific form of attribution, or make other conditions. Any such conditions must be complied with. It is usual for the owner's agreement to be incorporated into a binding contract, but this is not strictly required.\n\nDistribution without permission is copyright infringement, unless an ***exception to copyright*** applies. In the case described above, providing a site for retail purchase of apps written by various others, it is hard to see how any exception would apply. The US concept of ***fair use*** pretty clearly would not apply.\n\nThe owner may bring suit against an infringer. If the owner wins such a suit, the owner may be awarded monetary damages, and a court order against further infringement. In some cases the owner may also be able to collect legal fees and other costs of suit from the infringer. The exact rules for damages vary by country, and the details will vary with the particular case. In the US, under [17 USC 504](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504) the owner may elect to get statutory damages (which can be up to $150,000 per work infringed for willful infringement) or actual damages, which include both losses to the owner, and any profits made by the infringer.\n\nIn some cases copyright infringement may also be a crime, and can be prosecuted by the government. In the US, [17 USC 506](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) makes infringement a crime when the infringement is:\n\n* \"purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain\", and\n* of copies with the retail value of over $1,000 during a period of 6 months.\n\nHowever, my understanding is that actual prosecution by the US Justice Department is unusual unless infringement is carried out on a major commercial basis, well over the statutory threshold.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal requirements for such an operation?\n\nA) The website operator can freely distribute any mobile application as long as they charge a fee for it.\n\nB) Permission is only required from app developers if the website plans to offer the apps for free.\n\nC) The website operator must obtain permission from the copyright owner of each app before making it available for download, unless the app is released under a permissive license.\n\nD) Copyright laws do not apply to mobile applications, so no permissions are necessary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to copyright law, apps are protected creative works. The copyright owner has the exclusive right to make copies and distribute the work to the public. A website that allows users to download apps, whether for a fee or for free, involves both copying and distributing, which requires permission from the copyright owner. The only exception would be if the app has been released under a permissive license that explicitly allows such distribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because charging a fee does not negate the need for permission. Option B is false because permission is required regardless of whether the app is offered for free or for a fee. Option D is incorrect because copyright laws do indeed apply to mobile applications, just as they do to other forms of software and creative works."

If somebody else knew the details of the invention before the patent was applied for ([prior art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art)), the patent is not valid.\n\nSo if somebody else tried to get a patent on your invention, you (or anyone else) could simply provide the patent office with evidence of prior art. This would be particularly easy to do if you had already released the invention to the public, since potentially anyone could testify that they knew about the invention. Their application would then be rejected.\n\nIf they were awarded the patent without anybody noticing, and then tried to sue you (or some third party) for infringement, you could likewise produce the prior art, and their patent would be declared invalid and their lawsuit dismissed.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer releases a project under the WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License). Later, another individual attempts to patent the core algorithm of this project. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications?\n\nA) The patent will be automatically granted, and the original developer will be liable for infringement.\n\nB) The patent office will reject the application outright due to the use of the WTFPL license.\n\nC) If the patent is mistakenly granted, the original developer can have it invalidated by providing evidence of prior art.\n\nD) The WTFPL license protects the developer from all legal consequences, including patent disputes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. If someone attempts to patent an invention that has already been publicly disclosed, such as through an open-source software release, this constitutes prior art. Even if a patent is mistakenly granted, the original developer (or any other party) can challenge the patent's validity by providing evidence of prior art. This would likely result in the patent being invalidated and any related lawsuits being dismissed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the patent should not be automatically granted if prior art exists. Option B is incorrect because the license type itself doesn't directly influence the patent office's decision; it's the public disclosure that matters. Option D is incorrect because while the WTFPL is a very permissive license, it doesn't provide specific protection against patent disputes; that protection comes from the concept of prior art in patent law."

As far as I know, no jurisdiction actively disseminates investigation material, such as recorded interviews with suspects, to the public in the same way that the authorities publish laws and judicial decisions.\n\nWhen evidence of a police interview is adduced in open court, it becomes \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense that the information can generally be published (for example, by a journalist sitting in the courtroom). This freedom can overcome confidentiality obligations that may have applied to the information before it was admitted in evidence.\n\nBut court records are not \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense that they can be easily found on a freely accessible database. The courts still control access to the record and use this control to charge fees and limit the record\u2019s dissemination in the interests of justice. It is uncommon for courts to grant non\\-party or media access to sensitive exhibits (eg. where widespread publication would unreasonably harm a witness or party\u2019s privacy), even if this information was \u201cpublished\u201d to those physically present in the courtroom which was open to the public.\n\nMany jurisdictions have detailed legislation governing access to court documents, as well as legally enforceable disclosure requests using subpoenae or freedom of information laws.

I outlined the test in that other answer and will only summarize here: the question becomes \"[whether the offeror, acting reasonably, would understand that the offeree was assenting to the terms proposed](https://ca.vlex.com/vid/communication-of-acceptance-683505725).\" This is acceptance by conduct. This is [an *objective* inquiry](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90788/does-contract-formation-require-subjective-meeting-of-the-minds) focusing on how the actions would be understood to a reasonable observer, not an inquiry into the actual states of mind of the offeror or offeree.\n\nAn example of the above law being applied can be found in [*University of Edinburgh v. Onifade*, 2005 S.L.T. (Sh. Ct.) 63](https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=b39287a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7):\n\n> The pursuers' notice made it plain that their position was that anyone who parked on their property without a permit would have to pay them a fee of \u00a330 per day on that account. The defender, by parking his vehicle on their property without a permit, made it plain that he accepted that position. He signified his acceptance by his conduct in so doing. It is nothing to the purpose for him to maintain that he did not intend to pay because he considered that the pursuers were not entitled to make the charge specified. 'The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party; it is to decide what each was reasonably entitled to conclude from the attitude of the other.'\n\nSee also [*Imperial Parking Canada Corporation v. Toronto (City)*, 2007 ONCA 649](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2007/2007onca649/2007onca649.html). The signs said:\n\n> Impark is by this sign offering space for public parking. You accept this offer by parking on this lot. Do not park on this lot if you do not agree to these terms and conditions \u2026 If you park and do not display a valid ticket or pass the rate is $69\\.55 per day or portion thereof.\n\nThe judge found:\n\n> the signs posted on Impark\u2019s lots expressly state that Impark consents to the parking of cars without payment in advance and held that the fees that Impark collects are sums owing to it in contract rather than damages for trespass\n\nIn another parking lot example, [*Imperial Parking Ltd. v. Canada*, 2000 CanLII 15612 (FCA)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2000/2000canlii15612/2000canlii15612.html), the Federal Court of Appeal said:\n\n> In my view, the unequivocal conduct which constitutes acceptance of the appellant's offer to provide a parking space occurs when the driver leaves the lot after parking his or her vehicle. This interpretation is reinforced by the text of the large sign posed at the entrance to the appellant's lot. That is the point in time in which an owner can be deemed to have accepted the appellant's offer. **Any time before that moment, a driver can demonstrate his rejection of the appellant's offer by driving away.** Those who purchase a ticket must be deemed to have accepted the appellant\"s contractual terms upon leaving their parked vehicle in the appellant's lot. **As for those who park their vehicles but fail to pay, the act of non\\-payment is more consistent with the intention to breach a contract than a refusal to enter into one.**\n\n### Bob's sign/note/sticker is not likely an effective rejection of the offer\n\nI understand you to be asking whether Bob's sign constitutes rejection of the offer such that Bob's subsequent conduct no longer would be considered acceptance of the contract.\n\nA rejection would terminate the offer, such that it can no longer be accepted. However, *rejection must be communicated to the offeror* (*Chitty on Contracts*, \u00a7 4\\-124\\). In examples where apparent acceptance by conduct is negated by evidence of contrary intention, the offeror was in a position to be aware of the rejector's manifest expression of that contrary intention (see examples in *Chitty on Contracts*, \u00a7 4\\-035\\).",

The courts apply an objective test, focusing on how a reasonable person would interpret the actions, not the parties' actual states of mind. \n\nThe lot owner stipulated that parking constitutes acceptance, and as the \"master of the offer,\" their terms for acceptance generally prevail. Bob's sign is unlikely to be an effective rejection because it was not communicated to the offeror (lot owner). The act of parking and leaving the vehicle in the lot is more consistent with accepting and then breaching the contract rather than rejecting it outright.\n\nCases like University of Edinburgh v. Onifade support that parking in such circumstances constitutes acceptance even if the parker did not intend to pay. The Imperial Parking cases further reinforce that leaving a vehicle parked is the key act of acceptance, and non-payment is seen as a breach rather than a rejection of the contract."

Mutual Trust Co.*, [2002 SCC 43 at paragraph 26](https://canlii.ca/t/51s8#par26)); \"the purpose of expectation damages is to put the plaintiff in the same position it would have been *if the contract had been performed* (*Grandeur Homes Inc. v. Zeng*, [2021 ONSC 4005 at paragraph 19](https://canlii.ca/t/jgdx0#par19)). Unless Bob's contract specifies some other entitlement in the case of non\\-delivery, Bob will likely be awarded expectation damages.\n\nAs a starting point, courts are likely to view the market value of the contract (e.g. \u00a340\\) as the floor for expectation damages, but it is open to Bob to prove higher expectation damages by demonstrating the cost of obtaining a sufficiently similar alternative, while reasonably attempting to mitigate damages. That is: Bob should not simply announce a million\\-pound open bid for a similar phone, and Bob should not wait around if the price is increasing, but Bob could enter another reasonably competitive auction. Also, if Bob can prove losses incurred by not having the item in the meantime, those will also form part of the expectation damages.\n\n### Statute: Sales of Goods Acts essentially provide for expectation damages\n\nProvincial Sale of Goods Acts also say this. See e.g. [Ontario's](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90s01):\n\n> The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller\u2019s breach of contract.\n> \n> \n> Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed, then at the time of the refusal to deliver.",

The son can initiate the process of moving his father to an assisted living facility, but if the father objects and is mentally competent to do so, the son cannot force the move. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a POA does not grant absolute rights over the principal's choices. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the definition of a \"medical facility\" in a POA context is often not strictly defined, and an assisted living facility could potentially be considered appropriate under a medical POA.\n\nOption D is incorrect because guardianship is a separate legal process and is not automatically required just because there is disagreement; the POA is still valid unless revoked or challenged."

The applicable \"*court rules*\" or \"*rules of civil procedure*\" of your jurisdiction provide guidance on how much detail pleadings are expected to include.\n\nAlso make sure you read case law such as [*Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20090518941) and the cases cited therein.

To be exempt from motor vehicle classification, they must meet specific criteria. The correct answer, D, accurately states these criteria: the bicycle must be capable of pedal operation and must not provide electrical assistance above 15.5 mph (25 km/h). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes, stating that all \"twist and go\" bicycles are classified as motor vehicles, which is not true if they meet the specified criteria.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it states the wrong speed limit. The correct maximum speed for electrical assistance is 15.5 mph, not 20 mph.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while power output is a factor in EAPC regulations (limited to 250W), it is not the sole determining factor for motor vehicle classification exemption. The speed limit and pedal operation capability are crucial components.\n\nThis question tests the examinee's understanding of the specific legal requirements for electric bicycle classification in the UK, requiring careful attention to detail and the ability to distinguish between similar but incorrect statements."

Slack proposes that you use the \u201cstandard contractual clauses\u201d (SCCs) mechanism, which is incorporated into their DPA. To enter into SCCs, you as the controller must be convinced that the data importer on the other end is also able to enter into these SCCs. This cannot be the case if the data importer is subject to non\\-European laws that could require disclosure without legal basis.\n\nIn the Schrems II judgement, the partial adequacy decision for the United States was invalidated. SCCs can still be a valid transfer tool. However, exactly the same reasons that invalidated the adequacy decision also call into question whether US\\-based companies can enter into SCCs: electronic communications services can be compelled to disclose personal data to US intelligence agencies without suitable options for redress by the data subjects. Slack is such an US\\-based company that is probably within scope of these spy laws.\n\nIf no sufficient legal protections are available, SCCs might still be permissible by implementing supplemental measures that effectively prevent access to the personal data by US intelligence agencies, such as end to end encryption with keys that never leave Europe. The EDPB has issued [recommendations on such measures](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en). However, such technical measures are generally incompatible with SaaS services such as Slack.\n\nThus, you must perform an analysis of the available legal and technical measures:\n\n* If you find that Slack is subject to relevant US laws and that you cannot implement supplemental measures, then the data transfer is probably illegal.\n* Otherwise, a transfer based on SCCs combined with suitable supplemental measures might be legal.\n\nIn this answer, \u201cEurope\u201d means the UK for the UK GDPR, and EU/EEA for the EU GDPR.",

According to the documentation, simply signing a DPA or choosing an expensive plan with EU data residency is not enough to ensure GDPR compliance. The company must conduct a detailed analysis of the legal and technical measures available, including the potential implementation of supplementary measures like end-to-end encryption. This analysis should consider whether Slack is subject to relevant US laws that could compel data disclosure and whether effective supplementary measures can be implemented.

Incidentally, the act defines \"[oppressive child labor](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/203)\" as:\n\n> a condition of employment under which (1\\) any employee under the age\n>  of sixteen years is employed by an employer (other than a parent or a\n>  person standing in place of a parent employing his own child or a\n>  child in his custody under the age of sixteen years in an occupation\n>  other than manufacturing or mining or an occupation found by the\n>  Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous for the employment of\n>  children between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years or detrimental\n>  to their health or well\\-being) in any occupation, or (2\\) any employee\n>  between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years is employed by an\n>  employer in any occupation which the Secretary of Labor shall find and\n>  by order declare to be particularly hazardous for the employment of\n>  children between such ages or detrimental to their health or\n>  well\\-being; but oppressive child labor shall not be deemed to exist by\n>  virtue of the employment in any occupation of any person with respect\n>  to whom the employer shall have on file an unexpired certificate\n>  issued and held pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of Labor\n>  certifying that such person is above the oppressive child\\-labor age.\n>  The Secretary of Labor shall provide by regulation or by order that\n>  the employment of employees between the ages of fourteen and sixteen\n>  years in occupations other than manufacturing and mining shall not be\n>  deemed to constitute oppressive child labor if and to the extent that\n>  the Secretary of Labor determines that such employment is confined to\n>  periods which will not interfere with their schooling and to\n>  conditions which will not interfere with their health and well\\-being.\n\nWithout the statutory exemption, if you are under 16 and employed by a non\\-parent, in any occupation, that is oppressive child labor. But because of the specific exemption, what would otherwise be statutorily oppressive child labor is allowed.\n\nThe political \"why\" question (why did the bill contain such language) is extremely difficult to answer. The only substantive clues that I have seen are in a [1959 dissertation](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1486475308017293&disposition=inline) by G.E. Paulsen and [this article](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1972&context=lcp) on the passage of the act. It seems to be a legislative compromise relating stricter original standards, and was particularly driven by the need to allow children to work on family farms. The relevant clause was added from the floor of the House on May 24, 1938 by Rep Charles Kramer (CA). This is recorded on p. 7441 of the Congressional Record, which, unfortunately, is not freely available online. The two toughest questions were asked by Schneider (WI), Kramer's reply in parentheses:\n\n> The gentleman's amendment would exempt children engaged only \n>  in the making of moving pictures? (The gentleman is correct) \n>  There are very few young people employed in that occupation?\n>  (Very few.

The information provided suggests that the exemption for child actors was part of a broader legislative compromise related to the Fair Labor Standards Act. While the needs of family farms were a primary driver of compromises in the Act, the exemption for child actors was added as an amendment by Rep. Charles Kramer. The discussion around this amendment indicates it was seen as affecting very few children (around 10 at a time), suggesting it was not a major focus of the legislation.

It would have to follow some procedures to notify Bob of the lawsuit and, if he did not appear, it would win by default. If Bob were to appear, he could make his case about why the bank should not be entitled to that money (\"It was not me\" / \"I only took $1,000\" / whatever).\n\nAfter the trial had happened, the bank still could not take the money right away. Maybe Bob would offer some other assets worth $50,000 to pay the bank.\n\nAfter it had become evident that Bob was unwilling or unable to comply with the payments, then the bank could ask the court to seize Bob's assets. The court would decide which assets could be seized, would order to have them seized, and then would provide them to the bank.\n\nThat does not mean that Bob would be free to use his $100,000 during this time.

The judge would evaluate the likelihood of Bob losing the trial and refusing to honour it (and whatever Bob's lawyer's objections to this are) and decide on the issue.

The bank must win the lawsuit, and even then, it cannot immediately take the money. The court would decide which assets can be seized and order their seizure.

Jack is young and healthy, and was happily married to his equally young and healthy wife until recently. Then his wife, Jill, died suddenly from a mysterious infection that two different hospitals and 6\\+ doctors failed to identify.\n\nA few months later, Jack discovers an infectious agent in his house whose symptoms match closely with what killed Jill, and said agent is a fairly common occurrence in their area (basically any home). Jack is also positive that Jill's doctors never mentioned testing for said agent, so he suspects they missed something obvious, as hard as that is for him to believe.\n\nWhat might Jack do to investigate the possibility? Would he want to consult the hospitals first? A lawyer? A third party doctor? What term should Jack use to describe this possibility (malpractice, wrongful death, manslaughter, etc)? Bonus: What could happen to the doctor(s) if Jack's suspicions prove true?\n\nJack and Jill are in the US, for the record.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you're not asking how to proceed in an actual lawsuit or prosecution, and are just posing this as an information question about law. In this scenario, Jack wants to sue as many people as possible, and to have as many people as possible prosecuted.\n\nJack can sue the involved hospitals and doctors for negligence. The basis of the suit would be that the defendants failed to exhibit the required degree of professional care under the circumstances, resulting in Jill's death. Crucial to the argument is that they did something which they clearly should not have done that contributed to her death, or failed to do something that they clearly should have done. Assume that the infectious agent was *stachybotrys ebola* (currently non\\-existent), that 40% of houses in the county have this agent, and that it can be cured with a two\\-week course of tetracyclin. Patients generally present certain symptoms when they have the condition, and there is a simple test that confirms the diagnosis. In this instance, the patient did present those symptoms and didn't present conflicting symptoms.\n\nThe legally\\-relevant question is, what would the average physician customarily do under these circumstances. Since this is a \"mysterious\" agent, they must have failed to diagnose the condition. Again, we have to be specific about what the doctor(s) did wrong, because failing to diagnose is not *per se* negligence. If the standard strong indicators of the infection is bleeding gums (which the patient did report) and lowered BP, and the doctor didn't look or take BP, that is probably not up to the standard of care that would customarily be given by the average physician in that situation (i.e. walk\\-in clinic doctor, not fictitious TV super\\-sleuth doctor).\n\nJack doesn't have to be positive about the doctors never mentioning such a test, because it's all in the record. Maybe after the fact somebody mentions this infectious agent and he hires a medical sleuth to determine that the agent is present in the house. He gets the idea to sue everybody and subpoenas records right and left, and discovers that (a) although they didn't identify that agent, all of the objective facts clearly indicate that was the cause of the ailment and the cause of death and (b) they had the evidence required to correctly diagnose the situation, but did not use a high enough standard of professional care.\n\nThe described scenario is rather far\\-fetched, because it appears based on the unanimous decisions of 6 independent doctors and 2 hospitals that they all were in fact using the customary standard of care in the profession.\n\nThe legal outcome will depend in part on the state where this took place. There is a \"[two schools of thought](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1909875/jones-v-chidester/)\" doctrine in some states which allows that there might be competing medical theories, so even though 60% of physicians would do X, 40% would do Y, and doing Y is not a negligent action (those numbers aren't part of the legal doctrine, they are there to clarify the kind of situation where this could apply).\n\nJack probably doesn't do anything other than make some phone calls and write some checks. It is extremely unlikely that he would \"discover\" this agent in the house, and more likely he would just call an attorney in the hope of getting something from the doctors. The attorney (experienced in such matters) hires medical investigators that lead to the factual allegations which are the foundation of the lawsuit.\n\nIf the doctors were really that bad, then they could be sued for millions of dollars, and possibly have their licenses to practice stripped, depending on how shocking the neglect was.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, what would be the most appropriate initial step for Jack to take in investigating the possibility of medical negligence in his wife Jill's death?\n\nA) Directly confront the doctors and hospitals involved\nB) File a lawsuit against all medical professionals involved\nC) Consult with an experienced medical malpractice attorney\nD) Conduct his own investigation and collect evidence from the house\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Directly confronting the doctors and hospitals is not advisable as it could potentially harm any future legal case and may not yield accurate or complete information.\n\nB) Filing a lawsuit immediately without proper investigation or legal counsel is premature and could be counterproductive.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. Consulting with an experienced medical malpractice attorney is the most appropriate first step. The attorney can guide Jack through the process, help gather necessary information, and determine if there's a potential case. They can also hire medical investigators to properly examine the situation.\n\nD) While Jack's discovery in the house might be relevant, conducting his own investigation could potentially compromise evidence or lead to incorrect conclusions. It's better to let professionals handle the investigation.\n\nThe attorney can help Jack understand the legal terms (such as negligence or wrongful death), guide him through the process of obtaining medical records, and determine the best course of action based on the evidence."
