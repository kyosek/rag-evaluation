Even though the game is developed in the EU, its worldwide digital distribution means the developers must ensure compliance with copyright laws in every jurisdiction where the game can be accessed and purchased. This includes obtaining necessary permissions or licenses for the use of the modified arrangement, which itself may be a derivative work of the original copyrighted song.

The practice of an occupation or profession may be regulated by or pursuant to a law.\n\nHas art. 12(1\\) been interpreted to require that all students should be automatically graduated regardless of grades?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n==\n\nWhat it means is that no German can be forced by the government into a job, education or place of work. So for example, the Government cannot come and say \"we are short on railroad workers, the next 200 graduates of this school will report to Hamburg Station for training and become rail workers in Munich\".\n\nThat might be blindingly obvious *today*, but when this was written, the government that had just ceased to exist had heavily dictated who was allowed into which profession, not on personal qualification, but on things like faith, nationality, heritage and skin color. And *other* governments forming from the ashes right next door were indeed not capitalistic and their socialist central planning meant that they would direct at least parts of their workforce which jobs to take and sometimes even where.\n\nIn contrast, in Western Germany, whether or not one becomes a rail worker, which company educates them and where they work in the end is their choice.\n\nObviously choices are limited by reality. I can *choose* to be a railworker on an island in the North Sea, but I will be unemployed, because there is no rail line there and I won't get a permit to build my private one.\n\nI can *choose* to study philosophy, but if I cannot find an employer in need of philosophers, I will have to fall back on making money driving an Uber.\n\nI can *choose* to become a Pilot. But I will have a hard time finding a spare 747 to train on if I don't train with one of the big airlines. The may have their own, totally capitalistic goals. For example, contracts that say \"if we train you, you have to stay for X years and work for us or pay X amount of money\" are totally normal and legal in those businesses. And if their training center with the big 747 simulators is in city A, I can choose to train in city B, but I will obviously fail their program.\n\nSo no, this law does not imply any kind of automatic success on a personal level. You still need to qualify for the training you want, be able to pay rent in the city you want to live in and find an employer that employs you, or customers to become a successful freelancer. Maybe you cannot do that for personal reasons. But the government will not dictate instead.

The law ensures that Germans have the right to freely choose their occupation, place of work, and training. However, this doesn't guarantee success or override practical constraints. Individuals still need to qualify for their chosen profession, find willing employers or customers, and navigate real-world limitations. The law primarily protects against government-mandated career assignments, ensuring that career choices remain personal decisions within the constraints of the free market and individual capabilities."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/40405/is-it-legal-to-fake-a-social-media-post", "docs_id": 40405, "title": "Is it legal to fake a social media post?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are many fake social media post generators out there, so that you can generate a fake twitter tweet or a fake whatsapp message and so on.\n\nSee e.g. this: <http://simitator.com/generator/twitter/tweet>\n\nIs it legal to use these fake posts and present them as genuine?\n\nFor example, here's a possible use I had in mind: say I read a tweet some time ago, and I would like to present it in a blog post of mine. If I am unable to find the tweet, I can simply paraphrase the content of the tweet inside a 'fake tweet' like above and present that. \n\nWould that be legal? I am of course being dishonest to my own readers, but I'm guessing while unethical, that can't be illegal. The problem is whether Twitter would allow me to present made\\-up content as if it was posted on their site?\n\nFor my specific case, I don't think they would mind, but it may be illegal if e.g. I could use these fake posts to present an image of Twitter that they might have something against, and so a rule may exist against it just in case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A fake post in the sense of one that appears to be a Twitter or Facebook post (or a post on some other well\\-known social media site) but is in fact nothing of the sort, **might** be an infringement of trademark rights. Presumably such amn imitation would display the logo and other trademarks of the site being imitated, without permission, and in a way likely to confuse readers about the origin and affiliation of the display. Whether this would be considered to be \"used in trade\" or would be otherwise subject to a suit for trademark infringement is hard to say. \n\nA fake post in the sense of one actually posted to a social media site, but under an assumed name, possibly under a name that seems to be associated with a real person, but in fact is not so associated, probably violates the sites TOS. That would be a breech of contract, but such breeches are, I understand, rarely pursued in the form of actual lawsuits. \n\nIf a fake post in either sense uses the name or likeness of a real person without permission, that **might** violate the personality rights of the person imitated. Such rights vary considerably by jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions they apply only to the use in marketing. In some jurisdictions no such rights are recognized. If a fake post attributes to a real person statements which that person did not in fact make, and if those statements are offensive, or harm the person's reputation, there might be a case for defamation. If a fake post reveals, or purports to reveal, private information about a real purpose, in some jurisdictions there might be a tort case for invasion of privacy.\n\nIf a fake post attempts to deceive people to the materiel benefit of the poster, there might be a case for fraud. \n\nIf the fake post serves to advertise some product or service, and if the false name conceals that it was made by or on behalf of the seller or maker of the product or service, or falsely appears to be from some reliable source, such as an expert or a celebrity, then under US law that might be an unfair trade practice. The US FTC can take action in cases of unfair trade practices, if it sees fit.\n\nIn the US at least, simply posting under a false name is not a crime, and indeed may well be protected speech under the first Amendment to the US Federal Constitution.

There are various minimal limitations on the right to free speech, so that you can't threaten a person's life; there are more limits on the right to bear arms. In both cases, laws limiting the exercise of those fundamental rights must be restrained, and a law against openly carrying guns to a political protest would be subject to \"strict scrutiny\", meaning that there would have to be a compelling reason to infringe on these rights. The legal rule, here and in the UK, is that it's legal unless it is specifically illegal. That is not to say that Michigan could not pass a law outlawing the carrying of weapons in government buildings, or outlaw political protests right at the door of the governor's office,\nbut until they do, it's legal.

The situation is primarily governed by the First and Second Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which protect freedom of expression and the right to bear arms, respectively. Michigan has not enacted specific laws prohibiting the open carry of firearms in the State Capitol or limiting protests in this manner.

The real issue is not whether those policies are permitted, but what the consequences are for breaking them. \n\nThe fact that a company forbids its employees from exercising a legal right doesn't mean that the employee ceases to have that legal right. It simply means that if the employee exercises that legal right, then the employee has breached the contract and may suffer the consequences for breaching that contract.\n\nViolations of those policies are grounds for termination from employment, and this would probably not be void as a matter of public policy. \n\nFor an employee at will this is really pretty meaningless, although it could conceivably affect unemployment benefit eligibility. But, for a unionized or civil service employee who can only be fired for cause, this is a big deal.\n\nBut, in theory, a company policy does not impact the tort liability or the criminal liability of the individual engaging in legally privileged self\\-defense to anyone. This is because two people can't contractually change their legal duties to third parties with whom they are not in privity (i.e. with whom they do not have a contractual relationship). And two people also can't contractually change the terms of a country's penal laws.\n\nThe policy may be a defense of the company from vicarious liability for the employee's use of force in violation of the policy that gives rise to civil liability for the employee because the grounds for authorizing self\\-defense were not present.\n\nIf the employee using force did so wrongfully and was sued for negligence rather than battery, the existence of the company policy might also go to the issue of whether the employee was acting negligently since a reasonable person in the employee's shoes might have been less likely to wrongfully use force in purported self\\-defense if there was such a policy than if there was not such a policy (and instead there might arguably have been a legal fiduciary duty as an agent to protect the property and workers of the principal in the absence of the policy).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A large retail company implements a strict \"no violence\" policy for all employees, including security personnel.

The company's policy does not override John's legal right to self-defense, but it does create grounds for termination based on breach of company policy. This termination would be legally permissible, even though John's actions were legally justified under self-defense laws.

The situation: Tenant pays rent by handing a cheque to the landlord, the landlord is robbed before the cheque is deposited. Consensus on money.stackexchange.com is that the tenant should tell their bank to cancel the cheque, and hand over another cheque. \n\nHowever, what happens if the thief manages to cash in the checque before it is stopped? The money is gone. Clearly *someone* is going to lose out, either landlord or tenant. But whose money is it? Does the tenant have to pay the rent again, paying twice, or does the landlord lose his rental income for the month? \n\nThe question was asked in Canada, but other jurisdictions would be welcome as well. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Canada, the bank loses the money. They are the party that is ultimately responsible for paying only the person the cheque ordered to be paid. Canadian law is actually very strict on this, the bank would would be liable even if the landlord fraudulently gave the cheque to his brother to cash.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has made multiple decisions confirming the banks liability in cases like this, most recently in [Teva Canada Ltd. v. TD Canada Trust](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16815/index.do):\n\n> ... The question at the heart of this case is which innocent party \u2014 T or the collecting banks \u2014 should bear the loss resulting from fraud? The Bills of Exchange Act should be interpreted in such a way that drawers and banks are exposed to the risks created by the fraudulent use of the system, but the banks are the more significant beneficiaries of the bills of exchange system. It is therefore appropriate, in certain circumstances, for them to bear risks and losses associated with that system. To allocate losses to the drawer for having failed to identify and detect the fraud is inconsistent with the strict liability tort of conversion, which makes any negligence on the part of the drawer or the banks in preventing the fraud irrelevant. The Court has, in multiple decisions, provided a two\u2011step framework which outlines what a bank must prove to demonstrate that a payee is fictitious or non\u2011existing. ...\n\nNote that tenant would still owe the landlord rent. If the bank paid someone other than landlord then cheque wasn't properly honoured and so no longer satisfies the debt. So in the end the landlord would get paid, the tenant would only pay for the rent once, and the only bank would lose. That is, assuming the bank couldn't recover the money from the person who fraudulently cashed the cheque.\n\n(Note that banks in Canada make it very difficult for their customers to obtain compensation when the bank screws up, so what I've written above is only what should happen according to the law in theory. In practice the tenant will have to spend months going through the bank's arduous dispute resolution process, and only after that fails be able to go court to recover the money. Most tenants will give up before this and so will end up having to pay the rent twice.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, a tenant pays rent by check to their landlord.

TD Canada Trust, the bank bears ultimate responsibility in cases of fraudulently cashed checks. Banks are considered the primary beneficiaries of the bills of exchange system and are therefore expected to bear the risks and losses associated with it. The bank is liable for paying only the person the check was intended for, even in cases of theft or fraud. \n\nWhile the tenant still owes the landlord rent (as the debt wasn't properly satisfied due to the fraudulent cashing), and the landlord is entitled to receive the rent, it's the bank's responsibility to cover the loss from the fraudulently cashed check. The bank would need to reimburse the account and pursue recovery from the thief separately.\n\nIt's worth noting that while this is the legal theory, in practice, banks often make the dispute resolution process difficult, potentially leading to practical challenges for the affected parties in recovering their losses."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28695/can-anonymized-data-be-collected-under-gdpr-without-consent", "docs_id": 28695, "title": "Can anonymized data be collected under GDPR without consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am having an Android App in which I want to track the usage of the app. But the usage will not have anyone identity for eg.

And that child must be under the\n>  termination age, not be full\\-time employed, and must be dependent\n>  on you or Eugene for support.\n\nThe idea that Eugene must be dependent on Eugene for support is a bit nonsensical and contradicts the plainer fact that Eugene is identified at the very start as being a dependent. \n\nThere *is* a possible ambiguity regarding the scope of the \"not\\-employed (etc.)\" clause. The sentence identifies two kinds of \"children\": natural, adopted or step\\-children, and also a child that you are a legal guardian of. The question is whether the clause \"who is under the termination age, is not employed on a full\\-time basis and is dependent on you or your spouse for support\" refers to all of those kinds of dependents, or just the legal guardian type. There is an interpretive doctrine, the [last antecedent rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_antecedent_rule), which would say that the restrictor only applies to \"or a child for whom you or your spouse are the legal guardian\".

Which of the two laws is now the one that the contract has to adhere to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When an EU regulation or directive is replaced, the successor law will generally clarify that references to the old law should be interpreted as references to the successor law. That is also the case here.\n\n* The old law is Regulation (EU) No 531/2012\n* The successor law is Regulation (EU) 2022/612\n* The successor law contains the following article:\n\n> Article 23: Repeal\n> \n> \n> Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 is repealed.\n> \n> \n> References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex II.\n\nThat annex provides a mapping between articles in both laws.\n\nSo, if your contract references Regulation 531/2012, you can interpret that as a reference to Regulation 2022/612\\. If your contract mentions specific articles of the old regulation, you can use Annex II to find the corresponding articles in the new regulation.\n\nThis does not mean that the new regulation is necessarily applicable in your case. You mention that the dispute \u201cis\u201d from a time when the new law applied. However, the question is not when the dispute was raised, but when the alleged breaches occurred. If the matter were to be laid before a court, the court would apply the old law for breaches while the old law was in force, and the new law for those breaches while the new law was in force. This could lead to the same or distinct results. I haven't read the laws in question, so it could also be that these regulations apply to the formation of contracts and not conduct during those contracts, so that the old law might remain in effect until one contractual period is over (e.g. if you have a yearly contract that will renew on 2022\\-12\\-01, the old regulation *might* be applicable until then).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A telecommunications contract was signed on 01/12/2021, referencing EU Regulation 531/2012 in its terms and conditions.

Moreover, when I accepted this offer they were trying to pressure me into taking it and tried to make me decide within 2 hours of receiving the offer because they knew I had another very competitive offer. Had their offer not included overtime pay, the other offer would have been much better in comparison and I probably would have chosen that one. Lastly, the job description they sent me before they even sent the offer stated that my target hours are 45 hours a week, so they knew I'd be working overtime as well.\n\nYesterday, the agency called me and said that because I was classified as exempt, they weren't supposed to be paying me overtime and wouldn't be doing so going forward.

Do other countries have laws like these which block the use of dogs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The issue is more likely that there is no law or regulation allowing the use of dogs to sniff passengers in the US for matters not related to crime, whereas Dubai, a monarchy, has a different political system. In general, you have the constitutional right to move about in the U and the right not to be unreasonably seized, a right which may not exist in some other jurisdictions. That right can be restricted in accordance with law, but there has to be some such law. It is not a crime to have covid, or to travel while infected (it is a crime to carry bombs and drugs on a plane).\n\nOne area where there is some restriction is where there always has been a restriction, namely entry into the US. There is (was) [covid screening](https://www.dhs.gov/coronavirus/protecting-air-travelers-and-american-public) at certain airports for flights from certain countries. [This directive](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020-05606.pdf) indicates the airport restrictions, but does not explain what screening will take place. The above DHS site says that \"the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities. Passengers will then be given written guidance about COVID\\-19 and directed to their final destination, and immediately home\\-quarantine in accordance with CDC best practices\". It is not clear whether a mandatory temperature check without even reasonable suspicion of a crime would constitute an unreasonable search (body searches are subject to higher standards than property searches, it seems), and constitutional law surrounding searches has emphasized the primacy of privacy in search law, not the fact of physically entering property of the body. Some airlines and airports offer voluntary temperature checking, so it might be possible if someone has a covid\\-sniffing dog to offer voluntary sniff testing, especially if it is offered by a private concern and does not have the appearance of government mandate (which would require a law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, what is the primary legal obstacle to implementing coronavirus-sniffing dogs at airports, as seen in some other countries?\n\nA) Existing laws explicitly prohibit the use of dogs for medical detection purposes in public spaces.\nB) The absence of specific laws or regulations allowing such searches, coupled with constitutional protections against unreasonable seizures.\nC) Health privacy laws that prevent any form of medical screening without explicit consent.\nD) Federal aviation regulations that restrict the presence of animals in airport security areas.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The primary obstacle is not an explicit prohibition, but rather the lack of laws permitting such searches, combined with constitutional protections. In the US, citizens have the right to move freely and not be unreasonably seized, as guaranteed by the Constitution. Any restriction on these rights must be based on existing laws. Since having COVID-19 is not a crime, and there are no specific laws allowing for such searches, implementing coronavirus-sniffing dogs would likely be seen as an unconstitutional seizure without proper legal basis.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there are no specific laws prohibiting the use of dogs for medical detection; the issue is the lack of laws permitting it.\n\nAnswer C touches on privacy concerns but overstates the case. While health privacy is important, it's not the primary legal obstacle in this specific scenario.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while there are regulations about animals in airports, this is not the main legal issue preventing the implementation of COVID-sniffing dogs."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5835/canada-permanent-residency-express-entry-and-ontario-nominee-programs", "docs_id": 5835, "title": "Canada Permanent Residency: Express Entry and Ontario Nominee Programs", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is around 2 years that I have immigrated to Canada (Ontario).

The fact that the agency sent a contract after the work was completed suggests they may be aware of the ambiguity in the individual's status.

If the company under their control violates the rights of the minority shareholder(s), they are entitled to compensation from the majority shareholder(s) and/or the company, and they can and will sue them for that. Furthermore, any accounting irregularities, misrepresentations, faked reports, etc done during that process may easily push it from a mere civil claim into criminal charges.\n\nInvestor agreements and company bylaws\n--------------------------------------\n\n\"They can also kick the VC rep from the board since they own majority share.\" will be prevented by an investor rights agreement and modifications to the company charter and bylaws that mandate (for example) that a particular board seat will be controlled by that VC, and that this board seat will have a veto right over certain types of decisions \\- so the majority *can't* do whatever they want. The majority shareholders will also generally have a binding contractual agreement that they must vote in a particular way in certain aspects. \n\nDue diligence\n-------------\n\nA key part of most investment is due diligence review of the company current situation \\- the founders would be expected to agree to an invasive, thorough audit of their operations by the investors. This will include a review of any legal clauses, liabilities, etc. In addition, often the founders (personally) will be expected to sign so\\-called representations that affirm these details, and that they have disclosed all material aspects, and that they'll be personally liable for misrepresentations and omissions. In case of outright fraud (taking the money and running away) this will also be evidence in a criminal case that some misrepresentation was not just an accidental omission but an intentional act.\n\nTranches and clawback provisions\n--------------------------------\n\nIt's not that uncommon to have money disbursed in tranches conditional upon meeting certain provisions, and for any money that goes directly to founders it's not uncommon to see clawback provisions that state that the consequences of any misrepresentations will be taken out of these funds, possibly with large part of that money held in escrow for some time to cover that.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A venture capital firm is considering investing in a startup.

Apparently you are 25 hour short on that obligation, which may mean that you probably will be in breach of contract. I don't see what error there is w.r.t. the date: whatever the contract says, that is what you agreed to.\n\nPerhaps you are wholely responsible for the shortfall of hours, or perhaps the employer bears some responsibility (e.g. making it impossible for you to work). It sounds like the employer is offering you an accommodation so that you can fulfill the hours part of the contract, by extending the termination date. Technically, you also have to do the work by a particular date, but a reasonable delay in performance is standardly allowed under contract law, unless the contract has a \"time is of the essence\" clause which states that completion by the specific date is essential to the contract. If not, then there is reasonable flexibility in completion. Doing less than you contracted for, on the other hand, is not a standardly\\-available option.\n\nPursuant to the comment, it sort of sounds like the employer made it impossible to satisfy the conditions of the contract, and wants to use the end of contract date as a form of hardball to extract additional hours (i.e. \"we'll sue you for breach of contract for not having done this by the deadline, unless you agree to work an additional 15 hours\"). Hardcore deadlines without a time is of the essence clause don't support a claim for damages in case of minor delay, and even less so when the employer bears responsibility for the delay.

Make sure you have that landlord's statement *in writing* so you can file it in court if need be.\n\nThe option that involves suing the smoker has the purpose of making him responsible for the penalization if you breach the lease. There is no contract between you and the smoker\\-tenant, but his repeated violations of a clause of which he was aware clearly disrupt the enjoyment to which you as tenant are entitled (and ultimately your contract with the landlord). This type of claims is known as *tortious interference with relation*.\n\nPrior to suing the smoker, you might want to send him a *cease and desist letter* letting him know of the legal ramifications of his conduct.

How does my lawyer calculate a monetary amount on which to settle in the lawsuit? I saw a case recently of this variety, and the plaintiffs reached a settlement $1\\.3mil. How did the parties involved calculate $1\\.3mil exactly?\n\nI know this question is rather broad. *I am not asking for the correct amount to ask for when suing someone, for that is subjective and different for each case.* Rather, I am asking about the process.

One of the pieces of advice for patients is to see about getting the drug in a different formulation, as not all versions of Adderall are equally out of stock (Size of pill, extended release vs immediate release, etc.). Not knowing how quick or diligent my medial provider would be, I attempted to do my due diligence in finding out what would be in stock before contacting the prescriber, thus reducing the size of the task I was asking for.\n\nI was told by the pharmacy staff that since this was a schedule II drug, they could not share that information of what they had on stock with a patient. The only way to get that information would be for the provider to either send in an Rx for something that might not be on hand or for the provider to call the pharmacy and talk to them directly.\n\nI've been trying to determine if this is actually a law or just a store policy.

In that case, consumer groups sued to invalidate a Virginia law prohibiting pharmacists from disclosing the prices of their products to the general public. The state argued that \"purely commercial\" speech did not enjoy First Amendment protection, but the Supreme Court disagreed, holding that unless it is deceptive or misleading, commercial speech enjoys normal First Amendment protections:\n\n> Virginia is free to require whatever professional standards it wishes of its pharmacists; it may subsidize them or protect them from competition in other ways. ... But it may not do so by keeping the public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that competing pharmacists are offering. In this sense, the justifications Virginia has offered for suppressing the flow of prescription drug price information, far from persuading us that the flow is not protected by the First Amendment, have reinforced our view that it is.\n\n*Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council*, 425 U.S. 748, 770 (1976\\).\n\nI'd therefore assume this is just a matter of store policy.

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council established that commercial speech, including information about pharmaceutical products, is protected under the First Amendment unless it is false or misleading. The Court ruled that states cannot keep the public ignorant of lawful information about pharmaceutical products. Therefore, laws prohibiting pharmacies from disclosing inventory information about controlled substances would likely be deemed unconstitutional as they would suppress the flow of lawful commercial information, similar to the price disclosure prohibition struck down in the Virginia case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because public safety concerns, while important, do not automatically override First Amendment protections. Option C is incorrect because while states can regulate professional standards, they cannot do so by suppressing lawful commercial information.

The location is stored as the **technical identifier** of the subscriber's **network endpoint**, which basically identifies the \"internet cable\" installed at the subscriber's home.\n\n**Question 1\\. Are technical identifiers personal data?** Inside private company databases, they are definitely linked to subscriber data. They are also printed on invoices sent to the subscriber. But they are not public information.\n\n**Question 2\\. Can technical identifiers be stored in measurement devices?** The devices I made only measure a physical parameter, the network speed, for a given location in the company's IP network. I think this has nothing to do with the subscribers themselves.\n\nSomeone told me endpoint identifiers **should not be stored** in the devices, or at least **should be deleted after a while**, \"because of GDPR\". I think deleting the endpoint identifiers would make the measurements unusable, because the location of the measurement is very important for solving network problems. Delayed deletion is also problematic: if there is a 2nd speed problem months later, then it would be useful to have previous measurements at the same location. What should I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Question 1\\. Are technical identifiers personal data?\n\nYes. If they identify a person. For example an IP Address is considered personal data, because a person or household can be identified by an IP. Yes, I know that technically there are a lot of exceptions. But in general, if you have an IP, you can identify the subscriber given the right databases. So if your identifier, lets say a generated GUID, identifies a customer or something the customer can be linked to, it is personal data.\n\n> Question 2\\. Can technical identifiers be stored in measurement devices?\n\nJust because something is personal data, does not mean you are forbidden from using it. As long as you *need* it to do your job, you can store it. The internet would not work, if everybody was forbidden from storing any IP address.\n\nSo to summarize it: yes, it is personal data since it identifies a subscriber. However, it is needed for the job your subscriber asked you to do. So for as long as the job takes, it is legal to store it.\n\nOnce your job is done, you would be required to delete it.\n\n**But** consent trumps everything. If your subscriber consents to you keeping all data of such incidents to improve your network and handle future incidents better, then it's legal.

According to the information provided, HOAs in Georgia are bound by their governing documents (By-Laws and CC&Rs) when issuing citations to members. The law states that residents must \"comply with all lawful provisions of the property owners' association instrument,\" implying that if a specific violation is not mentioned in the HOA's governing documents, the HOA cannot issue a citation for it. In this case, since vandalism was not addressed in the HOA's governing documents, the HOA does not have the authority to issue a citation based solely on state law.

Your ability to assert that right is also not an absolute bar against being ordered to testify: if you are given immunity, you can be forced to testify.\n\nAlice cannot hold Bob in contempt \u2013 only the judge can. Bob can explain to the judge why a simple truthful \"yes\" or \"no\" answer is not possible, if he knows how to do that (does he understand the notion of a false presupposition, or unclarity?). He could for example assert truthfully that he does not understand the question (pointing to the distinction between \"Charlie's body falling on the vase, causing it to fall and break\", and \"Charlie acting with apparent intent to break the vase\", since it's not patently obvious that the former scenario constitutes \"breaking the vase\"). However (changing the scenario a bit), he has to understand that if the question is \"Did Charlie shoot Delilah?\" and the fact is that Ethan forced Charlie to shoot Delilah, saying \"No\" based on a theory of blame is not reasonably interpreted as truthful testimony.\n\nTaking the 5th, without setting forth your basis (not understanding the question) runs the risk that the prosecution will grant immunity from prosecution, and therefore you don't get to avoid answering the question.

Issuing work permits is dependent on meeting certain school criteria (grades, academic record, attendance, whatever the school wants). California has decided that parents may not issue work permits for home schooled kids.\n\n[You can read more about it on The HomeSchool Association of California's website](http://www.hsc.org/issuing-a-work-permit.html) along with the [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ct/we/workpermitsforstudents.asp). \n\nThe Employer can also decide not to hire minors (there is quite a bit of record\\-keeping, possible fines, and lengthy record\\-retention policies).

The correct answer is C because homeschooled students cannot obtain work permits unless they are part of a private school satellite program. The state has decided that parents may not issue work permits for homeschooled children. Work permits are typically issued by schools or private school satellite programs, which base their decision on certain criteria such as grades, academic record, and attendance. This restriction makes it difficult for traditionally homeschooled students to obtain work permits, limiting their employment opportunities until they graduate or enroll in a recognized educational institution."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43225/ice-detention-of-us-citizen", "docs_id": 43225, "title": "ICE Detention of US Citizen", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I hope that it is obvious from the questions my inquiry is **NOT** politically motivated, but seek to understand **how citizens can avoid repeating a similar long\\-term detention.**\n\nA US citizen was [detained for 23 days](https://thehill.com/latino/454991-us-citizen-released-by-ice-we-went-through-something-inhumane) by CBP.

They can also detain people in connection with civil violations of immigration status, but US citizens cannot commit violations of immigration status. Of course, if CBP does not believe the claim of citizenship, they will treat the person as an alien who is therefore potentially subject to civil immigration detention.\n\nThe constitution guarantees a right to a speedy trial. That prevents (is supposed to prevent) indefinite detention of those suspected of crimes. I do not know what procedural guarantees exist for aliens in civil detention to prevent indefinite detention, nor whether a claim of US citizenship would affect the procedure.\n\n> Absent any indication of a crime or violation, does CBP have the authority to detain a US citizen if presented with proper identification documentation (passport card, passport)?\n\nNo. Absent any indication of crime or violation, they can't detain anyone except under specific circumstances for a very limited period of time. Specifically, they can stop people at Martinez Fuerte checkpoints, and they can stop people who are entering the country from foreign territory. In both cases, they need justification to hold them for more than a few minutes.\n\n> What obligation does CBP have to process a detained US citizen in a timely manner?\n\nThe same obligations that apply to anyone detained in connection with a crime, arising out of the speedy trial guarantee in the US constitution.\n\n> Does CBP \\\\ ICE have jurisdiction or authority to demand ID from citizens in a non\\-border or non\\-airport context?\n\nMore or less. If an officer charged with enforcing immigration law has reasonable suspicion that someone claiming to be a US citizen is not, the officer can ask the US citizen for evidence of citizenship. If the US citizen does not provide it, the officer can detain the US citizen while investigating the claim of citizenship. Remember, this is true only if there is a reasonable suspicion that the US citizen is lying.\n\n> Did the citizen do anything to warrant the detention?\n\nProbably not all 23 days. It looks like someone is trying to cover something up since they claimed that he never said he was a US citizen even though they seem to have filed a complaint alleging that he presented a falsified US birth certificate.\n\n> Is there anything the citizen could have done at the checkpoint to avoid detention?\n\nIt is hard to know without knowing more about what happened or definitely whether he was detained for civil immigration violations or for a crime. If the former only, a US passport might have helped.\n\n> If the citizen refused to answer CBP questions, could this produce a better outcome?\n\nI don't see how it would have.\n\n> Once detained, what could the citizen do to reduce the detention duration?\n\nIt sounds like not much in addition to what he did. Getting before an immigration judge should have resulted in his release, but immigration judges are very overloaded these days, I believe.\n\n> What are the lessons learned for other citizens?\n\nIt really seems to depend. Don't hang out with your out\\-of\\-status brother might be one. Get and carry a passport might be one. Move north might be one.

I'm interested in the theoretical here: if they have actual grounds.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **theoretical** is that the domain slutsofinstagram.com *does dilute or harm* Instagram's mark because of the use of \"Instagram\" in the domain and because of the unwanted association of the parody story; that's the theory and \"grounds\" that Instagram would use in their lawsuit.\n\nInstagram would have to prove their theory of dilution or harm to the jury or judge, and convince either that the harm is not theoretical but real and financially damaging in order to win their case. The owners of slutsofinstagram.com would have to defend themselves and argue that they are not damaging Instagram's mark and their parody is a parody and is protected as such.\n\nAny actual court outcome is also theoretical. If Instagram won their case, one of the legal remedies could be the court ordering the owner of slutsofinstagram.com to transfer ownership of the domain to Instagram so they could simply park the domain and effectively take down the parody story. Or, the owner of slutsofinstagram.com could prevail because they argued the fact \\- and the court agreed \\- that the domain name and creative contents of the site is a parody and is protected speech and doesn't dilute Instagram's mark because any reasonable person could see that the site is a parody and not related to Instagram.\n\nIn the US, a possible example of a parody not diluting a mark is [L.L.

Instagram can indeed contest the use of the domain name, citing potential dilution or harm to their trademark. However, the outcome is not guaranteed and would depend on several factors.

The mark is being used to refer to, or **name**, the product (or service). It is not being used to sell a similar product, or anything else. No reasonable person could take it to indicate that the trademark owner has endorsed the person making the statement, nor that there is any sort of affiliation. \n\n[This page](https://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/Fair-Use-of-TrademarksNL.aspx) from the International Trademark Association describes the concept. \n\nThis concept is sometimes called \"fair use\" by analogy with the concept in US copyright law, but that term is not strictly accurate. It is better to simply say \"nominative use\" or \"descriptive use\". \n\nDigital Media Law's page on [\"Using the trademarks of others\"](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others) says:\n\n> As a general matter, if you are reporting on, commenting on, or criticizing a trademark owner, most ordinary consumers will not be confused about whether the company or organization is the source or sponsor of your work. You can reduce the likelihood of confusion further by avoiding a website design that looks like the trademark owner's site or resembles its product packaging, and you should never festoon your website with a company's logo (but isolated use when relevant to a discussion is OK)\n\n...\n\n> If someone threatens you with a lawsuit or sues you for trademark dilution, then a lack of consumer confusion will not help you. Here, one obvious line of defense is to argue that there is no likelihood of dilution. Federal and state dilution law protects a trademark owner against the whittling away of the distinctiveness of its famous trademark by association with other goods or services; it does not give a trademark owner the right to shut down all unflattering speech about it. If you do not associate a famous trademark with your own goods or services, then there can be no dilution (or at least that's how your argument goes).\n\n...\n\n> The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1\\) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2\\) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3\\) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits. The federal dilution statute, found at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c)(3\\)(A), also makes nominative fair use a complete defense to trademark dilution claims.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small software company, TechInnovate, wants to mention on their website that their CEO previously worked on a project that resulted in Microsoft acquiring a startup called CloudWave.

This scenario falls under the concept of nominative fair use. TechInnovate is using the trademarks (Microsoft and CloudWave) to refer to the actual companies in a factual statement, not to sell a product or imply any endorsement. As long as TechInnovate uses only as much of the marks as necessary to identify the companies and does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement, this use is protected.

(I know the question asked about the UK, I just happen to know the US copyright rule.) It would seem on the face of it to include independent research on a subject totally unrelated to the person's employment, done off the company's premises and not during normal work hours, but while the person was an employee.. Indeed it would arguably include the copyright to a novel written off premises and during off hours. \n\nUse of \"course of employment\" (instead of \"term\") would improve the provision. so would \"as a part of his or her employment\" or \"closely related to the subject of his or her employment\". Another possible restriction would be \"Using the Company's facilities and/or equipment, or during normal working hours\".\n\nHowever, my experience is that an employer will have drafted whatever language it uses through its company lawyer, and will be quite unwilling to alter it in any way.

Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 99\\-100\\). A third\u2014unilateral declarations\u2014has also been recognized, but it is less well developed as a source (see Currie at p. 111\\-117; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France)*, [\\[1974] I.C.J. Rep. 253](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/58/058-19741220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf), [p. 266](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/58/058-19741220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf#page=18)):\n\n> It is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with the declaration. An undertaking of this kind, if given publicly, and with an intent to be bound, even though not made within the context of international negotiations, is binding. In these circumstances, nothing in the nature of a *quid pro quo* nor any subsequent acceptance of the declaration, nor even any reply or reaction from other States, is required for the declaration to take effect, since such a requirement would be inconsistent with the strictly unilateral nature of the juridical act by which the pronouncement by the State was made.\n\n### Treaties\n\nTreaties (also sometimes called \"conventions\", \"charters\", \"covenants\", \"protocols\", \"pacts\", \"acts\", \"statutes\", or \"agreements\" (Currie, p. 125\\)) express the will of the parties to be bound by their terms. The law of treaties is itself largely governed by a treaty: the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). The *Vienna Convention* describes the ratification process and how treaties come into force. It specifies that treaties are binding upon the parties and that treaties must be performed in good faith.\n\n### Customary International Law\n\nIt is also widely recognized that there exists customary international law that creates or reflects binding obligations on states. For something to be customary international law, a rule must satisfy two elements (see Currie, p. 188\\):\n\n1. general and uniform state practice; and\n2. *opinio juris* (the requirement that states believe that the rule is legally obligatory).\n\nSee also *Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya*, [2020 SCC 5](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18169/index.do):\n\n> \\[77] There are two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such: general but not necessarily universal practice, and opinio juris, namely the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation. \\[citations omitted]\n> \n> \n> \\[78] To meet the first requirement, the practice must be sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent. To meet the second requirement, opinio juris, the practice \u201cmust be undertaken with a sense of legal right or obligation\u201d, as \u201cdistinguished from mere usage or habit.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n> \n> \n> \\[80] When an international practice develops from being intermittent and voluntary into being widely accepted and believed to be obligatory, it becomes a norm of customary international law.\n> \n> \n> \\[82] Once a practice becomes a norm of customary international law, by its very nature it \u201cmust have equal force for all members of the international community, and cannot therefore be the subject of any right of unilateral exclusion exercisable at will by any one of them in its own favour.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n\n### *Jus cogens*\n\nThere are some elements of customary international law that are \"non\\-derogable\" (Currie, p. 206; [*Vienna Convention*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf), art. 53\\). These are called *jus cogens* or *peremptory norms*. These cannot be derogated from even by treaty. See *Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya*, [2020 SCC 5](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18169/index.do):\n\n> \\[83] Within customary international law, there is a subset of norms known as jus cogens, or peremptory norms, which have been \u201caccepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole . . . from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.\u201d This Court acknowledged that \u201ca peremptory norm, or jus cogens norm is a fundamental tenet of international law that is non\\-derogable.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n\n### Relationship to domestic law\n\nTreaties do not change domestic law. States must take actions in good faith towards implementing treaties in their domestic law. This is known as the *dualist* approach.\n\nHowever, even in countries that take a dualist approach to treaty implementation, the dominant approach to customary international law is that it is directly and automatically incorporated into domestic law (see *Nevsun*, paras. 86\\-89, in particular the empirical study of Professors Pierre\\-Hugues Verdier and Mila Versteeg cited at para. 88\\):\n\n> \\[P]erhaps the most striking pattern that emerges from our data is that in virtually all states, CIL \\[Customary International Law] rules are in principle directly applicable without legislative implementation. . . . \\[M]ost countries that require treaty implementation do not apply the same rule to international custom, but rather apply it directly.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about sources of binding international law is NOT correct?\n\nA) Customary international law requires both general state practice and opinio juris to be considered binding.\n\nB) Treaties are only binding on states that have ratified them, while customary international law applies to all states.\n\nC) Unilateral declarations by states can create binding legal obligations if made with the intention to be bound.\n\nD) Jus cogens norms can be derogated from by treaty if all parties agree.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: Customary international law indeed requires both general state practice and opinio juris (the belief that the practice is legally obligatory) to be considered binding.\n\nB is correct: Treaties are only binding on states that have ratified them, while customary international law is generally considered to apply to all states once established.\n\nC is correct: The International Court of Justice has recognized that unilateral declarations can create binding legal obligations if made publicly and with the intention to be bound.\n\nD is incorrect: Jus cogens norms, also known as peremptory norms, are non-derogable. This means they cannot be derogated from even by treaty. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties explicitly states that treaties conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law are void."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60224/how-to-determine-what-frequency-of-gdpr-sar-is-not-excessive", "docs_id": 60224, "title": "How to determine what frequency of GDPR SAR is not excessive?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Repeat Subject Access Requests are limited in frequency by the [Manifestly unfounded and excessive requests rules](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-law-enforcement-processing/individual-rights/manifestly-unfounded-and-excessive-requests/). The critical bit seems to be \"A request may be excessive if it: repeats the substance of previous requests and a reasonable interval has not elapsed\". This is clarified \"how often the data is altered \u2013 if information is unlikely to have changed between requests, you may decide you do not need to respond to the same request twice.\" [The actual legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/53/enacted) says even less, but does say that it up to the controller to show that it is excessive.\n\nI was in the process of setting up a cron job to make an SAR to the DVLA requesting a list of organisations that have received my data. This is to know about claims such as parking fines being made under the [Protection of Freedoms Act 2012](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protection-of-freedoms-bill) when something goes wrong with the letters sent. I thought I had read that every 3 months was considered \"not excessive\" but I cannot find that now.\n\nI can think of 2 ways to make this decision, depending on what factors are important in the definition:\n\n* If the important factor is the use to which the data is to be put, then there is timing defined by the act, and this gives 14 days for a letter to be posted, received, acted upon than the response posted and received. I would say in this context 7 days would not be excessive for a process that could be completely automated.\n* If the important factor is \"information is unlikely to have changed between requests\" then I would take the distribution of information sharing events in the response to the 1st request, put them into a bayesian model and make requests at the frequency of the low end of the 95% credible interval of getting a change in the time period. It is quite possible, depending on the frequency of information sharing events , the time period for which information is provided as well as the model and prior, that this would be less than 7 days.\n\nI either case I would provide this rational in the initial data request, as well as informing them of my intention to make these follow up requests. It would then be up to the data controller to demonstrate that my rules are manifestly excessive.\n\nAs well as the DVLA, a similar argument could be made for many other organisations such as credit reference agencies. Many people may be interested in making these requests if it was demonstrated useful.\n\nAs a data subject, what aspects should be considered when making these decisions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no specific criteria for deciding whether a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, because this depends very much on context. The ICO has given some clarifications, but they still won't tell you an allowed frequency of requests.\n\nWe (as data subjects) should not invent particular criteria because they would be only our opinion. In any case, the data controller would have burden of proof to show that a request was indeed manifestly unfounded or excessive. That means that a data controller will generally err on the side of caution and allow repeated requests. But that doesn't mean you won't get pushback on your proposed frequency.\n\nI think your proposed approach is likely to be *both* unfounded and excessive.\n\nA controller has one month to respond to your request. Sending off a request while a previous request is still pending would likely demonstrate an excessive frequency of requests. Even if the data controller responds more quickly, it is doubtful whether that would entitle you to more frequent updates. Since the data controller will inform you about important events with a letter, this weakens your need to make frequent requests.\n\nYour \u201cBayesian model\u201d is also flawed, both in content and application. As your prior, you expect a very high rate of events. However, a normal citizen would expect to receive a parking fine approximately never. Your model should more correctly be based around the probability of missing an event, while also accounting for letters (which generally do arrive in time). It might also be incorrect to use *your* circumstances as the basis for determining a reasonable frequency. The ICO suggests multiple factors (nature of the data, purposes of processing, how often the data is altered, relationship with other GDPR rights). These factor's generally relate to the controller's processing, but not to your individual circumstances.\n\nNext, your requests seem unfounded: the purpose of your requests is not aligned with the GDPR, and automated requests raise doubt about whether the request is valid.\nYour motivation to make the requests is \u201cto know about claims such as parking fines \\[\u2026] when something goes wrong with the letters sent\u201d. This is a fairly speculative reason since letters generally do arrive well. In contrast, the GDPR provides for the right to access \u201cin order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing\u201d (Recital 63\\). You are not claiming the right to access for the purpose of verification and to obtain information about the processing, instead you're abusing the GDPR rights to create a kind of API that auto\\-updates.\n\nSo, is three months a hard and fast rule? Definitely not, but it seems like an unobjectionable, reasonable frequency. If a data controller thinks a request every three months is excessive, you'll likely be able to push back successfully. But with more frequent requests, you're entering a grey area. Here, it becomes increasingly likely that the controller is able to demonstrate that your requests are invalid.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A data subject plans to make frequent Subject Access Requests (SARs) to the DVLA for information about organizations that have received their data. Which of the following approaches is most likely to be considered acceptable under GDPR guidelines?\n\nA) Setting up an automated system to send SARs every 7 days based on a Bayesian model of expected data changes\nB) Making SARs every 3 months\nC) Sending a new SAR immediately after receiving a response to the previous one\nD) Making daily SARs to ensure no information is missed\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This approach is likely to be considered both excessive and unfounded. The high frequency and automated nature of the requests could be seen as an abuse of GDPR rights, and the Bayesian model may not align with the data controller's processing patterns.\n\nB) This is the most reasonable approach. While there's no hard and fast rule, a three-month interval between requests is likely to be seen as unobjectionable and reasonable by most data controllers. It allows sufficient time for potential changes in data while not overwhelming the system.\n\nC) This approach doesn't account for the processing time allowed for data controllers. They have up to one month to respond to a SAR, so sending a new request immediately after receiving a response could be seen as excessive.\n\nD) Daily requests would almost certainly be considered excessive. This frequency is far too high for typical data processing and would likely be seen as an unreasonable burden on the data controller.\n\nThe correct answer (B) strikes a balance between the data subject's right to access information and the data controller's ability to process requests without undue burden. It also aligns more closely with the GDPR's intent of allowing subjects to verify the lawfulness of data processing rather than creating a real-time data feed."}}
