The meeting starts at 9 AM and is expected to last until 5 PM. The employee requests to stay overnight in a hotel the night before, citing the early start time and long drive. The employer refuses, stating it's unnecessary. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employer is within their rights to refuse the hotel stay as it's not considered a reasonable expense for a 3-hour drive.\n\nB) The employee can insist on the hotel stay and the employer must reimburse them, as any travel over 2 hours automatically qualifies for overnight accommodation.\n\nC) The reasonableness of the hotel stay would be determined objectively, considering factors such as industry practice, the employee's role, and the length of the workday.\n\nD) The employee can file a complaint with the California Labor Board, who will make an immediate ruling on whether the hotel stay is necessary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the reasonableness of work-related expenses is an objective legal standard. It's not solely based on what the employer or employee thinks, but rather on various factors that would be considered by a trier of fact (judge or jury) if the dispute went to court. These factors include industry practice, the employee's role, the length of the workday, and other relevant circumstances. In this case, a 3-hour drive for an 8-hour workday starting early in the morning could potentially justify an overnight stay, but it's not automatically guaranteed or prohibited. The reasonableness would be determined by objectively considering all relevant factors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes a fixed rule about what's reasonable for a 3-hour drive, which isn't supported by the information given. Option B is incorrect because there's no mention of a 2-hour rule for automatic qualification of overnight stays. Option D is incorrect because while the California Labor Board might get involved in a dispute, they wouldn't make an immediate ruling, and the process would likely involve negotiation or other resolution attempts before reaching that stage."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33508/is-it-legal-to-sell-products-whose-design-uses-titles-of-copyrighted-songs", "docs_id": 33508, "title": "Is it legal to sell products whose design uses titles of copyrighted songs?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are some similar questions here, but I believe mine is a little different.

Can I withdraw my consent for marketing specifically?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under the GDPR, consent is not the only legal basis that allows processing of your personal data. Other legal bases such as *legitimate interest* exist as well. So the question is: does the company have a legitimate interest to send you these emails?\n\nThe answer is that this case is more about direct marketing, less about personal data. The circumstances under which direct marketing emails can be sent are covered by the ePrivacy directive, which is implemented in the UK via PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003\\).\n\nPECR and ePrivacy introduce a concept known as *soft opt\\-in*:\n\n> where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use.\n> \n> \n> (ePrivacy Directive, Art 13(2\\))\n\nIn plain language, they are allowed to send unsolicited marketing emails to existing customers, under the following restrictions:\n\n* this only applies to customer relationships\n* the marketing must be for similar products or services\n* you must be able to object to further messages, i.e. unsubscribe\n* upon collection of contact details you were given the opportunity to opt out", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer rents a bicycle from a bike-sharing company through their app. The company then starts sending marketing emails to the customer.

The email itself was a short blurb similar to the \"We've updated our terms of service\" emails, with a link to a document describing what was actually going on. The document itself is an \"Arbitration and Waiver of class action.\" The effective date is defined as \"the 61st day after we provide ... \\[this notice] to you.\" You have the option to opt out, in writing to a P.O. box. If you don't jump through these hoops \"you will be deemed to have consented to \\[arbitration].\" There is also a clause that it is retroactively enforceable if the claims \"relate to conduct that happened \\[before this notice].\"\n\nIt seems ludicrous to me that the process is\n\n1.

No mention of what information to include, and I hope you have envelopes and stamps at the ready otherwise there's another hoop to jump through.\n\nThis feels to me like getting people to agree to contracts they've never seen. Can the bank do this? Are companies allowed to create contracts with anything they want in them, and apply them to you because you didn't read an email and subsequently jump through 5 hoops? Is this practice legally enforceable? How does this differ from me dropping off a letter in all my neighbors mailboxes stating that if they don't come to my place with an engraved card stating intent to opt\\-out, they're agreeing to send me $100 per month for eternity? What do you mean, they had the chance to opt\\-out!\n\nThe actual notice [here](https://www.macu.com/about/disclosures/arbitration-notice).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For a contract to be valid, there needs to be \"consideration\" given to both sides, which is legalese for \"something of value\", including money, credit, service or goods. In the case of your neighbors, you are not giving them any consideration\n\nWith your bank, you are engaged in a contract, with each of you receiving consideration. Generally, you get consideration in the form of a) safekeeping of your money, b) transfer service of your money (electronically and in the form of checks), and c) interest, however good or pitiful it may be. You bank generally gets consideration in the form of a) any fees you pay and b) the right to use your money in fractional reserve banking to make loans to other people.\n\nGenerally, with a bank contract, there is generally no temporal binding on your relationship; by which I mean, there is no penalty (with perhaps the loss of a promotional interest rate) if you were to withdraw all of your funds today without any notice and close your account. (Though some savings account have withdrawal delays that the bank may or may not choose to invoke, but that is more for avoiding \"runs\" more than anything else). \n\nHowever, a bank can also choose to stop doing business with you, close your account, and give you your money, ending the relationship. Because you don't have a temporal binding in your contract, it can do so at any time. It can also refuse to do business with you under the existing terms, and only continue business on new terms.\n\nFor example, lets say that you have a lawn, and we have a contract (noting that a contract need not necessarily be written down) that I come by every Saturday and Tuesday morning and mow it, for which you pay me $20 a week. At any time, I could refuse to continue under the current terms, and demand new ones, which you could acquiesce to, refuse, or make a counter offer. So if I came to you and demanded $40 dollars a week, you could agree, refuse (and either end the contract or continue offering $20 a week for two days mowing), or counter offer, perhaps offering $30 or my only coming on Saturdays to mow the lawn for the original $20\\.\n\nEDIT: Note that this process doesn't work with a loan, because with a loan, there is technically only a single transaction: the lender trades the one\\-time consideration of the loan (money) for the borrower's binding promise to repay the money, by a specified schedule with a specified rate of interest.\n\n**You actually have three options here**: accept the new terms, send a letter to opt out, or stop using the service and terminate the contract that you have in place with your bank (which *should* be relatively simple and painless, EDIT: Unless you have a loan, but if you did, said loan would almost certainly not be affected by the change in terms, as one side cannot unilaterally change a loan contract). The reason for the opt out clauses is that binding arbitration clauses are under fire, with many (myself included) believing that they infringe on important rights. The opt\\-out clause, which gives you the option not be bound by the clause if you take action, is intended to be more palatable to judges, who might otherwise be more inclined to strike the contract in its entirety or otherwise create precedent hostile to arbitration.\n\nAs for the required format of the opt\\-out notice: yes, they are intentionally making it difficult for you to file it; however, they have chosen a format that is judicially recognized and until very recently, was the default means of judicially recognized communication. It was only in the last few years that courts have allowed for text messages, emails, etc. to be used for official court communications, such as summons, subpoenas and other serviced documents.

This is part of the standard procedure to ensure safety during demolition.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation states that laws regarding building demolitions and disconnection of utilities are very local in nature, varying by city or county.\n\nAnswer B is false because while the documentation mentions that permits and building codes can be minimal in rural areas, it also states that they can still exist. It does not exempt rural areas entirely from these requirements.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the documentation does not state that the local fire department is solely responsible for overseeing utility disconnection.

As I understand it they only keep my credit data for 6 years, but I would expect them to keep sales data for much longer. Say they know that they sold a large dataset to a third party 20 years ago, and cannot definitively say my data was not included. Are they required to give me details of this transaction? What if they had a potential data breach 20 years ago, would they be required to give details of this? Is there any particular language I should use in my SAR to make sure this is included?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In principle, the data subject's right to access involves a copy of all personal data the controller holds on them. There are no time limits by default. Of course, the controller can ask a data subject to clarify their request, e.g. to focus on a particular time frame.\n\nThere is an implied time limit though: personal data may only be processed/stored for as long as the data is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. Afterwards, it must be deleted. A controller with good data management will be able to limit their effort by having as short retention periods as possible for their different records.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of data is not personal data, or falls out of scope of the GDPR because it is not processed with automated means or forms part of a filing system. For example, if thousands of old invoices were archived in paper form in boxes that are only sorted by year, there might be an argument that this isn't a filing system in the sense of the GDPR and that a DSAR would not have to involve looking through all the archived invoices (compare also Art 11\\).\n\nIn your scenario, there is a clear retention period of six years. You are asking for records about how that data might have been used further in the past. To the degree that such data is actually available, that could reasonably be personal data and should be included in a response to a DSAR.\n\n* E.g. they might have information like this: \u201cFile \\#1234 was included in a data set that was sold to EvilCorp in 2007\\. The entries in File \\#1234 that are older than 2014 have been purged, so we do not know which entries were included in the data set. The current name on File \\#1234 is Dave.\u201d This information about the sale would be personal data because it relates to you, and you are identifiable. Of course, the controller might not be set up to perform this search unless specifically asked.\n* However, more unspecific information might not be personal data. For example: \u201cAbout 70% of our files were included in a data set that was sold to EvilCorp in 2007\\. We no longer have records indicating whether your file was included.\u201d Since there is no link between the sale and your personal data, I don't think it would have to be included in a DSAR response.\n\nThe primary reason why you should be told about sales of personal data is that per Art 15(1\\)(c), you should be informed about \u201cthe recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed\u201d in a DSAR response.\n\nSo when making a data subject access request, it could make sense to explicitly referencing this paragraph. So you would be interested in receiving a copy of your personal data as per Art 15 GDPR, and in particular any available information per Art 15(1\\)(c) GDPR about the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your personal data has been or may have been disclosed in the past.\n\nQuite likely the response will be underwhelming, e.g. by just giving a broad category such as \u201cpotential creditors who are contractually obligated to use the data only in accordance with our policies\u201d.

Controllers are required to provide a copy of all personal data they hold on the data subject, regardless of its age, as long as they still possess it.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the 6-year limit mentioned in the example is specific to credit data retention and is not a general rule for all personal data under GDPR.\n\nAnswer C, while containing an element of truth (as the documentation mentions that unorganized paper records might not constitute a \"filing system\" under GDPR), is not the most accurate answer to the question about historical data in general.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while controllers should inform about recipients of personal data, including past disclosures, there's no specific requirement to report all historical data breaches in a SAR response.\n\nThe key point is that if the controller still holds personal data, regardless of its age, it should be included in the SAR response, unless it falls under specific exceptions or is not considered personal data under GDPR definitions."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6007/my-software-outputs-to-another-companys-proprietary-file-format-legal", "docs_id": 6007, "title": "My software outputs to another company&#39;s proprietary file format; legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: is there a general answer to whether it contravenes DMCA or copyright protection to have a piece of my software output to another company's proprietary file format?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't see why it would be illegal. For example, Microsoft was even forced to publish file formats, which would be rather pointless if you couldn't output to that file format. \n\nThere was the situation where compressing images to the .gif format had legal problems because the compression algorithm was patented, but someone found a way to output images to the .gif file format without doing any compression, which turned out to be absolutely legal and not covered by that patent. \n\nWhen you output to a file format, you are not copying any information of the company. In the extreme case that the file format requires you to copy such information (for example if the file format requires that the first line of the file is \"This file format may only be used by ABC company.

What seems to be at issue here is whether you have a property right to \"access\" to the university, as an alumnus. Legal protection of alumnus rights is pretty minimal, contrasted with student or employee rights. There could be a line in the sand pertaining to whether you've paid for something, or are the privileges that you've enjoyed simple part of a PR stunt? If you pay the university for access to university facilities (borrower privileges, for example) then it would be harder to revoke that privilege. Most universities grant a certain level of added privilege, such as an alumnus email account, without any requirement to pay. (They hope to create some good will which translates into donations). So it would really depend on what the basis is for claiming access to university resources, as an alumnus.\n\nThere is no general obligation of a university to grant alumni various privileges, but they may have created a reasonable expectation and legal right to such privileges, as part of their advertising: that can only be judged by looking at all of the facts. There might be rules within the university which address alumni, so obviously reading the university rules is important. That is really how you would determine whether the coordinator is overstepping her authority.\n\nIf the university admits that it no longer has jurisdiction over you, then that *might* be the end of the case, unless that was an error based on less than the totality of the facts. If an accused completely and irrevocably severs relations with a university, the university would have no power over the accused. If there is still a relationship, or if the severance is revocable (i.e. you can become a student again), the university retains some power over an accused.\n\nIf a student violates the federal regulations pertaining to sex discrimination, the university could be in trouble if they do not address the situation. If the accused leaves the university for a quarter, that does not erase past acts, so the university could be in trouble if they don't address the situation in case of an intervening term off. Thus a legally\\-viable option would be for a university to permanently remove (unprotected) relations with an accused \u2013 not access to transcripts, because of FERPA, but certainly the right to re\\-enroll or the right to use the library as an alumnus.\n\nAgain, though, it would depend on what the university rules say. It is highly unlikely that the coordinator has the authority to find facts and mete out punishment (determine that an accused did the act), and this is usually determined by a committee, subject to approval by higher administration. However, an administrator does have the right to limit an individual's relationship to the university in a manner that protects the university's interest. For example, in the event that a person is accused of sexual harassment, the university can temporarily relieve a person of teaching and advising duties, until the case is resolved and there has been a final finding of fact. In general, universities are very protective of their interests and will absolutely squash anything that they think will get them into legal trouble. All that is necessary is that there be a credible basis for the claim \u2013 often, that means simply \"an accusation\". If a complainant vigorously pursues a case, the university could be in trouble because the law allows punishment (loss of funds) in case of a single past violation of the regulations. Their interest therefore is being sure that they have remediated the situation (the stronger course of action), or the complainant has given up (risky since the complainant can change their mind).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A university alumnus has been accused of stalking by a current student.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the university's authority in this situation?\n\nA) The university has no jurisdiction over alumni and must immediately cease all investigations and reinstate privileges.\n\nB) The university can only investigate if the alumnus agrees to be treated as an employee again.\n\nC) The university has full authority to investigate and revoke alumni privileges without any justification or due process.\n\nD) The university may have the right to investigate and limit alumni privileges, but the extent of their authority depends on specific university policies and any reasonable expectations created for alumni.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate because it reflects the nuanced nature of the situation. The university's authority over alumni is not absolute, but it's also not non-existent. The extent of their power depends on several factors:\n\n1. University policies: The specific rules and regulations of the institution regarding alumni rights and disciplinary procedures.\n2. Reasonable expectations: Any promises or implied rights given to alumni through advertising or longstanding practices.\n3. Nature of the accusation: Universities have obligations under federal regulations to address issues like sex discrimination, which may extend to alumni in some cases.\n4. Protective measures: Universities can take temporary actions to protect their interests while an investigation is ongoing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because universities do retain some authority over alumni, especially in cases involving current students or serious allegations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the university's authority doesn't solely depend on the alumnus's agreement to be treated as an employee.\n\nOption C is too extreme, as universities typically need some justification and often have procedural requirements for taking action against alumni."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9490/is-listening-to-a-song-or-watching-a-music-video-on-youtube-legal-if-yes-is-sp", "docs_id": 9490, "title": "Is listening to a song or watching a music video on YouTube legal?

If copyrighted content is uploaded to YouTube and matched against the Content ID database, YouTube will either\n\n* block access to the content\n* show adverts with the video for the copyright holder to earn revenue\n* allow the video with no advertising\n\nwhere the action to take is decided by the copyright holder. As such, the copyrighted content is perfectly legal and explicitly permitted for use in the video by the copyright holder (this system even applies to other videos that use the copyrighted content as, for example, background music \\- personally I had some song parodies recorded over the original backing tracks that were caught by the same system).\n\nVevo is a specific service for music producers to upload their own music to an \"official\" channel. If you see a Vevo channel and it's got the \"verified\" check mark next to it then you can be certain that it's an official channel operated by or on behalf of the original content producers.\n\nFor content not present in the Content ID database or identified by the Content ID system, I'm not sure what the legality is. YouTube has typically operated on a policy of \"hold no responsibility for illegal content and wait for the copyright holder to request takedown\", which they will then honour.\n\nIn any case, you cannot be in legal trouble for watching/listening to copyrighted content on YouTube. The legal responsibility falls on YouTube for distributing the content to you, and on the original uploader for copying and uploading the content. AFAIK copyright laws apply to the person *producing* a copy (either modified or unmodified) of the copyrighted content or *providing* a copy to someone else, not the person *receiving* or *consuming* the content. Watching a video online does not constitute producing a copy (downloading does, however).\n\nIt's also very likely that your use of the copyrighted content would fall under fair use (this applies particularly to the \"take screenshots of it\" part), as it is private and non\\-commercial use for study/educational purposes.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student is assigned to listen to a song on YouTube and take screenshots for a school project.

YouTube's Content ID system allows copyright holders to decide how their content is used on the platform, often permitting viewing.\n2. The legal responsibility for copyright compliance on YouTube typically falls on the platform and the content uploader, not the viewer.\n3.

How could they make it happen?\n\nOf course, they could abolish the federal death penalty with an ordinary act of legislation, and the President could pardon or commute the sentences of all federal prisoners on death row. But 31 states also provide for the death penalty, and in principle, Congress does not have the power to change their laws (Tenth Amendment). Let us suppose that those 31 states (and their legislatures, governors, courts, etc) are intent on preserving the death penalty, so that a Constitutional amendment to abolish it would not be ratified by 3/4 of state legislatures as required.\n\nThe Supreme Court could effectively abolish it by ruling that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment (which also applies to the states via the [incorporation doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights) and the Fourteenth Amendment).

Moreover, the justices thus appointed could change their minds.\n* The President's power of clemency only extends to federal crimes, right? He/she has no power to pardon crimes under state law, nor to order state prisoner reprieved.

Currently, the Supreme Court chooses which cases it reviews, this law would force the Supreme Court to review each death penalty case. Congress could also mandate that an automatic stay of execution would be issued upon appeal. Then Congress could mandate that such a stay continue until a petition for rehearing is denied.

That is not regulated in FCC rules, it falls directly from the copyright law: because the material is not fixed, it is not copyrighted in the first place. That is, if nobody fixed or fixes the transmission, nobody owns them. That doesn't mean the contents are public domain:\n\n**However** the contents of the transmission can be under copyright anyway and transmitting them might be copyright infringement (aka [\"Radio Piracy\" or \"Pirate Radio\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_radio)): you could play a recording of a song via amateur radio, which is under copyright, or you could read a book which is under copyright, and that would violate the author's copyrights if you don't have license to do so. But even if you *have* a license, transmitting does not put the materials into the public domain: it is a fixed expression (replayed on amateur band) and thus copyrighted.\n\nNothing in copyright law would turn a transmitted copyrighted material into the public domain \\- that requires an express release into it.\n\nBut it's complicated...\n-----------------------\n\nNow, it gets *really* complicated if we introduce simultaneously fixing the material.

One Canadian dollars \\= 0\\.77 U.S. dollars. The monetary claim limits in U.S. dollars in Canadian courts (at this rate) are as follows:\n\nThe Civil Division of the Provincial Court of Alberta hears claims up to $50,000\\. ($38,500 USD)\n\nThe Civil Resolution Tribunal hears claims up to $5,000 ($3,850 USD) The Provincial Court of British Columbia\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims from $5,001 to $35,000 ($26,950 USD)\n\nThe Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $15,000\\.

($18,250 USD)\n\n**The Term \"Small Claims Court\" Is Used Differently**\n\nSecond, this isn't an apples to apples comparison. The Canadian limits are for what would be called limited jurisdiction civil courts in the U.S., (except perhaps, British Columbia's Civil Resolution Tribunal) and aren't strictly equivalent to U.S. small claims courts which are a bit like the \"[Judge Judy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Judy)\" show or \"[The People's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Court)\" on U.S. television\n\nBut, most U.S. jurisdictions distinguish between small claims cases, which have a lower dollar limit and in which plaintiffs cannot commence cases with lawyers, and have an extremely simplified process, and ordinary civil cases in limited jurisdiction courts, which still have lots of parties without lawyers, and have greatly simplified and shortened pretrial civil procedure, but have higher dollar limits and allow either party to be represented by lawyers without limitations.\n\nMost adversarial U.S. limited jurisdiction court cases that are not small claims court cases are filed by professional debt collection firms on behalf of businesses, *en masse* with many cases resolved by default judgment, or involve protective orders (e.g. in domestic violence situations).\n\nThe charts below for U.S. Courts (from [here](https://www.ncsc.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/13376/civiljusticereport-2015.pdf) as of 2015 and hence seven years out of date) illustrate the difference. As of 2022, Colorado's limits are $7,500 USD for small claims court and $25,000 for its limited jurisdiction court. Some states, like New York State, have different jurisdictional limits in limited jurisdiction courts in different parts of the state.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHvJ9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHvJ9.png)\n\nAccording to the body text, some limited jurisdiction courts in the U.S. can entertain claims up to $200,000 USD (i.e. Mississippi and Texas).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ultTV.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ultTV.png)\n\n**Intrastate Federalism**\n\nMany courts of limited jurisdiction in the U.S. are part of local governments (e.g. a city or municipal court) rather than part of the state court system. State governments have often been reluctant to grant much authority to civil courts which are outside the state court system (that state legislatures can regulate directly) to local governments.\n\nIn contrast, all of the limited jurisdiction courts in Canada are part of either a provincial level court system, or the courts of a self\\-governing territory (also, while not precisely on point, while Canada has federal courts, the jurisdiction of Canada's federal courts is very limited and the federal court dockets make up only a tiny part of the total judicial system case load in Canada).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the differences between small claims courts in Canada and the United States?\n\nA) Small claims court monetary limits are generally higher in Canada than in the United States when adjusted for currency exchange rates.\n\nB) The term \"small claims court\" is used identically in both countries to refer to courts with simplified procedures and no lawyer representation.\n\nC) In the US, small claims courts and limited jurisdiction courts are the same, while Canada only has small claims courts.\n\nD) US small claims courts typically have lower monetary limits and more restrictions on lawyer representation compared to Canadian limited jurisdiction courts labeled as \"small claims\".\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately captures key differences between the systems. In the US, small claims courts typically have lower monetary limits and often restrict lawyer representation, while what Canada calls \"small claims courts\" are more akin to US limited jurisdiction courts with higher limits and fewer restrictions on lawyers. Option A is incorrect because the Canadian limits, when converted to USD, are not consistently higher than US limits. Option B is false because the term is used differently in the two countries.

If not extortion is it legal, assuming their are no threats of media outing just legal jeopardy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absent a specified jurisdiction, I'm going to assume the US state of New York. This conduct falls squarely within the definition of extortion under New York Penal Law section 155\\.05(2\\)(e):\n\n> A person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces\n>  another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person\n>  by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so\n>  delivered, the actor or another will: \\[...] (iv) Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be\n>  instituted against him;\n\nThere is a defense under section 155\\.15(2\\):\n\n> In any prosecution for larceny by extortion committed by instilling\n>  in the victim a fear that he or another person would be charged with a\n>  crime, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant reasonably\n>  believed the threatened charge to be true and that his sole purpose was\n>  to compel or induce the victim to take reasonable action to make good\n>  the wrong which was the subject of such threatened charge.\n\nHowever, in your hypothetical, the customer is just seeking a payout. This defense is meant for situations like a theft victim telling the thief \"give me back my property or I'll call the cops;\" unless paying the customer is actually a reasonable action to make up for the crime, the customer can't use this defense.\n\nIf the crime is a federal one, this is also blackmail under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 873:\n\n> Whoever, under a threat of informing, or as a consideration for not informing, against any violation of any law of the United States, demands or receives any money or other valuable thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\nIf interstate communications are involved, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 875(d) can also apply:\n\n> Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation of the addressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person **or any threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime,** shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer discovers that a company has committed a federal crime.

In New York, for example, it meets the criteria for extortion under Penal Law section 155.05(2)(e), which includes compelling someone to deliver property by instilling fear of being accused of a crime. On the federal level, it violates 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 873, which prohibits demanding money in exchange for not informing against a violation of U.S. law.\n\nThe action doesn't qualify for the affirmative defense mentioned in NY Penal Law section 155.15(2) because the customer is seeking a payout, not trying to make good on a wrong. The absence of explicit threats or the use of implications doesn't make it legal, as the intent to extort is still present. Therefore, regardless of how the demand is phrased or communicated, this action constitutes illegal extortion under both state and federal law."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18842/subtenant-hasnt-signed-the-sublease-has-the-key-and-wont-sign-or-move-out", "docs_id": 18842, "title": "subtenant hasn&#39;t signed the sublease, has the key and won&#39;t sign or move out", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The property in question is a bedroom in a shared 3\\-bedroom house.\n\nI made the mistake of giving the keys to my not\\-legally\\-yet subtenant (n.l.y.s. from here on) and letting him move in, after my landlord acknowledged he had received this month's rent payment from him.

That whole eviction process can take time; tenants \\- even illegal ones \\- have some rights established by their payments, your verbal agreements, they were given a key, etc. But the mention of eviction might scare them into leaving. Or signing a real lease. But do this in conjunction with the landlord; you are still a tenant yourself.\n\nYour landlord deals with the eviction process, not you.

This approach is correct for several reasons:\n\n1. The tenant cannot initiate eviction proceedings themselves, as they are not the property owner.\n2. The police are unlikely to intervene in what they may see as a civil matter.\n3. Directly threatening the NLYS with legal action could escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n4. Involving the landlord is crucial, as they have the legal authority to address the issue.\n5.

This approach aligns with the advice given in the documentation, which suggests finding the court's address and sending a clear, polite, and concise letter explaining why the ticket is in error. The letter should include all relevant details, copies of the received documents, and a specific request for an in-person hearing. This method provides a formal, documented attempt to contest the citation and initiates the proper legal process.\n\nOption A is not ideal because police usually don't have the authority to cancel tickets once they've been submitted for central processing.

The economics of the arrangement are different, but outside counsel is not more or less objective and neutral, in theory at least, than in house counsel.\n\nOutside counsel and in house counsel owe essentially the same duties in the context of a lawyer\\-client relationship to the client (in this case, the union), although, in practice, outside counsel with evaluate those duties and that relationship in the context of a single one off assignment, while in house counsel will evaluate those duties with a much richer understanding of the underlying facts of a matter and the larger context in which it is playing out.\n\nA lawyer's duty is to advance the objectives of the client, and those objective are largely within the province of the client and not the lawyer, although a lawyer has greater latitude in exercise discretion regarding the means by which this objective is achieved.\n\nFor example, a client could legitimately say that it wants to bring a lawsuit arising out of an incident it was involved in, but the lawyer would usually decide which court it was filed in, what specific legal claims were asserted, and so on.\n\n> \\[If] the lawyers didn't think they had a good chance to win, must the\n> lawyers still work to accomplish this?\n\nThere are a few boundary lines, short of resigning or withdrawing from representation when not legally or ethically required to do so, because the lawyer simply doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, the lawyer isn't allowed to bring groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, or otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), even if the client wants to do so.\n\nSecond, if a lawyer with an organization as a client (like a union) believes that someone within the organization, possibly with some authority, is about to engage in illegal activity that will hurt the organization, the lawyer has a duty to speak up (internally) about this conduct and urge the client representative not to break the law, if necessary, going up as high in the management or governance of the company as necessary (e.g. up to the highest governing board or CEO) to blow the whistle on this conduct internally within the organization, and to resign if the lawyer can't otherwise avoid being involved in illegal conduct by representatives of the organization.\n\nThird, the lawyer must counsel the client representative in a manner sufficient to make the client's decision to pursue a court of action that is unlikely to win, but is not groundless, frivolous, vexatious, or illegal, an informed decision.\n\nBut, if the client decides to go forward with a course of action or objective after making an informed decision to do so with information provided by the lawyer, the lawyer has to do his or her best to carry out the decision of the client even if it would not have been the decision that the lawyer would have made. The lawyer is still an agent of the client, carrying out the client's wishes, not an entirely independent free actor.\n\n> A member had hired a lawyer with an opposing view to the union's\n> lawyers. Would this other lawyer necessarily have to agree with this\n> view or believe there is a chance at success (e.g. proving it's\n> illegal discrimination to have a COVID policy in the workplace)?\n\nAgain, no. Lawyers don't have to agree personally with the positions that they take on behalf of their clients, so long as those positions are not groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, and the lawyer's work does not otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), it isn't improper for the lawyer to do that.\n\nTo provide some context for why these rules are the case, keep in mind that lawyers are in the business, primarily, of dealing with situations in which there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in the law. Lawyers, judges, and courts recognize that the law and language are pliable and subject to interpretation and application to a set of facts and that it is very frequently (although not always) possible to make legitimate arguments for different interpretations of it. And, it is hard, in advance, to know which of multiple different interpretations will wind up being found to be correct (with many legal issues in a case often never having those ambiguities resolved in that case because some other factor ends up making the ambiguous issues irrelevant).\n\nLawyers exist to make sure that every legitimate interpretation that benefits a represented party involved in an interaction to which the law applies is given fair consideration, with someone else generally making the final decision about what to do.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A union hires outside counsel to review the legality of employer COVID policies.

The key to removing the bicycle is that\n\n> In the event that a derelict bicycle is affixed to public property, a\n> notice shall be affixed to the derelict bicycle advising the owner\n> that such derelict bicycle must be removed within seven days from the\n> date of the notice. This notice shall also state that the failure to\n> remove such derelict bicycle within the designated time period will\n> result in the removal and disposal of the derelict bicycle by the\n> department of sanitation.\n\nThis ordinance is specifically addressed at the sanitation department. It does include a quasi\\-exception for ordinary citizens\n\n> Nothing in this section shall preclude the immediate removal of any\n> bicycle, including, but not limited to, a derelict bicycle or ghost\n> bike, or the taking of any other action by any city agency if the\n> presence of such bicycle which creates a dangerous condition by\n> restricting vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or otherwise violates the\n> law.\n\nWhat you should take away from the ordinances is that you are not legally authorized to remove a non\\-dangerous derelict bicycle.\n\nSupposing that you do take the law into your own hands, [this page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/services/vehicles-property/property-clerk.page) would be useful to you, because you have to turn in any abandoned property to the proper authorities. The \"have to\" part comes from [this state law](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-252.html): please note that non\\-compliance is a crime. There is a $20 threshold for the requirement to turn in the property. An abandoned bike may be lost property under the [statutory definition of lost property](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-251.html):\n\n> Abandoned property, waifs and treasure trove, and other property which\n> is found, shall be presumed to be lost property and such presumption\n> shall be conclusive unless it is established in an action or\n> proceeding commenced within six months after the date of the finding\n> that the property is not lost property\n\nIt is thus legally risky to not turn an abandoned bike in to the police. The police would have the discretion to arrest you for theft for vigilante bike\\-cleanup, although I suspect they have other priorities.

That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms Act\u2019s restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939\\. We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c\\[O]rdinarily when called for \\[militia] service \\[able\\-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U. S., at 179\\. \u2026 We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law\\-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short\\-barreled shotguns.\n\nAnd at p.54:\n\n> Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th\\-century cases, commentators and courts rou\u00adtinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. \u2026Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n> \n> \n> We also recognize another important limitation on the\n> right to keep and carry arms.

But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern\\-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have lim\u00adited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.\n\n\u201cNobody would say machine guns have no military uses\u201d \\- indubitably.

Often transition provisions are omitted entirely from a bill.\n\nEven if the draft bill says one thing now, it is unlikely that it will be enacted in precisely that form with respect to the transition provisions (if any).\n\nWhen transition rules are omitted entirely, the agency charged with implementing the new law, the Justice Department, and the judiciary have to figure out what to do. Under a legal case called *[Chevron](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1005)* an agency that administers a law has considerable discretion in how that law is implemented, to which the courts will defer, so long as the implementation is not contrary to any clear statutory direction.\n\n### General Concepts\n\nA core issue is whether someone has a vested right that cannot be taken from them without due process and compensation, or merely an expectancy that does not amount to a vested right. This distinction is rooted mostly in the 5th Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution to due process and to not have property taken without justice compensation, and, even though it is not directly applicable by its terms to Congress, in the contracts clause in Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution which provides that:\n\n> **No State shall** enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of\n> Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of\n> Debts; **pass any** Bill of Attainder, **ex post facto Law, or Law\n> impairing the Obligation of Contracts,** or grant any Title of\n> Nobility.\n\nThe 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states in the pertinent part:\n\n> No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property,\n> without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for\n> public use, without just compensation.\n\nTypically, someone who had a current visa in force might have some sort of vested right, while someone who merely had an application for a visa (or which what is colloquially called a \"green card\" is one type of many) that was pending would not. Even a visa in force, however, would not always include a right to convert that visa into citizenship.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about the RAISE Act and general concepts of immigration law, which of the following statements is most likely to be true if the RAISE Act were to be implemented?\n\nA) All pending green card applications for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens would be automatically converted to applications under the new system.\n\nB) Applicants with pending green card applications for family-based categories eliminated by the RAISE Act would have their applications summarily denied, regardless of how long they've been waiting.\n\nC) The Department of Justice would be required to process all pending green card applications under the old rules, even if they fall into categories eliminated by the RAISE Act.\n\nD) Applicants with pending green card applications would have a constitutionally protected vested right to have their applications processed under the old rules.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is most likely to be correct based on the information provided. The passage states that \"If a bill like this was enacted, people with pending green card applications that are not authorized under the new law, like siblings and adult children of citizens and green card holders, will probably have their applications summarily denied.\" This aligns with the general concept that pending applications typically do not create vested rights. Option A is unlikely as the RAISE Act aims to eliminate certain categories rather than convert them. Option C contradicts the likely outcome described in the passage.
