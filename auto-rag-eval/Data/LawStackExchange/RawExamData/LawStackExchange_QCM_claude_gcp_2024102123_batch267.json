            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When my sister got married, at the rehearsal the celebrant said he had to be careful what he said and when because if he said 'too much' they would end up married sooner than they planned. Although this was a year or two ago a question has lingered: at what point in a ceremony, taking place in England and Wales, does the marriage become official?\n\nI'm not concerned with wedding scenes for TV and film because there are precursor steps leading up to the ceremony that would prevent an 'accidental' marriage. I'm also like to know if there are any differences between marriage and civil partnerships.\n\nAll the results my searches have returned are related to what conditions make a marriage legal rather than the point it becomes legal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The celebrant was (hopefully) joking. They (should) know that you can\u2019t get married **accidentally**. Marriage requires genuine consent of both parties which participation in a **rehearsal** denies is there.\n\nTechnically, the parties are married when all the legal formalities are complete. Practically, they are married when they believe they are. \n\nLegally, they are married when the court considering the question in the case decides they are \\- a court would only be doing this if there was some issue that hinged on it and it would look at all the evidence. For example, if there were doubt about intention then the court might decide they were never married. Alternatively, even if the technical requirements were not met, the court might decide that they are married and if necessary the date/time this occurred.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In England and Wales, at what point does a marriage legally become official?\n\nA) As soon as the celebrant begins speaking during the ceremony\nB) When the couple exchanges rings\nC) When all legal formalities are complete and the court recognizes it as valid\nD) Immediately after the couple says \"I do\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a marriage legally becomes official when all the legal formalities are complete and, if challenged, when a court recognizes it as valid. The answer emphasizes that there isn't a single, specific moment during the ceremony that instantly makes the marriage official.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the celebrant's words alone do not constitute a legal marriage, especially during a rehearsal.\n\nOption B is incorrect because exchanging rings is a symbolic gesture and not a legal requirement for marriage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because saying \"I do\" is part of the ceremony but doesn't automatically finalize the marriage legally.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the legal complexities surrounding marriage formalization and the role of courts in determining marital status if disputed."

Specifically, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYmzVHRAo94) was [claimed to be a copyright infringement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHh8nPj5SDY). \n\nI'm aware of other questions related to copyright and YouTube policies, however my question is very specific. In the claimed video YouTuber plays on acoustic guitar for 25 seconds without even singing what for me looks like a quotation.\n\nIs there anything in US copyright law regulating how long and in which exact form (exact record or performance etc.) a musical quote can be, if such concept is a thing at all? While this video is on a commercial channel it's quite evident that guy did it for educational purposes. \n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtLG5.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *\"But he doesn't even sing!\"*\n\nIf music only consisted of lyrics, you'd have a point. But you already said exactly how the infringement happened: playing the guitar.\n\nThe content usage is clear: the video uses the song's melody, and therefore is infringing on copyright.\n\nIt doesn't matter how long or little is played. Copyright infringement suits have been successful when only seconds of the original work were copied, because that short section is important enough to require protection, and its use to deserve compensation (in the extreme, because it comprises the entire work).\n\n> While this video is on a commercial channel it's quite evident that guy did it for educational purposes.\n\nIf done for commercial purposes, this is almost surely the deciding factor over others in USA fair use, and clearly disallows UK fair dealing, and in most other jurisdictions would tend to make it disallowed usage as well.\n\nPut more simply, you can't justify infringing copyright in the material used for teaching when you're getting paid for that teaching, any more than you can justify theft of real or tangible property on the same basis.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding copyright law in this situation?\n\nA) The use is likely fair use because it's for educational purposes and only 25 seconds long.\nB) The use is permissible because the YouTuber didn't sing the lyrics, only played the melody.\nC) The copyright owner has no valid claim because the performance is on a different instrument than the original.\nD) The use likely infringes copyright, despite being short and for educational purposes, because it's on a commercial channel.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because even though the use is short (25 seconds) and for educational purposes, it's still likely to be considered copyright infringement. The key factors are:\n\n1. The video uses the song's melody, which is protected by copyright.\n2. The length of use doesn't matter - even short clips can infringe if they're important enough.\n3. While educational use can sometimes be fair use, the fact that this is on a commercial (monetized) YouTube channel weighs heavily against fair use.\n4. Not singing the lyrics doesn't matter - the melody alone is copyrightable.\n5. Performing on a different instrument doesn't avoid infringement - it's still recognizably the same musical work.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they misunderstand key aspects of copyright law as it applies to this situation."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have some questions regarding the concept and legality of a blockchain based peer\\-to\\-peer insurance platform.\n\n**A little background:**\nThe basic idea is for people being given the possibility to \"insure\" another users private property, whatever that may be in any specific case. The insurer would then have the opportunity\nto claim profits on a timely schedule, while the insured could claim the collateral provided by the insurer, if the requirements both parties agreed upon were to be met.\nThe insurance contracts themselves would be initialized, maintained and eventually resolved through a series of transparent open sourced smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially little programs, that run on the blockchain. The can\nbe reviewed by anyone interested.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is it legally necessary to formally record such a relation between two (or more) private persons? With the crypto space currently being so very unregulated, are there even laws applicable to this matter?\n2. How difficult would it be for users of such a service to declare the income generated through anything related to the platform? Would this be regarded\nas a form of self\\-employment, would they have to register a company or any of the likes?\n3. Would the platform itself, being the service provider, have to be registered in any way? The main aim of the platform would of course be income generation.\n\n**Legal accountability:**\n\n1. Would we need to explicitly declare a disclaimer to prevent being sued if a user considers the rejection of their claim unjust?\nSince this is a peer\\-to\\-peer system, the platform itself will mostly be uninvolved in the decision process. Instead this will be the duty of an independant third party comprised of individual users.\n2. Could the platform be held accountable in case of lost user funds? Only if the platform were at fault? (as in, did the platform's source code cause the issue?)\n3. Can a strictly blockchain based platform even be sued? Only if it is legally registered?\n4. Is there an exact legal counterpart as to the role the platform would assume in this system? It provides the framework upon wich the insurance policies are designed, contracts are established\nand payouts are issued. It does not directly take part in insurance business.\n\nFeel free to let me know, if any further clarification is needed.\n\n**Edit:**\nSince jurisdictional specification was suggested, let's assume it to be Switzerland and the U.S.A.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Although crypto space may be little regulated, insurance is in most jurisdictions highly regulated. Any such arrangement would need to comply with current laws on insurance, until and unless modified laws to cover this sort of thing are passed, and then it would need to comply with those.\n2. Tax authorities generally allow one to declare \"other business income\" or \"other investment income\" without forming a legal entity. I cannot say how such income would be classified in any given jurisdiction.\n3. Whether the platform, or some legal entity associated with the platform, would need to be registered will depend on the current laws and regulations governing insurance, and on the way in which teh contracts are structured.\n4. A disclaimer cannot prevent one from being sued. The contracts would need to carefully and explicitly state who is liable for what.\n5. Programs cannot be held accountable for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. If negligence in the creation or operation of a program causes a loss, the operator may well be liable.\n6. Programs cannot be sued for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. It may well be essential to constitute the \"platform\" as a legal entity of some sort. Otherwise its operator will be liable for its actions.\n7. I cannot be sure. I once encountered a somewhat similar system in which insurance was provided by individuals exchanging contracts, so that in a sense each member insured all the others. There was a company that supervised and provided legal and administrative services to the group of individuals, and collected fees for this. That sounds a bit similar to the suggested platform, but I don't know exactly how that company was organized. The system was called \"NJ CURE\". I don't know if it is still in operation.",

The platform would likely need to comply with existing insurance laws and regulations, even if it only provides the framework for peer-to-peer insurance contracts. It may need to be registered as a legal entity to operate legally and manage potential liabilities. A disclaimer alone would not be sufficient to prevent lawsuits or absolve the platform of all responsibilities. Users probably wouldn't need to register as insurance companies, but they may need to declare income from the platform.

A password cracker could be used, for example, if you forgot your email password, and that is perfectly legal. But you could also use the password cracker to hack into someone else's account. Same deal for a code decipher (it could be used legally or illegally.) So my question is: if a user uses a program illegally, is the user or the developer punished? Is there something a developer can do (like put a user agreement that states you should not use it illegally?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simple answer is yes. There's a famous case that illustrates this: A\\&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001\\).\n\nA number of record companies successfully sued *Napster* for infringing their various intellectual property rights.\n\nEssentially, the finding came down to the fact that:\n\n* Napster's program (of the same name) allows for the exchange of copyrighted material, ***and*** *Napster* had actual knowledge that specific infringing material was available using its system, and that it did not remote the material (by blocking access to the system or otherwise).\n* Napster did not police the index of files that they maintained, and so were liable for vicarious infringement.\n\nThe longer answer to your question is *it depends*. Based on the Napster precedent, it seems it would depend (at least) on whether: \n\n* the program may have legitimate uses\n* you are aware that it can be used for illegal purpose\n* you have a means of monitoring the activity\n* you have a means of restricting use of the program\n* you financially benefit from the activities of the users\n\nMany developers will include some warning about using the software only for legal purposes. I don't think such a warning has ever been tested, and even if it were, it's unlikely to make a difference if the clear purpose of the software is to perform illegal acts.",

Like witnesses, judges are human and subject to biases and external pressures, and it seems like it would be reasonable to assume that their jury instructions could reflect that.\n\nViewing jury instructions this way I think would mean that it is part of the role of the jury to determine which parts of the jury instructions should be considered fact, and I think it would also mean that jury nullification wouldn't necessarily mean that a jury [returns \"a verdict of 'Not Guilty' despite its belief that the defendant is guilty of the violation charged\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/112); it could just mean that the jury doesn't accept all of the statements in the jury instructions, such as the judge's interpretation of the law, as fact.\n\nCould jury instructions reasonably be viewed as a kind of expert witness testimony? If not, what are the main problems with viewing them this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. There is a clear distinction between:\n\n* evidence (or testimony), which consists of statements of fact given by witnesses on oath (subject to prosecution for perjury), governed by the rules of evidence, and which the jury is required to consider but not accept (in the sense that a verdict which is not supported by the evidence can be set aside on appeal),\n* submissions, which consist of argument by the lawyers for the parties, which the jury is not required to consider or accept, and\n* directions, which consist of statements of law given by the judge, which the jury is required to accept.\n\nThe jury is required by its oath to follow the law as stated by the judge, even if it is wrong. The remedy for erroneous trial directions (an appeal) is different to the remedy for erroneous evidence (a perjury prosecution in the case of deliberate lies; nothing in the case of innocent errors).\n\nBecause the jury has the power, but not the right, to nullify a charge by disobeying the judge\u2019s directions, there is a sense in which the jury is free to reject the judge\u2019s directions just as it is free to reject evidence. However, this is completely inconsistent with the theory that defines the roles of judge and jury. There is no *legal* basis for viewing judicial directions as a kind of expert testimony.\n\n\u2018The power, but not the right\u2019\n------------------------------\n\nObie 2\\.0 asked about this phrase.

The relevant passage is summarised in Lord Devlin's *[Trial by Jury](https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf)* (1956\\), at p 87:\n\n> **Jury\u2019s Power of Acquittal**\n> \n> \n> There may well be cases in which the killing is not in doubt and the formal direction not to return a verdict of manslaughter is therefore tantamount to a direction to return a verdict of Guilty. Still, if the direction is ignored, the court must, I think, accept the verdict. There is no way in which a verdict of acquittal can be nullified. As Lord Chief Justice Mansfield put it in 1784: \u201cIt is the duty of the judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in *their power* to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.\u201d Mr. Justice Willes said: \u201cI admit the jury have the *power* of finding a verdict against the law and so they have of finding a verdict against evidence, but I deny they have the *right* to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Justice of Australia held to similar effect in *Gammage v The Queen* (1969\\) [122 CLR 444](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/68.html?context=1;query=gammage;mask_path=), writing:\n\n> \\[The jury] have no right, in my opinion, to return a verdict of manslaughter where they are satisfied of murder. But, as I have said, persistence by them in returning another verdict must ultimately result in the acceptance of that verdict. In that sense, but in no other sense, it is both within their power and, if you will, their privilege to return a wrong verdict.\n\nTo answer Obie 2\\.0's question, the jury has the *power* to ignore the judge's directions, because \u2013 at least at the time Lord Devlin was writing in 1956 \u2013 a verdict of acquittal could not be nullified. However, the jury does not have the *right* to do so because the law requires it to follow the directions.\n\nAs Ed999 observes, the law governing jury trials does vary between jurisdictions. In particular, some jurisdictions (which lack the United States' constitutional [double jeopardy clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause)) now allow for a jury acquittal to be set aside on appeal. However, the fundamental distinction between a witness\u2019s evidence and a judge\u2019s directions was established in England centuries ago, and remains applicable throughout the common law world.\n\nIt is worth specifically mentioning the United States because [jury nullification remains a controversial topic in that jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification_in_the_United_States). However, the basic principle that the jury is legally required to follow the judge\u2019s directions was established in *[Sparf v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparf_v._United_States)*, [156 U.S. 51](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/156/51/case.html) (1895\\), and described by Ginsburg J (albeit in a dissenting judgment) as \u2018conclusive\u2019 in *[Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Motor_Co._v._Oberg)*, [512 U.S. 415](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/415/case.html), 447 (1994\\). In *Sparf*, the opinion of the court was:\n\n> We must hold firmly to the doctrine that in the courts of the United States it is the duty of juries in criminal cases to take the law from the court and apply that law to the facts as they find them to be from the evidence.",

Expert witness testimony, on the other hand, is evidence presented by witnesses that the jury may evaluate but is not obligated to accept. While juries have the power to disregard instructions through nullification, they do not have the legal right to do so. Expert testimony is subject to rules of evidence, while jury instructions are statements of law. This fundamental difference in their nature and how juries are expected to treat them makes C the correct answer."

If the hacker is unconnected with the recipient there seems no way that the hacker benefits financially, although I suppose a hacker might simply want to cause an amusing disruption.\n\nAs I understand it this rule only applies when the sender in fact owes a debt to the recipient that the transfer pays off.\n\nIf the hacker were working for one of a large group of recipients, most of whom are innocent, and subsequent analysis establishes that there was a hacker, but not who the hacker was or which of the many recipients the hacker was working for, I suspect, but cannot prove, that the doctrine would not apply, because the transfer was not a valid but incorrect act by the sender, but was a fraudulent intervention in the sender's procedures.",

The hack is discovered, but investigators cannot determine which company the hacker was working for. BigBank sues to recover the funds. Under these circumstances, how would the \"discharge-for-value\" defense likely apply?\n\nA) The defense would apply to all 100 companies, allowing them to keep the funds.\nB) The defense would not apply to any of the companies, and all would have to return the funds.\nC) The defense would apply to the 99 companies not involved in the hack, but not to the company that employed the hacker.\nD) The court would likely rule that the defense does not apply due to the fraudulent nature of the transfer, even though most recipients are innocent.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the \"discharge-for-value\" defense typically allows recipients to keep funds if they discharge a valid debt, the recipient made no misrepresentations, and had no notice of a mistake, this situation is complicated by the fraudulent nature of the transfer. Even though 99 of the companies are innocent and the funds did discharge valid debts, the fact that the transfer was initiated by a criminal act (hacking) rather than a mistake by the sender would likely lead a court to rule that the doctrine does not apply. The fraudulent intervention in the sender's procedures undermines the basis of the defense, which assumes an error by the sender, not an external criminal act. Additionally, the inability to identify the specific company involved in the fraud could lead to a blanket ruling against applying the defense to protect the integrity of the financial system and discourage future similar schemes."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Medium is sort of a content facilitator that charges its users for premium content and passes on part of that fee to authors, when the reader interacts with their work. However, over recent months, Medium has become increasingly focused on their own partnerships and internal publications, to the point where it's hard to argue that there is not an ethical conflict of interest. My question is whether there's a legal conflict of interest.\n\n---\n\n**General Idea**\n\nTo put it into general terms, consider three parties, A, B, and C. Party A offers party B and C the opportunity to profit from an operation, where parties B and C are in competition with one another for a finite amount of revenue in a given month (the total available from subscription fees in this case). Further suppose that the operation relies on party C for success (it seems easy to argue that Medium would have trouble surviving if only their own content was on the platform), and that party A provides biased support to party B. Finally, B and C are paid by A, from the revenue generated by the operation, rather than B and C obtaining the revenue directly from the operation's customers.\n\nIn such a scenario, there seems to be both an ethical issue and potentially legal issue. However, I am not familiar with any specific civil statutes that may come into play. Does it appear that the above scenario might violate any specific statute? The one potential reason why Medium might be saved from a valid lawsuit is that an author does not have to pay for the service. However, they are providing support, in their aggregate, through the massive volume of writing that they provide to the platform, without very much chance of being able to actually generate revenue. Precedent from cases involving pyramid schemes may apply here.\n\n---\n\nMichael Seifert raised an interesting question: \"How would this be different from Publishing House A promoting a more profitable Author B instead of a less profitable Author C?\"\n\nThe difference is that the publishing house does not rely on C's work for sales. To continue this analogy, consider a situation where the publishing house put in a request for chapters for an anthology, where the majority of the chapters came from C, and a few came from B. Further suppose that the publishing house paid its authors based on how many sales the respective authors generated, but almost exclusively promoted author B's website that sold the anthology. Even though readers likely would not purchase the anthology, without the chapters provided by C, because of A's disproportionate support of B, C would receive very little of the revenue stream.\n\n---\n\nBlueDogRanch made a point that Medium's terms of services \"says nothing about being fair, or ethical.\" Agreed. Its terms of services say nothing, and therefore it does not say that they reserve the right to unfair, unequal, or unethical, biases. If the terms of service stated that Medium reserves the right to unequal promotion of work regardless of whether it reduces the potential revenue by other authors, then Medium would have a greater chance of winning in court, and greater justification for their actions. However, without such statements, it becomes less certain that one should assume that a content facilitator that provides revenue streams as part of a ***partner program*** would engage in actions that disproportionately shift revenue streams towards their own content. \n\n---\n\nA final point. It seems that in California, an individual must pass the \"ABC\" test, at least when it comes to wage orders. Specifically, Medium's authors do not pass B: *the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business*. It seems that, contrary to the suggestion that Medium's authors are subcontractors, they are, at least as far as California law is concerned, employees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> *Is Medium at risk of legal action?*\n\nThey are, in as much as anyone or any company is due to the nature of civil law, i.e. just about anyone can take anyone else to civil court. That is where \"legal conflicts of interest\" are worked out. But I'd assume that Medium's lawyers have covered the bases in terms of adhering to state and federal laws that govern their business, their business model of paying authors and changing their business model; and ensure that they have a strong terms of service document for the site, and that document is legally binding for Medium's users.\n\nNow, a disgruntled author could file against Medium, alleging fraud, uncompetitive practices, unfairness, conflicts of interest or anything else and attempt to recover damages for what they allege is a skewed payoff to authors or Medium's self\\-serving policies. That said, authors and Medium are bound by the [Medium Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f). The TOS says nothing about being fair, or ethical, and it clearly states that \n\n> By using Medium, you agree to these Terms. If you don\u2019t agree to any\n>  of the Terms, you can\u2019t use Medium. We can change these Terms at any\n>  time...

This includes all types of\n>  damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary).\n>  And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract,\n>  breach of warranty, tort, or any other loss.\n\nThat's the contract that the author would have to fight in court, and they will lose. They agreed to the terms of using Medium. Their only option, within reason other than a lawsuit, is to quit using Medium. An author could still file a lawsuit, but how far are they going to get? How much money do they have to spend to go up against Medium?",

While Medium does face some legal risk, as any company does in civil law, its Terms of Service provide significant protection against most potential claims by authors. The Terms of Service explicitly limit Medium's liability and require users to agree to these terms to use the platform.

The club leader wants to secure rights to use the content created by the student members. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate and legally sound?\n\nA) Have all club members sign over their copyrights to the club board, regardless of their age.\n\nB) Implement a policy stating that all content created using club resources automatically becomes the property of the club.\n\nC) Create an agreement where club members retain their copyrights but grant the club a non-exclusive license to use the content for club-related purposes.\n\nD) Declare that since the club provides the materials, it inherently owns all content produced by members.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate and legally sound approach. This solution allows the student creators to retain their copyrights while granting the club the necessary rights to use the content. It avoids potential legal issues associated with minors signing over copyrights (A) or blanket claims of ownership (B and D). This approach also aligns with the \"least resistance\" method described in the documentation, which emphasizes protecting the ability to use the content rather than owning the copyright outright. It respects the rights of the creators while still allowing the club to utilize the content for its purposes, creating a balanced and legally safer arrangement."

It was used as an example of how dumb some people can be, and how the criminal just got what he deserved... however, can such a thing really happen? Wouldn't the suspect be protected by double jeopardy? (the story is set in a jurisdiction where double jeopardy exists)\n\nIs the trial officially over as soon as the judge utters the final decision?\n\nConsider the following cases:\n\n1. The suspect carelessly and accidentally admits the crime in the courtroom right after being cleared, like in the example above (\"thanks, I won't do it again\") Can the decision be altered ten seconds after it's been made? If so, is such a careless utterance enough evidence to do so?\n2. The suspect, having heard about double jeopardy, grins and says openly and voluntarily, right there in the courtroom after the decision: \"Haha, in your face! I did murder your wife, but the trial is over so you can't do anything anymore!\"\n3. Same as 2, but it happens weeks or months after the trial, the suspect boasts in front of witnesses how he did it and got away with it. (and to not make it *only* hearsay, let's assume that the boasting contained actual information which could have been used as a strong evidence)\n\nWould the suspect be protected by double jeopardy? If not, what would be the procedure of doing a retrial or a new trial?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, a person is generally protected from being tried for the same offense twice, but they are not necessarily absolutely \"protected\". If a jury convicts a person but the judge enters a directed verdict of not guilty, the prosecution can appeal that action ([Wilson v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/332/), 420 U.S. 332\\). The reason is that the acquittal could be disposed of on appeal without subjecting the person to a second trial. In contrast, in [Fong Foo v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/369/141/), 369 U.S. 141 the trial judge ordered the jury to enter a verdict of acquittal. The appeals court rejected the judges basis for ordering an acquittal: but Fong Foo was \"protected\" because there could not be a second trial (double jeopardy), and it does not follow that the jury would have convicted but for the judge's order.\n\nThe question reduces to the limited circumstances under which the prosecution can appeal a verdict. For instance, the prosecution can appeal a tre\\-trial motion to dismiss, and since there was no trial, there is no second jeopardy. Within a single jurisdiction, the only circumstance allowing a second trial involves bribery of a judge (Aleman v. [Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/138/302/473725/), 138 F.3d 302\\), where the basis for allowing a second trial is that defendant was not in jeopardy with the first trial.\n\nNew evidence does not override a defendant's protection against a second trial, whether it is new DNA evidence or a confession. It does not matter if this evidence arises seconds after the final verdict is entered, or months after. Or even before, but the prosecution was unaware.",

Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748\n> (2005\\)?\n\nNo. [Derek Chauvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Chauvin), the police officer whose affirmative physical acts caused the death of George Floyd is not protected by this precedent.\n\n*Castle Rock v. Gonzales* holds that the police do not have a duty to enforce the law that may be enforced by a private party in a civil action. Police instead have broad discretion regarding whether they will or will not take action to enforce a law.\n\nBut, when a police officer does take action affirmatively, this case does not apply. Instead, the question then, is whether the affirmative use of force by the officer was justified by the applicable substantive criminal law.\n\n> If Chauvin had not touched Floyd at all, would Chauvin be protected by\n> *Castle Rock v. Gonzales*?\n> \n> \n> Meaning no attempt at arrest, no confrontation, nothing. Just let\n> Floyd leave with his cigarettes.\n\nYes. (A much more complicated analysis applied if a fellow officer did what he did and he stood back and did nothing, but that is beyond the scope of this question as I understand it and would call for a separate question.)\n\n> Given the apparent huge disparity in the risk\\-reward calculation of a\n> police officer taking action versus just sitting in the car, why don't\n> all police just sit in their car all day?\n\nPolice officers who do that are routinely fired and given bad recommendation by their superiors when applying for a new law enforcement position. Law enforcement supervisors routinely punish police officers for inaction construing that as being a \"coward\" but are much less likely to punish a police officer for being unlawfully overzealous without strong pressure from civilians in the relevant government agency or local government.\n\nEmpirically, sitting in their car all day is not how police act. They are much more likely to be overzealous than to be docile.\n\nThis said, there is [some statistical evidence](https://www.vox.com/22360290/black-lives-matter-protest-crime-ferguson-effects-murder) that has been construed to show that following the announcement of the Chauvin prosecution and related protests before and after that was done, that police took a less active role in policing that led to higher crime.",

Gonzales precedent.\n\nC) Police officers have broad discretion in enforcing laws, but can be held accountable for affirmative actions that violate rights or laws.\n\nD) Police officers face equal risks whether they take action or remain passive in potential crime situations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Castle Rock v. Gonzales case established that police have broad discretion in enforcing laws and cannot be sued for failing to enforce a particular law. However, this protection does not extend to affirmative actions taken by officers that violate rights or laws, as seen in the Derek Chauvin case. While police have discretion, they can still be held accountable for their actions when they choose to intervene. Option A is incorrect because police are not obligated to enforce every law. Option B is wrong because Chauvin's actions were not protected by this precedent. Option D is inaccurate because there is a disparity in risk between action and inaction, with overzealousness often being less punished than perceived cowardice."

If something more is needed, what legal right does she have to consent on his behalf?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Don't believe everything you hear on the radio or see on TV. That radio show is probably staged with actors; read [https://didyouknowfacts.com/former\\-dj\\-radio\\-business\\-fake/](https://didyouknowfacts.com/former-dj-radio-business-fake/) and the linked AMA on Reddit.\n\nIf it happens that radio show is not entirely acted out, I'm sure the radio station has their legal ducks in a row. The station as a business and the DJ as an individual would have some legal exposure to \"out\" or reveal affairs on the air, so if the show is not a total act, all callers will have signed or agreed to verbal releases which state that all participants are recorded and the outcomes may be unpredictable, the station and the DJ are not liable, etc. One or two party consent for recording and broadcasting will be respected; if they weren't, the station would be sued out of existence.\n\nThe idea that they ask for consent on the air and act like that is required is simply more of the act. 99% of the listeners have no legal training, and the magic word \"consent\" makes the show sound more real and lawful. As above, there *could* be releases agreed to on the phone before the call is switch to broadcast, i.e. *\"do you agree to let us broadcast you and are you aware of this and any ramifications?\"* and that would be recorded by the station for their legal protection. But a good lawyer could get around that in court.\n\nSee also **[Is it legal for police to travel with a film crew and publicize arrest footage without consent?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7458/is-it-legal-for-police-to-travel-with-a-film-crew-and-publicize-arrest-footage-w)** and also **[Is 'You the Jury' TV show really legal?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18231/is-you-the-jury-tv-show-really-legal/18249#18249)**",

The documentation suggests that such radio shows are often staged with actors. If the show is genuine, it would require more comprehensive legal protections than just asking for consent on air. The station would need to have participants sign releases or agree to verbal releases off-air, covering recording, broadcasting, and liability issues. The on-air consent request is likely part of the show's dramatization rather than a legally sufficient protection. Options A and C are incorrect because they overstate the legal significance of the on-air consent request. Option B, while partially true about the dramatic aspect, doesn't address the broader legal considerations that would be necessary if the show were real."

Can these matters legally be handled privately?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Applicable Law**\n\nThere are (at least) two levels of regulation involved.\n\n[At the state level](https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx), all fifty states and all or almost all U.S. districts and territories have enacted laws requiring notifications of data breaches.\n\nUnder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, publicly held companies also have to make regular reports to the public via the Securities and Exchange Commission, some of which are on a fixed schedule and some of which are episodic for extraordinary events. The requirement under that '34 Act is to disclose all material information about the company that a reasonable investor would be influenced by in making an investment decision. There are regulations and there is case law governing what does and does not have to be disclosed, but there is still a great deal of discretion in deciding what to include.\n\nBut if your company fails to disclose information under the '34 Act and an investor sues the company for failing to disclose it, and a judge and jury handling the case determine in the court process that the information had to be disclosed under this vague standard and that someone was harmed economically as a result of the non\\-disclosure, then the company (and often people affiliated with the company) have liability to the people who the court finds were harmed by the non\\-disclosure for securities fraud and that liability cannot be discharged in bankruptcy in most cases (and is also eligible for special treatment in the debt collection process to enforce the judgment).\n\n**Application**\n\n> If I run a publicly traded company that's releasing hardware and that\n> hardware is compromised and customer data is harvested, do I have to\n> publicize that leak's existence?\n\nYou do if it is of a magnitude covered by state law, or if the existence of the leak would be material to an investor in the company's securities (either stock or bonds).\n\n> What if the people that found that data are presumed to be trustworthy\n> and are willing to destroy the data upon payment?\n\nThis depends on the language of an individual state disclosure law at the state level. At the federal level, the question is whether the event is material. A variety of factors could influence that conclusion. One is the amount of the payment. Another is the extent that it indicates a problem that is likely to recur, or reflects deeper management problems in the company's IT systems.\n\n> Does that material breach have to be announced?\n\nIf the breach is material, it has to be announced.

While state laws (A) do require breach notifications in many cases, this isn't the only consideration for public companies. The payment amount (B) could be a factor, but materiality isn't solely based on financial impact. Proof of data destruction (C) isn't the determining factor for disclosure.\n\nThe correct answer is D because under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, publicly held companies must disclose all material information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision. A significant data breach, even if supposedly resolved, could be considered material due to its potential impact on the company's reputation, customer trust, and future security risks. The materiality standard is broader than just financial impact and considers overall significance to the company's operations and risks."

When I looked at the place, it had a back room that was filled with the owners stuff (sort of a hoarder, but it wasn't just trash. Just furniture, tools, etc). In the lease provisions, I added that I wanted him to clear out the back room in August 2018 (signed in May) as well as remove a mounted bed frame that seemed to have been rotted away. He agreed and flew in from his country and took some (albeit not all, and left a lot more of the larger stuff like chairs and couches) and the bed frame still stands.\n\nMy rent has the utilities included, however he added an amendment that he wanted me to take on payment for gas in September. I didn't turn the gas on until November, since the neighbors upstairs and I (shared house) were fine with toughing it out for as long as needed. I have yet to receive any gas bill from the landlord, or any other word on this agreement. In my own fault, I also never brought it up.\n\nHe still has not brought it up, but he also never fulfilled his provisions. The rent was managed by a leasing agent nearby, however I pay rent to the LL directly. Can he come back and force me for gas payments, months later, even though he never sent me a bill starting in September? Also, will his failing to follow through on his provisions, effectively cancel out my need to follow through on mine?\n\nI know since I didn't reach out about the bills, I most likely don't have moral high ground. However, I'd be interested to know how this could be seen, if I choose to not renew in September. I'm not looking to break my lease or anything, just want to make sure I won't get a huge bill at the end when I decide not to renew. \n\nEdit: some background information \\-\n\nI am mid\\-20s, have been renting in various locations since 18\\. Have never had any issues or evictions from landlords.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can he come back and force me for gas payments, months later, even\n>  though he never sent me a bill starting in September?\n\nIf you accepted the amendment about payment for gas, then yes, the landlord can still come after you for your failure to abide by the amendment.\n\nI am not knowledgeable of MA landlord\\-tenant legislation (which might be [this](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleI/Chapter186) and perhaps other statutes) and thus whether or not the landlord has a *post move\\-out* deadline to send the tenant a bill of damages. Absent such deadline, the applicable deadline would be six years, which is the [MA statute of limitations for claims of breach of contract](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleV/Chapter260/Section2).\n\n> will his failing to follow through on his provisions, effectively\n>  cancel out my need to follow through on mine?\n\nThat is unlikely, since the landlord's breach of contract does not appear to have rendered the unit impermissibly unsafe. Instead, you would have to persuade the court that the damages you endured due to landlord's failure is comparable to his losses for your omission regarding payment of gas.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant signed a lease amendment agreeing to pay for gas starting in September, but didn't turn on the gas until November. The landlord never sent any gas bills or mentioned it again. The landlord also failed to fully clear out a back room as agreed in the lease. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's legal obligations?\n\nA) The tenant is not responsible for any gas payments due to the landlord's failure to send bills or fulfill other lease provisions.\n\nB) The tenant is only responsible for gas payments from November onward when they actually started using gas.\n\nC) The tenant is responsible for all gas payments from September onward as agreed in the lease amendment, regardless of actual usage or billing.\n\nD) The tenant's obligation for gas payments is nullified by the landlord's failure to fully clear out the back room as promised.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, if the tenant accepted the amendment about payment for gas, they are still obligated to abide by it even if the landlord never sent a bill. The landlord's failure to fulfill other provisions (like clearing out the back room) does not automatically cancel out the tenant's responsibilities. The landlord can potentially pursue gas payments for up to six years under the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims in Massachusetts. While the tenant didn't use gas until November, the agreement was to pay starting in September, so they could be held responsible for the full period."

Would there perhaps be some type of agreement between the two countries to only punish the offender for the act which was considered a crime in both jurisdictions, and to drop the other charge?\n\nI ask this question in general, rather than for a specific country overview. It might be easier to avoid United States law as it tends to get complicated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Extradition is done for specific charges.

If they're later in the country for another reason (or don't leave when they have the chance), they can potentially be rearrested for the other crime.

The most plausible alternative would be to force an involuntary bankruptcy, but this is not cost effective for you given the small amount still owed. You could join a class action in most circumstances even though you are not a U.S. citizen, but it would not be cost effective for you to make any effort to start one.\n\nYour best bet to get some money would be to call the debtor personally, to ask him to send you the $230, and to explain that the debt collection agency is now defunct.

Which of the following actions would be the MOST practical and cost-effective for the foreign individual to recover the remaining $230?\n\nA) File a complaint with the New York State Attorney General's office\nB) Initiate a class action lawsuit against the debt collection agency\nC) Contact the original debtor directly to request payment of the remaining balance\nD) Report the debt collection agency to local law enforcement\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While filing a complaint with the state agency regulating debt collectors is an option, it may not directly lead to recovering the money.\nB) Joining or initiating a class action lawsuit would not be cost-effective for such a small amount and given the individual's location outside the US.\nC) This is the most practical and cost-effective option. The answer suggests contacting the debtor directly, explaining the situation, and requesting the remaining balance as the best way to mitigate damages.\nD) Law enforcement would likely consider this a civil matter and decline to get involved.\n\nOption C provides the most direct path to potentially recovering the funds with minimal cost and complications, especially given the foreign individual's location and the relatively small amount involved."

Thus 5\\.e.2 does not apply. Points 3 and 4 would seem to indicate that the source, including title and author information, must be included or preserved in the output files, but seems to be the only relevant restriction that applies.\n\n### Response to Comment\n\nA [comment by user Brian Drake](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82923/can-i-use-google-cloud-text-to-speech-to-create-and-monetize-an-audiobook-from-a/82924?noredirect=1#comment181024_82924) questions the theory of this answer, stating:\n\n> The most you can say is that copyright law does not prohibit certain conduct (and even that is not clear: just because the text is in the public domain does not necessarily mean that the audio is in the public domain); this does not mean that copyright law expressly permits that conduct.\n\nUS Copyright law does not define what constitutes the public domain. Rather it defines what is protected by copyright, and specifies some cases in whch a work is not protected. (For nexample, [17 USC 105](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105) provides tht works of the US Federal Government are not protected.) Anything not included in the protection of copyright is in the public domain. This has been confirmed by many cour cases and legal writings. Law generally follows the rule \"Anything not forbidden is allowed.\"\n\n#### Audio as Derivitive Work\n\nAn audio recording of a person reading a text aloud would be a derivative work of that text, and would normally have its own copyright, if created lawfully. (If the recording was of a text protected by copyright, made without permission and outside of fair use, it was not made lawfully and the infringer has no copyright in the recording at all.) But US courts have held that a work created by a mechanical or automatic process, including many computer programs, is not an \"original work of authorship\" and thus is not protected by copyright at all, and is thus in the Public Domain. The case of the \"Monkey Selfie\" is on point. ([\"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, \u00a7 313\\.2\" (PDF)](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf). United States Copyright Office. 22 December 2014\\. p. 22\\. \"To qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being.... Works that do not satisfy this requirement are not copyrightable. The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.\"\n\nMoreover, if the audio were protected by copyright, it would presumably be owned by the person who ran the program, and [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) specifically grants the copyright owner permission to distribute copies.\n\n### Sources\n\n* The [Wikipedia article \"Public Domain\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) reads in relevant part (citations omitted):\n\n> The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. Those rights may have expired,\\[1] been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country\\-by\\-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public\\-domain status for a work in that country.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law. According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property. However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair\\-use rights and limitation on ownership\n\n\\*[\"How Can I Use Copyright\\-Free Works (in the Public Domain)?\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/works-public-domain-permission-29523.html) by Nolo Press reads:\n\n> Copyright law gives creators certain exclusive rights. These rights include the exclusive ability to copy, distribute, and perform the copyrighted work.\n> \n> \n> But copyright is not infinite. Rather, it provides copyright holders with protections for a limited duration. When a work becomes available for use without permission from a copyright owner, it is said to be \"in the public domain.\" Most works enter the public domain because their copyrights have expired.\n\n* The [Legal Information Institute (LII) article \"public domain\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/public_domain) reads:\n\n> The public domain includes every creative work that is no longer protected by a copyright, trademark, or patent. Creative works that are no longer protected are owned by the general public rather than the original creator. As such, the work is free to be copied, performed, or otherwise used by anyone.\n\n* [\"Copyright and Scholarship:\nPublic Domain\"](https://libguides.bc.edu/copyright/publicdomain) from Boston College Libraries reads in relevant part:\n\n> \"Public domain\" works are not protected by copyright. The public owns these works, not an individual author or artist. Anyone can use a public domain work without obtaining permission, but no one can ever own it.\n> \n> \n> An important caveat regarding public domain material is that collections, new editions, and derivative works of public domain material may all be protected by copyright. With collections, an author could collect public domain works in a book or display them on a website, and the collection as a whole could be protected by copyright, even though individual works within it are not.\n\n\\*[\"Welcome to the Public Domain\"](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/) (Stanford libraries) reads in relevant part:\n\n> The term \u201cpublic domain\u201d refers to creative materials that are not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, trademark, or patent laws. The public owns these works, not an individual author or artist. Anyone can use a public domain work without obtaining permission, but no one can ever own it.\n\n* [Wikipedia article \"Monkey selfie copyright dispute\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute)\n\n\\*[\"A macaque monkey who took now\\-famous selfie photographs cannot be declared the copyright owner of the photos\"](https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2016-01-06/judge-rules-monkey-cannot-own-selfie-photos-copyright) (AP) reads in relevant part:\n\n> A macaque monkey who took now\\-famous selfie photographs cannot be declared the copyright owner of the photos, a federal judge said Wednesday.\n> \n> \n> U.S. District Judge William Orrick said in federal court in San Francisco that \"while Congress and the president can extend the protection of law to animals as well as humans, there is no indication that they did so in the Copyright Act.\"\n\n* [\\*NARUTO, a Crested Macaque, by and through his Next Friends, People forthe Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc., v.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this endeavor?\n\nA) The publisher cannot use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for commercial purposes, as it violates Google's terms of service.\n\nB) The publisher can create and sell the audiobooks, but must obtain permission from Google before distributing them.\n\nC) The publisher can freely create and sell the audiobooks, as long as they include proper attribution for the original work and do not claim ownership of the generated audio.\n\nD) The publisher cannot sell the audiobooks because the audio files generated by Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API are protected by copyright.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, works in the public domain can be freely used, modified, and distributed without copyright restrictions. While Google's terms of service initially seem to prohibit commercial use of content generated by their APIs, the clause \"Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law\" allows for the use of public domain works. \n\nThe publisher can create and sell audiobooks of public domain works using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API because:\n\n1. The original text is in the public domain and not subject to copyright restrictions.\n2. The audio generated by an automatic process like text-to-speech is not considered an \"original work of authorship\" and thus not protected by copyright.\n3. Google's terms of service do not override the legal status of public domain works.\n\nHowever, the publisher should include proper attribution for the original work and not misrepresent the source or ownership of the content, as indicated in Google's terms of service. They also should not claim copyright ownership of the generated audio files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Google's terms do not prohibit this use for public domain works. Option B is incorrect because no additional permission from Google is required. Option D is incorrect because automatically generated audio files are not protected by copyright in this context."

What are main differences between these words in common law?\n\nCan seller state \"bedroom was remodeled without permits\" to imply that what is actually garage on building blueprints is now being called bedroom?

This provides the most accurate and transparent information to potential buyers.\nD) This statement is misleading as it implies a new structure was added rather than an existing space being repurposed.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the documentation's emphasis on clear disclosure to avoid potential lawsuits for misrepresentation. While the terms are not strictly defined in common law, \"converted\" most accurately describes the change in use from a non-living space (garage) to a living space (bedroom), and the inclusion of \"without permits\" ensures full transparency about the unpermitted nature of the work."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John has won a case at the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) for a small claim of $3,000. He wants to enforce the judgment. Which of the following describes the correct process for John to file the CRT order for enforcement?\n\nA) John can immediately file the CRT order with the Supreme Court of British Columbia for enforcement.\n\nB) John must wait 28 days from the date of the decision, then file a validated copy of the CRT order with the Provincial Court, either in person, by mail, or potentially through Court Services Online (CSO) if available.\n\nC) John can email a copy of the CRT order to any Provincial Court in British Columbia and pay a processing fee to have it enforced.\n\nD) John must appear before a judge in Provincial Court to have the CRT order reviewed before it can be filed for enforcement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct process for John to file the CRT order for enforcement is described in option B. According to the provided information:\n\n1. John must wait 28 days from the date of the decision before filing. This waiting period is mentioned in the documentation from smallclaimsbc.ca.\n\n2. The order should be filed with the Provincial Court, not the Supreme Court, as this is a small claim within the monetary limit of the Small Claims Act.\n\n3. Filing can be done in person, by mail, or potentially through Court Services Online (CSO) if available. The documentation mentions these filing options.\n\n4. A validated copy of the order must be filed, not just any copy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because small claims are filed with the Provincial Court, not the Supreme Court. Option C is incorrect because emailing the order is not mentioned as a valid filing method, and there's a required waiting period. Option D is incorrect because John does not need to appear before a judge; the CRT decision is already final and just needs to be filed for enforcement."

Can the copyright owner sue the website owner for this?\nI have read [DMCA Safe Harbor](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/14) about this:\n\n> In order to qualify for safe harbor protection, a service provider who hosts content must: \\- have no knowledge of, **or financial benefit from**,\n\nIf the website owner gets a subscription fee from users, does Safe Harbor qualify then? How about services like YouTube(they have income from ads from posted videos)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're talking about sites *like Youtube*, so I'll focus on that.\n\nThat quote, which you bolded, was over\\-simplified. The actual law is\n\n> **17 USC 512 (c) Information Residing on Systems or Networks At Direction of Users.**\n> \n> \n> **(1\\) In general.** A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider\n> \n> \n> **(A)**  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(I)** does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(ii)** in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(iii)** upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;  \n> \n> **(B)** does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and  \n> \n> (C says and complies with a DMCA takedown notice).\n\nWhat you're talking about is membership fees (e.g. [Youtube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium))... or general advertisements that would be placed on **any** video without awareness of it being infringing.\n\nThat does not violate Safe Harbor *per se*. At least not on a legitimate site which is dominated by legitimate content and makes an honest, credible effort to keep it that way.\n\nThe important clause in (B) is \"In a case...\" Under (B), they lack the *ability* to control each activity (upload or view).\n\nYoutube's inability is due to receiving 500 hours (30,000 minutes) of uploaded video *every minute*, obviously requiring 30,000\\+\\+ staff seats working 24x7 to curate. That would amount to about 200,000 staff \\- all of Google is around 50,000 right now.\n\nEven if a small site were able to moderate all content, they might still have a Safe Harbor defense if they could credibly say that they did not know the material was infringing. If someone created a \"Juan Brown\" username and uploaded blancolirio's videos from YouTube, they could say \"we did not know that was not the real person\". *But if the video started with an HBO splash screen and tones, then heck no.*\n\nBut non\\-moderation is not an airtight defense. When sites are neglectful toward removal, they can soon develop a reputation as a haven for such infringing content \\- which the sites tend to embrace, since it brings many customers! This was the undoing of several music sharing sites in the 00's, since this awareness of their reputation, plus a lack of diligent removal, failed them on all three arms of 1(A) above.\n\n---\n\nRemember that a competently run website that relies on user submissions is well aware of the DMCA and its case law, and has tailored its rules and enforcement to make it easy to defend a copyright claim. For instance, in the case of music, Youtube uses some human intervention but largely automated means to either\n\n* take it down and give the uploader a copyright \"strike\" leading to a ban (which alienates their biggest contributors, especially when a popular Youtuber like blancolirio winds up with a distant car stereo in background noise, remember the detection is by \"bot\" and no human ever sanity\\-checks it).\n* de\\-monetize the suspect video (uploader gets nothing, but, neither does YouTube).\n* monetize it, but give the revenue stream to the rights holder due to an agreement with them.\n\nThe last one is Youtube's preference with regards to music. As this was vastly easier, more practical and better for the community all\\-around, allowing whole classes of content to be created that would be *prima\\-facie* illegal otherwise. And it's content people are already creating and Youtube can't stop them, so it solves a big policing problem too.",

Well apparently he move to a new place after getting out of jail I believe?\n\nAnyway, I received an email for him moving his account to the new address. I've contacted the company and was told they can't do anything themselves unless he says so. Irritated, I called him and left a voice mail telling him to please change the email and that this is not a negative message and just please asking him to do it. Even after years he still has not changed and will not answer or do what I pleaded.\n\nWill I get in trouble for changing my email to a different one? If he were to ask for the email and password to the new email I would gladly give it to him no issue. Would I get in legal trouble even thought I've asked him multiple times and tried to contact other sources to help me?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It appears from your description that you have in mind abandoning your email account (possibly closing it) and opening a new account. You have no obligation to continue using an email account that causes problems for you. Simply abandoning the account is not the wisest choice, since there is some chance that someone may gain access to the account and they do bad things with it. You are not liable for things that others do with your email, but it may be a nuisance to establish that it was someone else who used your account to do bad things. It is possible that, under the terms of service associated with that account, you are not allowed to \"share\" the account.\n\nYour comments contrarily suggests that you want to change the email associated with that electric service account, despite the fact that the company refuses to do it for you, which is also a standard refusal. If so, the alternative question seems to be, can you legally log into that account (assuming that you know the password to the electric account), and change the email address to something else. This would almost certainly be a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, because you are not authorized to access that account \u2013 it's not your account, despite your email address being associated with it. But because it's not your account, you are not responsible for anything arising from his use of your email, and any negative consequences of not keeping the email address up to date fall on him, not you.\n\nA third possibility is that you are actually at least partially responsible for the account, which seems to have been created years ago when you were living together. That is, it was and is his and your account, therefore you *are* authorized to access the account and change the email address. I assume you didn't actually leave your name on the account, but you can clarify, if you did.",

I would probably say that French Law is more powerful and would void the contract, but a second opinion is very welcomed (especially with more information).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Disclaimer: I am not an expert in French law, but do read French semi\\-decently.*\n\nFrench Law is indeed more powerful than a CC license. This is because licenses are contracts, and contracts only have as much force as the law provides for.\n\nAs [previously mentioned](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/7835/3209) on this site, Creative Commons acknowledges that even a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (the least restrictive CC licence) cannot necessarily revoke all of an author's rights, particularly moral rights. \n\nIn France, [moral rights](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=131517FC37031E1B642057DA59DE084D.tpdila12v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006161636&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&dateTexte=20161027) include a *droit de retrait*. This does not mean the CC license as a whole would be invalid, but it certainly seems that an irrevocability clause would be.\n\nSide note: The *droit de retrait* is [hard to invoke](http://jiplp.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/8/535) and is [not applicable to software](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=131517FC37031E1B642057DA59DE084D.tpdila12v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006278899&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&dateTexte=20161027).",

How does this interact with Creative Commons (CC) licenses, which are generally considered irrevocable?\n\nA) The CC license completely overrides French law, making the right of retraction inapplicable.\nB) French law invalidates the entire CC license, rendering it null and void.\nC) The right of retraction remains valid, but only for the moral rights aspect of the work, not affecting other parts of the CC license.\nD) The right of retraction has no effect on CC licenses, as they are international agreements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: French law takes precedence over CC licenses, as licenses are contracts that only have as much force as the law provides. The right of retraction (droit de retrait) is part of an author's moral rights under French law. While this right conflicts with the irrevocability clause of CC licenses, it doesn't invalidate the entire license. Instead, it affects only the moral rights aspect, allowing the author to potentially invoke this right while leaving other aspects of the CC license intact. It's important to note that the right of retraction is difficult to invoke and doesn't apply to software.

The first trial involved 3 years of testimony and 9 weeks of deliberation, resulting in acquittal for one defendant. A second defendant was cleared of only 52 of the 65 charges but two jurors would not acquit on the remaining counts. The second trial of 6 of those charges lasted 2 months and resulted in a hung jury, at which point the prosecutor gave up. This is the longest criminal trial in US history.\n\n[This book](https://www.judges.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/On_Trial_The_Length_of_Civil_and_Criminal_Trials.pdf) esp. ch. 2 computes a median total trial duration of 11 hour and seven minutes for criminal trials, from jury selection though deliberation. However that figure goes up to 33 hour and 4 minutes for homicide cases, and it also turns out that venue matters (almost an order of magnitude longer trials in Marin county compared to Elizabeth NJ). Unfortunately there is no analysis of variance in that study, so we don't know about factors tending to result in longer trials vs. shorter trials. Given all of the factors related to trials, it's likely that the trial, if there is a trial, will last less than a year.",

[It is enumerated in a number of government constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial).\n\nHowever during the COVID\\-19 pandemic many courts suspended operations for months, and now more than 6 months later many are still struggling to resume even limited criminal trials. This means that defendants will wait at least six months longer than usual for trials.\n\nHow does the law balance the delays wrought by exigent circumstances like this pandemic with the fundamental right of defendants to speedy trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The hard part is figuring out what the nstional standard of speed is. As held in [US v. Marion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/404/307/), 404 U.S. 307,\nThe Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a speedy trial is applicable only after a person has been \"accused\" of a crime. In Washington, [Rule CrR 3\\.3](https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/?fa=court_rules.display&group=sup&set=CrR&ruleid=supCrR3.3) states the number of days and the order of priority to be given to trials. Therefore, under section (b), criminal trials take precedence over civil cases; criminal trials are to commence within 60 days or 90 days, depending on whether defendant is incarcerated. There are a number of factors that allow the deadline clock to reset, such as failure to appear, mistrial, change of venue etc. This also includes \"exclusions\" (events not counted for the 60/90 day rule) such as competency hearings, continuances and of particular interest for covid:\n\n> (8\\) Unavoidable or\n> unforeseen circumstances affecting the time for trial beyond the\n> control of the court or of the parties.\n\nIf that doesn't work out, then there is a \"cure\":\n\n> (g) The court may continue the case beyond the limits specified in\n> section (b) on motion of the court or a party made within five days\n> after the time for trial has expired. Such a continuance may be\n> granted only once in the case upon a finding on the record or in\n> writing that the defendant will not be substantially prejudiced in the\n> presentation of his or her defense. The period of delay shall be for\n> no more than 14 days for a defendant detained in jail, or 28 days for\n> a defendant not detained in jail, from the date that the continuance\n> is granted. The court may direct the parties to remain in attendance\n> or be on\\- call for trial assignment during the cure period.\n\nThat give a little bit of leeway. If they still cannot manage within that time frame, the last section of the rule is\n\n> (h) A charge not brought to trial within the time limit determined\n> under this rule shall be dismissed with prejudice. The State shall\n> provide notice of dismissal to the victim and at the court's\n> discretion shall allow the victim to address the court regarding the\n> impact of the crime. No case shall be dismissed for time\\-to\\-trial\n> reasons except as expressly required by this rule, a statute, or the\n> state or federal constitution.\n\nThe covid lockdown orders appear to have worked around the time to trial rules. [This order of March 20](http://www.courts.wa.gov/content/publicUpload/Supreme%20Court%20Orders/Supreme%20Court%20Emergency%20Order%20re%20CV19%20031820.pdf) orders that\n\n> 4. All criminal jury trials are suspended until after April 24, 2020\\.

For all criminal trials suspended under this provision,\n> April 25, 2020 will be the new commencement date under CrR 3\\.3\\.\n\nSo it seems likely given the existing latitude in commencing trials that section (h) has not been invoked, and covid hasn't been a criminal get out of jail free card. But that's just Washington, and it may be an under\\-advertised problem.",

I noticed that on Wikipedia it is mentioned that Australia has an entity called the [Australian National Audit Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit#Auditing_Australia), and that sounds kind of like what I am looking for.\n\nP.S. You may want to re\\-tag my question with \"auditors\", \"audits\", or something more appropriate than I have been able to find in the tags.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Within the field of accounting, the process of maintaining financial records and auditing financial records for purposes other than tax collection is called \"financial accounting\" as distinct from \"tax accounting\" and as distinct from \"managerial accounting\" which is the internal use of financial information for the purposes of managing the entity and improving its performance rather than for outside oversight of an entity. \n\nFinancial audits (as opposed to \"performance audits\") almost always pertain to either financial accounting or tax accounting. Obviously, tax audits are done by tax collection officials.\n\nIn the United States, financial accounting standards for non\\-profits are primarily set by a private organization controlled by the accounting profession called the [Not\\-for\\-Profit Advisory Committee](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/BridgePage&cid=1351027226246) which provides advise that is usually followed to the accounting profession controlled private [Financial Accounting Standards Board](http://www.fasb.org/home) that defines \"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\" (GAAP) in the United States for the for profit and non\\-profit sectors. This is the main body that sets industry accounting standards particular to non\\-profits and for fund accounting.\n\nThe private sector financial standards set by organizations like the FASC and NAC which are controlled by the accounting profession, are then adopted by reference by public or private organizations that want to specify accounting rules without having to devise them from scratch themselves.\n\nThese financial accounting standards are subject to specific tax law rules set by the IRS (under the Internal Revenue Code, [ERISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act), and related regulations and regulatory guidance) and state tax collection agencies, and by other industry specific regulations.\n\nIn cases where non\\-profits issue publicly held debt, the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or other applicable state and federal securities regulators, and the governing body of any exchange upon which the bonds issued by the non\\-profit are traded can also impose accounting standards. \n\nState probate statute also set some of the accounting standards for non\\-profits such as the rules for distinguishing between principal and interest.\n\nPublic or private donors to non\\-profits usually make grants that condition receipt of grant funds on a right to audit the non\\-profit, and investors in bonds issued by a non\\-profit generally have either a contractual or statutory right to obtain audited financial statements from the non\\-profit as well. These audits would usually be performance by Certified Public Accountants in private practice (and regulated under state administered licensing schemes) who are hired on an audit by audit basis.\n\nIn addition to tax collection authorities, and private people who have audit rights because they have invested in bonds from the entity or have given grants to the entity, **state attorneys\\-general** will generally have broad supervisory authority over non\\-profits including the same kinds of rights with respect to a non\\-profit that a beneficiary of a private trust would have (although sometimes a different official in state government is given this authority). \n\nState attorneys\\-general are given this authority so that there is someone with jurisdiction to oversee the affairs of, and prosecute misconduct in, charitable organizations with no well defined individuals or entities that are permanent beneficiaries of the charities.",

According to the information provided, the FASB is a private organization controlled by the accounting profession that defines \"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\" (GAAP) in the United States for both for-profit and non-profit sectors. The Not-for-Profit Advisory Committee provides advice to the FASB, which then sets the primary financial accounting standards for non-profits.\n\nA) The IRS is incorrect because while it sets specific tax law rules, it does not set the primary financial accounting standards for non-profits.\n\nC) The SEC is incorrect because its involvement is limited to cases where non-profits issue publicly held debt, and it does not set the primary accounting standards for all non-profits.\n\nD) State Attorneys-General is incorrect because while they have broad supervisory authority over non-profits, they do not set the primary financial accounting standards. Their role is more focused on overseeing the affairs of and prosecuting misconduct in charitable organizations."

Where did the robes originate, and why do judges (and lawyers) wear them?\n\nFor example, the first image shows justices of the Canadian Supreme Court, the second shows justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the third shows a british judge.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nazn5.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nazn5.jpg)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MX4DC.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MX4DC.jpg)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w26v6.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w26v6.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The black judicial robes date back in time hundreds, if not thousands of years. In medieval times, all educated people in the British isles, not just judges wore robes and these were customs descended from the Gaelic people who originally ruled Britain and Ireland. This custom differed from that of the Romans who wore togas.\n\nThe Gaelic elite wore robes with color signifying rank, black being the lowest rank, that of a docent, the lowest level of a professor. Later, when the Saxons invaded they eventually adopted some of the customs of the Gaels. The culmination of this was the founding of what is now known as Oxford University by [King Alfred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great), the greatest of the Saxon kings. This tradition was preserved and developed at Oxford which affected the dress of all academics, including lawyers and justices.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)\n\n**Thomas More in his regalia typical of an Oxford Don, c. 1500**\n\nThese patterns of dress also were influenced somewhat by Italian clerical styles. The main difference between the Italian styles and the Gaelic styles is that Italian robes are usually coats, opening in the front. The Gaelic robe either has no opening at all, just a hole the head is put through, or is divided at the back.\n\n**Wigs**\n\nThe custom of wearing wigs or perukes was a late development which originated in France in the 1700s and has no great antiquity at all.",

We published his full answer on <http://ttsreader.com/blog/2017/05/10/copyright/>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I presume the input is text: \"my original text\" is assumed to mean you wrote (created) the text. That means that you hold the copyright to the text, and only you can authorize a derivative work (such as a synthesized recording). Therefore, you hold the copyright to the recordings as well. The crucial consideration governing that right is that you \"created\" the work, meaning that there is a [modicum of creativity](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/9413/4501). However, if you did not create the text and your only function is to host an automatic process where users can create a synthesized recording, then whoever created the text has the right to the text and derivative works (i.e. the synthesized output). Automated processes like (unassisted) OCR or wav\\-to\\-mp3 conversion would not count as being \"original\", nor would automatic text\\-to\\-speech, so you don't gain copyright just from making an automatic work\\-creating tool available.\n\nOn the assumption that the conversion involves a component of Chrome, you can use the service per the [terms of service](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/privacy/eula_text.html), though you cannot \"reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services\". This might limit the extent to which you could make this conversion available to others, depending on how, exactly, you could do such a thing (does it duplicate the service?). As they say, Google owns all legal right to the *Services*, but Google obtains no right from you for any content created through their service.\n\nThere is no restriction in the TOS against using the service for commercial purposes. Even if there were, that would not assign copyright in the recording to anyone else, it would just mean they could sue you for violating the TOS.",

The author holds the copyright to both the original text and the resulting audio recording. This is because:\n\n1. The author created the original text, giving them initial copyright.\n2.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The developer can freely transfer the software IP to a new company without any legal implications.\nB) Shutting down the current company and starting a new one is a straightforward solution to remove the problematic partner.\nC) The company likely owns the IP, and liquidation would result in splitting assets among shareholders.\nD) The developer retains full ownership of the software IP regardless of the company structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, the company probably owns the intellectual property (IP) of the software. If the company is liquidated, assuming all creditors can be paid, the assets (including the software IP) would be split among the shareholders based on their ownership percentages. This means the developer cannot simply transfer the IP to a new company without considering the other partners' rights. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the developer cannot freely transfer the IP if it's owned by the company. Option B is misleading as it oversimplifies the process and ignores the legal implications of asset distribution. Option D is incorrect because once the software was sold through the company, the IP likely became a company asset rather than remaining solely with the developer.\n\nThe documentation also suggests an alternative approach: using the controlling interest (2/3 ownership) to change how profits are distributed, potentially encouraging the problematic partner to accept a buyout offer."

Additionally, they may be subject to foreign tax obligations, but this depends on several factors including local laws, existing tax treaties between the U.S. and the foreign country, the nature of their employment, and the reason for their stay abroad. The answer acknowledges the complexity of international tax situations and the need to consider multiple factors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because U.S. citizens and green card holders are generally required to pay U.S. taxes on their worldwide income, regardless of where they are working.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while U.S. tax obligations remain, there's no automatic exemption from foreign taxes based solely on the length of stay.\n\nOption D is incorrect because tax obligations are determined by law, not by the taxpayer's preference.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A while ago I was contacted by an old friend who wished to borrow my bank account to do online transactions, which has online banking enabled, while theirs is not. They want to confirm payments before sending the digital goods, so the plan is: whenever a payment is made, I told them and transfer the money, then they release the goods. I agreed and there were several payments, which I promptly transferred to them as soon as I received them. All of this happens in just one day, and no payment made and no further contact, until a few weeks then, my account got frozen.\n\nIt turned out that they seem were advertising selling tickets in Instagram, in which they provided my account number and told buyers to send the money there. The tickets were never sent, and the day after the money was sent the Instagram account was deleted. This was the day after I was contacted, so it matched out.\n\nThis 'friend' denied the connection with the seller account. The complication was that I've never met in\\-person with them.\n\nI can prove the chat requesting the borrowing, via Messenger and Whatsapp.\n\nWhat should I do? Can I be prosecuted if the victim of the fraud reported this to the police? What are my options?\n\nThis happened in Indonesia, but I'm interested if this happens in other countries.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can\u2019t speak for Indonesia but if you did this in Australia you would be a criminal.\n\nYou either committed fraud or are an accessory to fraud. You would probably be considered an accessory at and after the fact which [means](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/am-i-guilty-if-i-wasnt-directly-involved-in-a-crime/) you are subject to the same maximum penalty as if you had committed the fraud yourself \\- 10 years in jail.\n\nIn addition, you are liable to repay the money taken, jointly and severally with your \u2018friend\u2019. However, if they can only find you, you cannot recover from your \u2018friend\u2019 as you were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise.\n\nScams such as you describe are distressingly common and many people fall for them. As such, assuming the court accepted your story (because you might actually be the fraudster and have just made it up) you would be unlikely to get close to the full sentence and if you caught the judge on a good day, might even escape jail. If you are lucky, the jury might acquit, even though, on the facts, they shouldn\u2019t \\- juries do what juries do. If you\u2019re really lucky the police might decide not to prosecute.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the bank account lending scenario described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications in Australia?\n\nA) The person who lent their bank account would likely face no legal consequences as they were unaware of the fraudulent activity.\n\nB) The account lender would only be liable for repaying the stolen money, but would not face criminal charges.\n\nC) The account lender could be charged as an accessory to fraud, facing up to 10 years in jail and joint liability for repaying the stolen funds.\n\nD) The account lender would be considered the primary fraudster and face more severe penalties than the friend who requested to use the account.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, in Australia, the person who lent their bank account could be considered an accessory to fraud, both at and after the fact. This means they could face the same maximum penalty as the primary fraudster, which is up to 10 years in jail. Additionally, they would be jointly and severally liable for repaying the stolen money. While the actual sentence might be less severe depending on circumstances and the judge's discretion, the legal exposure is significant. Option A is incorrect because ignorance of the fraudulent activity does not exempt one from legal consequences in this case. Option B is incomplete, as it doesn't account for potential criminal charges. Option D overstates the account lender's culpability compared to the friend who initiated the scheme."

Regulations like the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) might affect how they can be taken.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal considerations?\n\nA) As long as the cashier doesn't post the videos online, there are no legal concerns to consider.\n\nB) The cashier only needs permission from their manager to record videos during work hours.\n\nC) The cashier must obtain consent from every customer visible in the recordings, regardless of intent to publish.\n\nD) The cashier should consult with lawyers specializing in employment and privacy law in their specific jurisdiction before proceeding.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the legal implications of recording videos in the workplace can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction. Even if the videos are not intended for online posting, they still involve processing personal data, which may be subject to privacy laws like GDPR. Additionally, there may be requirements for notifying individuals about being recorded, obtaining consent, and properly storing and protecting the data. Employment laws may also come into play regarding workplace surveillance. Consulting with specialized lawyers in the relevant jurisdiction is the most prudent approach to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are legal considerations even if the videos aren't posted online. Option B is insufficient, as permission from the manager alone doesn't address all potential legal issues. Option C may be overly strict and might not be necessary in all jurisdictions, which is why expert legal advice is crucial."

This would mean that any unstructured data should not be included in a data subject access request.\n\nIs this a reasonable conclusion for unstructured data such as message bodies in email archives?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, in my opinion, [Recital 15 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-15/) does not support the conclusion that unstructured electronic data, such as email message bodies, would be exempted from GDPR. \n\nAs indicated in the comments, the last sentence in Recital 15 refers to *physical* files or sets of files. This follows from the wording (\"files or sets of files\" and the reference to \"cover pages\") and is clear when looking at the translations (the german version refers to \"Akten oder Aktensammlungen\" and the french to \"Les dossiers ou ensembles de dossiers\"). \n\nThis interpretation is further supported by [Article 2(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-2-gdpr/) which separates between \"processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means\" and \"processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\".\n\nThis means that, generally, electronically processed personal data is covered by the GDPR (irrespective of whether the processing is structured or not), and personal data in physical papers or files is only covered by the GDPR if it is structured (or intended to be structured).",

However, only physical abuse is illegal, and thus can be intervened. But, psychologically speaking, other forms of abuse are also impactful as well. Especially the case of manipulation. And there are also signs and symptoms to conclude whether such abuses happen or not. So why they aren't illegal?\n\nOr perhaps it's more about evidence rather than law? To quote one person:\n\n> There is no finite definition of mental/emotional abuse. No protocols or reference to state what's harsh, excessive, just bad parenting... and there are no legal definitions. Its not like physical abuse where you have concrete signatures. It's a very destructive abstract so prevalent... hell, we know the damage it causes long term, have long known it, but as hurtful as it is, its technically not illegal. Unless it causes a physical manifestation like suicide... the occurrences are typically denied and its shrugged off.\n\nI'm asking about adults as well, not just children. I just can't find a suitable tag.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Subsection (3\\) of **The Domestic Abuse Act (Scotland) 2018** defines [abusive behaviour](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2018/5/section/2/enacted) as:\n\n> (a) making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A,\n> \n> \n> (b) isolating B from friends, relatives or other sources of support,\n> \n> \n> (c) controlling, regulating or monitoring B\u2019s day\\-to\\-day activities,\n> \n> \n> (d) depriving B of, or restricting B\u2019s, freedom of action,\n> \n> \n> (e) frightening, humiliating, degrading or punishing B.\n\nand also\n\n> In subsection in paragraph (a), the reference to violent behaviour\n> includes sexual violence as well as physical violence,\n\nSo there are some jurisdictions where the examples you list are illegal.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm not a lawyer, so can't provide much more insight into the evidentiary requirements of this Act. The Assistant Chief Constable of Scotland was quoted as saying that law officers and staff have \"***received further training on the dynamics of power and control in abusive relationships to help recognise the signs, identify investigative opportunities and to tackle the myths and misconceptions of abuse that still exist.\"***, but no indication of what that amounts to in practice regarding evidence thresholds.",

In some states the Secretary of State holds the records for business entities and in others, such as Arizona, it's an organization known as the Arizona Corporation Commission.\n\nRegardless of the state's organization that keeps the information, one of the pieces of information you will find when you look at a company's records is the \"registered agent\", \"resident agent\" or \"statutory agent.\"\n\nThe agent, whether a person or a representative corporation, must be located within the state where business is conducted. That agent is who or what gets served with papers for a lawsuit.\n\nHere's a good explanation at [legalzoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/knowledge/corporation/faq/corporation-registered-agent-requirement).\n\nA personal example that may help: I am an owner in a business that does business in Louisiana and Arizona. Our LLC is registered in Louisiana and is registered as a \"foreign corporation\" in Arizona. However, we are required to have a registered agent in each state. We pay a company to act as our registered agent in each state and the registered agent has a physical address in each state in which we are registered.\n\nIf someone wants to sue my company then they can look up the name of my company in either state and will find my registered agent along with the registered agent's physical address. Service to the registered agent counts as service to my company. The agent will forward to me any service which is made to them.\n\nEDIT: if you don't known the name of the entity, i.e., the name on the door of the business does not represent the name of the company, then you need to find the \"doing business as,\" or DBA record of the company.\n\nI don't know what state you're in but all the states in which I've done business maintain a \"Doing Business As\" system that can be searched. I guess it's possible that you're in a state that doesn't maintain DBA filings or require them.\n\nTypically, you can search either way \\- search by owner or search by the DBA name.

This is because:\n\n1. DBA records link the public-facing business name to the actual legal entity.\n2.

Paul says Nancy was sitting in his lap rolling her thing.\"\n\nPolice brought drug\\-possession charges against the plaintiff, but the grand jury declined to indict. Briggs then brought a Section 1983 claim for malicious prosecution, and the Court held that the claim was viable if the officer should have known \"that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause, and that he should not have applied for the warrant.\"\n\nIt may not even be the point of the case, but does the Court's decision give any indication that the affidavit did or did not meet that standard?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. It affirmed the appeals decision and remanded the case to the lower court to decide that as a matter of fact, it was irrelevant to the ruling whether the officer and/or magistrate had probable cause.\n\nBasically the ruling said that should have been addressed before giving a judgement, and not glossed over. If the lower court had said, and the court of appeals had affirmed, that there was probable cause and thus the officer was entitled to qualified immunity, the high court would have denied certiorari and let the decision stand.\n\nInstead, the lower court said, true statements, immune, which puts the total burden on the magistrate.\n\nSay that officer had a sworn statement saying that John Doe of 123 Main Street was seen committing murder. The officer goes to a magistrate and says that they have a sworn statement that John Doe was seen committing murder, and there is a John Doe at 321 First Street, please issue an arrest and search warrant for John Doe at 321 First Avenue. Omitting the fact that the identified John Doe is at a different address, doesn\u2019t change the truth of the rest of the information submitted to the magistrate.\n\nAccording to the lower courts ruling, that would be entirely legal and the officer could not be held accountable.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the officer would be liable because while the facts were true no reasonable officer would believe there was probable cause to issue a warrant for a different John Doe under the circumstances.\n\nThe dissenting opinion in this case amounts to saying that the affidavit was good, and they could directly affirm the appeals court ruling.",

The Supreme Court's decision in Malley v. Briggs established that police officers can be held liable under Section 1983 if they should have known that their affidavit failed to establish probable cause, even if a magistrate approved the warrant. This ruling rejected the lower courts' approach of granting automatic immunity to officers who submitted truthful affidavits, regardless of whether those affidavits actually established probable cause.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Court explicitly rejected the notion that officers are always immune if their affidavit contains true statements, emphasizing the importance of the totality of the information presented.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the Court did not make a determination about whether probable cause existed in this specific case. In fact, the Court remanded the case for further proceedings on this issue.\n\nAnswer D is overly broad and incorrect.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have immigrated from European countryA to European countryB several years ago. Before I left I was operating a small business with a close family member, they were taking care of the accounting/tax issues with their close accountant. I did not care to check very extensively about any wrong doings because they were family and I could not comprehend a fraudalent action on their behalf (never do this kids).\n\nLong story short I have discovered the following:\n\n1\\) Without my knowledge or consent they opened a bank account and gave two checks worth 16\\.000 euros. Of course the money did not exist in the bank, the checks were denied, I was procecuted and trialed without me knowing everything or attending a trial. This happened more than 5 years ago, I did not know it because the mail was stolen from my house at that period from the same person. Everything was forged and nothing bears my signature\n\n2\\) Some debts on my behalf were created to vendors, debt recognition forms were signed on my behalf, I have never seen or signed those papers\n\n3\\) Taxes of almost 30\\.000 euros were unpaid.\n\nNow some good things\n1\\) Proving the forgery I assume should be easy, I write with my left and the signatures do not resemble mine at all, they do not even exist in my official documents, my signature is totally different\n\n2\\) The person who did this (as I learned recently) has been convicted of forgery and usury 10 years back and my record (besides these) is clean. Plus my job is totally different at this point and I can provide my paychecks which will definetely show that I was in no need of any kind of financial assistance for many years (remote worker with western European salary in eastern Europe)\n\n3\\) There are many clients who are willing to testify that they have never seen me, and vendors, and that they have been dealing with that person for the entirety of their transactions\n\n4\\) They have unknowledged on emails their guilt (by starting to pay off the debt in the tax services)\n\nMy questions mostly have to do whether these actions will have an impact in my life in this country which I have strived to build:\n\n1\\) Can the tax services in countryA confiscate accounts that are opened in countryB by me?\n2\\) Do you think based on these that I have case?\n\nMy primary concern is whether they can confiscate or do something to my property here until I figure all this out.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The following answer applies in the situation where all countries involved are member states of the European Union:\n\n> Can the tax services in countryA confiscate accounts that are opened in countryB by me?\n\nAll countries in the European Union (EU) are party to the Brussels Regulation (Regulation No. 1215/2012\\), this regulation means that judgments made in one EU member state may be enforced in another EU member state, against those person who judgment is made against.\n\nIt may take some time, procedurally, for the judgment creditor to do this, but they are entitled to do so. \n\nAnyway, what this means for someone in such a position is that they contact a lawyer in \"countryA's\" jurisdiction to help appeal or find a way to mitigate the judgment since it was awarded as a result of fraud. Alternatively, when proceedings begin to register the judgment in countryB, one in such a position may choose to hire a lawyer practicing in countryB to challenge the registration of the judgment",

However, the process is not immediate and may take some time procedurally for the judgment creditor to complete. This allows for the possibility of challenging the judgment or its registration in Country B. Options A and D are incorrect as they contradict the regulation's provisions. Option B is incorrect because it overlooks the procedural steps required for enforcement in another EU country."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tenant John Doe signed a lease in 10/2015 to rent an apartment for a year in Texas. The balance due each month consisted of the apartment rent ($1000\\) and a monthly fee for water/sewer/garbage collection/pest control (\"fee A\") which was typically $45\\. While the amount of \"fee A\" could vary, it was typically the same each month. Tenants could view the exact amount of \"fee A\" on a 3rd\\-party website, if necessary.\n\nThe apartments were owned by Company X. Company X did not deliver rent statements to tenants. Tenants were responsible for remebering their rent and also adding that to \"Fee A.\" If necessary, tenants could stop by the apartment office and inquire about their rent balance in person before paying.\n\nIn 4/2016, Company X sold apartments to Company Z. Not long thereafter, Company Z began delivering rent balance statements to tenants' mailboxes and also charging tenants an administrative fee of $3 per month to deliver said statements.\n\nTenant John Doe spoke with the apartment office about the fee. Tenant said he did not believe he should pay fee because he did not agree to pay it in his lease contract. Management replied, \"That's how they're doing it now.\"\n\nTenant believes that apartment tenants should be notified about such fees in advance and be given the option to opt\\-out of statement deliveries if they do not wish to pay the corresponding fee. \n\n**Question**: If the lease contract does not specifically permit such a fee to be charged, does the landlord have the legal right to demand tenants pay an administrative fee for statement deliveries?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No they don't, changes to an existing contract must be agreed by all parties to it.

The $3 administrative fee was not part of the original lease agreement, and changes to an existing contract must be agreed upon by all parties involved. Therefore, John Doe is not legally obligated to pay this new fee. He can deduct the $3 from his rent payment, as suggested in the top answer from LawStackExchange. However, this action may lead to a dispute with Company Z, potentially resulting in legal action. The tenant should be prepared for this possibility and keep detailed records of all communications and payments. Options A and B are incorrect because they assume the landlord has the right to unilaterally change the terms of the lease, which is not legally valid. Option C is partially correct about the fee being illegal, but it oversimplifies the potential consequences of refusing to pay."

In the UK, law can only be changed through statutory instruments, which come from parliament or delegated officials. Courts do not create new laws but rather interpret, develop, and clarify existing laws. Their decisions are binding on lower courts but do not constitute new legislation. Pressure groups and law reform agencies can advocate for change but cannot directly modify laws. Option A is incorrect as it suggests all four methods have equal power to reform law. Option B overstates the court's ability to create new laws. Option D incorrectly attributes direct law-changing authority to pressure groups and law reform agencies."

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. YouTube offers two types of licenses: Standard YouTube License and Creative Commons License.\n\n2. The Standard YouTube License does not allow for derivative works, which is what the translation overlay would be considered.\n\n3. The Creative Commons License does allow for derivative works, but only if the terms of the license are followed.\n\n4. Simply obtaining permission from content creators (as suggested in option D) is not sufficient if the video is under the Standard YouTube License, as this would still violate YouTube's policies.\n\n5. Monetization (as mentioned in option A) does not grant any special rights to use content outside of YouTube's policies.\n\n6. The service would violate policies for videos under the Standard YouTube License, even with creator permission (contrary to option B), but could be compliant for Creative Commons Licensed videos.\n\nTherefore, to comply with YouTube's policies, the startup would need to ensure they only use videos under the Creative Commons License and adhere to the terms of that license."

It seems there were at least 2 similar incidents in the past few years with previous employees. The store manager was unhelpful and said it was my problem.\n\nThis makes me wonder in a situation where a tree falls on a car in a private lot is it considered an act of nature? or does liability fall to the owner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not\n------------\n\nIn order to establish negligence as a Cause of Action under the tort of negligence, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant:\n\n1. had a duty to the plaintiff,\n2. breached that duty by failing to conform to the required standard of conduct (generally the standard of a reasonable person),\n3. the negligent conduct was the cause of the harm to the plaintiff, and\n4. the plaintiff was, in fact, harmed or damaged.\n\n**What standard of conduct do you think your employer failed to conform with?**\n\nOwning a tree or a parking lot is not, of itself, negligent. Further, the branch fell \"during high winds\" \\- the wind is not within your employer's control.\n\nNow, if you can prove that your employer knew that the particular tree was ill and likely to drop branches in high winds and failed to do anything about it, that might be considered negligent.

The employer may be liable if they knew the tree was diseased or prone to dropping branches and failed to address it. This aligns with the principles of negligence outlined in the documentation. To establish negligence, the plaintiff must prove the defendant had a duty, breached that duty, and that the breach caused harm. Simply owning a tree or parking lot isn't negligent, but if the employer was aware of a hazardous condition (like a diseased tree) and failed to act, they could be found negligent. The other options are incorrect because: A) doesn't account for the need to prove negligence; B) oversimplifies the \"act of God\" defense without considering potential negligence; and D) incorrectly places blanket responsibility on the employee."

In order for the US to be at war, what are the requirements for the other party? In the distant past the party has been recognized nation states (Germany, Italy, Japan, etc.) \n\nQUESTIONS\n=========\n\n1. Is it possible for the US to be at war with a non\\-nation actor (ISIL, Al\\-Qaeda), in the same way that the US was at war with other recognized nations in WWII?\n2. If yes, has there been a declaration of war with XXXX (ISIL, Al\\-Qaeda, etc.)\n3. Do the conventions of war apply to ideological combatants (i.e. not representing a recognized state)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [Article One, Section Eight](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8) of the Constitution, \n\n> The Congress shall have power...\n> \n> \n> To declare war\n\nbut does not say what follows from \"declaring war\", nor does it say what form such a declaration shall take. [This rather long document](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf) analyzes the notion of \"declaration of war\". The primary significance of a \"declaration of war\" lies in international law, see the [Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907). Articles 1 and 2 say:\n\n> The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves\n>  must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form\n>  either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with\n>  conditional declaration of war\n\nand\n\n> The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers\n>  without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after\n>  the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by\n>  telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of\n>  notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware\n>  of the existence of a state of war\n\nSo if the US were to declare war on Canada, we would need to officially notify the government of Canada of this fact, which we could do because there is a country Canada whose government we can inform. This is not possible with \"terrorism\", which is not a nation. There were official declarations for the War of 1812, against Mexico, Spain, and WW I, WW II (11 declarations). Since \"the South\" was not (from the perspective of \"the North\") a separate country, the United States did not declare war on itself to conduct the Civil War. In fact, since the congressional action authorizing military action against the Algerine Cruisers (the [2nd Barbary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War)) in 1815, the actions authorized by Congress have not used the word \"war\" (except in mentioning a specific law, the War Powers Act), except in the aforementioned declared wars. Instead, the resolution described what could be done:\n\n> it shall be lawful fully to equip, officer, man and employ such of the\n>  armed vessels of the United States as may be judged requisite by the\n>  President of the United States for protecting effectually the\n>  commerce and seamen thereof on the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean\n>  and adjoining seas\n\n\"Declared war\" is a fairly limited genre of use of force, but \"being at war\" in the broadest sense, is common and can involve concepts and things (terrorism, poverty, drugs).",

The Global War on Terror is not a formally declared war in the traditional sense. Since 1815, with few exceptions like World War I and II, Congress has authorized military actions without explicitly using the term \"war.\" Instead, they typically describe specific actions that can be taken, such as equipping and employing armed forces. The GWOT falls into this category of congressionally authorized military actions that don't constitute a formal declaration of war.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the GWOT is not a formally declared war against specific nation-states. Option C is incorrect because the US has not followed the process of declaring war against non-state actors like Al-Qaeda or ISIL. Option D is incorrect because while the US hasn't formally declared war, the term GWOT does have a legal basis in congressional authorizations for the use of military force."

It doesn't clearly fit the definition of a standard sale, as Person A is not operating as a business and is not profiting from the transaction. However, it also doesn't fully align with the concept of a gift, given the expectation of reimbursement. The arrangement has elements of both a friendly favor and a financial transaction, but doesn't neatly fit into existing legal categories for consumer transactions or personal loans. Without specific legal precedent addressing this type of informal arrangement, it's difficult to definitively categorize it under current UK law. This ambiguity makes option D the most accurate response, highlighting the complexity of applying existing legal frameworks to novel digital and informal transactions."

Even if the confession was false, the communication is still protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nD) Incorrect. Lawyers cannot file complaints against their own clients based on information shared in confidence. This would be a severe breach of ethics and professional conduct.\n\nThe correct action is to maintain confidentiality. Lawyers are ethically bound to protect client communications, even if they later learn the information was false or misleading. Unless there's an immediate threat of future harm, the lawyer should not take any action based on this confession."

Border agents had caught him two days earlier crossing into Texas with his 6\\-year\\-old son. He quickly pleaded guilty...(he) was sentenced to time served and a $10 fee.\n\nPresumably, he was turned over for deportation processing. So, after pleading guilty, would Torres\\-Perdomo have further judicial or administrative hearings before being physically removed to his home country?\n\nThe reason I wonder, is because the BCP and DHS seem to be suggesting that detentions prior to removal may take weeks or months. \n\nThe article actually raises a lot of other questions, but I'd like to focus on this first.\n\nI'm not sure that this should be in Law SE or Politics SE, as it might have a home in either or both\\- feel free to migrate to Politics\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> So, after pleading guilty, would Torres\\-Perdomo have further judicial\n>  or administrative hearings before being physically removed to his home\n>  country?\n\nNo. All that would have to be done is for DHS to arrange transportation to his home country from the USA. The guilty plea would consent to deportation without further hearing.\n\n> The reason I wonder, is because the BCP and DHS seem to be suggesting\n>  that detentions prior to removal may take weeks or months.\n\nI think that this is in cases where there is not a guilty plea, for example, where an asylum claim is made by the person detained.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the case of Mariano Torres-Perdomo, what is the most likely sequence of events for an individual who pleads guilty to illegally entering the United States at the border?\n\nA) Guilty plea, sentencing, extended detention, multiple hearings, then deportation\nB) Guilty plea, sentencing, immediate deportation without further hearings\nC) Guilty plea, sentencing, asylum hearing, then either deportation or asylum granted\nD) Guilty plea, sentencing, mandatory weeks-long detention, then deportation\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The information provided indicates that after pleading guilty to illegally entering the country, an individual like Torres-Perdomo would likely face immediate deportation without further hearings. The guilty plea effectively consents to deportation, and all that remains is for DHS to arrange transportation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests extended detention and multiple hearings, which are not typically necessary after a guilty plea.\n\nOption C is incorrect because filing for asylum would generally occur before pleading guilty, not after.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests a mandatory weeks-long detention period, which is not mentioned as a requirement in the given information. The article actually contrasts this case with situations where longer detentions occur, typically when there is not a guilty plea."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am quite confused by what seems at the outset to be a very simple question in the UK's obscenity laws. Suppose a person puts an obscene story on a website (we'll call them the Writer) and another person reads the story (we'll call them the Reader). \n\nIs the Reader guilty of 'publishing' the material and therefore in breach of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act?\n\nIn the normal sense, 'publication' is defined in an online context as \n\n\"*to submit (content) online*, as to a message board or blog: I published a comment on her blog post with examples from my own life.\" \naccording to www.dictionary.com (emphasis added is mine). \n\nIn the context of the Obscene Publications Act, the word 'publishes' seems to have been redefined, appropriated to become a piece of legalese that no longer reflects the original meaning of the word. The wording of the Act states (emphasis mine) \\-\n\n(3\\)For the purposes of this Act a person publishes an article who\u2014\n\n(a)distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire; or\n\n(b)in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or projects it \\[F1, **or, where the matter is data stored electronically, transmits that data**.]:\n\n. . . F2\n\nWhat does it mean to 'transmit' that data? Regina vs Waddon has shown that transmission is said to have occurred when the data is uploaded to the Website by the Author or downloaded from the Website by the Reader. In both those instances, the Author was deemed to have 'published' the article. (The reason it mattered was that although the Website was hosted abroad, the UK\\-resident Author had still broken the UK law when the material was downloaded in the UK so he could therefore be prosecuted). \n\nBut what about the Reader? ... This nebulous wording seems to imply all manner of things.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer to your question is 'No'. The 1959 Act only creates an offence relating to the sale, production, promotion or publication of material that is obscene for the purposes of the Act.\n\nThe crucial issue is the nature of the \"obscene material\". Under the 1959 Act, the test is in s1(1\\) \"deprave and corrupt\". \n\nThere are examples of where it is an offence to be in possession of certain materials: child pornography or material that could be used in the preparation of a terrorist act are obvious examples.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the UK's Obscene Publications Act of 1959, which of the following actions would most likely be considered \"publishing\" obscene material?\n\nA) A person reading an obscene story on a website\nB) A person uploading an obscene story to a website hosted in another country\nC) A person sharing a link to an obscene story on social media\nD) A person saving an obscene story to their personal computer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because merely reading obscene material is not considered publishing under the Act. The reader is not distributing or transmitting the data.\n\nB) is correct because uploading content to a website, even if hosted abroad, is considered \"transmitting data\" and thus falls under the Act's definition of publishing. This is supported by the Regina vs Waddon case mentioned in the passage.\n\nC) is a gray area not specifically addressed in the given information, but sharing a link is less likely to be considered publishing than directly uploading content.\n\nD) is incorrect because saving a story to a personal computer does not involve distribution or transmission to others, which are key elements of \"publishing\" under the Act.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the Act's definition of publishing, which includes \"transmits that data\" in the case of electronically stored material, and is further supported by the legal precedent mentioned in the passage."

The tenancy agreement was signed in Oct 2020 and there are rent arrears for the last few months.\n\nI have a guarantor agreement signed with the tenant's dad acting as the guarantor where he is liable to pay any unpaid rent.\n\nThe tenancy agreement and the guarantor agreement were both signed using a popular online esignature platform, which as far as I have researched, is a perfectly legal and acceptable way to sign a contract.\n\nThe guarantor has confirmed the email address to which the guarantor agreement was emailed is his own, personal account.\n\nHowever, the guarantor is claiming the tenant (his son) has access to his email address and signed the guarantor agreement fraudulently \\- presumably without his knowledge.\n\nIt might be useful to know the guarantor has claimed the son has also fraudulently set up other forms of credit (e.g. payday loans) this way and the guarantor has allegedly filed a report with the police. It is unclear if the tenant still has access to the guarantor's email account.\n\nIn this scenario, is the guarantor still liable to pay the unpaid rent arrears?

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a UK tenancy dispute, a landlord claims the tenant's father signed a guarantor agreement using an e-signature platform. The father alleges his son fraudulently signed the agreement using his email account. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications?\n\nA) The guarantor is automatically liable for the unpaid rent, regardless of the fraud claim.\n\nB) The landlord must prove the guarantor personally signed the agreement to enforce it.\n\nC) If the guarantor can prove fraud on the balance of probabilities, he is not liable as a guarantor.\n\nD) The guarantor is liable due to negligence in allowing his son access to his email account.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, if the purported guarantor can prove the facts stated (in this case, that his son fraudulently signed the agreement) on the balance of probabilities, then they are not considered a guarantor. The onus of proving the signature isn't theirs rests on the guarantor, but if they can successfully do so, they never agreed to be a guarantor and are not liable for the unpaid rent. Options A and D incorrectly assume liability regardless of fraud, while B incorrectly places the burden of proof on the landlord."
