And when a passenger asked them to stop, behave, the response would be among the lines \"Want me to beat ya?\", \"Do you know who my parents are you shit\", again you get the gist. They looked about 11\\.\n\nBesides that, they were kicking the bus and each other, quite strongly. Strongly enough that at one point driver stopped the bus and came upstairs, physically put them apart to separate chairs and told them to cut it off. One of the boys responded \"You cannot touch me\", to which bus driver responded, \"Then keep it up and I will call the police, they can touch you.\".\n\nThis didn't help either, they swore more and more at every passenger on the bus, making few people head to debus on the next stop after being targetted, and at least a few I am more than sure that this was not their stop. So it kept going on, for good 30 minutes now.\n\nSo I wonder what can I do in this situation as one of the passengers? The bus driver clearly didn't want to take it further, but I also don't particularly enjoy having to cope with this, and if they were adults, I would likely already call the police myself. I honestly considered doing it and reporting two lost kids on the bus, but eventually decided against it for some reasons.\n\nI imagine that their age will play a role, and while my estimate at 11 may not be perfect, if a year or two up, or down, changes things I am wondering how. \n\nUpdate: I did record their behavior and filled a crime report afterward. I am mostly interested is there anything I can do while still on the bus. I personally do not feel threatened by two 11\\-year\\-old boys, nor pay much attention to the curses, but also I saw that it was making people really uncomfortable and pushing them off the bus.

If I signed, will I have to work for 2 years with them? If I signed and later leave the institution and join another one, will this clause cause problems for me?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some jurisdictions tend to favor non\\-compete agreements, others hold most of them to be unenforceable. From a very quick search, BC is a little reluctant to enforce them, but they can be valid if sensibly drawn.\n\nHowever, the text you included in the question is not a non\\-compete agreement at all, it is a *non\\-solicitation agreement*, a much less restrictive agreement, which is significantly more likely to be upheld.\n\n1. The agreement quoted in the question does not mandate the employee continuing to work for the employer for **any** minimum time, not two years, and not six months. (Another provision might specify a required notice period, but that was not quoted and may not be in the agreement.)\n2. The agreement quoted does not prohibit the employee, after s/he leaves the job, from working for a competitor of the former employer, not even for a brief period.\n3. What the agreement quoted **does** do, is prohibit the employee from asking individuals and businesses who were customers of the former employer for orders for the **same** products as are sold by the former employer. This applies to orders on behalf of the employee personally, on behalf of a new employer, or on behalf of a business in which the employee has some sort of ownership stake (such as partner or shareholder). That is **all** that the quoted language prohibits.\n\nThis means that the employee cannot ask those who were customers of the old employer, to buy from or through him, the same products that the old employer sells. It does not mean that the former employee cannot sell such products, if the inquiry comes from the customer.\n\nThis sort of agreement is primarily aimed at preventing a salesperson from taking a client list with him or her to a new employer, and trying to get them to move their business from the salesperson's old employer to his or her new employer or business. If the employee is primarily an instructor and does not also act as a salesperson, this agreement will have almost no effect on him or her.\n\n[This site](https://fortelaw.ca/is-a-non-compete-enforceable/) discusses such agreement an myths about them in BC, Canada. It says:\n\n> Non\\-competition clauses can be enforced by courts in BC. It is true that employers face an uphill battle in getting a judge to agree to enforce a non\\-compete, but it can and does happen. If you are wondering whether your non\\-compete will stick, ask an employment lawyer. Enforceability of a non\\-compete depends on the specifics of the wording of the clause itself and the overall employment contract. Some key considerations are whether the clause is clearly worded, and whether it is limited in time, geography and scope of what is covered.\n> \n> \n> If a non\\-competition clause is enforced by a judge, it will only be applied to prevent the employee from the specific activities listed. If the employer has missed something from the clause, or there is a \u201cloop\\-hole,\u201d that is generally fair game.\n> \n> \n> Many contracts include non\\-solicitation (aka non\\-solicit) clauses, which are meant to prevent the employee from contacting clients. Non\\-solicitation clauses are still an uphill battle to enforce, but slightly easier than a non\\-competition clauses. This is because non\\-solicits don\u2019t dictate where an employee can work, just what business they can seek out. Even if there is no contract, obligations to respect confidential information, and fiduciary duties (in the case of key employees) last beyond the end of employment and can limit competition.\n\n[An online paper on \"Is my Employee\u2019s Non\\-Compete Agreement Enforceable?\"](https://www.canadaemploymenthumanrightslaw.com/2018/02/employees-non-compete-agreement-enforceable/) by Lisa Stam says:\n\n> In Canada, courts have generally been reluctant to uphold agreements that have the effect of restricting an individual\u2019s ability to earn a living or pursue the job of their choice. Indeed, courts take the initial position that restrictive covenants in employment agreements are unenforceable, unless the employer can demonstrate otherwise. A restrictive covenant must jump through several hoops to be deemed enforceable.\n\n...\n\n> A non\\-solicitation agreement will allow a former employee to work for a competitor, but prevent them from soliciting the clients (and possibly the employees) of their former employer for a specific period of time. Former employees may have close relationships with clients. Allowing them to solicit these clients may give them an unfair advantage against the former employer in the marketplace. If the employee does not solicit the client, but the client leaves to follow them anyway, there is little an employer can do.\n\n...\n\n> If a court finds a restrictive covenant clause unreasonable, for example it restricts solicitation for 12 months when 6 would have been reasonable, they will not read it down to fix it. Canadian courts require the employer to get it right the first time and a flawed clause will therefore normally be unenforceable.\n\nIn short, the above quoted agreement may not be enforceable. But if it is, it only restricts solicitation, not competition, and does not require the employee to work for the employer for a period of two years, or any other minimum time."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An IT instructor in British Columbia, Canada, signs an employment agreement containing the following clause:\n\n\"He or she agrees that they will not, either directly or indirectly, either as a partner or as an officer, director, shareholder, employee or agent or servant of any corporation or partnership, for a period of two (2) years after leaving the said employment, solicit orders from any customers, clients or agents of the employer for such products as are sold by the employer in any area of the world.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this clause?\n\nA) The instructor is prohibited from working for any competing educational institution for two years after leaving their current employer.\n\nB) The clause is definitely enforceable in British Columbia and will prevent the instructor from teaching IT subjects anywhere in the world for two years.\n\nC) The instructor is required to work for the current employer for a minimum of two years before they can leave the job.\n\nD) The clause is a non-solicitation agreement that may be enforceable, preventing the instructor from actively seeking business from their former employer's customers for two years, but does not prohibit working for competitors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The clause in question is a non-solicitation agreement, not a non-compete agreement. It does not prohibit the instructor from working for competitors or teaching IT subjects elsewhere. Instead, it aims to prevent the employee from soliciting business from the former employer's customers for a period of two years after leaving the job.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the clause does not prohibit working for competitors, only soliciting business from the former employer's customers.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while such clauses can be enforceable in British Columbia, courts are generally reluctant to uphold overly broad restrictions. Moreover, this clause does not prevent the instructor from teaching IT subjects globally.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the clause does not mandate a minimum employment period. It only applies to actions after leaving the employment.\n\nAnswer D correctly identifies the nature of the clause as a non-solicitation agreement and accurately describes its potential effects and limitations.

It is exactly as if a company employee had written it; for at least 35 years, you lose any and all rights of authorship. You may *not* use the code except under license from the assignee; in particular, you may *not* modify it and use it in your own proprietary program, unless you have permission from the company.\n\nThe default for a simple copyright assignment is that the assignee gains the right to do whatever they want with the code. If they own the copyright, nothing they do could conceivably be copyright infringement. Likewise, the original author often loses any right to do anything whatsoever with their code without explicitly gaining permission. Note, though, that the GPL is not revocable except under certain conditions; the company could at most make *future* versions proprietary. \n\nThat said, these agreements can be more complicated. The FSF copyright assignment licenses the code back to the author for use as the author sees fit; it also imposes conditions on how the FSF may use the code. Copyright assignments are generally standard contracts, and can have all sorts of terms. I'm not sure what the effect is if the FSF violates its transfer, but the specific legal document you have been asked to sign is very important.

This is similar to code written by a company employee. The developer loses all rights of authorship for at least 35 years and may not use the code except under license from the assignee (the company). They cannot modify it or use it in their own projects without explicit permission from the company.

Can I be held accountable if it is considered not to be self\\-defense? Let's just assume for argument's sake that the dog in question has not received any attack training.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law on such matters within the US varies from state to state. In general a dog owner is responsible for taking \"reasonable\" measures to control the dog and prevent harm. What measures are reasonable will depend on the detailed facts. particularly important will be the previous history and actions of the dog. If a dog has a history of attacking people, then the owner is expected to know this, and to take measures which are reasonable **in light of** that history.\n\nThe page [\"Strict Liability Dog\\-Bite Laws\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/dog-bite-statutes.html) from Nolo documents states in which an owner may be responsible for any bite. As that page says:\n\n> When a dog hurts someone, the injured person is likely to sue the animal's owner for medical costs and other damages. In more than half of the states, those lawsuits may be based on laws that make the owner automatically liable for most dog\\-bite injuries. These laws are often called \"strict liability\" statutes, because the injured person doesn't have to prove that the animal's owner knew the dog was dangerous (often called the \"one\\-bite rule\") or that the dog owner was negligent (legalese for \"careless\").\n\nThat page goes on to say:\n\n> Also, dog owners may have legal defenses to avoid liability for dog bites. Most dog\\-bite laws include exceptions\u2014typically when the injured person was trespassing or provoked the dog. And many of the laws don't apply if the dog was performing its duties as a police dog when the bite happened.\n\nThe page lists details on the laws for holding dog owners liable in the listed states under a \"strict liability\" theory. The page notes that even when one of the listed exceptions applies, so a strict\\-liability suit cannot be brought, a suit under a negligence theory (failure to take reasonable precautions) may still be possible. A plaintiff may cite both theories in a single suit where the law permits. The page lists 36 states and the District of Columbia as having some sort of strict liability statute for dog attacks as of December 2020\\.\n\nIn a number of states that the person attacked was trespassing is considered an exception to the strict\\-liability rule.\n\nThe page [\"Brief Summary of Dog Bite Laws\"](https://www.animallaw.info/article/brief-summary-dog-bite-laws) published by Michigan State University in 2004 says:\n\n> Liability can be based on a common law theory of negligence of the owner where recovery is based on the action or lack of action by an animal owner /keeper. Common law is the law derived from court decisions and historical traditions rather than explicit statutory provisions. Recovery at law under this concept requires a showing by the injured party that there was a legal duty owed to the injured party by the animal owner /keeper and that the injury arose because of a breach of that duty. This duty can arise from a failing to properly secure an animal or entrusting the animal with someone unfit to restrain the animal. It can also arise independently from violating a local ordinance, such as those ordinances that prohibit dogs running at large or mandatory muzzling provisions. It has been said that one who keeps a vicious dog, with knowledge of its savage and vicious nature, is presumed to be negligent if he or she does not keep the animal secure from injuring others.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> States may also impose a more stringent standard of fault called strict liability . In those states, liability automatically arises when a domestic animal has a known vicious propensity attacks, bites, injures, or even chases someone. There is no necessity to show that the owner was negligent in his or her actions in proving liability. ( Click here for a summary of states that impose strict liability). In addition, owners may face liability based on the legal category of the dog him or herself.\n> \n> \n> Nearly all states have some laws that govern what can be termed \u201cdangerous dog\u201d or \u201cvicious dog\u201d laws. These laws outline what constitutes a \u201cdangerous dog\u201d or even a \u201cpotentially dangerous dog\u201d and under what circumstances an owner will be liable for the actions of such dogs. Moreover, some states impose what is called \u201cstrict liability\u201d on dog owners for any injury resulting from a dog deemed dangerous regardless of any knowledge of the dog\u2019s tendencies. These strict liability laws may also limit the ability of the owner to claim a defense to the action. In other words, the law may state that the owner is liable regardless of whether the person who was bitten was trespassing on the owner\u2019s property or whether the owner knew the dog was vicious.\n> \n> \n> Regardless of whether you are dealing with a strict liability state or not, provocation will be an important factual issue. Provocation simply refers to a situation where a dog is incited, encouraged, or provoked into biting a person. In states where there is strict liability, an owner may use provocation as a defense to the dog bite. This will either reduce the owner's liability based in part (comparative or contributory negligence on the part of the victim) or bar the victim's claim completely. A court will either determine provocation from the perspective of the injured party (i.e., did the person intend to provoke the animal or have knowledge that his or her actions would provoke the animal) or from the perspective of the dog.\n\nThe page [\"State Dog Bite Laws: \"One\\-Bite\" vs. Strict Liability\"](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/one-bite-strict-liability-dog-bite.html) from AllLaw says:\n\n> Prior to the twentieth century, a dog owner was usually only held liable for injuries when their dog bit someone if the owner had reason to know the dog might bite. This was known as the \"one bite\" rule because it generally meant that a dog was allowed \"one free bite\" before the owner would face legal trouble.\n> \n> \n> In modern times, the one bite rule does not necessarily allow a dog one free bite. If an owner knows the particular breed is dangerous, or if the particular dog might be prone to biting because of its general character or some other factor, he or she could face liability for the dog's first bite.\n> \n> \n> The focus is on whether the owner knew or should have known that the dog might bite, and whether the owner took reasonable precautions based on that knowledge. For example, if a relatively aggressive dog recently underwent surgery and the owner did not warn a house guest not to pet the dog, the owner might be held liable if the house guest is subsequently bitten.\n> \n> \n> As a fault concept, the \"one bite\" rule has much in common with (and often overlaps) the personal injury liability rule of negligence.\n> \n> \n> Many states have enacted \"dog bite\" statutes that create a form of \"strict liability\" for dog bites. Strict liability means that the defendant is held liable if a certain event occurs, regardless of whether the defendant could have done anything to prevent the event.\n> \n> \n> The typical strict liability dog bite statute says that a dog owner is liable if his or her dog bites someone, regardless of whether the owner did anything wrong, as long as the injured person:\n> \n> \n> * was not trespassing or otherwise breaking the law at the time of the incident, and\n> * did not provoke the dog.\n> \n> \n> If a strict liability dog bite statute applies, what the owner did or did not know about the dog prior to the bite is usually irrelevant. Note that strict liability dog bite statutes are not the same in every state that has one of these laws on the books. ...\n\nIn short, the particular law of the state or locality, and the particular facts of the case will both be important in the case of any dog attack.\n\nBy the way, nothing an animal does on its own can be classed as self\\-defense, although where a human orders an animal to attack that might be self\\-defense by the human (using the animal), depending on the facts. Actions that would have been self\\-defense by a human will probably not be grounds for finding an animal's owner liable."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a state with strict liability dog bite laws, a homeowner's large dog fatally attacks an intruder who broke into the house at night while the owner was asleep.

However, there are typically exceptions for trespassers, which would normally protect the homeowner in a break-in scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because self-defense (even by proxy through a dog) would likely protect the owner from liability.\n\nOption B is incorrect because warning signs, while potentially helpful in some cases, do not typically absolve an owner of liability in strict liability states.\n\nOption C is incorrect because if the intruder had been invited earlier, they might not be considered a trespasser, but the scenario specifically states it was a break-in.\n\nOption D is the most likely scenario for liability because it suggests the homeowner failed to take reasonable precautions in light of known risks (recent break-ins). Even in strict liability states, courts may consider whether an owner took appropriate measures to prevent harm.

When the chat is active there is a green button, otherwise, it is grey. It is almost impossible to find the green button (although sometimes it is green) so I decided to test the real availability of this service.\n\nMy idea was to create a script that accesses the website, checks the status of the button and then logs it. My goal was not to DDoS the server or something similar so I thought a request every minute will suffice for getting some statistics.\n\nCould this be considered illegal? I know it might depend on each country's laws but if someone in the field could provide some insight or directions is really appreciated.\n\n---\n\n**Even more Details:**\n\nThe website is always up even if the chat is not available, so it is not only testing an HTTP request. What I found is that the HTML is loaded without the \"button\" (it's not a button tag, it's actually a clickable image), then a javascript script connects to the chat service and depending on the status, it loads the \"button\" to access the chat or to notify it is unavailable. This is an `<img>` tag. What I do is read the \"alt\" property description where the status can be identified. Then I put that in a cron job, log the time and the status. Finally, at the end of the day, I summarise the data into a chart showing the percentage of time the chat was really active. The purpose of this experiment is to prove that the customer service is awful with actual data.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **What you are doing is commonly referred to \"web scrapers\" and they are [legal in the EU](https://medium.com/@jurgenstojku_62417/is-web-scraping-legal-in-2020-63cbcf0d5ec).**\n\nWhat you cannot do is extract personal data.

In other words, does it give a citizen or the press a right to spread falsehoods publicly?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Sometimes**\n-------------\n\nIn general, intentionally false speech gets less protection than other speech, and in some cases it is unprotected. The classic example of speech that is unprotected is \"[Falsely shouting FIRE in a crowded theater](http://civil-liberties.yoexpert.com/civil-liberties-general/is-it-legal-to-shout-%22fire%22-in-a-crowded-theater-19421.html)\". Note that this is both intentionally false and highly likely to be seriously harmful to multiple uninvolved people.\n\nOn the other hand, the classic case of *New York Times vs Sullivan* said that, at least when the subjects were public officials (later broadened to public figures) it was not enough to prove simple falsehood in a defamation case, one must prove \"actual malice\" (an unfortunate term) which in this context means statements that are either knowingly false or are made with reckless disregard for the truth. The court in that case said, in effect, that if a newspaper had to be sure that its every statement could be proved true in every detail, it would be unwilling to vigorously report on matters of significant public concern (this is a paraphrase, I'll add a quote later).\n\nOpinions are considered legally not to be either false or true. \"President Jone is the worst leader the US has ever had\" Is a statement of opinion, and so is not defamation. \n\nMoreover, in political contexts, attempts to punish false statements of fact that are not defamatory have been held unconstitutional. One example was the \"Stolen Valor\" act, which punished falsely claiming to have been awarded a medal by the US armed forces. This was held to be against the First Amendment. \n\nIn general, regulation of speech (which here includes writing and other forms of communication) must be fairly narrowly drawn and must have good reasons behind them to survive a court challenge. How much so depends on the nature of the law, and particularly whether it is \"content\\-neutral\" or not.\n\nDetails and cites to come when i have a little more time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the protection of false speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution?\n\nA) All false speech is protected under the First Amendment, regardless of intent or consequences.\n\nB) False speech is never protected under the First Amendment and can always be legally punished.\n\nC) False speech receives less protection than other forms of speech, but may still be protected in certain contexts, particularly in political discourse.\n\nD) Only false speech that does not harm public officials or public figures is protected under the First Amendment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The First Amendment's protection of false speech is nuanced and context-dependent. While intentionally false speech generally receives less protection than other forms of speech, it is not entirely unprotected. The level of protection depends on factors such as intent, potential harm, and the subject of the speech.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all false speech is protected. For example, falsely shouting \"fire\" in a crowded theater is not protected due to its potential for harm.\n\nOption B is incorrect because some false speech is protected, especially in political contexts. The Supreme Court has struck down laws attempting to punish false statements that are not defamatory, such as the Stolen Valor Act.\n\nOption D is too narrow and misses the broader context. While the New York Times v. Sullivan case established a higher standard for defamation cases involving public officials and figures, this doesn't mean that all other false speech is unprotected.\n\nOption C correctly captures the nuanced approach to false speech under the First Amendment, acknowledging that it receives less protection but may still be protected in certain contexts, particularly in political discourse."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49773/does-the-trump-campaign-have-standing-to-sue-over-defamation-against-trump", "docs_id": 49773, "title": "Does the Trump campaign have standing to sue over defamation against Trump?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The NY Times, the Washington Post and, most recently, CNN, are being sued for defaming Trump.

The lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign against media outlets like the NY Times, Washington Post, and CNN are alleging defamation against the campaign itself, not Donald Trump as an individual. This is a crucial distinction in terms of legal standing. The campaign, as an organization, is claiming that statements made by these media outlets have defamed the campaign specifically. For example, the lawsuit against CNN relates to claims about the campaign's alleged consideration of seeking Russian assistance in the 2020 election. This approach allows the campaign to have standing to sue, as it is claiming harm to its own reputation rather than to Trump personally.

According to the Danish prosecution's statement, burning holy books like the Bible and the Quran may in some cases be considered a violation of the blasphemy provision. The law does not automatically prohibit burning all religious texts in all circumstances, nor does it single out only the Quran. Instead, it depends on the specific context and whether the act can be considered public mockery or insult against a religion. The blasphemy law in Denmark punishes those who publicly mock or insult the religious teachings or worship of legally existing religious communities, with penalties including fines or up to four months in prison.

Absolutely no communications were sent from both sides.\n\nDuring the third year I received an invoice from the \"Verein\", stating that I had to pay the sum due for the second year, plus a fine, because I didn't pay them before (how was I supposed to? They didn't send me anything \\- and the payment is based on people's income). Since I was not willing to have arguments, I paid and asked to terminate what I found out to be our contract right at that moment.\n\nThe woman I spoke to, told me that it would not have been possible before the end of the third year, and since it already started, and I needed to honor my part of the contract and pay for that year too.\n\nThere is more than one problem with this contract, I don't have any copy, and I am quite positive that if I did receive the invoice on time (2nd year), I would have understood that I was under a binding obligation, and therefore would have asked to terminate the contract as well **before** having to pay for another year.\n\nAm I under any obligation to honor that payment, provided that I never received their invoice for the second year within an acceptable timing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's hard to say what you are obliged to if you cannot check the contract.

In Germany, automatically renewing contracts do exist and are legal, but the specific terms of the contract are crucial. Without seeing the contract, it's impossible to determine the exact obligations.

The doctor can then adapt the treatment on the score.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on added comments from the OP, the situation seems to be that Dr. A published a certain algorithm; Dr. B then published a translation, without consent. The question is whether the algorithm is subject to copyright protection: if it is, that means that Dr. A has to authorize a derivative work (a translation is a derivative work). An underlying equation (viz. .25\\*A \\+ .25\\*B \\+ .5\\*(A\\\\B)) is not subject to copyright protection. A verbal description of how to compute the score, or of the meaning of variables, or of how to present questions via a program so that values of A, B.... are supplied would be subject to protection. The essential distinction is that copyright law (as opposed to patent) protects the expression, especially aspects of visual presentation and wording. The requirement is that a work which manifests expressive creativity (it need not be a high level of creativity) is protectable. That would include any unauthorized translation of Dr. A's article. If the algorithm is patented, patent (not copyright) issues would arise, but in normal usage you can't \"translate\" an algorithm from one language to another.\n\nThere is an issue of whether permission was received. If A says to B \"Yes you may\" then unless there is evidence of such permission (an email for example), B may be in trouble. Assuming evidence of permission, then we have to know if the permission was conditional, i.e. \"Yes, as long as you cite me\". Without such a condition, A can't late retract his permission."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Dr. A publishes a scientific article describing a new medical score calculation.

Copyright law protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. In this case, while the underlying mathematical algorithm or formula for the medical score cannot be copyrighted, Dr. A's specific verbal description, presentation method, and any creative elements in explaining the score calculation could be protected by copyright. The translation by Dr. B, even if it doesn't use the exact wording, could still be considered a derivative work requiring permission. Option A is incorrect because pure mathematical formulas are not copyrightable. Option B is incorrect because even a translation can infringe on copyright if it's a derivative work without permission. Option D is incorrect because while some medical innovations can be patented, a scoring system would typically fall under copyright law rather than patent law."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6178/what-happens-if-open-source-software-infringes-existing-patent", "docs_id": 6178, "title": "What happens if open source software infringes existing patent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What happens if an open source software is released globally and it violates a patent?

Creating a product that includes the software may infringe the patent, and may infringe that patent because the software is included, but the software itself doesn't. Software on its own doesn't have any effect that could be patented, only as part of some machine. \n\nOn the other hand, if you want to distribute software that is under the GPL v3\\.0 license, then a requirement is that you give everyone a patent license for all patents that would be infringed by using the software (as part of some machine), and if you are not the patent holder, then in practice that means you are not allowed to distribute the software. \n\nWith your grand plan that you write software and then let the end users do the patent infringement, that will backfire in two ways: First, you'd be likely sued for contributory patent infringment, because it is you who enables the patent infringemnt.

Last but not least, I'll discuss if GDPR even applies.\n\nDoes the GDPR require consent for X?\n------------------------------------\n\nAlmost always, no. Consent is only one of many legal bases of processing. A common alternative to consent is a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d where a balancing test is performed between this legitimate interest and your interests, rights, and freedoms. Consent is typically only appropriate if this balancing test fails, for example if you would not reasonably expect this processing activity to occur.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's a reasonably common occurrence that businesses are sold or merged. This is not unexpected. In general, you would not be required to consent to such a transfer.\n\nWhat can a company do with personal data acquired through a merger/acquisition?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR does not provide explicit provisions for this case. But it might be useful to think about the two cases where (a) the new company is a continuation or successor of the original one, and (b) where the data is transferred (\u201csold\u201d) to an otherwise unrelated company.\n\nIn case (a) where the business is continued as normal, there is no change.\n\nIn case (b) where data is transferred to a separate company, things are more complicated.\n\n* The original company would need a legal basis for transferring the data. But as mentioned above, there might be a legitimate interest. Arguably, such a transfer could also be based on Art 6(1\\)(b) if the transfer is *necessary* to continue to provide the service, for example if the original company would otherwise have to terminate service.\n\nOf course, activities like data brokering where access to data is granted to unrelated third parties would generally fail to be covered by contractual necessity or a legitimate interest, and would probably need consent \u2013 but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n* When a data controller (such as the new company) acquires your personal data from sources other than directly from you, then they are subject to the notice requirements in Art 14\\. They have to actively notify you about their processing activities. But because you received emails that mentioned the transfer, this condition might have been met.\n\nOf course the new company continues to be bound by the purpose limitation principle as detailed in Art 6(4\\) \u2013 they can only use the data for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which the data was initially collected. Thus, the new company cannot arbitrarily widen processing purposes, though some change in scope is certainly permissible.\n\nHow does the GDPR right to object and to restrict processing apply here?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Art 21 GDPR right to object means that if the legal basis for a processing activity is a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d, then you can ask for an opt\\-out. But in some cases, this objection does not have to be granted. An objection essentially requires the controller to repeat the legitimate interest balancing test, taking into account the \u201cgrounds relating to \\[your] particular situation\u201d that you provided in the objection.\n\nThe Art 18 GDPR right to restrict processing is an alternative to the right to erasure. It applies only in narrow circumstances, for example while an objection is being checked.\n\nIt is likely that you were informed about the transfer to a new company about 1 month in advance, so that you would have been able to prevent this transfer by closing your account prior to the deadline. If the new company conducts processing activities based on a legitimate interest, then their presumably GDPR\\-compliant privacy notice about which you were notified will certainly explain that you have a right to object.\n\nIs the new company GDPR\\-compliant?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThat is impossible to tell, but nothing you've shown so far indicates that they're non\\-compliant.\n\nMy largest issue with this story is that the new company is from Australia, a country with extraordinarily bad privacy protections (as of 2022\\). However, due to the way how the GDPR treats international transfers of data, this doesn't prevent Australian data controllers from being GDPR\\-compliant, although it does make it difficult for other companies to use services based in Australia.\n\nDoes GDPR even apply?\n---------------------\n\nWhether GDPR applies to a non\\-European company depends only on whether they either offer goods or services to people who are in Europe (\u201ctargeting criterion\u201d), and whether the monitor people's behavior that takes place in Europe. Factors such as your citizenship would be irrelevant.\n\nI'll ignore the monitoring criterion, and focus on the targeting criterion. I'll assume that you are in Europe (EU/EEA or UK).\n\nWhether a company is targeting people in Europe depends primarily on the company's intentions. It does not matter whether the service is accessible from Europe.\n\nThus, it is quite possible that the original company was not subject to the GDPR. Then, any questions about GDPR, consent, and data transfers are moot.\n\nIn contrast, the new company clearly mentions GDPR\\-compliance, which would only matter if they intend for people in Europe to use their services. So GDPR probably applies to them, giving you the full suite of GDPR data subject rights as (hopefully) outlined in their privacy notice. And as long as they notified you that they acquired your personal data in accordance of Art 14, I don't seen anything that they might have done wrong in respect to this acquisition/merger."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company based in the US (Company A) that provides online services is acquired by an Australian company (Company B).

GDPR applicability depends on whether a company targets users in the EU/EEA, not on the company's location.\n2. Consent is not always required for data processing under GDPR; legitimate interests can be a valid legal basis.\n3. Company acquisitions and subsequent data transfers can often be justified under legitimate interests.\n4.

This is not as high a bar as it used to be, but the courts will not grant relief for \"isolated incidents\" unless they are extremely serious. Such incidents typically involve some kind of forcible, physical, sexual contact, which I don't see here.\n\nThe general rule is that the more severe the harassment, the less frequently it needs to occur, and vice versa. Unfortunately, courts would probably look at the events you've described \\-\\- not physical, not sexually explicit, not threatening, not intimidating, not soliciting sexual conduct, not mocking you \\-\\- and say that they are not particularly severe.\n\nGiven the lack of severity, the court would need to see them happening with pretty regular frequency, but you've described only two events in the course of about 18 months. And with one of those, the employer appears to have taken reasonable corrective action, leaving you with only one incident to complain about in however long you've worked there.\n\nEven if a court agreed that your co\\-workers engaged in unwanted sexual conduct, I'd expect the employer to be able to successfully invoke the *Farragher\\-Ellerth* defense, which permits them to escape liability if they can prove:\n\n1. that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior; and\n2. that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\n\n[*Burlington Industries, Inc. v.

According to 18 USC 1039(a)(9), it is illegal to knowingly produce software that is configured to obtain telecommunications service without authorization. The statute specifically mentions \"produces\" in addition to \"uses\" or \"traffics in,\" meaning that simply creating such software, even without using it on other networks or distributing it, can be considered a criminal act.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the law doesn't require the software to be used on other networks to be considered illegal.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because distribution is not necessary for the act to be criminal; production alone is sufficient.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because 18 USC 1039(a)(9) doesn't require proof of actual damage.

However, I am not sure if this is correct.\n\nThere are generally two theories on being the best way to deal with traffic stops: 1\\. is to be nice and comply with the officer, nicely answering any questions; 2\\. is to be nice and comply only to orders they are legally obligated to follow, answering only questions they are legally obligated to answer, and speaking to the officer as minimal as possible.\n\nBut I would like to test a third theory: speaking a language the officer does not understand, and making it appear that I either barely understand the officer, or barely can speak to the officer in their language (presumably English or Spanish, most likely, in the United States).\n\nI am thinking I will start speaking in German to the officer, and hope the officer doesn't speak German.

This is your Fifth Amendment right to silence. The only exception to this is that the officer could ask for your name and you are obliged to give it under [Arizona Laws 13\\-2412](https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/arizona/az-laws/arizona_laws_13-2412), but the answer to that is language\\-independent and is usually already answered with your driver's license in a traffic stop. \n\nIf you did choose to communicate only in German, this may have the effect of frustrating the officer's investigation but if you only make truthful statements in German it is unlikely to be obstruction of their investigation. [Arizona Laws 13\\-2409](https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/arizona/az-laws/arizona_laws_13-2409) is I believe the relevant section (emphasis mine):\n\n> A person who knowingly attempts by means of bribery, **misrepresentation**, intimidation or force or threats of force to **obstruct, delay or prevent the communication of information or testimony relating to a violation of any criminal statute to a peace officer**, magistrate, prosecutor or grand jury or who knowingly injures another in his person or property on account of the giving by the latter or by any other person of any such information or testimony to a peace officer, magistrate, prosecutor or grand jury is guilty of a class 5 felony, except that it is a class 3 felony if the person commits the offense with the intent to promote, further or assist a criminal street gang.\n\nIn general, a law that required you to give answers to a police officer during an investigation in English if you understand English and have waived your right to silence would violate your First Amendment right to free speech (as it is in effect \"forced speech\"). However, you would need to be careful not to tell the police officer that you do not understand English if that is not true, as it could be misrepresentation.\n\nPolice officer training likely includes instructions for detaining someone that cannot understand them and the police can detain you and wait for an interpreter to continue their investigation if they determine that is necessary. You may actually be shooting yourself in the foot by doing this, because the time it takes for them to get an interpreter likely extends the amount of time the detainment can last while remaining \"reasonable,\" so you may be waiting by the side of the road longer than you would have if you had simply told the officer that you were invoking your right to silence and followed the officer's instructions without speaking.\n\nAs an aside, as more people are educated on their rights via the Internet and understand why they should always invoke their right to silence when detained, police officers will get more used to people they pull over immediately and politely telling them that they are going to invoke their right to silence. I doubt most police officers will hold it against you as long as you are otherwise cooperative and don't yell at them or berate them."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: During a traffic stop in Arizona, a driver decides to speak only German to the police officer, despite being fluent in English.

Is this legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Education level is not an FHA protected category. However, whenever you give one broad group preferential treatment over another, you'll raise eyebrows. Someone might argue, for example, that while your incentive does not explicitly mention a protected category like race or sex, it might disproportionately impact one group in a protected category over another.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court in 2015 addressed this question in *Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project*. They found (albeit by a 5\\-4 vote) that disparate impact could, under certain circumstances, be the basis for a discrimination claim under FHA. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact#The_Fair_Housing_Act) on this subject is informative.\n\nAs for your case, it really depends on what you are trying to accomplish with the policy, and what you reasonably predict it will do. For example, given that in most areas, white people more often have graduate degrees than black people, then if this policy did in fact end up advantaging white tenant over black tenants, someone might claim that you are in effect discriminating on the basis of race. I would not want to be on the defending end of that claim.\n\nIn general, if you want to be safe from FHA's wrath, you need to evaluate each applicant on their individual merits as a tenant, not their membership in some group. Whenever you treat one person differently from another person, you should have a reason that clearly derives from your business interests as a landlord, and you should write it down.\n\nLegal questions aside, it seems like a really bad idea to offer incentives like this. I can't imagine it achieving any legitimate business goal, and I can easily imagine it making tenants or applicants feel cheated and devalued. And when people feel cheated and devalued, even if they haven't legally been wronged, they often seek legal redress.

The 2015 Supreme Court case Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project established that disparate impact claims can be valid under the FHA. Since advanced degree holders may disproportionately belong to certain racial or ethnic groups, this practice could indirectly discriminate against protected categories.

It is not a crime, but it could be a civil wrong, and if the recording resulted in damage to the tutor, the person making the recording could be sued. If A records B threatening violence against A and complains to B's supervisor, B might get fired and B could try suing. Under those circumstances the firing would be justified, so with unclean hands, B is unlikely to prevail in court. Alternatively, suppose B was doing nothing wrong; then B didn't get fired, and A didn't cause damage to B, so nothing to sue over. The question of whether there is a civil cause of action depends heavily on the facts of the case, so that it is possible but unlikely that B could sue A for making a secret recording. (I do not offer an opinion as to whether [GDPR](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/pdfs/ukpga_20180012_en.pdf) could provide a path for a suit against the recorder, there being insufficient case law regarding how the courts interpret the new language. It is also unclear whether secret recordings could be entered as evidence in a court proceeding, if such a recording was made \"in the public interest\").\n\nWith or without a recording, the first step would be filing an official complaint with the employer, outlining what wrongs the employee committed. It appears that you've done something like this and didn't get the result that you wanted. Perhaps you didn't present the case appropriately, for example you may have casually said to a supervisor \"Smith is bullying Jones\", when what Jones needs to do is file an official grievance. It is a virtual certainty that an employer would not terminate an employee simply because someone reported \"Smith is bullying Jones\": the aggrieved party would have to make an official accusation. In that context, making a surreptitious recording would only be useful for establishing that Smith threatened violence against Jones, if that is what happened, and Smith denies the threat. \n\nIf the employer does not take action, one would have to sue the school and the employee for some reason. The reason would have to be more specific than \"going after\" a person, or \"bullying\" (which now has a very broad range of applications). You would need to say exactly what wrong the tutor committed, and why you think it is an actionable wrong (your attorney would in fact be the one to identify the specific legal wrong).\n\nSince the legality of secret recordings in this situation is unclear, it is risky to make a secret recording, and you should get informed and paid legal advice from your attorney."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, a student is being bullied and threatened by a tutor at their college.

While forming a limited liability company (LLC) can provide significant protection for personal assets, it does not offer absolute protection in all circumstances. The developer can generally avoid personal liability for the company's debts and obligations by forming an LLC. However, there are exceptions to this protection, particularly in cases where the owner intentionally extracts too much money from the company, leaving it unable to pay its debts, or if the owner engages in criminal activities. In the context of this video-sharing business, if the developer knowingly allows or facilitates copyright infringement, it could potentially be considered criminal behavior, which would pierce the corporate veil and expose the developer to personal liability.

If the amount of my deposit exceeds actual damages sustained by you, you will promptly refund the difference to me.\n\nThe car was ready on day 3\\. As a result, the Customer was obligated to pay and take delivery of the vehicle until day 5\\.\n\nBecause the customer did not follow through with the purchase, the deposit is used to compensate the salesman in the amount that covers the costs of preparing the sale and having the car on the lot for those days that the salesman could not sell it to someone else.\n\nAt the end of day 5, the contractual obligation to hold the car for the customers in exchange for the deposit ended, and the other clauses of the contract (car for rest of payment) become void. The car salesman is in his right to sell the car because the actual sales contract has fallen through and the holding fee/deposit expired, as the very quoted paragraph shows.\n\nBased on the final sentence of the quoted portion of the contract, to get a part of the deposit back, one would need to establish that the losses are less than the contractually fixed amount of 300 USD. When I had my car at the workshop and could not get it back on the day it was done with repairs, I was also informed that holding my car for more than a day would incur storage fees of up to 15\u00a0\u20ac per day. Similarly, the last time I bought a car, I was told that the sale included a fresh inspection and oil. Those are costs to the seller and can be accounted for in the deposit. The inspection costs about \\~120\u00a0\u20ac for a new T\u00dcV certificate and exhaust check and the materials for an oil change come for about 70\u00a0\u20ac. This leaves about 70\u00a0\u20ac cover for the mechanic and salesman's wages for about one hour. That's 300\u00a0\u20ac, or about 330\u00a0USD today.

But it isn't entirely independent, since the firearm might be needed as evidence or might need to be kept out of the possession of the person from whom it was seized to effect the red flag order while it was in place in a way that that the third\\-party owners would have to assure.\n\n> An example might be where a gun is confiscated via red\\-flag law, where\n> no crime has been committed, but the suspect won't get his day in\n> court for 6 months. Would the true owner, or partner owners if in a\n> Trust, be denied their property or could they go ahead and recover it\n> pre\\-trial (ie. the day after it was confiscated)?\n\nIn the case of a red\\-flag seizure, the existence of the gun wouldn't be evidence in the court proceeding, so it wouldn't have to be retained for that purpose prior to trial.\n\nBut, the owner of the gun would probably have to petition the court to regain possession and would have to demonstrate that the red\\-flag order would continue to deny the person who had the gun possession of it until the red\\-flag order period expired (if ever).\n\nIf the trustee was the red\\-flag order target, or was someone related to him (or her), that might be a showing that the trustee could not make.\n\n**Caveat**\n\nOf course, red\\-flag laws are specific pieces of state legislation. Each one is different. Many would provide a specific statutory procedure for how this issue would be handled.\n\nFor example, in some places, the proper means to regain possession of property held by law enforcement in connection with a criminal case is a motion filed by a third\\-party intervenor in the criminal case, while in others, the property process is to bring a civil action for replevin (a lawsuit to regain physical possession of particular items) against the law enforcement officer in possession or constructive possession of the property in question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A red-flag order has been issued against John, and the police have confiscated a firearm from his possession. The gun is actually owned by a trust, of which John's father is a trustee. What is the most likely scenario for the trust to recover the firearm before John's court hearing in 6 months?\n\nA) The trust can immediately reclaim the firearm without any legal proceedings, as it is not owned by John.\n\nB) The trust must wait until after John's court hearing to petition for the return of the firearm.\n\nC) The trust can petition the court to regain possession, but must demonstrate that the red-flag order will continue to be enforced against John.\n\nD) The trust has no legal recourse to recover the firearm until the red-flag order expires.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, third-party owners of property seized in a red-flag case can petition the court to regain possession. However, they would need to demonstrate that the red-flag order would continue to deny the person (in this case, John) possession of the firearm until the order expires. This aligns with the statement: \"But, the owner of the gun would probably have to petition the court to regain possession and would have to demonstrate that the red-flag order would continue to deny the person who had the gun possession of it until the red-flag order period expired (if ever).\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate reclamation without legal proceedings is not possible in this scenario. Option B is incorrect because the trust doesn't necessarily have to wait until after John's court hearing; they can petition earlier. Option D is incorrect because the trust does have legal recourse to recover the firearm before the red-flag order expires, provided they follow the proper legal procedures."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41224/can-i-sue-my-appraiser-from-when-i-bought-my-home-in-georgia-a-few-years-ago-due", "docs_id": 41224, "title": "Can I sue my appraiser from when I bought my home in Georgia a few years ago due to an egregious error on the square footage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Both seller and buyer agreed to a purchase price with all the details agreed upon. \nThe financing was not an issue either. The only issue that created a problem was the difference in the square footage. My home appraisal from 2015 listed the property for 300 square feet more than the current appraisal. This has resulted in my appraisal coming in $15K less than needed. I actually agree with the new square footage \\#, and want to see if the previous appraiser can be held liable for misrepresenting the square footage to me. Can I sue the appraiser for the egregious error?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To be able to sue the appraiser, he would have to have a duty to you. If he was hired by a bank, his duty is to the bank and not to you. Assuming that you directly hired the appraiser, then you would have to check the contract for limits on his liability \u2013 a clause that says \"you waive your right to sue me for (certain) mistakes\". Now supposing that you haven't waived your right to sue, you almost certainly cannot sue for misrepresentation, unless for some reason you can prove that he knew that he was lying to you.\n\nYour best bet is arguing that his mistake was negligent. You would have to establish that the first figure was incorrect (a disagreement in figures does not establish which figure is correct). A discrepancy between county records and an appraiser's estimate can be explained by numerous non\\-negligence related facts (unpermitted modifications of the structure, for example). Suppose that the source of the discrepancy is inclusion of finished basement space in the earlier appraisal, or perhaps measurement error. Then you would have to prove that that error involved a lack of professional care, which implies certain professional standards (not just your feeling that the error is egregious). [This article](https://www.redfin.com/blog/how-to-calculate-the-square-footage-of-your-home) explains the ANSI guidelines. The standard tends to increase square footage because it is measured from the outside.\n\nThen you would have to establish that you were damaged by the earlier figure. The law doesn't allow you to sue because someone does something that bugs you, you have to have suffered damage. You don't say how you were harmed \u2013 I presume the problem is that the buyer's bank is not willing to lend that much money, where you relied on an earlier incorrect estimate of square footage in advertising the house and setting the price. You may have contributed to the problem by relying on that estimate when you knew or should have known from the government records that the size is something less. There is some possibility of legal recourse, but it's not obvious (so gather all of your facts and talk to your attorney)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner is trying to sell their house and encounters a problem when a new appraisal shows the square footage is 300 sq ft less than a previous appraisal from 5 years ago.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's ability to sue the appraiser?\n\nA) The homeowner can easily sue the appraiser for misrepresentation, regardless of who hired the appraiser.\n\nB) The homeowner can only sue if they directly hired the appraiser and there are no liability limitations in the contract.\n\nC) The homeowner can sue the appraiser for negligence without needing to prove that the first figure was incorrect.\n\nD) The homeowner cannot sue the appraiser under any circumstances, as appraisers are protected from all liability.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The homeowner can only sue the appraiser if they directly hired them and there are no liability limitations in the contract. This is because the appraiser's duty is typically to the party that hired them. If the appraiser was hired by a bank, their duty would be to the bank, not the homeowner. Additionally, even if the homeowner hired the appraiser directly, they would need to check the contract for any clauses limiting the appraiser's liability. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the ability to sue is not easy or guaranteed, and it does matter who hired the appraiser. \n\nOption C is incorrect because to sue for negligence, the homeowner would need to establish that the first figure was indeed incorrect and that the error involved a lack of professional care.\n\nOption D is incorrect because appraisers are not universally protected from all liability, though there are often limitations and specific circumstances under which they can be held liable."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48500/what-legal-recourse-do-we-have-against-clearview-ais-collection-of-our-personal", "docs_id": 48500, "title": "What legal recourse do we have against Clearview AI&#39;s collection of our personal data and terrifying privacy policy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **TL;DR:** how do we get the data this company collected on us without also giving them our government\\-issued IDs that they could potentially keep and tie to our \"profiles\"?\n\n---\n\nA week ago (January 25th), the [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html) that [Clearview AI](https://clearview.ai/), a neural\\-network\\-based facial recognition software, has collected and stored over 3 billion names, photos and addresses.

Not asking when the insurance company will ask the driver for their money back, but when they are not going to pay? \n\nI couldn't find anything through Google. AFAIK for example the German rules are that the insurance doesn't pay if the car was not insured, if the damage was caused intentionally, and as far as the damage exceeds the insurance coverage, but has to pay in all other cases. \n\nBecause this was asked in a comment: The German insurance doesn't pay to third parties if the car isn't insured anymore, which happens after several payments are missed; they will also inform the police that there is an uninsured car. The policy doesn't matter, whether they have to pay to third parties is governed by law. They have to pay in case of negligence, gross negligence, but not for intentional damage. Since \"third party liability insurance\" is a legal requirement in many countries, intended to protect innocent third parties, you wouldn't expect the insurance policy to matter. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The British system of motor insurance is not the same as the German system, at least as you describe it. The law that applies is [Section 143 of the Road Traffic Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/143), which specifies that \"a person must not use a motor vehicle...unless there is in force...a policy of insurance that complies with the requirements of this Part of this Act\" (unless you provide your own third party insurance by depositing a large sum with the Court Funds Office: I do not believe this has ever been done).\n\nSo what the insurance company will cover depends on the policy provisions, providing that the policy is inclusive enough to meet the standards set out in the Act. As a matter of general agreement any large company will usually cover most expenses and seek to recover from the driver any payout they were arguably not required to make (such as where you provided false information); that is another (huge) question entirely, in which you say you are not interested here.\n\nAs an example, my car insurance will cover all damage caused to third parties where I or somebody named in the policy was driving unless (i) there is other insurance covering the same liability (ii) the victim was working with or for me (iii) acts of terrorism or (iv) liability caused by cutting, welding or use of blowtorches. (Note that all these exceptions do have legal definitions, either in the small print or in legislation. It may also be important that this is a comprehensive policy from which I have quoted only the relevant provisions; 'third\\-party only' policies are available but are, as a deliberate choice by the insurance companies, more expensive than comprehensive.)

But a few months ago, I coincidentally received two unrelated emails from fellow former (but \\>\\>much\\<\\< more recent:) students, both thanking me for putting my detailed notes online. That prompted me to google the teacher, and surprisingly finding him still at CCNY.\n\nSo I emailed him, forwarding both emails I'd received, and pointing him to my online notes in case they were actually still of any use. That started a five\\-or\\-six email exchange, during which I mentioned my copyright statement, explaining why I'd claimed it, and offering to transfer it to him, since I considered it his material, with me just the \"scribe\". But he never mentioned it, one way or the other, so I just left the copyright statement as\\-is.\n\nBut my curious question \\-\\- suppose there were a dispute. Who prevails, and why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The copyright owner is whoever first put the material in fixed form. It is most likely that that is the note\\-taker (you).\n\nIt is possible (and highly unlikely) that the lecturer read (had memorized) a prepared script and you copied that script mechanically, and if that were the case, he would hold copyright and you infringed by making a copy. Typically, a note\\-taker follows the logic of a lecture and expresses those ideas in his own words (the notes do not match a plausible verbatim class lecture). Since expression is protected and ideas are not, that makes it most likely that you would prevail in a suit. The equations are almost certainly not protected."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a student takes detailed notes during a lecture and later publishes them online with their own copyright claim, who is most likely to hold the copyright for the notes?\n\nA) The lecturer, as they are the original source of the information\nB) The student who took the notes, as they put the material in fixed form\nC) The educational institution where the lecture took place\nD) Both the lecturer and the student jointly hold the copyright\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to copyright law, the copyright owner is typically the person who first puts the material in fixed form. In this case, it would most likely be the student who took the notes. While the lecturer provides the ideas and content, the student expresses these ideas in their own words and writing style. Copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Unless the lecturer was reading from a prepared script that the student copied verbatim (which is highly unlikely in a typical lecture scenario), the student's unique expression in the notes would be protected by copyright. The equations and raw facts presented in the lecture are generally not protected by copyright. Therefore, the student who took the notes and put them in fixed form would most likely hold the copyright, even if the content is based on the lecturer's presentation."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36024/do-you-have-to-follow-all-the-orders-a-police-officer-gives", "docs_id": 36024, "title": "Do you have to follow all the orders a police officer gives?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Saw a video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/7ec--GpRiKE) where a woman is being filmed in Walmart. \n\nFrom what I understood, she was being accused of shoplifting (I guess rolled the cart beyond the registers without paying?), and then supposedly left her baby in the cart while running outside (although I am not sure if she was trying to run away, or just stepped out through the door, and then she came back in). \n\nLong story short, I see in the video, a Sheriff officer whole is way way taller then her, all geared up, giving her commands to \"stop talking\" \\- he repeated that several times, and then just arrested her. \n\nQuestion is, can you be arrested for now \"shutting up\", or other weird (to my opinion) commands? I am asking because the USA is supposed to be a \"free\" country, and not a police country. \n\nUnder what circumstances do you have to follow 100% of an officer's commands? For example, a person gets pulled over while driving. Can the officer command you to open the window fully (lets say you opened just a little crack to give away license and insurance)? How about to step out of the vehicle (can you refuse to do so until their sergeant shows up \\- just so you won't get shot and/or accused of some trumped\\-up stuff?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In most US States (probably all of them) failure to follow the **Lawful** orders of a police officer is itself a crime, and is grounds for the officer to arrest the person, even if the person had not done anything wrong prior to that. \n\nThis obviously leads to the question: what orders are lawful? The officer has a pretty broad range of discretion. Ordering a person out of a car, or to roll down a car window, is pretty clearly lawful. Ordering a person to commit a crime would not be lawful. Neither would ordering a person to submit while the officer rapes or robs the individual be lawful. \n\nIn practice, the officer will usually think that all of his or her commands are lawful, and might feel threatened by any failure to comply. In which case, the officer might shoot. This might not be upheld later if the command was not lawful and/or the officer's fear was not reasonable, but that will do the person shot little good. It is usually wise to comply with any commend, unless it puts you very directly at serious risk. \n\nRemember you don't know what else has happed to the officer that day. Has the officer had a fight with his/her spouse that morning? Just been denied a promotion? Been turned down for a mortgage? None of that should matter, legally, but it will affect the officer's attitude, and can lead to escalation, even if the person stopped is in no way at fault.\n\nAn instruction to \"shut up\" is probably not going to provoke an officer to shoot if it is disobeyed, but it might help to escalate the situation. It is probably lawful, depending non the exact circumstances. As to the first amendment issues, that would probably come under the 'time, place, or manner\" regulations that may be applied to speech. And even if it is not held to be lawful, the time to contest it is in court, not during the stop. \n\nIf the officer feels safer with the window fully rolled down so that the officer could reach in, that is probably a lawful command."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Officer Smith pulls over a driver for speeding.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The driver has the right to keep their window partially closed, as opening it fully violates their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches.\n\nB) Officer Smith's order is unlawful, as it does not directly relate to the speeding offense for which the driver was pulled over.\n\nC) The driver can be arrested for failing to comply with Officer Smith's order to fully roll down the window.\n\nD) The driver must comply only if Officer Smith explicitly states that keeping the window partially closed poses a safety risk.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, failure to follow a lawful order from a police officer can be grounds for arrest in most US states. An order to fully roll down a car window is generally considered a lawful command, as it falls within the officer's discretion for safety and control of the situation. While the driver may have privacy concerns, the time to contest the lawfulness of the order is in court, not during the traffic stop. Refusing to comply with this order could lead to arrest, even if the driver had not committed any other offense beyond the initial speeding violation."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58157/is-it-legal-to-record-your-parents-at-home", "docs_id": 58157, "title": "Is it legal to record your parents at home?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legal for a minor to make an audio recording of his parents engaging in abuse?\n\nIf so, is it also legal once that child is an adult for him to publicize those recordings?\n\nInterested in U.S. law, but if state is necessary use Maryland.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Per your comment responses, Maryland is a two party consent state which means that the other party must consent to your recording IF there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. In one's own home is generally considered a place where one has this expectation and thus these recordings are problematic. Depending what you intend to do with them, I would first contact a lawyer to get legal advice as to how to handle this before you publish them. If you are looking to file a criminal complaint (and assuming statute of limitations hasn't run out) the prosecutor may be willing to not prosecute you for violating 2 party consent law because you were trying to gather evidence of someone else's crime, but it's not a guarantee (though this will look bad on the prosecutor come election season).\n\nIf you are suing your parents it might not be admissible as evidence but I can't specifically say that either.\n\nIf you are using it to show other people in the same situation what to look for it's probably best to find another set of recordings as these ones carry a lot of legal issues that will come back to bite you if you release them.\n\nFinally, while not legal, your parents may not want to pursue the criminal recording side of this matter if they are aware of the [\"Barbra Streisand effect,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)\" wherein actions taken to ensure something isn't viewed by the public cause that something to gain wider viewership than if they never bothered trying to censor it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Maryland, a minor makes an audio recording of their parents engaging in abusive behavior within the family home.

Maryland is a two-party consent state, meaning all parties must consent to being recorded when there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, which typically applies in one's home. This makes the recordings legally problematic. However, if the individual wants to file a criminal complaint (assuming the statute of limitations hasn't expired), a prosecutor might be willing to overlook the consent law violation since the recordings were made to gather evidence of a crime. It's not guaranteed, but it's a possibility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the recordings likely violate Maryland's two-party consent law, so they can't be freely publicized without potential legal consequences.\n\nOption B is too absolute. While the recordings do violate the two-party consent law, they might still have some limited uses, particularly in the context of reporting a crime.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the admissibility of such recordings in a civil lawsuit is not automatic and would likely face significant legal challenges due to how they were obtained."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82689/obnoxiously-loud-music-from-a-festival", "docs_id": 82689, "title": "Obnoxiously loud music from a festival", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a local annual festival that plays their music *really* loudly.

Unincorporated areas are only subject to county\\-wide restrictions, which tend to also be quite minimal (owing to the fact that farms are typically \"out in the county\", and county governments tend not to ticket farmers when their cows are noisy).\n\nThe first step would be to determine whether the event was in (prima facie) violation of the local noise ordinance, if any.

Indeed, usually it will be more specific than city and state or province and will also identify a hospital or residence or other place where the birth happened.\n\nSo, for example, if a child is born to U.S. diplomats in Paris, France (in or out of the embassy grounds), the birth certificate will say that the child was born in Paris, France at Charles de Gaulle Hospital.\n\nBut, that child will still be a U.S. citizen in all likelihood, because that child's mother, and/or married father or unmarried father who acknowledges paternity, is a U.S. citizen (in all likelihood) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401 and 1409\\.

Embassies are not considered the soil of the country they represent for birthright purposes. However, the child will likely be a U.S. citizen not because of where they were born, but because their parents are U.S. citizens (assuming they meet the requirements for transmitting citizenship).
