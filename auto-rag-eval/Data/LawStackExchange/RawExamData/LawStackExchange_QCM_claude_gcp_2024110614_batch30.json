We can make some observations.\n\nFirst, the Unlicense is applied to software that's basically free for anyone to do anything with. It's basically making the software available, not warranting it for any particular purpose. If you sell software, it's presumably for a purpose, so there will likely be some sort of legal warranty or liability that can't be disclaimed in the license. This depends on where you are, which you don't tell us.\n\nSecond, if you're planning to make money, consulting a lawyer is a worthwhile investment.

They want to limit their liability without allowing distribution or granting other open-source permissions. Which of the following approaches best addresses their needs while considering legal and business implications?\n\nA) Use the Unlicense with only the liability disclaimer section\nB) Create a custom license based on open-source templates\nC) Sell the software without any license or disclaimers\nD) Consult with a lawyer to draft a tailored license agreement\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. The developer is creating a project with profit potential, which introduces complexities beyond simple liability protection. As mentioned in the documentation, \"If you sell software, it's presumably for a purpose, so there will likely be some sort of legal warranty or liability that can't be disclaimed in the license.\"\n\n2. The Unlicense (option A) is designed for software that's \"basically free for anyone to do anything with,\" which contradicts the developer's desire to restrict distribution and maintain copyright.\n\n3. Creating a custom license based on open-source templates (option B) or selling without any license (option C) carries significant legal risks, especially for a commercial project. The documentation emphasizes that \"consulting a lawyer is a worthwhile investment\" and \"Paying to get a license that does what you want is likely to be far less expensive than using a license that leaves you open to problems.\"\n\n4. The developer's location in Poland (EU) adds another layer of complexity due to potential regional legal requirements that may affect software licensing and liability.\n\n5. The question states that the developer wants to \"protect myself\" and avoid spending time \"figuring out how to put together legally binding license,\" which a lawyer can efficiently address.\n\nBy consulting with a lawyer, the developer can create a license that properly limits liability, maintains copyright, restricts distribution, and complies with local laws, while also considering the business aspects of a potentially profitable project. This approach aligns with the documentation's advice to treat it as a \"business expense\" for projects intended to make money."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4676/how-does-one-ask-the-court-to-recuse-an-attorney-due-to-a-perceived-conflict-of", "docs_id": 4676, "title": "How does one ask the court to recuse an attorney due to a perceived conflict of interest?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a legal principle or process that can be used to ask a court in the US \\- either at the time of filing or during a legal proceeding \\- to consider recusing an attorney from the opposing side due to a perceived conflict of interest?\n\nWhat is the name(s) of the process or principle?

This approach aligns with the information provided in the documentation, which states that \"recusal\" is typically reserved for judges, while \"disqualification\" is the correct term for removing an attorney from a case due to a conflict of interest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because recusal applies to judges, not attorneys. Option C, reporting to the bar association, may be premature and doesn't directly address the immediate issue in the ongoing lawsuit. Option D, negotiating directly, could be seen as inappropriate ex parte communication and doesn't involve the court's oversight.\n\nFiling a motion to disqualify opposing counsel allows the court to formally consider the potential conflict of interest, gives both parties an opportunity to present their arguments, and ensures that the matter is handled within the proper legal framework of the ongoing proceedings.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The story is unlikely to meet the criteria for defamation/libel. As per the documentation, one element of libel is that \"The statement was false while a reasonable person would believe it to be true.\" In this case, the depiction of a modern-day slave trade in Washington D.C. next to a courthouse is so unrealistic that no reasonable person would believe it to be true, similar to the beauty queen case mentioned.\n\n2.

Which of the following legal actions would be most effective in recovering the funds, considering the international nature of the transaction and the unresponsiveness of the agency?\n\nA) File a complaint with the Irish Residential Tenancies Board\nB) Initiate a chargeback process through the credit card company\nC) Sue the agency in a Spanish court for breach of contract\nD) Report the agency to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective action in this scenario is to initiate a chargeback process through the credit card company (option B). This approach is particularly suitable for several reasons:\n\n1. International transaction: Given that the student is from Spain and the agency is in Ireland, cross-border legal action could be complex and time-consuming. A chargeback process transcends these geographical boundaries.\n\n2. Speed and efficiency: Chargebacks can often be processed more quickly than legal proceedings, which is crucial given the student's limited time in Ireland.\n\n3. Burden of proof: In a chargeback, the burden falls on the seller (the agency) to prove they are entitled to the money, which is advantageous given their unresponsiveness.\n\n4. Consumer protection: Credit card companies often have robust consumer protection policies, especially for cases of services not rendered as promised.\n\n5. No additional cost: Unlike legal proceedings, initiating a chargeback typically doesn't incur additional fees for the consumer.\n\nOption A (Irish Residential Tenancies Board) is less suitable because student accommodations often fall outside standard tenancy laws.

That means you will have to comply with the GDPR regarding how you process and store this data. This involves disclosing recipients of this data per Art 13(1\\)(e), and only engaging data processors in line with Art 28\\.\n\nYour storage provider such as Azure and AWS cannot decrypt this data, so it would not be personal data if processed by them for their own purposes. There is an argument that they did not receive personal data, especially considering the definition of a recipient in Art 4: a person/entity \u201cto which the personal data are disclosed\u201d.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily relevant when talking about sub\\-processors. A processor is anyone who \u201cprocesses personal data on behalf of the controller\u201d. As processors, they're not using the data for their own purposes but are just acting on your behalf. Storage is a kind processing, and they are storing data on your behalf. This data is personal data for you. Thus, I'd consider the storage providers to be your processors.\n\nDue to your use of strong client\\-side encryption, your remaining compliance obligations are mostly boilerplate (signing a data processing agreement per Art 28, sorting out international transfers if necessary, and getting agreement for adding a sub\\-processor from your controllers). Note that encryption is mandatory whenever appropriate (Art 32(1\\)(a)).\n\nSuch client\\-side encryption could even serve as a legal basis for storing the data in jurisdictions that don't offer an adequate level of data protection, such as a data center in the US.

Is it possible that the rolls could be considered public domain as they are arrangements of public domain works published postmortem?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First: the real answer to your questions is \"consult your academic library staff.\" If this is for a thesis project, then you're presumably affiliated with a college or university, and the librarians at such institutions are used to helping sort out copyright claims and helping researchers obtain the necessary clearances.\n\n---\n\nThere are two questions you're asking, really.\n\n### Are these works in the public domain?\n\nPossibly, but not for the reasons you think. In the US, [copyright in unpublished works](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) lasts for the life of the creator \\+ 70 years. After that, they pass into the public domain. This means that if the composer/arranger died before 1919, then the works passed into the public domain before the formal publication in 1989, and they are still in the public domain now. However, if the creator died after 1919, then their 1989 publication effectively \"resets the clock\" on the copyright, and they will not come into the public domain until (according to the above link) 70 years after the death of the creator or 2048, whichever comes later.\n\nWhat doesn't matter is that the original symphonic works were in the public domain. Even if the *1812 Overture* is in the public domain, I could write an arrangement of it for accordion quintet and I would have the exclusive right to publish it and profit from that arrangement for the standard term. In your case, if the work really is a straight transcription, it *might* not have a copyright; but if the work required some amount of creativity and artistic decision\\-making (which a piano transcription of a symphony certainly would) then the arrangement gets its own copyright when it's published.\n\n### Can I make transcriptions of them if I don't publish them?\n\nProbably, but you should really consult your librarians. It's entirely possible that your proposed copying would fall under \"fair use\"; it would be for scholarship \\& research and you're not planning to include the transcriptions in your final published work. On the other hand, you're talking about effectively copying a substantial portion of a creative work that is still in print, which argues against fair use.

The correct answer is C because the documentation states that \"if the composer/arranger died before 1919, then the works passed into the public domain before the formal publication in 1989, and they are still in the public domain now.\" This is the only scenario that would definitively allow the musicologist to transcribe and publish the arrangements without copyright concerns.\n\nOption A is incorrect because obtaining permission from the 1989 publisher doesn't guarantee copyright clearance if the arranger died after 1919, as the copyright would still be in effect.\n\nOption B, while a safer approach mentioned in the documentation, doesn't fully answer the question about being able to publish the transcriptions themselves.\n\nOption D is a distractor based on the fair use discussion in the documentation.

However, I plan on continuing to develop them on my own time as I work at a company. They are software related.\n\nFirst, the first two highlighted parts seem to contradict each other. The first says whether or not during working hours, the second says it's fine if it's on my own time. Wondering if this is a problem for the contract. Also wondering how valid those statements actually are.\n\nSecond, they like most other companies want me to list my prior inventions. But I've asked this before to a lawyer and they said I can't simply list a title of a project such as \"Photoshop\\-like image editor\", I have to actually go into detail and describe it. And not just a few sentences, but paragraphs of detail. Not so much detail as to be like a patent in its thoroughness, but more detail than a few paragraphs PER INVENTION. But this is a security leak as I don't want to disclose my inventions even if they are simple, it's a matter of privacy. So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation.\n\nAnd last thing is, let's say this company, a software company, is in the field of Sales and Marketing. This means they have a robust application or suite of applications, practices, and tools like CRMs, machine learning stuff, APIs, etc. They also use lots of open source programming tools. Meanwhile, let's say my inventions are in the field of Programming Tools and Application tools. It's not *directly* related to Sales and Marketing, but it's related pretty closely to CRMs and machine learning tools, and APIs. It's not related to their specific APIs, but it's related to APIs let's say. The question is how the line is drawn on what is considered competitive inventions. If I were to invent a new machine learning algorithm while working as a marketer or sales person at a software company, if that is considered competitive and prohibited by the contract.\n\nOh, and \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is very vague. The company could be interested in literally anything these days.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> the first two highlighted parts seem to contradict each other.\n\nNo, in this case they do not. The first highlighted portion refers to works or items produced \"*for or under the direction of the Company*\", whereas the second highlight refers to your creations that satisfy conditions (a) and (b).\n\nWhere contradictions actually exist, the doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) entitles you (the non\\-draftsman of the contract) to adopt the portion or reasonable interpretation that favors your legal position.\n\n> Also wondering how valid those statements actually are\n\nThey are valid and become enforceable as soon as you sign the contract or your subsequent conduct reflects your acceptance thereof.\n\n> it's a matter of privacy. So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation\n\nThe reality is that you are asked to sign a contract that is abusive and ridiculous. \n\nOne vulnerability from describing your inventions (presumably in Appendix A) is that the employer gets \"irrevocable, worldwide, etc\" rights on them as soon as you \"*use or disclose any \\[items listed in Appendix A] when acting within the scope of \\[your] employment*\". This means that if instead of reinventing the wheel you share or apply any portion of your prior creations so as to enhance your productivity, you *knowingly* and *irreversibly* grant to the employer perpetual rights to those items.\n\nLegal disputes regarding APIs can become extremely intricate. And, since judges usually have no decent background on IT, even those few judges with integrity are unlikely to grasp the key subtleties that would lead to a correct ruling.\n\n> \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is very vague. The company could be interested in literally anything these days.\n\nClauses which are too vague or excessively wide\\-encompassing are *supposedly* stricken as unconscionable, unenforceable, etc. However, I personally would foreclose upfront the risk of judicial hassle and decline the abusive contract.\n\nLegal issues aside, keep in mind that you are *offering* your *expertise* (in terms of supply \\& demand, you are on the *supply* side).

She has been developing a novel machine learning algorithm for natural language processing on her own time, without using company resources. The algorithm could potentially be applied to improve customer sentiment analysis in CRM systems. Given the contract language provided, what is the most likely legal status of this invention?\n\nA) It belongs entirely to the developer, as it was created on her own time without company resources.\nB) It belongs to the company, as it relates to a \"Company Interest\" in CRM systems.\nC) It falls into a gray area and would likely require negotiation or legal interpretation.\nD) The developer retains ownership but must grant the company a non-exclusive license.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario presents a complex situation that highlights the ambiguities in the contract language. The invention was created on the developer's own time without company resources, which seems to satisfy the condition in the contract that excludes inventions \"developed entirely on my own time, without use of any Company facilities, assets, ideas or direction.\" However, the contract also claims ownership over inventions that \"are useful with or relate directly or indirectly to any 'Company Interest'.\"\n\nThe algorithm's potential application to CRM systems, which are part of the company's domain, creates ambiguity. The phrase \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is indeed vague, as noted in the documentation. Modern tech companies often have broad interests, making it difficult to clearly delineate what is and isn't related to company interests.\n\nFurthermore, the contract's language about \"whether or not (i) conducted at the Company's facilities, (ii) during working hours or (iii) using Company assets\" adds another layer of complexity, as it seems to contradict the exclusion for inventions developed on personal time.\n\nGiven these conflicting elements, the most likely outcome is that this invention falls into a gray area (C). It would likely require negotiation between the developer and the company, or potentially legal interpretation, to determine ownership rights.

The correct answer is B) The province where the consultant physically performs the work. In employment law disputes, the jurisdiction is typically determined by where the work is actually performed, rather than the location of the employer's office or headquarters.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The principle of \"innocent until proven guilty\" applies, as mentioned in the postscript. The CEO has not been convicted, only arrested.\n2. The documentation states that \"A person's property cannot be seized in the US except by due process of law.\" This means the CEO maintains legal ownership and control of their assets.\n3.

This option accurately represents the balance between the CEO's rights and the potential for asset seizure related to the alleged crime.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it arbitrarily distinguishes between company and personal assets, which is not supported by the documentation. Option B introduces a court approval process for transactions, which is not mentioned and would likely require a specific court order. Option C is incorrect because it contradicts the principle that property cannot be seized without due process, and the documentation explicitly states that conviction does not automatically result in forfeiture of all property to the state.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts (property rights, civil forfeiture, and the presumption of innocence) and applying them to a real-world scenario involving a CEO facing criminal charges."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27119/is-british-columbia-violating-the-1949-geneva-convention-on-road-traffic-by-requ", "docs_id": 27119, "title": "Is British Columbia violating the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic by requiring foreign drivers to exchange their license within three months?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to the [1949 Geneva Convention](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Geneva_Convention_on_Road_Traffic) citizens of any country that signed the agreement are able to drive in any other country for up to one year with an international driving permit:\n\n> No Contracting State shall be required to extend the benefit of the provisions of this Convention to any motor vehicle or trailer, or to **any driver having remained within its territory for a continuous period exceeding one year.** (Article 1, paragraph 2\\)\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Each Contracting State **shall allow any driver admitted to its territory who fulfils the conditions which are set out in Annex 8 and who holds a valid driving permit issued to him, after he has given proof of his competence, by the competent authority of another Contracting State or subdivision thereof, or by an Association duly empowered by such authority, to drive on its roads without further examination** motor vehicles of the category or categories defined in Annexes 9 and 10 for which the permit has been issued.

As with many other laws it would take a court ruling to definitively spell out how international agreements are applicable to a given situation. Unfortunately it doesn't seem that such a court ruling was ever produced so far:\n\n* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) fails to list any US court cases relevant to the Convention on Road Traffic. The only somewhat relevant case is [Busby v. State](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=16410084149983965777&q=\"Convention+on+Road+Traffic\"&hl=en&as_sdt=ffffffffffffe04) in which the court rules that one cannot drive in Alaska with an IDP after having been previously restricted from driving in Alaska. The court does stress out that:\n\n> **The Convention does forbid a signatory country (or subsidiary state) from imposing or enforcing license revocations in a manner that discriminates against residents of other signatory countries.** But Busby does not claim that he was the victim of such discrimination. Busby's license was revoked for conduct that would have led to license revocation if committed by an Alaska resident. (Indeed, Busby's license was revoked while he was an Alaska resident.) And Busby does not claim that he was singled out for prosecution because he was a resident of a foreign country\u2014i.e., that the State would not have charged him with the offense of driving with a revoked license if he had still been an Alaska resident.\n\nThis could possibly mean that the court believes that the Convention only applies to foreign residents, but its not spelled out specifically.\n* Searching for Canadian court cases [likewise doesn't turn up anything useful](https://www.canlii.org/en/#search/type=decision&text=%22convention%20on%20road%20traffic%22). The only relevant case is [R. v.

Here the court rules similar to the decision in Alaska in that having a foreign license does not allow one to circumvent locally imposed license restrictions.\n* Searching for UK case law [doesn't turn up any relevant court cases](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/lucy_search_1.cgi?sort=rank&method=boolean&highlight=1&datehigh=&mask_path=/eu/cases%20/ew/cases%20/ie/cases%20/nie/cases%20/scot/cases%20/uk/cases&datelow=&query=(%22Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic%22)).\n* Australian case law is [likewise mute on the subject](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?mask_path=&method=auto&query=%22convention+on+road+traffic%22).\n\nThere is also a relevant legal opinion by the Department of State quoted in the [Digest of United States practice in International Law, 2002](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/139638.pdf):\n\n> Reading these provisions as a whole, we believe that the State\n>  of Georgia, consistent with the CRT, \n> \n> \n> (1\\) must permit an alien to\n>  drive in Georgia using a foreign driver\u2019s license issued by a country\n>  party to the CRT only if the alien has been lawfully admitted to\n>  the United States; \n> \n> \n> (2\\) **must permit a lawfully admitted alien to drive\n>  in Georgia using a foreign driver\u2019s license of a CRT party only\n>  during the first year after the alien\u2019s admission**; and \n> \n> \n> (3\\) may, in\n>  accordance with Georgia\u2019s residency laws, require an alien resident\n>  in Georgia to obtain a Georgia driver\u2019s license as a condition for\n>  continued authorization to drive. By the same token, nothing in\n>  the CRT would prevent the State of Georgia from applying more\n>  liberal rules with respect to the driving privileges of aliens.\n\nIn [Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in the United States, 2014](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2303904) the author further analyses how the 1949 Geneva Convention is applicable within the United States. First, to settle the definition of \"international traffic\":\n\n> Nonetheless, the United States ultimately accepted that \u201cthe purpose\n>  of chapter II was to establish, in effect, an international code of minimum\n>  safety requirements. By indirection, the rules of the road set\n>  forth in the convention **would apply to the pattern of domestic as well\n>  as to international traffic**.\n\nThe author the meaning behind Article I of the Convention:\n\n> Article 1 states in part that no party \u201cshall be required to extend the benefit of the provisions of this Convention to any motor vehicle or trailer, or to any driver\n>  having remained within its territory for a continuous period exceeding\n>  one year.\u201d \n> \n> \n> This provision, on its face, indicates that the parties recognized\n>  that the treaty would benefit individuals.

Nonetheless, a court might conclude\n>  that, with respect to section II\u2019s rules of the road, the governmental obligation is merely to \u201ctake appropriate measures\u201d\n>  and that such an obligation is too vague to be enforced judicially.\n\n---\n\nSo it seems absolutely clear that the Convention intended for participating countries to allow foreign drivers to drive abroad for up to one year. However international treaties [are not self\\-executing by default in Canada](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-making-power/), unlike the US:\n\n> Canada is bound by the terms of treaties that it enters into and breach thereof may give rise to international claims. However, in Canada treaties are not self\\-executing; they do not constitute part of the law of the land merely by virtue of their conclusion.\n\nSo even though British Columbia is violating the 1949 Geneva Convention one cannot directly rely on said international agreement to enforce their rights. But another state party could theorethically sue Canada on behalf of its citizen to request that Canada rectifies its laws with accordance to the agreement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided documentation about international driving permits and the 1949 Geneva Convention:\n\nQuestion: A Canadian citizen who has been living in the United States for 8 months decides to move to British Columbia. They have a valid US driver's license and an International Driving Permit (IDP). Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their driving privileges in British Columbia?\n\nA) They can legally drive for up to one year using their US license and IDP, as per the 1949 Geneva Convention.\nB) They must exchange their US license for a British Columbia license within 90 days of becoming a resident.\nC) They can continue driving indefinitely with their US license and IDP as long as they renew the IDP annually.\nD) They are immediately required to obtain a British Columbia license upon establishing residency.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the conflict between international and domestic law, as well as understanding the practical application of these laws. \n\nThe 1949 Geneva Convention suggests that drivers should be allowed to drive for up to one year in other signatory countries using their valid license and IDP. However, the documentation also states that British Columbia requires foreign drivers to exchange their licenses within 90 days of becoming a resident.\n\nWhile there appears to be a conflict between these laws, the correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. International treaties are not self-executing in Canada, meaning they don't automatically become part of domestic law without being incorporated through legislation.\n\n2. The Geneva Convention allows for some flexibility, stating that no Contracting State is required to extend benefits to drivers who have remained in its territory for over a year. This suggests that shorter periods might be permissible under local laws.\n\n3. British Columbia's law is more specific and directly applicable to residents, whereas the Geneva Convention is more general and primarily aimed at temporary visitors.\n\n4. The lack of court rulings specifically addressing this conflict suggests that in practice, local laws like British Columbia's 90-day rule are typically enforced.\n\n5. The US Department of State's legal opinion, while not directly applicable to Canada, supports the idea that countries can require residents to obtain local licenses in accordance with their residency laws.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, analyze conflicting information, and understand the practical application of international agreements in the context of local laws.

Are this and similar ordinances constitutionally valid?**\n\nYes.\n\nSome future court might decide the law is invalid at some future time. But that possibility is hypothetical and speculative. Therefore, as of now, the law is valid unless and until it is challenged and overturned.\n\n> **2\\. What defenses could a government make if challenged?**\n\nIt depends on what grounds the law is challenged.\n\nYour question about *possible defenses* is highly dependent on the nature of any challenge \u2014 which you have not specified in your question. The U.S. Constitution, for example, prohibits laws respecting a number of things such as freedom of the press, speech, religion, peaceful assembly, bearing arms, etc. to list just a few of the most notable ones.\n\nBut your question does not assert the law in question violates any specific or particular prohibition against it. Although the question mentions \"*restricting free movement as well as targeting only a specific demographic*,\" it does not specify any part of any constitution that prohibits these things. Therefore, your question is unclear as to what might present a constitutional problem for the law. \n\nIt is also unclear which constitution you think might contain prohibitive language. Is it a federal constitutional issue that concerns you? Or is it a state constitutional matter? In either case, which issue specifically concerns you? Your question needs to address these specifics in order to analyze it and respond in a meaningful way.\n\nLook at it like this... just as it is impossible to prove a negative, so is it impossible for anyone to conclude with absolute certainty that any law is ***not unconstitutional*** because no one can predict with certainty every possible future challenge a law might face. There are just too many possibilities to (pre\\-emptively) exhaust them all with certainty. Also, no one can predict with certainty how any future court might rule on the future challenges (*which themselves* are unpredictable as previously argued). Therefore, one can only say I think the law ***is unconstitutional*** and here are my reasons. Then others can analyze the law and the reasons; then offer an opinion.\n\n> **Further, based on precedent, would they likely be successful?**\n\nSee above answer to question numbered 2\\.\n\n### Laws aren't required to be \"justified\" by the constitution.\n\n***Constitutional justification*** for a law is a meaningless phrase. There is no requirement for a law to be \"justified\" by any constitution other than that the legislature is empowered by the constitution to make laws. That's all the justification any law needs.

In most U.S. states there is a two part test. One part is determined based upon the face of the document, the other is based upon extrinsic evidence.\n\n**Formal Requirements**\n\nTo be formally valid without a hearing unless an interested party requests one in most U.S. states on its face (i.e. to be a \"self\\-proving will\") a will must:\n\n* Be in writing.\n* Be signed by the person making the will who is at least eighteen years of age.\n* Be signed by at least two witnesses who do not have conflicts of interest, who are attesting that the person making the will was competent and that they saw him or her sign it.\n* The signatures of the witnesses must be notarized. If their statements are not notarized, usually at least one witness must testify in a hearing or with a later affidavit.\n* The language of the will must indicate an intent to make a binding disposition of property in the estate of the person making it when they die, and other rights related to their estate and their death.\n\nVarious exceptions to these requirements exist in most state (e.g. a \"holographic will\" is valid if it is in writing, indicates the necessary intent, is signed, and has its material provision substantially in the hand writing of the person writing it).\n\nSome states allow oral wills called \"nuncupative wills\" in very specific circumstances usually limited to soldiers or sailors in circumstances of actual battle or imminent mayhem likely to result in death, with the proper witnesses.\n\nA will is like a dollar bill, a copy is not as good as the original document. If the original document cannot be found it is presumed that the will was revoked by physical destruction of the will, in the absence of evidence to the contrary submitted at a hearing to a judge.\n\n**Extrinsic Requirements**\n\nAny interested party can contest a will that appears valid on its face under the standards describe above on several grounds.\n\nTwo of these relate to the condition of the person signing the will at the time it was signed. The notarized witness statements create a presumption that these two conditions were met. But, that presumption can be overcome with other evidence from witnesses and/or documents or other kinds of evidence. These conditions are:\n\n* The document was procured from the person making it with duress or undue influence, even if the person making it did have \"testamentary capacity.\"\n* The person making it lacked testamentary capacity which is also a two part test. The first part is that the person making it knows who their family and the \"natural objects of their bounty are\", knows in general terms what they own, and knows what a will is intended to do and is capable of understanding the general outlines of what it does. This basically rules out people with severe dementia. The second part is that if the person is not suffering from dementia but is suffering from hallucinations, that the hallucinations have not influenced the nature of the provisions contained in the will.\n\nIn practice, \"[undue influence](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/publications/bifocal/vol_35/issue_3_feb2014/defining_undue_influence/)\" is the predominant ground for contesting wills that are formally valid on their face because testamentary capacity is a very low standard.\n\nA will can also be contested on the grounds involving extrinsic evidence that:\n\n* A later validly executed document revoked the will, or\n* The document is a forgery.\n\nIf any of the issues related to extrinsic evidence are disputed, both the party contesting the will, and the party defending it, has a right to have that issue resolved in a jury trial, although often the right to a jury trial in a case like this is waived by the parties.\n\nThis is determined by making a reasonable inquiry before submitting the will and examining the physical document and the place where it was when it was discovered, closely. The inquiry should be very searching if the terms of the will are surprising, and can be fairly lax if the terms of the will are what was widely expected.\n\nThere is generally a notice given to all interested parties when a will is submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction to be given effect that contains a deadline to raise a contest along these lines. A will that is not submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction usually has no force or effect until that happen in most U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nPublic Policy\n=============\n\nEven if the will is valid in general, some terms of the will may be invalid as a matter of public policy, or modified by statue, in certain circumstances. These exceptions can usually be determined on the face of the document or with minimal additional information (although \"your mileage may vary\" and cases where, for example, the cause of death or date of death is uncertain can be difficult).\n\nFor example, the following limitations are common:\n\n* A term in a will conditioning a gift at death on marrying or not marrying a particular person is void in most, if not all, U.S. states.\n* Under certain circumstances a will is required to leave certain minimum amounts to a surviving spouse and/or minor dependent children.\n* If a will appears to omit a child of the person making it by accident, it is modified in particular ways mandated by statute.\n* Will provisions making gifts at death or giving responsibilities to someone who murdered the person who wrote the will are void.\n* Some states invalidate provisions in favor of an ex\\-spouse upon divorce, unless a post\\-divorce document reaffirms those inheritances.\n* Certain kinds of words are given defined statutory meanings unless the express language of a will says otherwise, such as \"by representation\", or \"if he survives me\", that are not necessarily intuitive or in line with every day use of language.\n\nIt is usually necessary to review the probate court and case law in the state where the decedent was domiciled at death to determine if these limitations apply, ideally with a probate or estate administration lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about wills, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy entrepreneur, Sarah, created a will that appears to meet all formal requirements.

The documentation states that for lack of testamentary capacity, not only must the person be suffering from hallucinations, but those hallucinations must have influenced the nature of the will's provisions. In this case, while Sarah experienced hallucinations, proving that they specifically affected the will's contents would be extremely difficult.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's relatively easy to prove and invalidates the will on formal grounds. The documentation clearly states that for a self-proving will, the witnesses' signatures must be notarized.\n\nOption C relates to undue influence, which the documentation notes is the \"predominant ground for contesting wills.\" While this scenario presents some pressure, proving undue influence would likely be easier than option A, especially if there's evidence of the assistant's actions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's a clear-cut case described in the documentation.

Having phoned in the numbers and learning that the items were stolen, they then had probable cause for a seizure. That cause was, however, obtained via an illegal search.\n\nSuppose that the serial numbers had been visible from the front: then because they would have been in plain view and since the police were there for a reasonable search related to the shooting, then could have legally seized the stereo, since no additional search was required.\n\nThere is no distinction between search and seizure w.r.t. 4th Amendment protection (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\"). Police could not confiscate the stereo without probable cause, nor could they confiscate cash, or any other thing, again, unless they had probable cause.

That could be actionable as conspiracy with \\-\\-or abetting of\\-\\- the new buyer. Your description does not reflect any plans of yours to vacate the premises, though.\n\n> Would it be a legal, enforceable contract?\n\nYes. However, it is utmost important that the \"separate\" contract make it clear the superseding effect it has on the full contract that is presented to the lender.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that, when interpreting a contract, a court is supposed to restrict its review to the language of the contract only. Any external records are ignored unless they explicitly relate to the contract, or in situations where the language of the contract lacks guidance as to the controversy at issue.\n\nAlso, without proper reference to the official lease, the separate provision would look as a one\\-sided promise rather than an *exchange* of considerations (by definition, a contract is an exchange of considerations). Thus, you would be more vulnerable to the new buyer's eventual decision not to honor the provision. \n\nStrictly speaking, the separate contract with no references to the official lease could make it clear that your consideration was in the form of helping the new buyer in his mortgage process. However, for obvious reasons the new buyer will refuse to reflect that in the separate contract. Hence, your protection consists of ensuring that the relation between the official contract and the separate contract is explicit in the latter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tenant without a current lease is asked by a prospective buyer of the office building to sign a new lease to facilitate a mortgage approval. The buyer proposes a side agreement allowing the tenant to terminate the lease with 90 days' notice, which would not be disclosed to the mortgage lender. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this arrangement?\n\nA) The tenant could be held liable for conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud if they agree to the side contract.\nB) The side agreement would be unenforceable due to its fraudulent nature, leaving the tenant bound by the full lease term.\nC) The tenant bears no legal risk, but the side agreement must explicitly reference the official lease to be enforceable.\nD) The arrangement is legal and risk-free for the tenant as long as they have no immediate plans to vacate the premises.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The tenant is not directly involved in the potential mortgage fraud, which is primarily the buyer's responsibility. This eliminates option A.\n\n2. The side agreement would be a legal and enforceable contract between the tenant and the buyer, contrary to option B. However, its enforceability depends on proper construction.\n\n3. To ensure enforceability, the side agreement must explicitly reference the official lease. This is crucial for two reasons:\n   a) It establishes the connection between the two documents for court interpretation.\n   b) It clarifies the exchange of considerations, making it a valid contract.\n\n4. While option D touches on a valid point about the tenant's risk being lower if they don't plan to vacate soon, it oversimplifies the legal situation. The enforceability of the side agreement is not dependent on the tenant's plans but on its proper construction.\n\n5.

Option C is the most critical factor because it directly addresses the legal basis for the claim. By showing evidence that all conditions of the unilateral contract were met (new user, correct invite code entry, linking a personal debit card, and sending $5+ within 14 days), the user establishes that they have fully performed their part of the agreement.

(Since, ostensibly, Josephine would be getting all that she is due.)\n* Does Josephine's desire to represent the class make a difference?\n* Does it make a difference whether the class has been certified or not?\n* Does it matter whether Josephine accepts the offer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you are referring to is a Rule 68 (FED. R. Civ. P. 68\\) offer of judgment (OOJ). Thus far, nearly every jurisdiction's court of appeals has refused to construe these as being binding on the Plaintiff if the offer is denied, even if it offers complete remuneration, especially in a putative class action. The underlying reasons when applied to a certified class differ fairly substantially from an individual plaintiff or a non\\-certified class. However, there are some kinds of cases where a Rule 68 offer could *never* fully compensate (as with cases where subjective or non\\-substantive forms of damage have been requested).\n\nA Rule 68 offer is a cost\\-flipping mechanism, often used by defense attorneys when they are making what they believe is a fair offer (very rarely is the offer one that is equal to the Plaintiff's demand, which is why this issue rarely arises). If a defense attorney makes an offer of judgment, and then the Plaintiff doesn't accept the offer, they need to get a jury verdict in an amount greater than the offer, or the costs are flipped. So, typically, if there is no OOJ and the Plaintiff wins even a nominal judgment (it can be a dollar) the Defendant always has to pay their costs, which can be substantial. When a Rule 68 offer is made, it's a carefully calculated amount that the defendant thinks the plaintiff can't get in a jury verdict, even if they win, but it's typically less than the demand. \n\nThe reason a Rule 68 offer is **almost never** \"full compensation\" is that a Plaintiff's demand for settlement will typically be somewhere in the area of 3x the amount the Plaintiff's attorney estimates the case to be worth. The Plaintiff is informed of this by their lawyer, so they don't have unreasonable expectations. If you think about it, this makes sense from an *ability to negotiate* perspective, with the logic being that the Plaintiff wants to get as close to full value as they can, and the defense needs their client to think they've saved them from some huge judgement. If a plaintiff demanded only what the case was worth, it would have no chance of settling for true value, or if the case were to settle, the Defense lawyer wouldn't be able to move the Plaintiff down off their number in any substantial way. This way, the lawyers can play their game negotiating the case down to a fair value. Plaintiff gets what their case is worth and Defendant feels like their lawyer saved them from catastrophe. It's all illusion.\n\nThe First Circuit recently joined the Second, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits in holding that a Rule 68 offer made prior to class certification and rejected by Plaintiff does not moot the Plaintiff\u2019s claim. The Plaintiff, a private high school, brought the action against the corporate developer of a college\\-entrance exam, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and an analogous state statute related to unsolicited faxes it received. Prior to Plaintiff\u2019s deadline to move for class certification, the Defendant made an Offer Of Judgment, offering Plaintiff the amount it could receive under the two statutes for each fax. Plaintiff did not respond within 14 days, rendering the offer withdrawn under Rule 68, and instead moved for class certification. Defendant then moved to dismiss, arguing that the withdrawn offer rendered Plaintiff\u2019s claims moot and divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, holding that Plaintiff\u2019s claim was not moot, but certified the question of whether an unaccepted Rule 68 offer, made before certification, moots the entire action and deprives the court of jurisdiction.\n\nGenerally speaking, aside from very specific types of cases involving contracts, or specific types of statutory relief, a Plaintiff typically includes counts for things like NIED (negligent infliction of emotional distress), pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of future earning capacity \u2013 these are a few of the types of counts whereby there is no specific value a defendant could ever point to being \"fully satisfied\" \u2013 the reason being, a jury needs to determine the legitimate value of these claims unless the Plaintiff accepts a settlement award whereby he/she/it feels as if it's fully satisfied.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a class action lawsuit against CE Inc., lead plaintiff Josephine is offered the maximum statutory remedy before class certification.

The example provided in the documentation supports this, mentioning that the First Circuit joined other circuits in holding that a rejected Rule 68 offer made prior to class certification does not moot the Plaintiff's claim.\n\n3. By rejecting the offer and moving for class certification, Josephine is following the path that courts have generally allowed to continue the case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because accepting the offer would likely moot Josephine's individual claim, potentially disqualifying her as a class representative. Option C is incorrect because accepting the offer and withdrawing would end the case. Option D is incorrect because judges typically do not order plaintiffs to accept settlement offers, and doing so would go against the precedent described in the documentation.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts, understand the implications of timing in class action lawsuits, and apply legal precedents to a specific scenario, aligning with higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60030/are-chess-games-copyrighted", "docs_id": 60030, "title": "Are chess games copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First and foremost, I've already done some research regarding my question \\- web pages including, but not limited to the following ones, weren't able to answer my question to it's full extent:\n\n* [https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/17143/what\\-are\\-the\\-laws\\-concerning\\-copyright\\-of\\-chess\\-games](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/17143/what-are-the-laws-concerning-copyright-of-chess-games)\n* <https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1wgnc7/chess_and_copyright/>\n* [https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/copyright\\-on\\-games](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/copyright-on-games)\n* etc.\n\nAccording to various sources, chess games (the moves themselves) aren't protected by copyright of any kind.

A mid-level immigration officer believes this order violates due process rights but is instructed by superiors to comply. If the officer follows the order and a court later rules it unconstitutional, what is the most likely outcome regarding the officer's personal liability?\n\nA) The officer would be granted absolute immunity due to following orders from the executive branch\nB) The officer would be personally liable because the order clearly violated established constitutional rights\nC) The officer would likely be protected by qualified immunity unless the right was \"clearly established\" at the time\nD) The officer would have no liability as only the President can be held accountable for unconstitutional executive orders\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the distinction between absolute and qualified immunity, the \"clearly established right\" standard, and the application of these principles to executive orders.\n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"qualified immunity represents the norm\" for executive officials, not absolute immunity (which eliminates option A).\n\n2. Officers with qualified immunity are \"shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n\n3. For liability to attach, the right must be \"clearly established at the time of the alleged violation\" and \"existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question confronted by the official beyond debate.\"\n\n4. In this scenario, while the order may indeed be unconstitutional, it's not immediately clear that every reasonable official would have known this at the time, especially given the national security justification and instructions from superiors.\n\n5. A court would need to determine if the right in question (due process for non-citizens in deportation proceedings) was so clearly established that any reasonable official would have known the order was unconstitutional.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it assumes the violation was clearly established without considering the complexities of the situation. Option D is incorrect because it misunderstands the concept of official liability, as lower-level officials can indeed be held liable for carrying out unconstitutional orders.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the application of legal principles to a complex, real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16564/would-stop-a-douchebag-be-legal-in-the-us-why-is-it-legal-in-russia", "docs_id": 16564, "title": "Would &quot;Stop a Douchebag&quot; be legal in the US?

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of this situation under the Law of Property Act 1925?\n\nA) The nephew would be considered a \"purchaser\" with a valid claim to the property, as caring for the seller constitutes \"valuable consideration.\"\nB) The developer would be considered a \"purchaser\" only if they offer money or money's worth, while the nephew's claim would be invalid.\nC) Both the developer and the nephew could be considered \"purchasers,\" but the developer's claim would take precedence if they offer monetary consideration.\nD) Neither the developer nor the nephew would be considered \"purchasers\" as the land has not yet been formally transferred.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the definition of \"purchaser\" provided in the Law of Property Act 1925.

To the best of my knowledge, this provision has only been employed against people who were solders or civil officials of the Confederacy during the US Civil War.

The legislature in question could surely act to expel a member in such a case, if its own rules allow expulsion (Each house of Congress is granted that power explicitly in the Federal Constitution, but a 2/3rds vote to expel is needed.) Presumably other procedures could also be used, but I am not sure what they would be, or what procedures were used back in the 1860s.\n\nIt is not clear that a person would need to be criminally convicted before this could apply, but under Due process some sort of hearing would be required.

Option C is the most comprehensive and legally sound approach based on the information provided:\n\n1. The question of whether the Capitol storming constitutes an \"insurrection\" under the 14th Amendment is not settled, making a direct criminal charge (Option A) premature and potentially insufficient.\n\n2. No implementation law is required for Section 3, as it is self-executing, making Option B unnecessary and incorrect.\n\n3. The state legislature has the power to expel its own members, which is a direct and potentially faster route. Simultaneously seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court addresses the unsettled nature of whether the actions constitute \"insurrection or rebellion\" under the 14th Amendment.\n\n4.

He was trying to say *\"if you find something, you'll say I'm driving, it's my car, it's my contraband\"*. This is a legitimate concern because police often hold the driver responsible for what they find on the passenger, or if the passenger were to stuff drugs (or whatever) in a place accessible to the driver, the driver could be charged.\n\nHe is not implying that it isn't \"his car\", he's trying to reason with the officers saying that if they do find something, they shouldn't attribute that to him automatically.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An Uber driver is pulled over by police who mention \"there's a lot of history on this vehicle.\" The driver implies the vehicle isn't his.

While trespassers are the lowest category of visitors in occupier's liability law, there is still a duty owed to them. This is described as a duty to their \"common humanity.\"\n\n2.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The original terms of service likely include provisions for the provider to modify the agreement, but not for the user to do so unilaterally.\n2.

(A similar argument is usually made when the state provides a death sentence and executes its citizens). Or maybe the contra\\-positive is more import \\- a judge who knows he or she is not held accountable is free be be as corrupt as they like knowing they will probably not get caught.\n\nHow is it in the public's interest not to hold a corrupt judge accountable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judicial immunity means only that the judge can't be *sued* by the people negatively affected by his decisions, even if they were made corruptly. \n\nThe idea is that if this were possible, then anyone who lost a case before the judge could sue him, perhaps falsely claiming that he was corrupt. Defending such suits would be a major nuisance and expense for the judge, and some fraction of such cases might be wrongly decided against him (courts do err sometimes). So, a party who said (or insinuated) to the judge that \"you'd better decide my case in my favor or else I'll sue you\" would have a credible threat, and the judge might be intimidated into giving in.

This would exhaust the list.\n\nFurthermore, \"If all eligibles at a score waive appointment or fail to respond within the time limits provided in these Rules, the appointing officer may request supplementary certification(s) from the next highest score.\" This indicates that if multiple candidates waive appointment, it could potentially exhaust the list or require supplementary certifications, creating a challenge in the hiring process.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about the potential challenges in the civil service hiring process under these rules."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79627/what-can-someone-do-when-scammed-in-the-crypto-world-how-to-report-the-scam-and", "docs_id": 79627, "title": "What can someone do when scammed in the crypto world?

If you (or your mother) own the guns, you can sell them to anyone you like unless you have reason to believe they are a prohibited possessor.\n\n* There is no legal requirement for you to validate their identity.\n* There is no limit on the number of guns you can sell to one person.\n* A bill of sale is optional.\n* You don't need a lawyer and, honestly, I'm not sure what a lawyer would do to help you sell a gun.\n\nThe laws, being what they are, lead some to conclude that this must be how prohibited possessors get their guns. It's not. Most \"illegal\" guns are bought through straw purchases in which a person with a clean record buys a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to own one.\n\nYou can work through a licensed dealer if it makes you feel better. If you don't want to use a dealer, you can simply require that a buyer have a concealed carry license as evidence that they are not a prohibited possessor. The CCW is not a surefire way to guarantee anything though.\n\nPersonally, I would transact a private party sale with individuals via a dealer. You're in AZ. There is no shortage of gun buyers!\n\nAt the risk of breaking site rules, you can also list guns online. For example, [www.gunbroker.com](http://www.gunbroker.com) is a popular site and follows an eBay\\-style bid structure (I have no affiliation to them).

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that there are no rules against private sales of firearms in Arizona, so legal consultation (option A) is unnecessary.\n2.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The duress defense would likely apply if you choose a hostage. As mentioned in the documentation, duress is recognized in most jurisdictions when someone is forced to commit an act under threat of death or serious harm. In this case, you're under extreme duress from the terrorists.\n\n2.

The FAA has nothing to do with it; they regulate things as they affect airplanes, but the actual *radio* rules are set by the FCC, and since frequency allocation is a purely radio thing the FAA has nothing official to do with it. The breakdown between FCC and NTIA is that the FCC deals with non\\-federal communications, while the NTIA deals with federal communications; they split the spectrum.\n\nNow, with things like Wi\\-Fi, many of the rules are set by non\\-governmental standards organizations. Wi\\-Fi is not regulated by the FCC; it falls within the frequencies and transmission powers that the FCC has deemed to be not regulated. So, the FCC never set aside 2\\.4 GHz for wireless Internet; they set it aside for any low\\-powered transmissions anyone wants to make (subject to interference rules). With LTE and satellite communications, there's more regulatory control; they are high\\-powered communications, and are licensed to individual operators for a specific frequency range. \n\nAs Flup said, there is international coordination for obvious reasons (the ITU actually predates the UN by almost a century).

The opinion refers to \"the phrase \u201cthe militia\u201d in the prefatory clause\", with no capitalization when mentioning it.\n\nIn interpreting the object of \"keep and bear Arms\", \"Arms\", the opinion immediately removes capitalization in its own discussion of the term.

The court explicitly stated that differences in punctuation and capitalization between similar provisions (e.g., Vermont's adoption of Pennsylvania's right to bear arms) were \"inconsequential.\"\n\n3.

If those moving parts are part of claims in the patent to use in engine patent, will it be illegal to mimic them in replica?\n\nCheers,\nFilip\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several forms of intellectual property:\n\n1. Utility patents protect the functional aspects of a product for a period of approximately 20 years. If it is out of patent, it is in the public domain and you can freely make one. I can't think of any case where a patent infringement case was successfully made against someone who made a non\\-functional version of the patented item and I have no idea how the case law would play out in that. Usually those suits aren't brought because the functionality isn't imitated and it isn't valuable.\n2. Design patents protect the design for about the same time period. Usually, a functional product like an engine wouldn't be subject to a design patent \\- more often, only the exterior of a vehicle design would be subject to a design patent.\n3. A copyright protects expressions of a design or derivations of a copyright, but will not generally protect a functional design where the design parameters are governed by the laws of physics. Copyrights last much longer than patents (up to about a century depending upon who owns it), and there was a major change in the scope of copyright protection in the 1970s. Earlier copyrights required an affirmative filing to protect and had to be renewed. Later copyrights arise automatically, although filing and claiming a copyright enhances the copyright owner's rights. I would seriously doubt that an engine design would enjoy copyright protection.\n4. Trade dress/trademark covers non\\-functional aspects of a good that are associated with a brand of good to sell a product and can arise even without a public filing at common law. For example, if the engine had a company logo embossed on it, this would have trademark protection.\n\nGenerally speaking, your project would be at low risk for intellectual property infringement, particularly if the engine were a classic one, rather than a modern one. It also helps, from a practical perspective, that few companies that own intellectual property rights associated with engines are actively pursuing possible infringements of their engine designs legally. They are in the business of selling parts for vehicles to make vehicles run; they are not in the business of selling their engine designs as art.

The correct answer is D because including the manufacturer's logo, even if small, poses the highest risk of intellectual property infringement due to trademark protection.\n\nOption A has a lower risk because utility patents on a 1960s engine would likely have expired, and copyright generally doesn't protect functional designs governed by physics. The moving parts, while mimicking the original, don't infringe on patents if they're non-functional.\n\nOption B presents a low risk because slight modifications to the external design might actually help avoid any potential design patent issues, while the internal structure of a functional item is less likely to be protected by copyright.\n\nOption C is also low-risk because using modern materials doesn't typically infringe on intellectual property rights, especially for older designs.\n\nOption D, however, directly involves trademark/trade dress issues. As the documentation states, \"Trade dress/trademark covers non-functional aspects of a good that are associated with a brand of good to sell a product and can arise even without a public filing at common law.\" Logos are specifically mentioned as an example of trademark protection.

It appears to me that the German bureaucracy is preventing multiple registrations on the same address, however I have yet to receive clear answers as to why and how.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think I can easily find myself officially homeless even though I have a job, health insurance and pay taxes. \n\nWhat do people without a home do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All residents in Germany need to have a registered address. The reasons for that are numerous:\n\n* no need for a separate voting registration,\n* it gives a place to deliver legal notices,\n* it helps enforcing tax regulation (though tax law has another definition of \"residence\"),\n* certain taxes are assigned to the municipality where you are registered,\n* no need to do a utility bill or credit report dance when trying to prove your address to third\\-parties,\n* it was always done like that.\n\nThe last is reason enough as far as bureaucracy is concerned.\n\nAs far as your question goes, there are a few wrong assumptions.\n\nFirst, nobody is trying to limit or deny registrations. Municipalities actually get money for every resident they have registered through tax allocation.\n\nSecond, if you (semi\\-)permanently live at some place you are not considered \"officially homeless\" but as someone has didn't properly register themselves (which could result in a fine).\n\nThird, multiple people can be registered at the same address. How else could people register themselves in huge apartment buildings? Or even a family living together? If there is a suspicious amount of people registered they might want to check whether other regulation (such as minimum space per person) is adhered to. \n\nFourth, to register somewhere you need proof that you actually live there. This is where you probably ran into problems. This proof is usually [a letter given by the person allowing you live at a place](http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402544). Note that this is not necessarily the owner of the place but literally the person allowing you to stay (the authorities can check with the owner though). Often subletters won't sign that piece of paper, either because they think they are not allowed to or they don't have permission by the owner to sublet the place to begin with. If that happens you are supposed to tell that to the authorities (\u00a7\u00a019 Abs.\u00a02 BMG) who then can choose to fine the one providing the place for refusing to sign the paper. (The need for proof was recently reintroduced after it was noticed that there was a huge amount of people who registered at an address where they didn't actually live.)\n\nFifth, if you never have been registered before you can't actually properly pay your taxes as you need a tax ID for that. This is automatically assigned when you \u2013 surprise \u2013 register for the first time. If you are not an EU/EEA/CH citizen you also need to register yourself before they can change anything about the residence permit within Germany.\n\nTo end with an answer to your question if taken literally: German citizens can register themselves as homeless (*ohne festen Wohnsitz*) if they really are. For foreigners this is a bit more complicated. EU citizens usually don't have freedom of movement rights if they can't properly support themselves, a living space is supposed to be part of that.

And it's used quite often.\n\nFor example, take unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, if the police want to search someone's home, they normally have to obtain a warrant. In Canada, this can often be obtained by a Justice of the Peace. For some background, the [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html) says this:\n\n> Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\n\nSo what happens if someone was searched unreasonably?\n\nIn such cases, the court would throw out the evidence. If the police searched someones home, and found a firearm, but they didn't obtain a warrant (and they didn't provide justification for not having done so), the evidence would be thrown out of court. This is to make sure that the rights of the accused are kept, and that a fair trial is run.\n\nIn [*R v Feeney \\[1997] 2 SCR 13*](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1508/index.do), the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that searching a house without a warrant constitutes an unreasonable search:\n\n> The police, during a murder investigation in 1991, entered the accused\u2019s house (an equipment trailer) without permission. When they received no answer at the door, they entered, roused the accused, touched his leg, ordered him to get up and took him to the front of the trailer for better lighting. ...\n> \n> \n> Warrantless arrests in dwelling houses are in general prohibited. Prior to such an arrest, the police officer must obtain judicial authorization for the arrest by obtaining a warrant to enter the dwelling house for the purpose of arrest. Such a warrant will only be authorized if there are reasonable grounds for the arrest, and reasonable grounds to believe that the person will be found at the address named, thus providing individuals\u2019 privacy interests in an arrest situation with the protection this Court has required with respect to searches and seizures. Requiring a warrant prior to arrest avoids the ex post facto analysis of the reasonableness of an intrusion and invasive arrests without a basis of reasonable and probable grounds are prevented, rather than remedied after the fact.\n> \n> \n> The protection of privacy does not end with a warrant; before forcibly entering a dwelling house to make an arrest with a warrant for an indictable offence, proper announcement must be made.\n\nWhen a request to exclude evidence is made, a *voir dire* will often be held, with the jury absent, to determine if the evidence is admissible into court.\n\nTo respond to your second paragraph, \"targeting\" of individuals can happen, but the justice system normally has a lot of integrity. That's not a result of the justice system \\- it's more psychological and political if anything. Courts are impartial, and look at all aspects of the alleged crime that they are trying. I'm not aware of any charges that have been biased, at least here in Canada. **There are many steps to keep the justice system transparent and accountable**, so if any incident like that were to occur, it would be extremely rare and dealt with promptly. \n\nYou may have fun reading [Judge blasts Toronto police over 'Kafkaesque' traffic stop](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/13/judge-blasts-toronto-police-over-kafkaesque-traffic-stop.html):\n\n> A judge has acquitted a man of failing to provide a breath sample, rebuking Toronto police officers\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cverbally abusive\u201d conduct following a simple traffic stop, which included telling the man he needed to exit his car because he had come to a \u201chigh drug\u201d area.\n> \n> \n> Calling the encounter, which was captured on the police\u2019s in\\-car camera system, \u201ctruly Kafkaesque,\u201d Ontario Court Justice Sandra Bacchus was also critical of the officers for turning off their microphones during \u201ckey seconds.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Those seconds were just before officers decided to ask the man for a breath sample after repeatedly demanding he exit his vehicle, despite there being no valid reason to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A civil rights attorney is representing a group of Black defendants who were arrested for burglary.

Not all businesses are entities and when a business is organized as a sole proprietorship rather than as an entity, registering a vehicle in your name and registering a vehicle in the business are the same thing in any case.\n\nIt is conceivable that Virginia has, or may have at some time in the future, different registration fees, for example, for vehicles owned for personal use and vehicles owned for business use, and that it might put a cap on the number of vehicles owned for personal use for that purpose (so far as I know, there is no such limit now, but I could imagine a state government doing something like that, much as they do for certain kinds of residential real estate property tax breaks).\n\nBut whether a vehicle is owned for personal use or for business use still wouldn't change the fact that a vehicle is owned by you individually.\n\nAs a matter of good business practices, registering a large number of vehicles used for business purposes in your personal name probably isn't wise (e.g. for liability and tax purposes), but that doesn't mean that it is illegal or prohibited.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that would be similar to the kind of limitation that you are worried about is that New York City has (and perhaps a few other jurisdictions have) a highly regulated taxi industry, and to operate a taxi you must have a taxi license. Taxi licenses in New York City are fixed in number and transferrable, and all of the licenses available have been issued, so the only way you can own a taxi and actually use it as a taxi is to buy a taxi license from someone who already has one and even in theory, you couldn't buy more than the total number of taxi licenses which are outstanding.\n\nIn many businesses where you need a license to operate (e.g. liquor stores and radio stations and TV stations) there are numerical limits on how many licenses any one person can own at one time in a particular territory.\n\nBut registering a car is not a discretionarily granted license in the same way that a taxi or radio license is, it is simply a way of formally registering ownership of a particular item of tangible personal property as owned by you (the registration laws were originally passed to discourage car theft).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in Virginia is expanding her fleet of delivery vehicles and plans to register 20 new vans.

The documentation states that \"registering a large number of vehicles used for business purposes in your personal name probably isn't wise (e.g. for liability and tax purposes).\" This suggests that option A is not advisable.\n\n2. While there's no explicit limit on the number of vehicles one can register, the answer mentions that \"as a matter of good business practices,\" it's better to separate personal and business assets.

As a cybersecurity professional I can provide some technical context around what I believe to be the situation.\n\nWhile I do not know the legal precedence, technically, IP addresses cannot typically be attributed to an individual person. There are a number of reasons for this.\n\nIn a local network, IP addresses are not unique. Rather, they are distributed by the DHCP server, and are reassigned at intervals. Forensic attribution to an individual in most environments would require a DHCP log linking the IP to the machine\u2019s MAC address, with time stamps that correlate to the individual\u2019s logon to that machine at the same time.\n\nIf the IP correlation involves a VPN, it gets more difficult. I would need to know where the log/evidence was obtained to determine what the IPs in question actually correlate to. If the evidence was obtained in local area network of the suspect, the IP addresses are likely assigned by the DHCP server (see previous). If they are obtained after encryption in transit to decryption, then very little can be determined. If they were obtained at the VPN server log, these IPs likely belong to an ISP which in turn may or may not be able to show what machine initiated the conversation.\n\nDigital photos often contain EXIF data, which is metadata about the photo. This data can contain details like, device make and model, sometimes location, time and date... If the defendant owns a Nikon such and such and the photo was taken with a Nikon such and such, and was uploaded using a VPN the defendant has an account with, and the defendant was in that location at the time and place of the photo... there may be enough there... but I\u2019m not a lawyer.\n\nI believe the discovery should include any EXIF metadata and logs to be used as evidence.\n\nYou may need a special technical whiteness to educate the court on what can and cannot be determined (technically) given the evidence.

The correct answer is B because it provides the strongest connection between the suspect and the uploaded images.\n\nOption A, while relevant, is not the strongest because IP addresses alone cannot typically be attributed to an individual person, as mentioned in the documentation. They are often dynamically assigned and can be shared among multiple users.\n\nOption B is the most compelling because it links physical evidence (the camera) with digital evidence (EXIF data). The documentation specifically mentions that EXIF data can contain details like device make and model, which can be a strong indicator if it matches a device in the suspect's possession.\n\nOption C involves a VPN, which the documentation notes makes attribution more difficult. While it provides some evidence, it's not as strong as the camera-EXIF data match.\n\nOption D is problematic because, as the documentation states, in a local network (like an office), IP addresses are not unique and are distributed by the DHCP server.

For example, if someone came a slapped you on the face but did not proceed hitting you (at which point it could be claimed he no longer presented threatening force to you), would it be okay to punch him and not be legally liable? Or if someone started getting in your face but not really touch you, would it be legally okay to punch them to get them out of your face? What are some examples of provocation that the law would be sympathetic with the target using physical force against? \n\nIn general, what are some guidelines, in the U.S., to know when it is okay to respond with physical force? Is ANY violence (e.g. a humiliating act like slapping somebody) enough to exempt the victim from ... beating the c\\*\\*p out of or shooting the perpetrator? At which point does shooting the perpetrator becomes fair game because their actions constituted a legitimate threat?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that using force in self\\-defense is justified if the person using the force reasonably believes it immediately is necessary to prevent the unlawful use of force against themselves or a third party. Deadly force is not generally justified except in response to a reasonable fear of deadly force, or to prevent certain violent crimes (like rape, kidnapping, robbery, etc.) Force is *not* justified in retaliation. In some states, if you're not at home (or maybe even then), you also have a duty to retreat before you can use deadly force in self\\-defense.\n\nSo, for your specific questions:\n\n* If they hit you once but aren't continuing to hit you, it's illegal to hit them back. You can only use force to defend yourself, not to get even.\n* If someone gets in your face without touching you, you *might* be allowed to use force, but it depends on the circumstances. You don't have to wait for someone to hit you, but you can't sucker\\-punch someone because you want more space in a mosh pit.\n* Your use of force needs to be something you reasonably believe to be necessary to stop/prevent their unlawful use of force. It also needs to be proportional to the force you're defending against; you can meet deadly force with deadly force, but shooting someone to stop them from slapping you is murder. Likewise, no one's going to believe that you really thought you *had* to beat the crap out of someone in order to stop them from slapping you, or that it's in any way proportionate to what they did.\n* Deadly force is not allowed in defense of a person unless you reasonably think *deadly* force is needed to prevent the unlawful use of deadly force, or to prevent one of a few crimes being committed against them.

The correct answer is C because it represents a proportional and immediate response to the threat posed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using deadly force (shooting) is not justified in this scenario. The documentation states that deadly force is only allowed when facing deadly force or to prevent certain violent crimes, neither of which apply here.\n\nOption B, while not using deadly force, is likely disproportionate to the threat.

The committee said it was \"deeply alarmed\" over the discretionary power judges hold to treat juveniles as adults: In its 2004 report the Saudi Arabian government had stated that it \"never imposes capital punishment on persons ... below the age of 18\". The government delegation later acknowledged that a judge could impose the death penalty whenever he decided that the convicted person had reached his or her majority, regardless of the person's actual age at the time of the crime or at the time of the scheduled execution.\n\nThe last bit is taken from [here](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/01/28/saudi-arabia-follow-un-call-end-juvenile-death-penalty).

Their parents (or guardians, or whoever is with them) will shout half\\-heartedly a few times, then, without anything changing, the so\\-called guardians will just go back inside their house.\n4. Their kids have banged on my windows, with the excuse that they \"want to see the dog\".\n5.

Their kids have gone into private property (my garage and my neighbors backyard\\-\\-which sits behind a gate).\n\nI have attempted to \"reason\" with them, several times, to no avail. Their general excuses are:\n\n1. The curfew on sound starts at 10pm, so as long as it is before 10pm, they are free to be as loud as they want to be.\n2. Their kids are \"just kids\" and not only can they \"play outside\" but they need to do so directly outside my house because that is a \"public street\" (mind you, I live in a small German village, where the \"public street\" is extremely narrow and is not even a through street).\n\nThis has bothered me for the following reasons:\n\n1. Disrupted my work.\n2. Disrupted my baby daughter's sleep.\n\nWhat can I do about this?\n\nWhenever I tell them that I am not against their kids playing outside, I would just prefer they did not do it directly outside my house when my daughter is trying to sleep, I am either ignored or told that \"they will talk to their kids\" (which results in nothing).\n\nThere is literally a beautiful, public, free to access park (Sportplatz) right down the street, where I walk my dog daily: it has soccer fields, basketball courts, and several hiking and biking paths, but when I raise this as a suggestion, they say that their kids can play on the \"public street\", meaning directly outside my house, where they scream, shout, pretend to cry, and \"play outside\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Germany, the noise of playing children is **defined as not noise** according to [\u00a722 BImSchG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bimschg/__22.html). Normal industrial/commercial limits do not apply. This aims mostly at playgrounds, kindergartens, etc.\n\nThe noise of cars, stereos, etc. is not unlimited even before 22:00, but it is considerably harder to get the *police* to intervene during daytime. You might consult with a lawyer to find out if they are unreasonably noisy, you are unreasonably thin\\-skinned, or both. Similarly, the driving you describe *may* be violating traffic regulations, but proving that will be difficult.\n\nAs to actual damages to your premises, what happens depends on the age of the children *and* if they had proper supervision by their guardians. Proper supervision does not require the guardians to stand next to the children around the clock. If you have a specific case, and if the \"perpetrator\" was over 7 years old, you can ask for repayment and then sue if they refuse. This is most likely more hassle than the damage is worth, even if you do get a judgement against a minor, but it could change the tone of the relationship with your neighbours.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. German law (\u00a722 BImSchG) defines children's play noise as \"not noise,\" making standard noise complaints less effective.\n2.

Massachusetts's statutes don't seem to expressly prohibit it\u2014and I didn't find any Massachusetts cases where the registered agent's age was at issue. But registered agents have some fiduciary duties, and the agent has to have the capacity to receive all forms of legal process.\n\nSome possible roadblocks are:\n\n1. \"minor\" is a broad term that courts don't seem to have interpreted in the context of registered agents, and\n2. each form of legal process sets its own requirements.\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst, the term \"minor\" encompasses extremes: a 1 year old doesn't have the capacity to receive and forward legal process to the intended party, but a 16 year old might. Some jurisdictions recognize a \"suitable age and discretion\" rule, though it hasn't been extended to the context of registered agents. *See, e.g.*, [Fed. R. of Civ. Proc. 4(e)(2\\)(B)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_4). Massachusetts isn't one of those jurisdictions. *See* [Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 4(d)(1\\)](https://www.mass.gov/rules-of-civil-procedure/civil-procedure-rule-4-process).\n\nIn the broader law of agency, minors do have the capacity to serve as \"agents\"\u2014though their ability to affect the legal relations of the principal is limited. For example, the enforceability of minors' contracts is an issue, and minors can't enter into durable powers of attorney or serve as trustees. See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3\\.04\\. The problems associated with appointing a minor as an agent in Massachusetts are longstanding. In *Commonwealth v. O'Leary*, 143 Mass. 95 (1886\\), a mother had her minor daughter enter into a contract of sale for alcohol for the mother's use. While the court recognized the daughter as the mother's agent, it still characterized the transaction as an illegal sale \"to\" a minor.\n\nIn the case of a registered agent, the primary action Massachusetts expects of the agent is the receipt and forwarding of the principal's legal correspondence. Courts have found that this creates a fiduciary duty on the registered agent's part. *See* *Int'l Envtl. Mgmt. v. United Corporate Servs.*, [858 F.3d 1121](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170526144) (8th Cir. 2017\\). This makes sense because the service of process satisfies constitutional requirements embodied in the Due Process clause. So in predicting whether a court would extend the \"suitable age and discretion\" rule to registered agents (or even needs to), it would likely consider that the agent has fiduciary duties, albeit more limited than those of a typical trustee.\n\nSecond, [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B \u00a7 49](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156B/Section49) governs corporations and requires that the agent be capable of receiving \"all lawful processes in any action or proceeding\". When the agent is an individual (as opposed to a company), that person must be a resident of Massachusetts and have a \"business address in the commonwealth\". [Mass. Gen. Laws 156C \u00a7 5](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156C/Section5) governs the process for LLCs, and [Mass Gen. Laws 156D \u00a7 15\\.07](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156D/Section15.07) details it for non\\-Massachusetts companies.\n\nMassachusetts's statutes don't expressly prohibit minors from serving as registered agents, but the agent must have the capacity to receive all forms of lawful process. Thus if some lawful process requires delivery to an adult, the minor wouldn't be capable of receiving it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup in Massachusetts wants to appoint 17-year-old prodigy Alex as their registered agent to save costs. The company's lawyer advises against this decision. Which of the following best explains the lawyer's concerns?\n\nA) Massachusetts law explicitly prohibits minors from serving as registered agents\nB) Alex lacks the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts on behalf of the company\nC) The fiduciary duties of a registered agent may conflict with legal protections for minors\nD) Alex cannot meet the requirement of having a business address in Massachusetts\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The lawyer's concerns stem from the complex interplay of legal concepts surrounding registered agents and minors' legal status. While Massachusetts law doesn't explicitly prohibit minors from serving as registered agents, there are several issues that make it problematic:\n\n1. Fiduciary duties: Registered agents have fiduciary duties, as noted in the case of Int'l Envtl. Mgmt. v. United Corporate Servs. These duties may conflict with the legal protections typically afforded to minors.\n\n2. Capacity to receive all forms of legal process: The law requires registered agents to be capable of receiving \"all lawful processes in any action or proceeding.\" Some forms of legal process may require delivery to an adult, which a minor couldn't fulfill.\n\n3. Due Process considerations: The role of a registered agent is tied to satisfying constitutional Due Process requirements, which adds weight to the importance of the agent's capacity.\n\n4. Ambiguity in the law: The term \"minor\" is broad and hasn't been clearly interpreted in the context of registered agents, creating legal uncertainty.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Massachusetts law doesn't explicitly prohibit minors from being registered agents. Option B is partially true but oversimplified; while minors' contracts can be problematic, this isn't the primary issue for registered agents. Option D is incorrect because a 17-year-old could theoretically have a business address.\n\nOption C best captures the nuanced legal concerns, highlighting the potential conflict between the fiduciary responsibilities of a registered agent and the legal protections typically afforded to minors.

If the text is written by the textbook author and the textbook is still in copyright, then it is protected, and it would be infringement to post either the original text or a translation. [17 USC 102(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102) states the basic rule regarding what is protected: \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\", and [17 USC 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) states that the copyright owner has the sole right to authorize derivative works such as translations. Hyper\\-technically, you kinda violate the law when you do homework, which is an absurdity that just struck me. No language textbook author bothers to grant permission for students to do translation exercises. A reasonable person would assume that permission to translate is implicit in the fact of publishing a language textbook. Copyright is not about \"attribution\", it is about the property rights of authors: permission is required from the author.\n\nIf you opt to go ahead and get sued, one approach to defending yourself against a suit would be to plead [fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/7683/4501), so read that analysis. Applied to your case, a fair use analysis is IMO highly unlikely to succeed. In freely distributing the original texts, you would be undercutting a major portion of the market value of the textbook. In addition, in distributing translations (free answers), you would be seriously undermining the pedagogical utility of the exercises. Copying a short passage like *\u1f25\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u039a\u03c5\u0342\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u025b\u03c5\u0301\u1fc3* (blatantly lifted from Chase \\& Phillips) for ullustrative purposes would not be substantial copying, but an entire text would be probably found to be too much. The fact that you're planning on distributing the material for free (in a blog) would not help much, though selling the material would make it even worse.

Both excerpts read \"*No corporation \\[or] guarantor of an obligation of a corporation*\" rather than \"*no person*\". The prohibition restrains the corporation and its guarantor, not the \"*person dealing with the corporation or \\[the] person who who acquired rights from the corporation*\".\n\n> Why is it talking about people \"dealing with the corporation\" rather than just \"the corporation itself\"?\n\nThe purpose of this question is unclear, but maybe the previous clarification renders this one moot.\n\n> What if the \"by\\-laws\" and \"unanimous member agreement\" are in contradiction with each other as is the case I described at the beginning?\n\nIt depends on how or why the discrepancy hinders or reasonably could hinder the complainant's capacity and/or his rights. That issue is unclear from your description.\n\nIf the departure from by\\-laws does not harm (or implies no potential harm to) the complainant, the departure is immaterial and as such it does not disrupt the legal obligations the non\\-profit organization has. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a court \"*thinks fit*\" to order compliance with an item that seems ritualistic at least in relation to that complaint.\n\nIt is noteworthy, though, that requirement (b)(ii) in and of itself is rather unclear. The terms \"*advanced computing system*\" and \"*from time to time*\" are particularly vague. That vagueness foreseeably complicates the \\[judicial] ascertainment of compliance.\n\nLastly, the fact that the term \"*by\\-laws*\" is not explicitly mentioned in the statutory definition of \"*articles*\" is irrelevant.

At the annual general meeting, the institutional members unanimously approved this slate of Directors. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The organization is in clear violation of its by-laws, and any member can immediately seek court intervention to rectify the board composition.\n\nB) The unanimous approval at the annual general meeting supersedes the by-law requirement, making the current board composition legally valid.\n\nC) The organization may be at risk, but cannot assert its own non-compliance with by-laws against third parties dealing with the corporation.\n\nD) The vagueness of terms like \"advanced computing system\" in the by-law renders it unenforceable, allowing the current board composition to stand.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced legal situation described in the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, specifically section 19(1)(a). While the organization appears to be in violation of its own by-laws regarding board composition, the Act states that \"No corporation... may assert against a person dealing with the corporation... that the articles, the by-laws or any unanimous member agreement has not been complied with.\" This means that while the organization may indeed be at risk of non-compliance, it cannot use its own failure to comply with by-laws as a defense against third parties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while members might seek court intervention under section 259 of the Act, it's not an immediate or guaranteed solution. Option B is incorrect because unanimous approval doesn't automatically override by-laws. Option D touches on a real issue of vagueness in the by-law language, but doesn't fully capture the legal implications of the situation.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the interplay between organizational by-laws, statutory law, and real-world governance practices, requiring integration of multiple concepts and application to a specific scenario."}, "82": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25609/suing-beyond-expenses-in-california", "docs_id": 25609, "title": "Suing Beyond Expenses in California", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In California, I loaned my $6000 car to someone who paid a $500 deposit. If he returned it today, according to the agreement, he would owe $1500 (so he would need to pay $800 more since he once made a $200 payment, albeit late). But, he now refuses to pay more and refuses to return the car. I am pressing criminal charges, but want to focus here on just my potential in a civil suit. Also, I understand that I am unlikely to ever get paid even if I win the civil suit, but let's not discuss that.\n\nThen, what is the most I can reasonably sue for? My guess is that I can sue for the $6000 car (minus whatever value I can sell it for if I get it back) plus the $800 debt plus my court\\-related costs (maybe $500\\). Does California civil court have any punitive/double/treble recovery precedent? Is there a common practice in California civil courts which would allow me to sue beyond my true expenses?\n\nHe makes arrangements to pay or return the car but reneges on these actions. I could claim that he has caused me 40 extra hours of work to manage this but I don't believe I can expense my own time for a suit, so hoping instead for a more official California civil court punitive rule.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. You can repossess the car, with or without a court order to do so, so long as it is accomplished without a breach of the peace. If the car is never returned, you have $6,000 of damages for conversion of the car and probably punitive damages for theft of the car.\n2. You can sue for the money damages you experienced from breach of contract (which looks like $800\\), you would also get court costs if you prevailed ($500 per your question) but not attorneys' fees unless you had a contract that provided for them (you should have had an agreement in writing that said you get your attorneys' fees if you have to collect or take legal action to get the car back). You are correct that you can't sue for your own time (at least as a non\\-lawyer).\n3. You can add damages for the lost rental value of the car during the time that it was detained and the out of pocket costs you incurred repossessing the car, and for any damages to the car (e.g. cost of getting it cleaned, paint fixes from his actions, etc.) Find market quotations from low end car rental places as proof, or use the contract rate for the planned duration of the loan (probably better described as a short term lease).\n4. I am surprised that the prosecutor would pursue this criminally, because that would be unusual. If you wait for a conviction, the civil suit would be much cheaper and easier because the conviction proves liability (although not damages) in the civil suit. There also might be a restitution award in a criminal suit and if there was that wouldn't be dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n5. Intentional breach of contract is not fraud and hence usually doesn't give rise to punitive damages (which would be a thousand or two dollars at more) unless you could should an intent not to perform when the contract was entered into, and the fact that at least one payment of $200 was made really undermines that theory. But, detaining the car after the lease period expires could be a form of conversion or theft. In Colorado, we have a civil theft statute that allows for treble damages and attorneys' fees if you prevail, but I'm not sure that California has a comparable law, but some sort of exemplary damages are probably available if he stole the car in the end and never returned it.\n6. Don't worry too much about collection. Judgments remain valid for a long time. Even if he doesn't have money now, he may someday get a job from which you can garnish his wages, or a bank account that you can garnish, or buy real estate that can be subjected to a judgment lien, if he doesn't file for bankruptcy first (which lots of people don't). You can also refer the judgment to a collection agency which screws up his credit.\n\n> I'm more upset about this guy's lack of respect for agreements and\n>  people than about not being paid. Most people who realize they can't\n>  afford a car would be respectful and simply return the car, but this\n>  guy has no shame and has repeatedly wasted my time (and a friend's\n>  time) with his deception.

You sound like a one time occasional participant in this market, so this doesn't apply to you.\n\nInstead, your goal should be to optimize your monetary recovery from this one transaction and then to move on.

In this case this means I make the monthly payments on these cars and I also pay for the car insurance for both of them.\n\nBoth of my cars are insured from the same company. On the insurance, she is listed as a driver for the car that she has with her in Georgia, and that car is also listed as garaged in Georgia.\n\nCan the car insurance company legally deny insuring the vehicle she is driving in this kind of case?\n\n**Update:** The reason for my question is that the car was in an accident where parts of the body (side front bumper, and side rear panel) got scratched. This happened when the car was parked outside a shopping center (someone tried to squeeze into a parking space next to it), meaning that she was not driving the car, or even inside it, at the time. A police report was made about this incident but it is not yet known if the driver of that other car had insurance, as they had left the scene after bumping into this car (some passerby got the tag\\# of that other car and gave it to my sister\\-in\\-law).\n\nWhen we asked the insurance company about this, we eventually received the reply that the insurance company \"is not going to insure the \\[car] that is garaged in Georgia, they are going to issue legal notice to cancel the insurance since \\[my sister\\-in\\-law's] residence is there.\"\n\nThe insurance policy has listed her as the driver on the car garaged in Georgia for 3 years. So if there was an issue with this setup, I would have thought that we had been informed about it.\n\nI am not particularly concerned about whether they are willing to cover the damage, as it is not major and the insurance in any case has a $500 deductible. The concern and question I have is about the \"legal notice\" from the insurance company, because that implies that this setup has been somehow illegal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The insurer can absolutely deny paying any claims if they discover that you misrepresented something in obtaining your policy, or you failed to notify them of relevant changes in accordance with the policy's terms.\n\nIn fact, even changing the \"garage\" location *within a state* can affect your premium.\n\nYou should call your insurer and provide them an honest and complete description of the regular use of the car. It is up to their underwriters whether they will continue to provide insurance for that use, and whether they will change your premium accordingly.\n\n**Update** regarding the question update: The insurer could *not* legally deny a claim for any insured damage prior to notice of cancellation, so long as there was no misrepresentation and you had paid your premiums.\n\nAs to when an insurer can legally cancel a policy: This is first a contractual question, and their policy should include terms and conditions that address this. (E.g., they might reserve the right in the policy to cancel it for *any reason at any time*, in which case it's almost certainly legal.) Note that *all policy terms* must be approved by a state's insurance commission. I happen to remember that Massachusetts has some very unusual terms and restrictions for car insurance, so I wouldn't be surprised if the Massachusetts entity discovered that their policy on the out\\-of\\-state car was non\\-compliant and they *had* to cancel it.\n\nThe great thing about the tight regulation of auto insurance is that if a claim on a policy is denied, or if a policy is improperly cancelled, then you can file a complaint with the state regulator, and those tend to get resolved quickly and in the insured's favor. Therefore, you should simply review your policy terms and the cancellation notice.

The insurer can deny claims if there was misrepresentation, but they can't necessarily do so retroactively for all claims if premiums were paid and there was no fraud.\n\nOption C oversimplifies the situation by focusing solely on state regulations, ignoring the importance of the policy terms and the accuracy of provided information.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, consider real-world implications, and understand the complex interplay between contract terms, legal regulations, and insurance practices."}, "88": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41014/how-can-one-document-a-conversation", "docs_id": 41014, "title": "How can one document a conversation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When someone gets themselves into a situation where legal action is likely imminent, common legal advice is to document as much as possible.

However, the judge has the power to reject the agreement altogether.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the judge cannot unilaterally sentence the defendant to a longer term if a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement is in place. This would violate the terms of the plea agreement.\n\nOption B is incorrect for the same reason. Even if the judge believes the sentence is too lenient, they cannot accept the plea deal and then impose a longer sentence. This would go against the binding nature of a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the judge doesn't have the authority to require the prosecution to modify the recommended sentence in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. The agreement is between the prosecution and the defense, and the judge's role is to either accept or reject it.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. If the judge believes the agreed-upon sentence is too lenient, their appropriate course of action is to reject the plea deal entirely.

Real estate law, including condo law, is different in every state. To find out if you have a case, you need to talk to a lawyer who knows Georgia real estate law. Do not rely on anonymous wise\\-guys on the internet. And for sure do not rely on the selling agent. \n\n**It looks like you are out of luck on condo law:** \n\nIn many states, owners selling condos have to give buyers a \"resale certificate,\" a packet of detailed information about the HOA. That packet usually includes a copy of the by\\-laws. If they take too long getting the certificate to you, you get to reconsider your offer. Unfortunately, it looks like Georgia does not require the seller to give you a resale certificate. You should definitely double check, but it seems unlikely you will be able to use Georgia condo law to get your money back. \n\n**You might have other legal recourse**\n\nDespite the disclaimers, [you might have a case against the broker, listing/selling agent or the MLS](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/California-high-court-decision-favors-real-estate-10629057.php). To find out if you do, you can't just look at the general principles of contract law, or read the Georgia statutes or the contracts. In many states, buyers have rights created by court decisions interpreting the statutes and contracts. The only way to find out if Georgia courts have interpreted Georgia laws to give Georgia buyers extra rights, is to talk to a Georgia real estate lawyer who deals with these sorts of issues. \n\n**A word to the wise: Nobody wants to go to court**\n\nRemember: A good lawyer knows the law; a great lawyer knows how to avoid using it. Nobody wants to go to court or get a bad Yelp review. It's a hassle, it's messy and it might cost money and reputation. When you look for a lawyer, look for one who knows how to settle these disputes to everyone's benefit without going to court. \n\n**Dale is right: Next time, read the contracts and pay attention to the deadlines!**\n\nPS Who knows what your by\\-laws mean for Airbnb?

The selling agent claims no responsibility due to a contract clause stating buyers haven't relied on broker representations outside the agreement. Which of the following best describes the buyer's most strategic legal recourse?\n\nA) File a small claims court case against the selling agent for the deposit and appraisal fee\nB) Pursue action against the HOA for not providing bylaws within the discovery window\nC) Consult a local real estate attorney to explore potential rights under state-specific case law\nD) Attempt to void the contract based on the MLS description's inaccuracy\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, is the most strategic approach because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the complexity of real estate law varying by state, as mentioned in the documentation: \"Real estate law, including condo law, is different in every state.\"\n\n2. It recognizes that despite contract disclaimers, there might be additional legal recourse based on court decisions interpreting statutes and contracts, as indicated by: \"In many states, buyers have rights created by court decisions interpreting the statutes and contracts.\"\n\n3. It avoids making assumptions about the strength of the case without expert knowledge of local laws, adhering to the advice: \"To find out if you have a case, you need to talk to a lawyer who knows Georgia real estate law.\"\n\n4. It potentially addresses both the misrepresentation issue and the delayed bylaw provision, looking at the broader legal context rather than focusing on a single aspect.\n\nOption A is less strategic as it prematurely pursues legal action without exploring all options. Option B is incorrect as the documentation suggests Georgia may not require timely provision of HOA bylaws. Option D oversimplifies the situation, ignoring the contract clause and potential complexities in state law.

Most examples given in military manuals, or which have been the object of condemnations, have been cases where persons were actually taken to military objectives in order to shield those objectives from attacks.\n\nThere have recently been claims that the opposite can constitute a war crime, where the placing of weapons within cities has been interpreted as breech of this law. Examples include [this page](https://en.news-front.info/2022/02/26/ukraines-tactic-is-to-inflict-maximum-damage-on-the-population-in-order-to-blame-it-on-russia/) blaming Ukrainian forces for putting military equipment within residential areas of Kharkiv and [this page](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2021/06/23/hold-hamas-accountable-for-human-shields-use-during-the-may-2021-gaza-war/) blaming Hamas for operating in built\\-up residential areas.\n\nUkraine:\n\n> Ukrainian Armed Forces place 122mm D\\-30 howitzers in residential areas\n\n> Soldiers from the 92nd brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces hiding behind the backs of Kharkiv civilians\n\nGaza:\n\n> Palestinian fighters are clearly operating in built\\-up residential areas and have positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and command and control infrastructure in close proximity to schools, mosques and homes.\n\nObviously these conflicts are vastly different, but they share features.
