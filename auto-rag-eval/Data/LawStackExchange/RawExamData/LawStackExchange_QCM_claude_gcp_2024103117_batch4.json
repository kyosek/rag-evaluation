The theft would still be considered shoplifting, regardless of the album's title. The album's provocative title does not provide any legal justification for theft. The physical item belongs to the retailer, not the band or label, and removing it from the store without payment constitutes shoplifting, a form of larceny. \n\nOption A is incorrect because entrapment only applies when law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime they wouldn't otherwise commit. The album title is not related to law enforcement activities.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the band or label cannot be held liable for the actions of individuals who might misinterpret the album title as permission to steal.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the retailer maintains full legal ownership of the item and has every right to pursue legal action against shoplifters, regardless of any perceived \"implicit permission\" from the album title."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16260/is-it-legal-to-read-and-edit-on-the-fly-javascript-code-with-a-browser", "docs_id": 16260, "title": "Is it legal to read and edit on the fly JavaScript code with a browser?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I go on a website, can I read the source code of the JavaScript files?\n\nEven if the code is obfuscated?

That is why such tools exist; and by processing code client\\-side, the authors submit to that possibility. If there is something which a website wishes to make absolutely sure you won't mess with, they will process this information server\\-side, as per \u2013 B\u00e1lint's comment.\n\nNow as you pointed out, in the example you brought up, the code is compressed but not obfuscated to make it harder for a human to read. This is usually the norm. Because things that obfuscate the code, they make it take longer for a human to figure out how to manipulate it; however, they don't actually prevent a human from doing it; also, once a human has figured it out, he can explain it to others without legal repercussions \\-\\- whether it is to correct a bug, or to cheat. And any author who makes his code available as JavaScript, has to bear full acknowledgement of the fact that his code can be manipulated.\n\nNow, there is one exception. You say:\n\n> The authors of the website explicitely said that they does not want that other people read and modify 'on the fly' their code.\n\nIf this is something that you had to click \"I agree\" to, then it is legally binding. Therefore, if you must check to box agreeing not to modify the JavaScript code *before* you can download it, then it is protected by law. Otherwise, the author will have to prove that you were aware of his requirements, before he can legally prosecute you. (For example, if he can find a log that shows you read the ToS, and he can reasonably prove that it was you, e.g. by IP address, then he can prosecute you; however, in practice, such things are usually very hard to prove.)

This is why tools for such modifications exist. However, if a user explicitly agrees not to modify the code (e.g., by clicking \"I agree\" to terms of service), then it becomes legally binding and potentially illegal to modify.

That would allow embedding Like buttons on any page at will and Facebook could only track the users that have already given consent for Facebook. Technically facebook would have been able to run their own JavaScript code on the host page so they could have implemented the consent query on any page if they really wanted to set cookies only after getting consent.\n\nThis would also immediately solve questions such as [Who's liable for GDPR compliance when embedding/hosting a self\\-contained 3rd\\-party website/service?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/50337/34270) and [Who needs to implement Cookie Consent for embedded content?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/55925/34270) because in both cases the host that wants to set non\\-necessary cookies would need to independantly verify they already have been given consent for those cookies. As GDPR doesn't define how such content must be acquired, there could be an UI on the host domain document and then the acquired consent must be explicitly transferred to 3rd party. In practice, the transfer cannot be just \"it's okay\" but \"user has given consent for trackingdomain.com via domain example.com at yyyy\\-mm\\-dd with log id abc123ef\" because GDPR requires that the user must be able to retract the consent later and entity doing the processing must be able to specify the origin for the consent.\n\nIs the current ruling just caused by the interpretation that embedding any content via URL is considered *implicit* consent for the whole domain?\n\nIn practice, this would practically prevent 3rd party cookies for any services the user hasn't expicitly visited previously.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The rulings you refer to are not primarily about cookies or consent. They are about pages who use Facebook services, and claim that Facebook would be the sole data controller. As the ECJ has ruled, this is not the case: causing or contributing to Facebook's processing of personal data can establish a joint controller role. Thus, the admin of a Facebook page ends up being co\\-responsible for the correct use of cookies on that page, and the embedder of a Facebook like button ends up being co\\-responsible for sending visitor data (such as IP addresses) to Facebook.\n\nYou are correct that joint controller situations are messy and potentially difficult to navigate. But the \u201cjoint controller\u201d concept reflects the reality of the legal situation that more than one person/entity can meet the definition of a \u201ccontroller\u201d for a particular processing activity.\n\nIt is possible to avoid joint controller situations, for example when processing activities are structured suitably, or when one party engages the others as data processors. Of course, it would be contrary to Facebook's interests to act as a data processor because FB wants to use the personal data for their own purposes, not solely for the other controller's purposes.\n\nSome detailed notes:\n\n* The Fashion ID case does not involve the *setting* of cookies, it applies more generally to any personal data a browser might send while making a request.\n* Both of these cases are not about Facebook's responsibilities, but about the responsibilities of data controllers that use Facebook's services. You can't just embed/use third party services and argue that you're not responsible for compliance.\n* GDPR does not require explicit records of consent to be stored. Doing so might even violate the data minimisation principle. The GDPR has the weaker requirement that \u201cthe controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data\u201d (Art 7(1\\)). This could perhaps be demonstrated indirectly, e.g. that it is not possible to trigger the processing activity without giving consent.\n* The controller of a page embedding content does not have influence over the use of cookies by that embedded content and would not typically collect consents for that content.\n* Instead, embedding pages typically collect consent for the *loading* of third party content, e.g. \u201cclick to show content from twitter.com\u201d or a greyed\\-out Facebook icon with a toggle next to it. This page (about the Fashion ID ruling) has a wonderful example with an embedded YouTube video:\n\n> [![a blurred-out placeholder for a YouTube video player embedding, with a consent dialogue up front](https://i.stack.imgur.com/POv4B.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/POv4B.png)\n> \n> \n> Source: [https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/digitale\\-welt/datenschutz/eughurteil\\-likebutton\\-von\\-facebook\\-nur\\-mit\\-info\\-an\\-nutzer\\-12029](https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/digitale-welt/datenschutz/eughurteil-likebutton-von-facebook-nur-mit-info-an-nutzer-12029)\n\nTranslation:\n\n> The video is currently deactivated to prevent unwanted data transfers to Youtube.\n> To activate, please click the link!\n> This will transmit data, but we can't provide information on their type, scope, and purpose.\n> \n> \n> Link: **show video**\n* There is no such thing as implicit consent under the GDPR. Consent must be indicated unambiguously. Art 4(11\\) defines consent as \u201cany freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data\u201d.\n* It is quite likely that, were Facebook to set cookies via embedded Like buttons or to use Like buttons to create profiles of users that are not Facebook members, that Facebook would be acting illegally. The lack of suitable consent would be a concern.

The ECJ rulings established that website owners who embed third-party content, such as Facebook's \"Like\" button, become joint controllers with the third-party service provider. However, their responsibility is not unlimited. It specifically pertains to the collection and transmission of personal data to the third-party service (in this case, Facebook).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it understates the website owner's responsibility.

Wikipedia has a [short list of jurisdictions with notable decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming#Law.2C_regulation_and_taxation) on virtual sales; see the page's references for the official news stories or government documents. Most of the rulings have been positive for virtual\\-goods vendors, though China has banned the sale of *real items* for *virtual currency* (the opposite of your proposed plan) and South Korea has banned the sale of virtual goods for real money outright.\n\nSuch sales incur normal tax responsibilities, just as any other income does. I don't know if any jurisdictions have imposed special legislation that place income limits or special tax rates for income from the sale of virtual goods.\n\n---\n\nIn the case of Steam specifically, the sale of virtual goods is broadly disallowed in Section 2\\.G of the [Steam Subscriber Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/), but narrowly allowed in Section 3\\.D. All virtual Steam goods remain the property of Steam, and you have a license to use them, which includes sale in limited circumstances.\n\nThe prohibition in Section 2\\.G reads:\n\n> G.

Separately, you can also trade *giftable games* (N.B.: game trading does *not* support real money) using Steam's trading system. Applying terms to a game\\-trade (like requiring payment external to Stream's trading system) appears to be disallowed by the broad prohibition in 2\\.G, but it's not very clear. The mechanical transfer of the game from one account to another is allowed, but the fact that it is actually a *sale* in a way that is not explicitly allowed seems to make it against the terms of service.

What judge enabled them?\n\nThe name of the judge authorizing a search warrant or arrest warrant, and the court in which that judge serves, will always appears on the face of the warrant document.\n\nIt is possible to eventually get a copy of a search warrant or arrest warrant, once it has been served, but search warrants and arrest warrants are frequently issued \"under seal\" prior to the point in time at which they are served so that the law enforcement can have the element of surprise in executing those warrants.\n\nSearch warrants are usually served very shortly after they are issued, so there isn't much of a gap period for them to be under seal. Arrest warrants are frequently made public and widely publicized to law enforcement officers in cases that don't have an organized crime component or co\\-conspirators who have not yet been arrested, particularly if law enforcement doesn't know where to find the person named in the warrant.\n\nSearch warrants and arrest warrants which aren't under seal may be obtained by any member of the public from the clerk of the court that issued the warrant.\n\nOnce a search warrant or arrest warrant has been executed, the person searched or arrested and their lawyers are always entitled to a copy of it, and to a copy of the \"return\" of the warrant to the court, and to a copy of the police report, if any, prepared regarding the execution of the warrant. The \"return\" of the warrant to the court and the police report, if any, will generally disclose at least some of the officers who were involved in executing the warrant.\n\nSometimes a search warrant is handed to the person searched. Criminal case warrants and related documents are sometimes made available by law enforcement records departments, sometimes by the clerk of the relevant court, and sometimes by the prosecutor's office as part of \"discovery\" in a criminal case. Police reports are sometimes made available by the law enforcement records departments and sometimes by the prosecutor's office as part of \"discovery\" in a criminal case.\n\nBut, sometimes these documents remain sealed as to the general public if a criminal investigation is ongoing so that co\\-conspirators will not be tipped off and so that potential witnesses will not receive information not made available to the general public (allowing law enforcement to distinguish between reliable witnesses who know non\\-public factors and people just making things up based upon news reports) and so that juries will not be tainted by information which may not be admissible at trial.\n\nEventually, not later than after a jury has heard the case and all witnesses have testified at trial, the general public has a right to that information.\n\nOfficers Providing Probable Cause Affidavits\n============================================\n\nAnother kind of information that someone would often like to have regarding a search warrant is to know who supplied the probable cause statement for the warrant. Usually, there will be a named law enforcement officer's affidavit either attached to the warrant or including as part of that form, or filed under the same court case number even if it does not accompany the warrant itself.\n\nBut, while the law enforcement officer preparing the probable cause affidavit or declaration will be named, the law enforcement officer will not infrequently rely in part on unnamed anonymous informants who are described in more or less detail in the probable cause affidavit. The identity of the anonymous informant is not revealed unless the prosecution in the case chooses to do so. Instead, the practice of relying on anonymous informants is regulated with rules of law regarding when information from an anonymous informant can be sufficient, with or without other kinds of corroborating information, to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant or arrest warrant.\n\nIf after the search has been conducted, a court determines that the warrant was not supported by probable cause, this sometimes constitutes grounds to suppress the evidence obtained with the search warrant.\n\nIf a court later determines that an arrest warrant was not supported by probable cause, this could provide a basis for the suppression of evidence obtained incident to the arrest, for the release of the criminal defendant if no later evidence has established probable cause after the arrest from sources not tainted by the arrest without probable cause, or for a civil lawsuit for wrongful arrest brought by the person arrested.\n\nSo, failing to identify officers who are sources of information for an arrest warrant or search warrant is something only done if it serves some worthwhile purpose for law enforcement, because they don't want to have their evidence needlessly suppressed.\n\nAlso, while judges usually trust law enforcement officers and issue warrants rather freely based upon their statements, if a particular officer develops a pattern of seeking warrants based upon unreliable anonymous sources in cases that turn out to be baseless, eventually judges may start to view probable cause affidavits from the officers who do that with greater skepticism than probable cause affidavits from other law enforcement officers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A judge has issued a search warrant for a suspect's residence.

Comments and explanations in answers talked about what it means to have a \"legitimate educational interest\" in a student's grades. This question posed to law.StackExchange is about **what constitutes \"legitimate educational interest\"?**\n\n> Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.31\\):\n> \n> \n> * School officials with legitimate educational interest;\n\nThe majority opinion on Academia seems to be that a teacher wanting to know their student's pervious grades in a different class \\- a class which was a prerequisite for the current class \\- is a legitimate educational interest. The only reason provided as for why is that the teacher can use it to deny access to the class to some students or to adjust the class speed and/or content to better accommodate the students' level of understanding.\n\nI suggested that teachers can get this information in other, better ways, and have no true need or interest in previous grades. For example, when I want to get a feel for the level of the class up front, I have given an anonymous quiz on the first day of class. Since it's anonymous, it is obviously not graded. Others still insist that teachers in this situation have a legitimate educational interest in the student grades.\n\nOne person went so far as to suggest that FERPA only denies the teacher in cases of idle curiosity. That seems wholly ineffective to me at that point, as any teacher could always get out of a reprimand by claiming \"I heard this student was concerned about their standing and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help.\" You cannot easily prove that a teacher had only idle curiosity.\n\nSo the question is, in a nutshell: **Legally, what has FERPA's \"legitimate educational interest\" been interpreted as meaning, strictly?** If this has ever been tested in court for any grey areas like this (ie: not cases of negligence or idle curiosity), that would be great.\n\nMy personal interest in this is to get a better idea of when FERPA denies access to student records and when it does not. I am concerned, as the interpretation of some people of \"legitimate educational interest\" makes me wonder if FERPA does not really protect our privacy in practice, since negligence and idle curiosity should already have been grounds for workplace discipline for school officials in any competent school.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exact text of [34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.31](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.31) makes it clear that the determination of who has \"legitimate educational interest\" is left up to each educational institution to establish:\n\n> (a) An educational agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record of a student without the consent required by \u00a7 99\\.30 if the disclosure meets one or more of the following conditions:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\n> \n> \n> (i)\n> \n> \n> (A) The disclosure is to other school officials, including teachers, within the agency or institution **whom the agency or institution has determined to have legitimate educational interests.**\n\nMoreover, [34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.7) requires each institution to notify students of their particular definition of \"legitimate educational interest\":\n\n> (a)\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Each educational agency or institution shall annually notify parents of students currently in attendance, or eligible students currently in attendance, of their rights under the Act and this part.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **The notice must include all of the following:**\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (iii) If the educational agency or institution has a policy of disclosing education records under \u00a7 99\\.31(a)(1\\), **a specification of criteria for determining** who constitutes a school official and **what constitutes a legitimate educational interest.**\n\n(bolding mine)\n\nAs far as whether this has ever been tested at law, I'm not sure. There are a few cases mentioned in [this legal review article from 2003,](http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/nclr/vol81/iss3/12/) though the author calls the existing case law at the time \"meager\":\n\n> Not surprisingly, schools' interpretations of the legitimate educational interests exception have been at issue in some FERPA controversies. In *Krebs v. Rutgers*, for example, a university attempted to characterize its disclosure of students' Social Security numbers to campus post office personnel as a \"legitimate educational interest.\" The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey enjoined the practice, noting that \"the regulations do not suggest, and it is far from clear, that distribution of social security numbers ... serves a 'legitimate educational interest.' \" In contrast, in *Achman v. Chicago Lakes Independent School District No. 2144*, a Minnesota federal district court held that the supervisor of the school's detention room had a legitimate educational interest in accessing the disciplinary records of a student she monitored. In another FERPA case from 1987, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals found that a school official who requested students' education records to defend against her pending criminal charges did not have a legitimate educational interest in the records.\" Finally, in another instance that some commentators have deemed \"an egregious example of when disclosure serves no legitimate educational interest,\" a substitute teacher told her class that a student had HIV and classmates should not share lip balm with him.\n\nEarlier in the article, the author makes basically the same point you make in your question:\n\n> Thus, if a professor, campus employer, or other school official can contrive a colorable \"legitimate educational interest\" for accessing a student's education records, the official may obtain the data without the\n> student's knowledge or consent. ...

I understand that this isn't entirely reliable in European civil law. The preferred alternative is to license it to the public. However, you have to decide how \"free\" you want the work to be made. The normal state of affairs, where you do nothing and just rely on copyright law, is that you have the sole right to allow copies to be made and derivative works to be created. Thus if someone were to make a derivative work based on your composition, they would need your permission: but then they would have the right what they created (such as a translation). If you just abandon your property right to the work, you impose no obligation on others, and a person can freely create a translation (which is now *their* property). If you execute the right public license, you can allow people to use your work as long as they include that license in their versions.\n\nA fairly common public licensing scheme is the [Creative Commons licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license).

For this defence, it doesn't matter whether that was actually a crime, just whether the defendants honestly held the belief that it was, and that they were using what they believed to be reasonable force to prevent the crime. They also invoked a specific lawful excuse mentioned in [the relevant Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5), that each of them\n\n> believed that the person or persons whom he believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction of or damage to the property in question had so consented, or would have so consented to it if he or they had known of the destruction or damage and its circumstances.\n\nThe argument was that they honestly believed that the statue belonged to the people of Bristol as a collective, and that the people of Bristol would generally be in favour of their actions.\n\nFinally, the defence made a human rights claim on the basis of free expression, saying that their conviction would be a disproportionate interference with those rights. This is about weighing up the public interest in property rights and public safety on the one hand, and the defendants' right to act in accordance with their conscience on a matter important to them.\n\nThe judge allowed all these defences to be made, and it was the prosecution's job to make the jury sure that the elements of the offence were proved, despite whatever the defence made out.

The words are close synonyms. A threat, however, is usually used only in connection with an action that has some sort of human (or at least, AI) agency, while a warning often made to alert someone to a mere natural consequence of an action with no human agency (e.g. a warning that an object is hot and could burn you if you touch it).\n\nBut, the term \"warning\", when used in connection with an action that involves human agency, is usually used when the action threatened would be lawful when taken (and often refers to a threat from a third\\-party rather than the person giving the warning), while the term \"threat\" is usually used when the action threatened would be unlawful when taken, or if the action, while lawful, is threatened for an improper purposes that amounts to blackmail (e.g. a threat to release legally taken photos showing that someone is having an affair if money is not paid). Also, a threat is generally made by the person who would take the action (or their agent), rather than a disinterested third\\-party.\n\nIncidentally, a threat to bring a lawsuit, since a proper purposes of a lawsuit is to secure money from someone, is not improper to connect to a demand to pay money.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A property owner posts a sign that reads \"Trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" Which of the following statements best characterizes this sign and its legal implications?\n\nA) This is an illegal threat and the property owner could be held liable for intimidation.\nB) This is a lawful warning that informs potential trespassers of legal consequences.\nC) This sign has no legal standing and cannot be used as evidence in court.\nD) This is considered a threat because it implies physical harm to trespassers.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The sign \"Trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\" is best characterized as a lawful warning.

This aligns with the explanation in the documentation that a \"warning\" typically refers to lawful actions, often involving third-party intervention (in this case, law enforcement and the legal system).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sign does not constitute an illegal threat.

Some notable examples:\n\n* [Infinion acquires International Rectifier](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2015/INFXX201501-020.html). Both companies specialized in advanced MOSFET circuits with barely any other competitors existing in the whole world. They now have close to monopoly on these kind of circuits. You find these circuits in every modern car.\n* [Microchip acquires Atmel](http://www.microchip.com/announcements/microchip-technology-inc-acquires-atmel). Both companies were direct and fierce competitors in the market of cheap, small microcontrollers. They were the only two companies in the world that profiled themselves as having beginner\\-friendly, easy to use microcontrollers and so they have been competing over the very same kind of customers for the past 30 years or so. There is barely any competition left at all on that market now.\n* [NXP acquires Freescale](http://investors.nxp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=209114&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2120581). The companies had many overlaps and were competitors in many areas, particularly in microcontrollers and automotive electronics. These two companies branched out from Phillips and Motorola respectively, roughly at the same time, some 15 years ago. Since then they had the same owners. NXP now got a different owner Qualcomm, at the same time as the merger. Qualcomm being another of these huge companies, but with a focus on telecom electronics, where they in turn have close to monopoly. So essentially this is 3 companies merging into 1\\.\n\nThere are many more examples. ON Semi acquires Fairchild, Analog Devices acquires Linear Technology and so on. All in the past 1\\-2 years. It is the same story over and over, two huge multi\\-national companies that are direct competitors, with little or no other competition, merge into one. Imagine Microsoft and Google merging and you get the idea. \n\nThe nature of their products \\- advanced electronic components \\- is such that barely anyone can start up a competing company, as they would need to do massive investments in R\\&D, head\\-hunt all staff from the existing companies and possibly also make massive investments in production lines. Because of this steep threshold to enter the market, there has traditionally only been around 20 companies like this in the world, making 99% of the world's advanced electronic components. \n\nI take it that these mergers must have been approved by authorities in USA and Europe etc. Are there no laws regulating this? If there are, how do these companies manage to repeatedly dodge such laws world\\-wide? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no laws directly regulating merger of two companies. Instead, there are laws against \"monopolizing\" (and similar expressions). In the US, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act and the FTC Act providing the legal underpinning for the Department of Justice to prosecute a merger, or for a judge to prohibit a merger. The typical logical flow is that it is illegal to unfairly reduce competition, which might mean lowering prices when you have a substantial share of the market, privately agreeing on technical innovations with a competitor, or simply gaining a substantial share of the market via a merger.\n\n[Section 7](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/mergers) of the Clayton Act (also Sect 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, Sect. 5 of the FTC Act) forbid a merger or acquisition when the effect would be \"substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\". The US government has issued [guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/mergers/100819hmg.pdf) that gives ballpark suggestions about that they would be looking for in deciding is a merger is forbidden. The [Hart\u2013Scott\u2013Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act) provides the legal framework for federal review where the government approves vs. blocks an acquisition action (you have to file paperwork so they know that you intend a potential violation of anti\\-trust law).

The pursuit is seen as a continuation of the original crime and allows for immediate action to apprehend the suspect.

According to NC lien law, there is no minimum threshold for filing a claim. A subcontractor initially has a \"lien upon funds\" owed to the contractor they dealt with (44A-18(a)). However, they don't automatically have a lien on the property itself. To potentially file a claim of lien on the real property, additional steps are required as outlined in 44A-20(d). This involves the concept of the property owner becoming an \"obligor\" and the subcontractor potentially being entitled to a claim of lien on the real property to the extent of the owner's personal liability. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no $500 minimum threshold in NC lien law. \nOption B is incorrect because subcontractors don't have an automatic right to file a mechanic's lien directly on the property; they must follow specific procedures.\nOption D is incorrect because subcontractors don't need a direct contract with the property owner to have lien rights; their rights stem from their contract with the general contractor."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66567/should-you-share-credit-card-details-with-online-websites", "docs_id": 66567, "title": "Should you share Credit Card details with online websites?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This comes from me casually entering my bank details on every next website.\n\nThis includes Canadian tire, Home Depot, Coinbase, etc. to name a few.

However, the clearance rates for small\\-amount thefts and frauds are fairly low in Canada.\n\nIf it is purely an unintentional software error on the part of merchant, the police will not get involved. It is a civil case, not a matter of criminal law.\n\nYou can file a lawsuit against the merchant and your bank **but this is rarely necessary to resolve this type of issues.**\n\n---\n\nTo alleviate your fears and encourage use of credit cards, payment networks (Visa/Mastercard/Amex/etc.) usually require stronger consumer protection process as a condition for banks and merchants to participate in the network.\n\nYou are also [protected by law](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/resolving-unauthorized-transaction.html) against unauthorized credit card charges.\n\n> Unauthorized credit card transaction\n> \n> \n> When an unauthorized transaction is made with your credit card, your maximum liability, by law, can't be more than $50\\.00\\.

The bank decides on the merits of your claim, and they usually favour the consumer. If the merchant disputes your dispute, a police report might be needed to convince the bank if there is an actual fraud involved.\n\nIf your dispute is successful, for credit cards, it is usually credited back to your account in a few days or within the next billing cycle.\n\n---\n\n> Will judge have enough time to hear my case?\n\nIf your bank and the merchant refuse to refund you, you may bring a claim before a competent court. Usually for 2000$, it would be in a small claims court with simplified procedures. Judges do hear these cases. In many if not most cases, a settlement is made before trial. In some jurisdictions (e.g. [Ontario](https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/What_is_Small_Claims_Court_EN.html)), a mediation\\-like settlement conference, led by a deputy judge, is mandatory before going to trial.

Burlington lost after the jury decided the facts did not support his claim. However, the judge made clear that the actions he alleged would violate Title VII:\n\n> Historically, African Americans' use of the word has been ironic, satirical, or even affectionate. Too often, however, the word has been used by whites as a tool to belittle, oppress, or dehumanize African Americans.

Title VII was enacted to counter social norms that supported widespread discrimination against African Americans. To conclude that the Station may act in accordance with the social norm that it is permissible for African Americans to use the word but not whites would require a determination that this is a \"good\" race\\-based social norm that justifies a departure from the text of Title VII. **Neither the text of Title VII, the legislative history, nor the caselaw permits such a departure from Title VII's command that employers refrain from \"discriminat\\[ing] against any individual...because of such individual's race.\"**\n\n**Added: Why *Bostock* is Irrelevant for Your Friend\u2019s Case:**\n\nAs you say, if we substitute the word \u201crace\u201d for \u201csex\u201d in those sentences from *Bostock,* it seems obvious your friend would have a case under Title VII. This is true, but not *because of* *Bostock.* *Bostock* changed who could claim sex discrimination under Title VII, but nothing else.

What does it mean for an interested to be vested or unvested?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A vested interest is a type of property interest. Black's Law Dictionary provides this definition:\n\n> Accrued; fixed; settled; absolute ; having the character or giving the rights of absolute ownership; not contingent; not subject to be defeated by a condition precedent.\n\nIn other words, a holder's interest in property is vested when he does not need to satisfy any further conditions before claiming his property. This is in contrast to a *contingent* interest which does not become vested until some condition is satisfied.\n\nIn the United States, the most familiar example may be in the retirement context. An employer may offer to match your contributions to your 401(k) plan, with the match vesting after one year.\n\nIn that case, your employer should deposit matching funds into an account in your name as soon as you begin work, but for the first 12 months, you do not actually have the right to access or use those funds. Once a year has passed, though, you are not required to do anything else to take control of the matching funds, so you are said to have a vested interest in those funds \\-\\- you may withdraw them if you please, and the employer no longer has any claim to them.\n\nThe colloquial sense of vested interest is therefore inconsistent with the legal definition. For instance, in reporting on San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin's reelection campaign, Fox News described writer Shaun King as having  [\"a vested interest in the controversial DA,\"](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shaun-king-group-involved-save-san-francisco-da-boudin-recall-election) based on their mutual involvement in a nonprofit organization. But absent the repeal of the Thirteenth Amendment, it is not possible to have a vested interest in another person.\n\nLikewise, reports that [a politician has a vested interest in some policy](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/05/29/i-was-a-texas-gop-legislator-we-couldnt-stand-up-to-gun-violence/), that an [international organization has a vested interest in global economic development](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/russia-ukraine-war-naftogaz-says-opec-is-on-the-wrong-side-of-history.html) or that [a coach has a vested interest in his players' health](https://www.si.com/nba/2022/05/10/monty-williams-safety-suggestion-incident-involving-chris-paul-family) make no sense when applying the legal definition. None of these things are property to begin with, let alone property that these people could actually be said to hold an interest in with no preconditions.\n\nIt is likely that in the vast majority of cases, references to a \"vested interest\" should simply say \"interest.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tech company offers a stock option plan to its employees, with the following conditions:\n1.

How many vested stock options does this employee have?\n\nA) 250 options\nB) 500 options\nC) 750 options\nD) 625 options\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of vested interests in a common employment scenario. Let's break it down:\n\n1. After one year, 25% of 1000 options = 250 options vest.\n2. For the remaining three years, 75% (750 options) vest monthly. This means 750 options / 36 months = 20.83 options vest per month.\n3. The employee has been there for 2 years total, so that's 12 months after the first year.\n4. 12 months * 20.83 options per month = 250 additional options (rounded down).\n5. Total vested options: 250 (from first year) + 250 (from second year) = 500 options\n\nOption A (250) represents only the first year's vesting.\nOption B (500) doesn't account for the monthly vesting in the second year.\nOption C (750) would be correct for 3 years of employment.\nOption D (625) is correct: 250 from the first year, plus 375 from the 18 months of the second year (18 * 20.83, rounded down).\n\nThis question demonstrates the concept of vested interest as a fixed, settled right to property (in this case, stock options) that is no longer contingent on future conditions."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87247/a-penny-for-your-thoughts-can-you-evict-a-tenant-for-paying-rent-in-pennies", "docs_id": 87247, "title": "A Penny for Your Thoughts: Can You Evict a Tenant for Paying Rent in Pennies?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A friend of mine owns an apartment complex in NJ (USA) with multiple rentable units and is having difficulty with a particular tenant who insists on paying his rent in coins (pennies, nickels and dimes \\- but mostly pennies).\n\nI was asked to provide my two cents on the matter.

However, it does allow the landlord to evict if the tenant does not pay the rent within 60 days after it is due.\n\nIf the tenant offers to pay rent in pennies \\& the landlord refuses to accept payment, does that mean that the tenant is in violation of the lease agreement which states that the tenant can be evicted if \"he does not pay rent within 60 days after it is due\"? In other words, while I understand the landlord has a right to reject the rent, the tenant may have fulfilled his obligation as it relates to the terms of the lease as soon as he offered to pay rent?\n\nAdditionally, the tenant could argue that if he pays after the due date it is like a debt which can be paid off in any form. Since rent is due at the beginning of each month, if the tenant pays his rent several days after the rent is due, the payment is now considered payment for a debt which would require the landlord to accept it in any form?\n\nSection 31 U.S.C. 5103, states:\n\n> United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and\n> circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are\n> legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.

The lease agreement doesn't specify a required form of payment but allows for eviction if rent is not paid within 60 days of the due date. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can refuse to accept the coins and immediately evict the tenant for non-payment.\n\nB) The landlord must accept the coins as payment, as they are legal tender for all debts according to federal law.\n\nC) The landlord can refuse the coins, but doing so may prevent them from claiming the tenant failed to pay rent within the 60-day period.\n\nD) The tenant is in violation of the lease agreement by offering coins instead of more conventional forms of payment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement. While the landlord has the right to refuse the coins as payment (since there's no federal mandate for private businesses to accept all forms of currency), doing so could potentially interfere with their ability to evict the tenant for non-payment. The tenant could argue they attempted to pay within the specified timeframe. Options A and D are incorrect because the lease doesn't specify payment forms, so using coins isn't a violation.

Or a gift from my family?\n\nAnother way to ask this is:\nDoes inheritance always happen posthumously?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\n**Inheritance** usually refers only to a post\\-humous transfer, but that usage isn't absolute. There are circumstances when people will use the word in an extremely broad sense that also includes large transfers received during the donor's life in lieu of a true **inheritance** received at death, and it isn't completely incorrect to do so.\n\nFor example, if the stock made up 90% or 100% ownership in a family business, often this might be called an **inheritance** even if it was received while the donors were alive.\n\nStill, if you received the stock while the donors were alive, the preferred term would be to call it a **gift** (even though a **gift** can include gifts made during life and gifts made upon death).\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nIf you receive something because someone died and their will says that you should receive it, the proper legal term for this is a **devise**. You are a **devisee**. A **devise** and **bequest** and **legacy** are close synonyms. Historically, a gift by will of personal property at death was called a **bequest** or a **legacy**, and a gift by will of real property at death was called a **devise**, but the terms are now often used more or less interchangably.\n\nThe original primary meaning of the word **legacy** has become a secondary and technical one in contemporary usage. Now, the term **legacy** is primarily used to refer to the reputation that someone (usually, but not always, someone who has died or at least ceased to participate in a particular field in which they are distinguished) has left behind and is associate with.\n\nIf you receive something because someone died and they didn't have a will, the proper legal term for this is an **inheritance** and you are an **heir.** (In civil law jurisdictions not derived from the laws of England where English is spoken, such as Louisiana, there is also the term a **testamentary inheritance** which means a **devise** or **bequest** in the narrow technical senses of those words.)\n\nHowever, many people (even in legal circumstances) use the term **inheritance** to refer to anything received as a consequence of someone's death even if it was pursuant to something other than **intestate succession** (which is the passing of property at death other than pursuant to a will or a beneficiary designation or joint ownership). And, the term **heir** is likewise sometimes used more generally to refer to anyone receiving an **inheritance** in the broader sense of the word.\n\nThe term **heir** also refers to someone who would be entitled to receive an **intestate succession** at the time if someone died, even in the absence of any actual inheritance or death. This narrow sense of the word is also called an **heir at law**. And the term **heir** is also used in a slightly different sense to refer to someone who would receive the property or feudal title of someone if they died, even if this is not pursuant to **intestate succession**. If one wants to distinguish this sense of this paragraph from other senses of the word **heir**, one can say **heir apparent**.\n\n(There are also non\\-literal senses of the words **inheritance** and **heir** that refer to people who are recipients of intellectual contributions made by someone or some movement. Similarly, there is a technical sense of the word in genetics which means to receive a trait genetically from a parent. More generally, sometimes the semantic focus when one uses the word **inheritance** is on the fact that something is received by someone in a younger generation from an older generation, rather than on the timing of the transfer.)\n\nIf you receive property from a trust or a beneficiary designation you are a **transferee** also called a **beneficiary** and the technical terms for this are **non\\-probate transfer** or **distribution**.\n\nThe term **gift** usually refers to a transfer of property during life, but the strict technical meaning of the word **gift** includes both gifts made during life and gifts given as a consequence of a death. The strict technical term for a gift given during life when the context doesn't make the fact that the donor is alive at the time of the gift is a **lifetime gift** or an **inter vivos gift**.\n\nWhile it is contrary to the technical meaning of the term **inheritance** and also to the broader literal meaning of the term **inheritance**, people sometimes the term **inheritance** very loosely to refer to a large **lifetime gift** made in lieu of an **inheritance** or **devise** or **bequest** at death. But, this usage is not appropriate in technical discussions.\n\nIf you received the stock during the life of the donor, it would be more clear and a better usage to say that it was a **gift**, rather than an **inheritance**, even though it would not be unheard of (and not absolutely incorrect) to call a large gift made during life in lieu of a transfer at death an **inheritance** and even though a **gift**, in theory, could be made after death. In this extremely broad, but literal, sense, **inheritance** refers to a substantial, usually one time, intergenerational transfer of wealth.\n\nAlso, when one talks about **inherited wealth** one is usually talking about all wealth received from lifetime gifts and gifts made upon death by any means, combined, rather than in the narrow sense of wealth received upon someone's death. Similarly, the word **inheritance** can be used in the sense of all of a person's **inherited wealth** rather than with respect to a particular transfer of property, and in this sense **inheritance** refers to all wealth received from lifetime gifts and gifts made upon death by any means, combined, rather than in the narrow sense of wealth received upon someone's death. Indeed, sometimes **inheritance** is used even more broadly still to refer to everything a person owns (i.e. all of their wealth) without regard to its source, although this usage is usually limited to poetic or religious uses of the word.\n\n(While I don't cite to sources here, I have been an estate planning attorney for twenty years and just yesterday taught a course to attorneys and accountants that spent the first 40 minutes or so defining these terms.)\n\nThe [origin of the word inherit](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/inherit) is as follows:\n\n> Middle English enherite \u2018receive as a right\u2019, from Old French\n> enheriter, from late Latin inhereditare \u2018appoint as heir\u2019, from Latin\n> in\\- \u2018in\u2019 \\+ heres, hered\\- \u2018heir\u2019.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the term \"inheritance\" in its legal and historical context?\n\nA) Inheritance refers exclusively to property received after someone's death, never during their lifetime.\n\nB) The word \"inheritance\" originally meant \"to receive as a right\" and has always included both lifetime gifts and posthumous transfers.\n\nC) In modern usage, \"inheritance\" strictly refers to property received through intestate succession, not through a will.\n\nD) While \"inheritance\" typically refers to posthumous transfers, it can sometimes be used more broadly to include substantial lifetime gifts made in lieu of death transfers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While \"inheritance\" is usually associated with posthumous transfers, the text indicates that in some contexts, particularly with large lifetime gifts that effectively replace what would have been received at death, the term can be used more broadly. Options A and C are too restrictive, as the text explains that inheritance is not exclusively limited to posthumous transfers or intestate succession. Option B is incorrect because it overstates the original meaning and current usage of the term.

This tax wasn't indicated anywhere in the pub. Is this legal or not ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a consumer protection point of view, it is not legal:\n\nMy first thought was that there is a similar issue under French tax law as under German tax law when distinguishing the taxation of food sold, and the taxation of food provided under a contract that has elements of a sales contract as well as a service contract (i.e. eating in a restaurant). Where food is sold to take away, it is taxed at 7% value added tax (VAT), while food served in a restaurant is taxed at 19% VAT.\n\nHowever, the additional 15% are not a tax, especially not a higher rate of VAT. As pointed out VAT often has different tax rates for specific goods and services to meet certain policy goals. Some or all food often attracts a lower tax rate to decrease the economic burden on the poorer demographic. \n\nFrance has four VAT tax [rates](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf): \n\n1. super\\-reduced rate: 2,2%\n2. reduced rate: 5,5% or 10%\n3. standard rate: 20%\n\nWhile **foodstuffs** can attract all tax rates, **restaurant and catering services** only attract the **reduced rate** at either 5,5% or 10%. But the 5,5% rate only applies to school cantines. All other restaurant services attract the 10% rate, with the exception of alcoholic beverages, which are liable to 20%.\n\nConsequently, the additional 15% are not a tax, but a 'service fee' for additional services rendered, such as plates, tables, glasses etc.\n\nIf it is true that there was no display in the pub that mentioned this service fee, this might have violated provision **L113\\-3** of French Consumer Code (**Code de consommation**), which states:\n\n> Article L113\\-3\n>  Tout vendeur de produit ou tout prestataire de services doit, par voie de marquage, d'\u00e9tiquetage, d'affichage ou par tout autre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 appropri\u00e9, informer le consommateur sur les prix et les conditions particuli\u00e8res de la vente et de l'ex\u00e9cution des services, selon des modalit\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par arr\u00eat\u00e9s du ministre charg\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie, apr\u00e8s consultation du Conseil national de la consommation.\n\nFrom this follows that the restaurant as service provider must inform the consumer about the price.\n\nA violation in contravention of said law allows for the imposition of an **administrative fine** of up to **15000,\\- \u20ac**:\n\n> Tout manquement \u00e0 l'article L. 113\\-3 et aux arr\u00eat\u00e9s pris pour son application et \u00e0 l'article L. 113\\-3\\-1 est passible d'une amende administrative dont le montant ne peut exc\u00e9der 3 000 \u20ac pour une personne physique et 15 000 \u20ac pour une personne morale.

The restaurant, as a service provider, is required to display all charges, including service fees. Failure to do so could result in an administrative fine of up to 15,000 \u20ac for a business.

A statute of limitations statutorily encodes what is a reasonable delay (if SCOTUS thinks that 5 years is too long a time, they can so rule and Congress will have to change the law). The practical rationale for limiting the delay on trying a person is that after 30 years, memory of the details surrounding an event are likely to be very unreliable, so that witnesses on both sides are of limited value. In addition, the limit motivates law enforcement to investigate the problem in a timely manner.\n\nThe federal law, [in the general (noncapital) case](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3282), is that the limit for all crimes is 5 years, There are various longer limitations, including none for capital offenses. [Criminal contempt](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3285) has a shorter limit of one year, and otherwise 5 years is the shortest period for criminal prosecution at the federal level. The reason why perjury has a 5 year limit is that it is not one of the specific more serious offenses and it is not criminal contempt. [The limit in 1948](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/80th-congress/session-2/c80s2ch645.pdf) was 3 years, and was [increased to 5 years](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-68/pdf/STATUTE-68-Pg1142.pdf) in 1954\\.

This limitation is primarily based on the Speedy Trial Clause and the Due Process Clauses of the Constitution. These constitutional provisions require that there be some limit on how long an accused person has to wait for trial. The 5-year limit was established in 1954, increased from the previous 3-year limit set in 1948.

It is the *quid pro quo* or \"something for something\" that is the essence of a contract \\- it's what turns an unenforcable agreement into a contract.\n\nA formal contract supported by a deed does not need consideration.\n\nThe rules of consideration are that it:\n\n1. must move from the promisee, but need not move to the promissor. For example, you promising me to wash someone else's car is good consideration.\n2. may be 'executed' (something for something now) or 'executory' (something for something in the future) but it cannot be 'past' (something that has already occurred before the contract came into existence \\- noting that that exact moment might be somewhat nebulous).\n3. need not be adequate. If I agree to sell you my home for $1 this is clearly not adequate (in most circumstances) but the $1 is good consideration.\n4. must be sufficient. This is not the same as adequate. Insufficient consideration falls under the following headings \n\n\t* performance of a duty imposed by law\n\t* performance of a duty already imposed by another contract\n\t* moral obligations\n\t* uncertain or indefinite promises.\n5. Possible to perform \\- both legally and practically.\n\nWhat is promised does not need to have intrinsic value and can be a promise to do something or to refrain from doing something.\n\nCondition\n---------\n\n\"Condition\" has several meanings in contract law.\n\n**Condition of a Contract**\n\nA condition in a contract is an essential term the breach of which entitles the innocent party to either:\n\n1. affirm the contract and sue for damages, or\n2. treat itself as no longer under an obligation to perform the contract \\- but rights which had accrued up until that time continue.\n\nA term that is not a condition is a warranty. Breach of a warranty allows suing for damages but does not allow the innocent party to escape their obligations.\n\nWhether a term is a condition or a warranty depends on how essential it is \\- if it was so essential that the innocent party would not have entered the contract without it, it's a condition. The egregiousness of the breach can affect this as well \\- a term requiring payment on the 1st of each month is likely to be a warranty if payments are consistently made on the 3rd but a condition if they are constantly 2 months late.\n\n**Condition Precedent**\n\nA condition precedent is one which must be satisfied before a contract becomes binding.\n\n1. A condition precedent to the formation or existence of a contract. There are no enforcable rights on either party until the condition is fulfilled. Usually, this condition depends on a third\\-party. For example, an offer to buy real estate \"subject to finance\" is not a contract if the finance is not forthcoming.\n2. A condition which is precedent (a pre\\-requisite) to the obligation of a party to perform its part of the contract. For example, a requirement that delivery must be before 9\\.00 am on Wednesday or there is no binding contract. This can alternatively be thought of as the parties providing within the contract a mechanism for its discharge.\n\n**Condition Subsequent**\n\nIs a condition terminating the contract (either automatically or on the election of one of the parties) when it occurs. For example, a contract for the supply of iron ore while the price is above $X/ton \\- if the price drops lower the contract ends.\n\n**Other uses**\n\nOutside of contract law, the word \"condition\" is used a lot; most usually in its common English construction of \"If \\[condition] then \\[consequence]\". For example, \"if I put the basketball through the hoop, my team gets 2 (or 3 or 1\\) points\" \\- that's a condition of getting the points but it's not a contractual obligation.\n\nBob and Alice\n-------------\n\n**Bob washing his hands**\n\n1. It moves from Bob \\- that is, Bob has to do something. It doesn't move to Alice (apart from her not having to sensorily experience Bob's greasy fat\\-smeared hands anymore).\n2. It is executory \\- Bob may have washed his hands in the past (we can hope) but this particular contract requires him to wash them in the future.\n3. It doesn't have to be adequate although in the context of this contract it probably is anyway.\n4. It is sufficient \\- Bob is under no legal or moral obligation to wash his hands.\n5. It's possible to perform \\- it is neither illegal nor physically impossible for Bob to wash his hands.\n\n**Alice lending the pen**\n\n1. It moves from Alice and it this case, to Bob.\n2. It is executory \\- Alice will lend the pen in the future.\n3. It doesn't have to be adequate although in the context of this contract it probably is anyway.\n4. It is sufficient \\- Alice is under no legal or moral obligation to lend Bob her pen.\n5. It's possible to perform \\- it is neither illegal nor physically impossible for Alice to lend the pen.\n\nBob washing his hands is *also* a condition of the contract \\- if Bob does not wash his hands, Alice can either affirm the contract and sue for (admittedly small) damages or terminate the contract and keep whatever benefits she has accrued (none).\n\nAnd, it's a condition subsequent, until Bob washes his hands, Alice has no obligations under the contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario with Alice and Bob on the plane, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal aspects of their interaction?\n\nA) The agreement between Alice and Bob cannot be considered a contract because there is no intention to create legal relations.\n\nB) Bob washing his hands can be considered valid consideration, but Alice lending her pen cannot be, as it lacks sufficient value.\n\nC) The interaction satisfies the basic requirements for a contract, with Bob washing his hands serving as both consideration and a condition precedent.\n\nD) The agreement is merely a permission to use the pen subject to conditions, not a legally binding contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The interaction between Alice and Bob satisfies the basic requirements for a contract in common law. Bob washing his hands serves as valid consideration because it meets all the necessary criteria: it moves from the promisee (Bob), it is executory, it is sufficient (not a pre-existing duty), and it is possible to perform. Additionally, it acts as a condition precedent, as Alice's obligation to lend the pen is contingent on Bob washing his hands first.

Falwell*, 485 U.S. 46 (1988\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/46). At the time, Campari Liqueur was running an ad campaign in which people talked about their first time drinking Campari, but in a context setting up extended double\\-entendres about losing their virginity. Playing off that format, Hustler ran a [fake interview with Jerry Falwell](https://frontpageconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Falwell-Ad-e1511466570818.jpg) about his \"first time,\" which can really only be understood if reprinted in full:\n\n> **Falwell:** My first time was in an outhouse outside Lynchburg, Virginia.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Wasn\u2019t it a little cramped?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Not after I kicked the goat out.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** I see. You must tell me all about it.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** I never really expected to make it with Mom, but then after she showed all the other guys in town such a good time, I figured, \"What the hell!\"\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** But your Mom? Isn\u2019t that a little odd?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** I don\u2019t think so. Looks don\u2019t mean that much to me in a woman.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Go on.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Well, we were drunk off our God\\-fearing asses on Campari, ginger ale and soda\u2014that\u2019s called a Fire and Brimstone\u2014at the time. And Mom looked better than a Baptist whore with a $100 donation.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Campari in the crapper with Mom. How interesting. Well, how was it?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** The Campari was great but Mom passed out before I could come.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Did you ever try it again?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Sure. Lots of times. But not in the outhouse. Between Mom and the shit, the flies were too much to bear.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** We meant the Campari.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Oh, yeah, I always get sloshed before I go to the pulpit. You don\u2019t think I could lay down all that bullshit sober do you?\n> \n> \n> **Campari, like all liquor, was made to mix you up. It's a light, 48\\-proof, refreshing spirit, just mild enough to make you drink too much before you know you're schnockered. For your first time, mix it with orange juice. Or maybe some white wine. Then you won't remember anything the next morning. Campari. The mixable that smarts.**\n\nPredictably, Falwell sued, claiming defamation and extreme emotional distress. A jury awarded Falwell $150,000, and Hustler appealed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Falwell could not recover for defamation because the ad \"was not reasonably believable,\" and that he could not recover for emotional distress because the First Amendment does permit such claims when \"the conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad parody involved here\":\n\n> Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate. ... From the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without them. ... There is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite sure that the pejorative description \"outrageous\" does not supply one.\n\nSince then, the principles from *Hustler* have evolved and distilled into a test that generally requires the plaintiff to prove that reasoanble readers would view the material in question as actually telling the truth about the defendant. For your hypothetical, then, the question would become whether people reading the website believed that about it.\n\nThis is a trickier question than it might sound like.

There are plenty of for\\-profit companies that don't make a profit.\n\nWhat it means is that you have filled out the paperwork with the IRS and other interested parties in your city, county, or state, that says your organization is a non\\-profit. That invokes certain rules as to where and how the funds you receive must be spent. It also relates to your purpose as an organization. If it's to \"sell some software\" then you likely don't qualify as a non\\-profit.

Using terms like \"non-profit\" or \"not-for-profit\" without proper legal structure and registration can violate laws governing such organizations.

For sales tax, depending on the type of business you are and your expected taxable sales, you may be required to report your taxable sales quarterly, biannually, or annually. **Tax is due when the report is due** much like income tax, but these cannot be delayed like income tax filings.\n\nIf you fail to make a report, the State will estimate your taxes and send you a bill. This bill will include late fees and charges. There is no incentive for business owners to delay these filings and payments. In fact, not filing and not paying **may result in your sales and use tax certificate being revoked**, effectively putting you out of business.\n\nA business is also not required to set aside any certain amount from a single transaction and pay that to the State. They don't have to take $5 of your $100 transaction and put it in a \"sales tax\" envelope to send to the State. At the end of the period they have to calculate, $X in taxable sales \\* Y% tax rate \\= Total Tax bill, and pay that amount. They could pay it all from the last sale, or set aside a separate account, or a sub\\-account, etc.\n\nSo businesses don't have to pay immediately, they pay on a set schedule. The funds that they collect will most likely be deposited into a general account and the taxes paid out of that account at a later date. Yes, this may include revenue from the following month, *but who cares*? The point is that the tax is paid on time and in the amount required.\n\nBut to the question at hand... No, you cannot file a form or inform the business that you will pay tax directly. The business **is required by law** to collect those taxes at the time of the sale (unless you have a reseller certificate and they make those kinds of sales). They are not allowed to say \"sure, take the X% off the price and pay the state, we trust you\". They have to report taxable sales and pay the tax on those sales. Since your sale is \"taxable\", they are required to pay the tax on that, regardless of them collecting it from you or not.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in Wisconsin is concerned about the timing of sales tax payments to the state.

It can make anything legal and it can make anything illegal. It generally addresses fairly high\\-leval legal principles, but there's no reason that it couldn't be amended to include a 9,000\\-page law specifically addressing every conceivable aspect of the regulation of nuclear energy.\n\nAs it stands now and as it always has, the Constitution permits the federal government to write laws only with respect to [certain topics](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8). The states, meanwhile, retain authority to write laws on virtually any other topic.\n\nThere are a variety of legal and historical reasons why prohibition took the form of a constitutional amendment while drug laws are handled legislatively, but one important consideration is the scope of Congress's power to regulate \"interstate commerce.\"\n\nAt the time of prohibition, it was not clear that Congress could regulate commercial activity that took place entirely within a single state. So if you grew all the ingredients for your whiskey in Kentucky, and you distilled those ingredients in Kentucky, and then you sold your whiskey in Kentucky exclusively to residents of Kentucky, it seemed that your conduct was outside the reach of Congress, and that any attempt to regulate it would be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge. The solution, therefore, was to amend the constitution and give that authority to Congress.\n\nAbout a decade after prohibition ended, though, the Supreme Court decided that the power to regulate interstate commerce includes not just transactions that cross state lines, but also any conduct that \u201cexerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce\u201d [*Wickard v. Filburn*, 317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942\\)](https://casetext.com/case/wickard-v-filburn). This broadens the Commerce Clause authority to cover virtually any economic activity. So even if you buy marijuana seeds from your next door neighbor, plant them in your own back yard, grow them for strictly personal use in your own home, and never sell anything to anyone, the courts will hold that your conduct affects the interstate market for marijuana, and is therefore subject to federal regulation.\n\nThis standard substantially lowers the bar for Congress to act without a constitutional amendment, which is a big part of the reason there hasn't been an amendment to address narcotic use.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why Prohibition required a Constitutional Amendment, while modern drug laws do not?\n\nA) The Constitution can only be amended to address high-level legal principles, not specific substances like alcohol or drugs.\n\nB) Federal laws are easier to pass than Constitutional Amendments, so modern lawmakers chose the simpler route for drug regulation.\n\nC) The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause expanded significantly between the Prohibition era and the modern era, allowing for broader federal regulation without Constitutional Amendments.\n\nD) States have always had the authority to regulate substances, so federal involvement in drug laws is actually unconstitutional.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key difference between Prohibition and modern drug laws lies in the evolution of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause. During Prohibition, it was unclear if Congress had the authority to regulate commercial activity occurring entirely within a single state. This uncertainty led to the use of a Constitutional Amendment to ban alcohol nationwide. However, in the 1942 case Wickard v. Filburn, the Supreme Court significantly broadened the interpretation of the Commerce Clause to include any activity that \"exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" This expanded interpretation allows Congress to regulate a wide range of activities, including drug production and use, even if they occur within a single state, without needing a Constitutional Amendment.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Constitution can be amended to include specific details if desired. Answer B, while true that federal laws are easier to pass, doesn't explain the fundamental shift in legal interpretation that allowed for drug laws without an amendment.
