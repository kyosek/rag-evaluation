It does not, however, excuse a British subject from the ordinary duties of paying taxes and the like; anyone in a more accessible (and more clearly British) part of the country would be subject to the normal forms of law enforcement, including imprisonment for contempt of court if they refused to obey court orders. Despite the more eccentric theories of the 'sovereign citizen' movement (who [do exist](http://loweringthebar.net/2016/03/sovereign-citizens-also-bothering-scotland.html) in the UK), the fact that somebody living in Britain is subject to British laws is not open to negotiation.\n\nResisting this law enforcement by force would not be a good idea: as well as the fact that the Government has access to bigger and better armed forces than you do, it would probably render you guilty of treason. The Treason Act 1351 (as amended and translated) makes it illegal to \"levy war against our lord the King in his realm, or be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere\"; the good news is that the death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998 (some time after that for murder).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A group of individuals in rural England declare their 50-acre property an independent nation, refusing to pay UK taxes or comply with local building regulations.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that claiming independence is likely not a crime itself, as evidenced by the Principality of Sealand case.\n2. However, it emphasizes that such a claim \"does not excuse a British subject from the ordinary duties of paying taxes and the like.\"\n3.

Which of the following best describes the most likely legal outcome and its implications?\n\nA) The clause would be deemed enforceable, setting a precedent for software companies to claim ownership of user-created content.\nB) The clause would be unenforceable, but the company could legally implement a revenue-sharing model for commercial use of their software.\nC) The clause would be enforceable only if the author had explicitly agreed to it before writing the novel.\nD) The clause would be deemed unenforceable and void, with no legal basis for the company to claim any rights to the author's work.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal implications of software ToS and copyright law. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The proposed clause attempting to transfer full copyright ownership to the software company would likely be deemed unenforceable by courts. It's overly broad and would effectively prevent users from meaningfully using the software, which goes against the basic principles of contract law and consumer rights.\n\n2. However, the answer suggests that a more nuanced approach of revenue-sharing for commercial use could potentially be legal. This aligns with the documentation's statement that \"A more effective strategy would be to impose a revenue-sharing formula on any commercially-exploited work created using the software.\"\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because such a broad claim of ownership would likely not be upheld, as it would severely restrict users' rights and creativity.\n\n4. Option C is incorrect because the enforceability of such a clause doesn't solely depend on explicit agreement, but also on its reasonableness and legality.\n\n5.

The correct answer is C because, as explained in the documentation, an NDA is considered an asset of the company that doesn't simply disappear when the company ceases to exist. Instead, it becomes owned by the company's heirs and assignees, which in this case would be the creditors (if the company was insolvent) or the former shareholders. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it mistakenly assumes that the dissolution of the company automatically voids all contracts.

This is based on the ['Schrems II' decision in 2020 that the EU\\-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=228677&pageIndex=0&doclang=en) fails to protect Europeans' rights to data privacy when companies are transferring those data to the U.S. The details and requirements are discussed by the [International Association of Privacy Professionals](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/).\n\nSuppose Alice Inc. was in this situation, in that they are a US company with their websites running on the cloud in US datacenters, let us say in a single docker container with apache and MySQL and their simple site. They could with a simple purchase of alternative hosting and a few commands deploy their webserver on an EU host. This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.\n\nIf they did this, would this satisfy the particular aspect of the GDPR that was covered by the 'Schrems II' decision and the Meta fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maybe this changes something, maybe not. But at first glance, yes, avoiding US\\-based vendors does help comply with Schrems II. They need not be EU\\-based.\n\nDefinition of an international data transfer\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR unfortunately does not define what an international transfer is, and just explains when they may be lawful:\n\n> Art 44: Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country \\[\u2026] shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country \\[\u2026] to another third country \\[\u2026]. \\[\u2026]\n\nThis has been interpreted, in particular by the official EU SCCs and by [EDPB guidance](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052021-interplay-between-application-article-3_en), to imply two roles: the data exporter, and the data importer. Per those EDPB guidelines, a transfer occurs when three criteria are fulfilled together:\n\n1. The data exporter is subject to GDPR (e.g. as a controller via Art 3, or as a processor via an Art 28 data processing contract).\n2. The exporter discloses or makes available personal data to the importer.\n3. The importer is in a \"third country\" (for EU GDPR: anything outside the EU/EEA).\n\nNote that these importer/exporter aspects are independent from roles like \"controller\" or \"processor\". It also does not depend on where in the world the exporter is situated.\n\nApplying this to your scenario\n------------------------------\n\nHow does this apply to your scenario?\n\n* I am assuming Alice Inc is subject to the GDPR (criterion \\#1\\). Now, Alice Inc can process personal data, and **that's not an international transfer**, even if Alice Inc is in the US (or any other third country). The general GDPR rules apply, such as the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of processing operations.\n* If Alice Inc engages data processors to process personal data on Alice Inc's behalf, then this would fulfil criterion \\#2 (disclosure to a third party). For example, hosting providers generally act as data processors. Any other kind of data sharing (e.g. to other data processors) would also fall under this category. Tricky in an US context: while employees would be agents of Alice Inc and would not be separate recipients, contractors/freelancers would also be potential data importers.\n* If those data importers are based in the EU/EEA, then criterion \\#3 is not fulfilled and **there's no international transfer**. For example, using an EU\\-based hosting providers would sidestep Chapter V of the GDPR completely.\n* If those data importers are based outside of the EU/EEA, **then criterion \\#3 is triggered and we have an international transfer**.\n\nLawfulness of international data transfers\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen there is an international transfer, it must be adequately protected. In order of decreasing priority:\n\n* country has an EU adequacy decision\n* appropriate safeguards\n\t+ for a group of companies: Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)\n\t+ Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)\n* Art 49 specific situations\n\nWhat SCCs and BCRs do is to translate enough of the GDPR from statutory law into a contract to ensure adequate protection. But to be effective, they must actually be enforceable, and the data importer must actually be able to comply with those rules.\n\nIn Schrems II, the CJEU found that the US (at that time) did not offer an adequate level of data protection, and that SCCs are probably invalid as well since importers cannot comply with both the SCCs and with US surveillance laws. Before using SCCs, it is effectively necessary to perform a transfer impact assessment (TIA) analyzing, among other things, the legal context of the importer's country. It may be possible to defuse this, for example by using supplemental security measures like end\\-to\\-end that prevent unlawful use of the data even if it falls into the wrong hands. However, such measures also tend to prevent intended use, especially in a cloud context.\n\nIn the [DPC Ireland decision against Meta Ireland (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/final_for_issue_ov_transfers_decision_12-05-23.pdf), the DPC finds:\n\n> 7\\.202 In summary, therefore, I am satisfied (and I so find) that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) US law does not provide a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that provided by EU law;  \n> \n> (2\\) Neither the 2010 SCCs nor the 2021 SCCs can compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law; and  \n> \n> (3\\) Meta Ireland does not have in place any supplemental measures which would\n> compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law.\n> \n> \n> 7\\.203 Accordingly, in making the Data Transfers, I find that, subject to the analysis contained at Section 8 below, Meta Ireland is infringing Article 46(1\\) GDPR.\n\nImplications of using non\\-US vendors\n-------------------------------------\n\nAs already mentioned, using EU\\-based data processors avoids the international transfer problem due to the way how international transfers are defined.\n\nEven if an international transfer occurs, that might not be a problem.\n\n* Some countries have an EU adequacy decision, for example Canada, Israel, or South Korea. While there would nominally be an international data transfer that needs to be disclosed e.g. in a privacy notice, there is no additional bureaucracy required.\n* In other countries, transfer tools like SCCs might work. A TIA might show that that the issues discussed in the Schrems II decision and the DPC decision wouldn't apply there.\n\nBut isn't that a contradiction?\n-------------------------------\n\nYou correctly point out a problem with the GDPR's approach to data transfers:\n\n> This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.\n\nYes, this is arguably a loophole.\n\nHowever:\n\n* If the US\\-based Alice Inc is a data processor in behalf of another controller, that controller would likely be violating the GDPR by transferring personal data to Alice.\n* If Alice Inc is a data controller: while this might not be a violation of the Chapter V rules on international data transfers, such a scenario could be argued to be an Art 24 or Art 32 violation instead (requirement to ensure compliance and security).\n* When Alice Inc transfers personal data to data importers, that is less visible to data subjects, and outside of their immediate control. However, when Alice Inc collects data on data subjects, that is more visible to data subjects, in particular through an Art 13 or Art 14 privacy notice. That notice must also contain the identity of the data controller, which would disclose that Alice is US\\-based, which may enable to data subjects to make more informed choices.\n\nThis won't help Meta\n--------------------\n\nWhile moving to non\\-US data processors can be a sensible compliance approach for many companies, it is less useful for multinationals like Meta. In this context, Meta is an Irish data controller who engages platform and development services from an American company. Even if Meta Ireland tries to perform all GDPR\\-covered processing activities outside the US, it's actual corporate structure situates some processing activities such as administration tasks in the US and other third countries. If my above analysis is correct, it would have been easier for Meta to comply with GDPR if the US\\-based Meta company were the data controller.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Alice Inc., a US-based company, is concerned about compliance with GDPR following the 'Schrems II' decision.

However, I cannot see anywhere in the section a requirement that the notice must give an address for the landlord which is in England or Wales.\n\nThe article also confirms one aspect of the question, in that:\n\n> There are situations where the landlord\u2019s address is significant.

So how can I reliably ask for his address?\n\nI'm taking this (and subsequent comments) to mean that OP does have a reliable way of contacting the landlord \\- but that the landlord is in breach of section 48 because no address has been made available which is in England or Wales.\n\nSo the answer seems to be: assuming the Section 21 notice is otherwise valid, the fact that the landlord has provided an invalid address doesn't change that. However, it appears that no rent is due until a valid address is provided (though note that once a valid address is provided, [**all** withheld rent is then due](https://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/2014/05/29/a-tenants-right-to-know-his-landlords-address/).)\n\nIt is possible that the landlord has made an honest mistake, and didn't realise that the current absence of a letting agent has left them in breach of the law. So it may be worth contacting the landlord to point this out, so they can appoint a new letting agent.\n\n*Please note: withholding rent when it is legally due can have serious consequences.

The only address provided is in a foreign country. What is the most appropriate course of action for the tenant?\n\nA) Immediately challenge the validity of the Section 21 notice in court based on the missing UK address\nB) Withhold all rent payments until a valid UK address is provided, then vacate the property\nC) Contact the landlord to inform them of the Section 48 breach and request a UK address, while preparing for potential eviction\nD) Ignore the Section 21 notice entirely, as it is automatically invalidated by the Section 48 breach\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their practical application. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The Section 21 notice is not automatically invalidated by the lack of a UK address. As per the Landlord Law Blog cited in the documentation, Section 21 notices must comply with the requirements of Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, which does not explicitly require a UK address.\n\n2. While withholding rent is a potential consequence of the landlord's failure to provide a UK address, it's not advisable to do so without first informing the landlord of the breach. Additionally, once a valid address is provided, all withheld rent becomes due immediately.\n\n3. Challenging the validity of the Section 21 notice in court solely based on the missing UK address is likely to be unsuccessful and could be costly.\n\n4. Ignoring the notice entirely is risky, as it may still be valid despite the Section 48 breach.\n\nThe most appropriate action is to contact the landlord, inform them of the Section 48 breach, and request a valid UK address. This gives the landlord an opportunity to rectify the situation, possibly by appointing a new letting agent. Simultaneously, the tenant should prepare for potential eviction, as the Section 21 notice may still be valid.\n\nThis approach balances legal rights, practical considerations, and the potential for resolving the issue without escalating to legal action.

These resources are not available to be sold otherwise: a room is *booked* and thus blocked from being rented to someone else, or a seat on the plane is *booked* and not offered to others, and so on.\n\nAs long as the booking person arrives, no damage happens.

The key elements are:\n\n1. There is a scheme to defraud: Customers are intentionally using payment methods they know can't cover potential fees.\n2. There is a transfer of service: The act of booking reserves resources, which is itself a service provided by the company.\n3.

There are laws against circumventing copy protection measures (DRM) but not against aimbotting (to the best of my knowledge). Thus, you cannot reasonably believe that a click\\-assist functionality would be used to break *laws*. It could definitely be used to break *private contracts* such as an EULA, but you are not a party to that contract and are not bound by its terms. Of course, when *you* use such click\\-assist tech in an online game, you might be breaking *your* contract with the game vendor or server provider.

E.g.\n\n> 23 June 2020, 10pm, upstairs washing machine on for the tenth time today, very noisy, spoke with neighbour who told me to f off.\n\nFrom a practical and enjoyment of life point of view as opposed to the theoretical exercise of one's legal rights and discussion of civil torts, consider moving as soon possible if the neighbour or landlord aren't cooperative.\n\nConsider [contacting Shelter for competent free guidance about noise](https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/noise).\n\nIn terms of being woken up at 8am or 9am by the washing machine, if you are not doing shift work or night work I don't think you'll get much sympathy.

Given the situation described, what is the most appropriate and legally sound course of action for the tenant to address these issues?\n\nA) File a formal noise complaint with the local council immediately, citing the decibel readings from the iPhone app as evidence\nB) Withhold rent payments until the landlord addresses both the noise and water billing concerns\nC) Approach the noisy neighbor directly, then escalate to the landlord and local council if unresolved, while separately investigating the water billing arrangement\nD) Terminate the tenancy agreement early, citing breach of quiet enjoyment due to the noise issues\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests critical thinking in a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, aligns with the stepwise approach recommended in the top answer for addressing noise issues: first approaching the neighbor, then escalating to the landlord, and finally involving the local council if necessary. This approach is supported by the link provided (https://www.gov.uk/how-to-resolve-neighbour-disputes) and the advice to keep a log of incidents and communication attempts.\n\nAdditionally, it suggests separately investigating the water billing arrangement, which addresses the tenant's concern about the unusual shared water billing. This could involve contacting the water authority anonymously to verify the arrangement's legitimacy, as suggested in the documentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it skips important initial steps and relies solely on potentially unreliable evidence from a smartphone app. Option B is problematic as withholding rent can lead to legal issues for the tenant and doesn't address the problems constructively. Option D is an extreme measure that doesn't follow the recommended dispute resolution process and may not be legally justified based on the information provided.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, apply appropriate conflict resolution strategies, and understand the legal and practical implications of different approaches in a tenancy dispute."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87536/arming-yacht-pleasure-craft-at-sea", "docs_id": 87536, "title": "Arming yacht/pleasure craft at sea", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legal, applicable to arm yachts, recreational vessels.

Most functioning large\\-caliber and fully\\-automatic weapons are not allowed in civilian hands globally. The moment the ship leaves the 12 nautical miles zone, the country law of its flag applies, so unless you happen to start in the US with a duly registered curio/relic deck gun with proper stamps... you'll have a hard time being allowed to have the thing on board in the first place, and entering any other country's water is pretty much violating their gun control laws and gun import laws.\n\nShip hulls don't support them.\n------------------------------\n\nThat deck gun there is a type of [Bofors 40mm L/60 twin mounting \\- 40x311mmR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_L/60_gun). That means, its installation weighs upwards of half a ton, as that's the smallest carriage setup according to Wikipedia. [Navweapons](http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_4cm-56_mk12.php) helpfully provides gun weights of roundabout half a ton per gun. That puts the minimum weight at about that of a [PAK 40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.5_cm_Pak_40), but as Navweapons tells us, a US Mark 1 Twin clocks in at 4\\.4 to 5\\.8 tons including guns. All on the one mounting spot.\n\nWith the bulk they are, no fiberglass ship hull could support that much load on the gun's small footprint. It needs a steel\\-hulled superyacht to even bear the deck load of such an installation. If your ship is the size of a coastguard or navy vessel, it probably *is* such a ship redesigned, a commercial fishing boat (similar specs), a cargo vessel, a large cruise vessel, or built to your specifications from the ground up.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy individual is planning to outfit their newly purchased superyacht with a defensive weapon system for protection against piracy.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that most large-caliber and fully-automatic weapons are globally restricted for civilian use, ruling out option A.\n\n2. Option A is further invalidated by the information about ship hull strength - a fiberglass yacht couldn't support the weight of a Bofors gun (4.4 to 5.8 tons).\n\n3.

Option D, while creative, is not mentioned in the documentation and would likely face similar legal challenges as conventional weapons.\n\n5. Option C is the most feasible because:\n   - It doesn't require permanent installation of weapons on the yacht, avoiding structural issues.\n   - Professional security teams are more likely to have the necessary permits and understanding of international maritime laws.\n   - It provides flexibility to add security only in high-risk areas, potentially easing legal complications when entering different territorial waters.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate information about legal restrictions, practical limitations of yacht construction, and apply critical thinking to devise a solution that navigates both legal and practical challenges in a real-world scenario."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27965/is-it-really-an-abduction-if-the-protest-or-resistance-ends-before-the-victim", "docs_id": 27965, "title": "Is it really an abduction if the protest or resistance ends before the &quot;victim&quot; is &quot;released&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend ran into her ex\\-boyfriend at a store.

The crime of kidnapping is complete at the moment of the unlawful restraint and movement, regardless of the duration or ultimate outcome.\n\n3.

The prosecutor, not the victim, has the authority to decide whether to pursue charges, even if the victim is unwilling.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the victim's later acquiescence does not retroactively make the initial act legal.

When applying for federal financial aid, grants, and loans as a man, however, you may be asked to prove that you are exempt.

Can someone please provide me reliable information about any such laws or regulations that exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of US laws that form the basis of effectively warrantless surveillance, including through tech companies:\n\n* Under Executive Order 12333, US intelligence agencies issue National Security Letters. These letters compel the recipient to provide requested data. These letters do not require a warrant, and typically include a gag order for the recipient.\n* Under Section 702 FISA, US intelligence agencies enjoy substantial powers for foreign surveillance. This surveillance has to be authorized by the FISA court, but it has been criticized for rubber\\-stamping requests. Proceedings at the FISA court are *ex parte* and lack representation for the surveillance subjects.\n* FISA and the National Security Letters mechanism where expanded through the Patriot Act.\n* US intelligence agencies often have creative interpretations of the governing laws. Judicial review tends to defer to executive branch interpretation if that interpretation is reasonable. Thus, there exists a secret body of quasi\\-law where intelligence agencies can interpret the existence of further powers.\n\nThese laws have very limited checks and balances. While Americans enjoy some protections, there are basically none for non\\-Americans. Subjects have extremely limited options to fight this surveillance in court. FISA has to be re\\-authorized every few years.\n\nThe true scope of surveillance under these laws became publicly known through the Snowden leaks. For example, intelligence agencies ran the PRISM program based on section 702 FISA that compelled companies to supply all data matching a \u201cselector\u201d.\n\nA bit of outside perspective: In 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that EO 12333 and other laws mean that the United States do not have an adequate level of data protection, effectively forbidding further transfers of personal data into the US. While the EU's GDPR does recognize surveillance measures that are \u201cnecessary and proportionate in a democratic society\u201d, the lack of judicial remedies for surveillance subjects are especially troubling. The ECJ wrote in its judgement (case C\u2011311/18\\):\n\n> As regards judicial protection, the referring court states that EU citizens do not have the same remedies as US citizens in respect of the processing of personal data by the US authorities, since the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which constitutes, in United States law, the most important cause of action available to challenge unlawful surveillance, does not apply to EU citizens. In that regard, the referring court states that there are substantial obstacles in respect of the causes of action open to EU citizens, in particular that of *locus standi*, which it considers to be excessively difficult to satisfy. Furthermore, according to the findings of the referring court, the NSA\u2019s activities based on E.O. 12333 are not subject to judicial oversight and are not justiciable. \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> It follows therefore that neither Section 702 of the FISA, nor E.O. 12333, read in conjunction with PPD\u201128, correlates to the minimum safeguards resulting, under EU law, from the principle of proportionality, with the consequence that the surveillance programmes based on those provisions cannot be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about US surveillance laws and practices, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A US-based tech company receives a National Security Letter requesting user data for a foreign national.

Which of the following scenarios most accurately reflects the immediate change in their title and the associated legal and administrative processes?\n\nA) The barrister must apply for a new appointment as King's Counsel (KC) before they can use the new title in court.\nB) The barrister's title automatically changes to KC, but they must wait for new letters patent to be issued before using it officially.\nC) The barrister's title instantly becomes KC, and they can use it immediately in court without any formal reappointment process.\nD) The barrister retains the QC title until a formal ceremony is held to confer the new KC status on all existing QCs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer is C, as it best integrates the information from various sources and historical precedents.\n\nThe Demise of the Crown Act 1901 establishes that appointments such as QC/KC are not affected by the change of monarch, eliminating the need for reappointment (ruling out option A). The historical example of Sir Robert McCall, who transitioned from QC to KC without new letters patent being issued, supports this (ruling out option B).\n\nThe most compelling evidence comes from the account of the transition following King George VI's death, where a King's Counselor resumed court proceedings as a Queen's Counselor just ten minutes after the news broke. This demonstrates the immediacy of the change and the lack of any formal reappointment process or ceremony (ruling out options B and D).\n\nFurthermore, the general principle that \"EVERY past reference to Queen becomes King at once, or King to Queen as appropriate\" underscores the automatic and immediate nature of the change.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of information from multiple sources and applying it to a specific scenario.

You are the data controller, the third party analytics are usually a data processor who only process data on your behalf. You must ensure that the data processor is compliant. Even if they were a joint controller you'd be responsible for what happens on the website (relevant precedent is the Fashion ID case).\n* While ePrivacy originally had a fairly weak concept of consent (e.g. \u201cby continuing to use this site, you consent \u2026\u201d). However, the GDPR updated the definition of consent, so that valid consent must be freely given, informed, actively given, and specific. If you set cookies for different purposes in addition to analytics, users should be able to give or withhold consent for analytics independently from other purposes. Since consent must be actively given, consent is never the default, e.g. pre\\-ticked checkboxes are not compliant (relevant precedent is the Planet49 case).\n* Like Google, GoSquared stores data in the US. You are causing personal data to be transferred into the US, which is an international transfer. Before it was invalidated earlier in 2020, such transfers were easy to do under the Privacy Shield adequacy decision. Now, such transfers are only legal if you sign SCCs with your data processor, and your risk assessment indicates that your user's data is sufficiently safe there, despite your processors potentially being legally unable to comply with the SCCs.

These include certain patent termination and indemnification provisions. The patent termination provision is a good thing, which is why we recommend the Apache 2\\.0 license for substantial programs over other lax permissive licenses.\n\n**But what does it mean when the FSF says a license is \"[compatible with the GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean)?\"**\n\n> It means that the other license and the GNU GPL are compatible; you can combine code released under the other license with code released under the GNU GPL in one larger program.\n> \n> \n> All GNU GPL versions permit such combinations privately; they also permit distribution of such combinations provided the combination is released under the same GNU GPL version. The other license is compatible with the GPL if it permits this too.\n> \n> \n> GPLv3 is compatible with more licenses than GPLv2: it allows you to make combinations with code that has specific kinds of additional requirements that are not in GPLv3 itself. Section 7 has more information about this, including the list of additional requirements that are permitted.\n\nSo what can you make of this? The FSF considers these two licenses compatible and it also means that when you combine code under these two licenses, the effective obligations that will apply are these of the Apache and GPL combined, including source code redistribution.\n\nBut why are the compatible? Is the fact that the FSF says so enough?\n\nWe can check what the Apache Software Foundation [says on the topic](https://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html):\n\n> The Free Software Foundation considers the Apache License, Version 2\\.0 to be a free software license, compatible with version 3 of the GPL. The Software Freedom Law Center provides practical advice for developers about including permissively licensed source.\n> \n> \n> Apache 2 software can therefore be included in GPLv3 projects, because the GPLv3 license accepts our software into GPLv3 works.\n\nSo irrespective of the deeper why, they tend to agree and as they are the authors of the respective licenses, this carries some weight.\n\nBut wait, this is not true the other way around as the ASF goes on:\n\n> However, GPLv3 software cannot be included in Apache projects. The licenses are incompatible in one direction only, and it is a result of ASF's licensing philosophy and the GPLv3 authors' interpretation of copyright law.\n\nSo in a nutshell, the FSF considers that the terms of the Apache license are compatible with the copyleft terms of the GPL 3\\.0\\.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Compatibility: The Free Software Foundation (FSF) considers the Apache 2.0 license compatible with GPL 3.0. This means that code licensed under Apache 2.0 can be included in a GPL 3.0 project.\n\n2. One-way compatibility: While Apache 2.0 code can be included in GPL 3.0 projects, the reverse is not true. GPL 3.0 code cannot be included in Apache 2.0 projects due to the copyleft nature of the GPL.\n\n3. Copyleft requirements: When combining Apache 2.0 and GPL 3.0 code, the resulting project must be licensed under GPL 3.0 to satisfy its copyleft requirements. This ensures that the freedoms guaranteed by the GPL are preserved in the combined work.\n\n4. Legal agreement: Both the FSF and the Apache Software Foundation agree on this compatibility, which provides strong legal backing for this approach.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using only Apache 2.0 would violate the terms of the GPL 3.0 components. Option B (dual-licensing) is not appropriate here because the GPL 3.0 components cannot be relicensed under Apache 2.0.

However, some staff only enjoy \"official acts\" immunity. Immunities only apply to foreign nationals of the sending nation, and not to citizens or permanent residents of the US. Quite often, nations have consular offices outside the capital manned by locals with an interest in the sending nation, and they may carry out business in their own home. The individuals do not have regular consular immunity, they have only official acts immunity, and the premise where they do their business is *not* unsearchable, unless the premise is used only for official consular business (thus, not their own homes). \n\nUnder the Vienna treaty, \"consular premises\" is a term of diplomatic art, referring to a subset of consulates, as\n\n> the buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto,\n>  irrespective of ownership, *used exclusively for the purposes of the\n>  consular post*\n\nAn honorary consul may uses his home for conducting consular business, but it is not immune from search (it is a de facto consulate, but does not qualify as a \"consular premise\" in the sense defined by the convention).

The practice of an occupation or profession may be regulated by or pursuant to a law.\n\nHas art. 12(1\\) been interpreted to require that all students should be automatically graduated regardless of grades?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n==\n\nWhat it means is that no German can be forced by the government into a job, education or place of work. So for example, the Government cannot come and say \"we are short on railroad workers, the next 200 graduates of this school will report to Hamburg Station for training and become rail workers in Munich\".\n\nThat might be blindingly obvious *today*, but when this was written, the government that had just ceased to exist had heavily dictated who was allowed into which profession, not on personal qualification, but on things like faith, nationality, heritage and skin color. And *other* governments forming from the ashes right next door were indeed not capitalistic and their socialist central planning meant that they would direct at least parts of their workforce which jobs to take and sometimes even where.\n\nIn contrast, in Western Germany, whether or not one becomes a rail worker, which company educates them and where they work in the end is their choice.\n\nObviously choices are limited by reality. I can *choose* to be a railworker on an island in the North Sea, but I will be unemployed, because there is no rail line there and I won't get a permit to build my private one.\n\nI can *choose* to study philosophy, but if I cannot find an employer in need of philosophers, I will have to fall back on making money driving an Uber.\n\nI can *choose* to become a Pilot. But I will have a hard time finding a spare 747 to train on if I don't train with one of the big airlines. The may have their own, totally capitalistic goals. For example, contracts that say \"if we train you, you have to stay for X years and work for us or pay X amount of money\" are totally normal and legal in those businesses. And if their training center with the big 747 simulators is in city A, I can choose to train in city B, but I will obviously fail their program.\n\nSo no, this law does not imply any kind of automatic success on a personal level. You still need to qualify for the training you want, be able to pay rent in the city you want to live in and find an employer that employs you, or customers to become a successful freelancer. Maybe you cannot do that for personal reasons. But the government will not dictate instead.

The correct interpretation is that the university can dismiss the student for poor academic performance. Article 12(1) protects the right to choose one's profession and place of training, but it does not guarantee success or completion in that chosen field. \n\nThe explanation in the documentation clarifies that this law prevents the government from forcing individuals into specific jobs or educational paths, but it does not imply automatic success.

Presumably such amn imitation would display the logo and other trademarks of the site being imitated, without permission, and in a way likely to confuse readers about the origin and affiliation of the display. Whether this would be considered to be \"used in trade\" or would be otherwise subject to a suit for trademark infringement is hard to say. \n\nA fake post in the sense of one actually posted to a social media site, but under an assumed name, possibly under a name that seems to be associated with a real person, but in fact is not so associated, probably violates the sites TOS. That would be a breech of contract, but such breeches are, I understand, rarely pursued in the form of actual lawsuits. \n\nIf a fake post in either sense uses the name or likeness of a real person without permission, that **might** violate the personality rights of the person imitated. Such rights vary considerably by jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions they apply only to the use in marketing. In some jurisdictions no such rights are recognized. If a fake post attributes to a real person statements which that person did not in fact make, and if those statements are offensive, or harm the person's reputation, there might be a case for defamation. If a fake post reveals, or purports to reveal, private information about a real purpose, in some jurisdictions there might be a tort case for invasion of privacy.\n\nIf a fake post attempts to deceive people to the materiel benefit of the poster, there might be a case for fraud. \n\nIf the fake post serves to advertise some product or service, and if the false name conceals that it was made by or on behalf of the seller or maker of the product or service, or falsely appears to be from some reliable source, such as an expert or a celebrity, then under US law that might be an unfair trade practice.

The judge's immediate sentencing action is fundamentally flawed for several reasons:\n\n1. Lack of formal charges: The confessor has not been formally charged or indicted for the crimes, which is a prerequisite for any criminal proceedings.\n\n2. Absence of arraignment: The confessor has not been formally arraigned, where they would be informed of the charges against them and their rights.\n\n3. No plea entered: There has been no formal opportunity for the confessor to enter a plea (guilty, not guilty, or no contest) in a proper legal setting.\n\n4. Denial of right to counsel: The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to legal counsel, which the confessor has not been afforded.\n\n5. No trial or due process: The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee due process of law. An immediate sentencing without a trial, evidence presentation, or opportunity for defense violates this fundamental right.\n\n6. Potential coercion or mental health issues: The circumstances of the confession (bursting into a courtroom) might raise questions about the confessor's mental state or potential coercion, which would need to be evaluated.\n\n7. Violation of established sentencing procedures: Proper sentencing typically involves pre-sentence investigations, victim impact statements, and other procedural steps, all of which are bypassed in this scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because judicial discretion does not extend to bypassing fundamental constitutional rights and established legal procedures.

The correct answer is D because it most closely aligns with the law's intent to prohibit devices that detect or disturb traffic monitoring systems.\n\nOption A is likely legal as it doesn't directly detect enforcement devices. Option B is in a grey area - while it provides information about speed cameras, it doesn't actively detect them in real-time. Option C is generally legal in France and doesn't interact with traffic monitoring systems.\n\nOption D, however, violates Article R413-15 of the Code de la Route. The law prohibits devices that detect systems used to record or regulate traffic, regardless of the form they take. A smartphone app that actively scans for and alerts to mobile speed traps in real-time would fall under this prohibition, as it's intended to detect and allow evasion of traffic enforcement.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the applicant to:\n1.

There are various minimal limitations on the right to free speech, so that you can't threaten a person's life; there are more limits on the right to bear arms. In both cases, laws limiting the exercise of those fundamental rights must be restrained, and a law against openly carrying guns to a political protest would be subject to \"strict scrutiny\", meaning that there would have to be a compelling reason to infringe on these rights. The legal rule, here and in the UK, is that it's legal unless it is specifically illegal. That is not to say that Michigan could not pass a law outlawing the carrying of weapons in government buildings, or outlaw political protests right at the door of the governor's office,\nbut until they do, it's legal.

The real issue is not whether those policies are permitted, but what the consequences are for breaking them. \n\nThe fact that a company forbids its employees from exercising a legal right doesn't mean that the employee ceases to have that legal right. It simply means that if the employee exercises that legal right, then the employee has breached the contract and may suffer the consequences for breaching that contract.\n\nViolations of those policies are grounds for termination from employment, and this would probably not be void as a matter of public policy. \n\nFor an employee at will this is really pretty meaningless, although it could conceivably affect unemployment benefit eligibility. But, for a unionized or civil service employee who can only be fired for cause, this is a big deal.\n\nBut, in theory, a company policy does not impact the tort liability or the criminal liability of the individual engaging in legally privileged self\\-defense to anyone. This is because two people can't contractually change their legal duties to third parties with whom they are not in privity (i.e. with whom they do not have a contractual relationship). And two people also can't contractually change the terms of a country's penal laws.\n\nThe policy may be a defense of the company from vicarious liability for the employee's use of force in violation of the policy that gives rise to civil liability for the employee because the grounds for authorizing self\\-defense were not present.\n\nIf the employee using force did so wrongfully and was sued for negligence rather than battery, the existence of the company policy might also go to the issue of whether the employee was acting negligently since a reasonable person in the employee's shoes might have been less likely to wrongfully use force in purported self\\-defense if there was such a policy than if there was not such a policy (and instead there might arguably have been a legal fiduciary duty as an agent to protect the property and workers of the principal in the absence of the policy).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A security guard at a retail store is faced with an aggressive shoplifter who suddenly becomes violent and threatens physical harm.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, a company policy does not override a person's legal right to self-defense. The guard retains their common law right to defend themselves against physical harm.\n\n2. However, the documentation also clearly states that violating such policies can be grounds for termination from employment. The policy creates a contractual obligation between the employee and the employer.\n\n3. The guard's actions, if deemed self-defense, would likely not result in criminal or civil liability to third parties, as the documentation explains that company policies cannot change legal duties to third parties or alter penal laws.\n\n4. The guard may face employment consequences (e.g., termination) for violating the policy, even if their actions were legally justified as self-defense.\n\nThis question targets higher cognitive levels by requiring analysis of the interplay between company policies, employment contracts, and legal rights.

The situation: Tenant pays rent by handing a cheque to the landlord, the landlord is robbed before the cheque is deposited. Consensus on money.stackexchange.com is that the tenant should tell their bank to cancel the cheque, and hand over another cheque. \n\nHowever, what happens if the thief manages to cash in the checque before it is stopped? The money is gone. Clearly *someone* is going to lose out, either landlord or tenant. But whose money is it? Does the tenant have to pay the rent again, paying twice, or does the landlord lose his rental income for the month? \n\nThe question was asked in Canada, but other jurisdictions would be welcome as well. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Canada, the bank loses the money. They are the party that is ultimately responsible for paying only the person the cheque ordered to be paid. Canadian law is actually very strict on this, the bank would would be liable even if the landlord fraudulently gave the cheque to his brother to cash.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has made multiple decisions confirming the banks liability in cases like this, most recently in [Teva Canada Ltd. v. TD Canada Trust](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16815/index.do):\n\n> ... The question at the heart of this case is which innocent party \u2014 T or the collecting banks \u2014 should bear the loss resulting from fraud? The Bills of Exchange Act should be interpreted in such a way that drawers and banks are exposed to the risks created by the fraudulent use of the system, but the banks are the more significant beneficiaries of the bills of exchange system. It is therefore appropriate, in certain circumstances, for them to bear risks and losses associated with that system. To allocate losses to the drawer for having failed to identify and detect the fraud is inconsistent with the strict liability tort of conversion, which makes any negligence on the part of the drawer or the banks in preventing the fraud irrelevant. The Court has, in multiple decisions, provided a two\u2011step framework which outlines what a bank must prove to demonstrate that a payee is fictitious or non\u2011existing. ...\n\nNote that tenant would still owe the landlord rent. If the bank paid someone other than landlord then cheque wasn't properly honoured and so no longer satisfies the debt. So in the end the landlord would get paid, the tenant would only pay for the rent once, and the only bank would lose. That is, assuming the bank couldn't recover the money from the person who fraudulently cashed the cheque.\n\n(Note that banks in Canada make it very difficult for their customers to obtain compensation when the bank screws up, so what I've written above is only what should happen according to the law in theory.

She hands the cheque to her landlord, John, who is subsequently robbed before depositing it. The thief manages to cash the cheque at a local bank branch. A week later, John demands that Sarah pay the rent again. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Sarah is legally obligated to pay the rent again, as the initial payment was never received by John.\nB) John must absorb the loss, as he failed to deposit the cheque promptly, thereby assuming the risk.\nC) Sarah should file a police report and refuse to pay again, as she has fulfilled her legal obligation.\nD) Sarah should inform her bank of the fraud and pursue compensation from them, while John can still expect to receive the rent payment.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application of Canadian law. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. According to Canadian law, specifically the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Teva Canada Ltd. v. TD Canada Trust, the bank is ultimately responsible for paying only the person the cheque was intended for. In this case, the bank improperly cashed the cheque for someone other than John, the landlord.\n\n2. The bank's liability exists even in cases of fraud, and the negligence of the drawer (Sarah) or the payee (John) is irrelevant in the strict liability tort of conversion.\n\n3. However, Sarah still owes John the rent because the cheque wasn't properly honoured and thus doesn't satisfy the debt. This means John can still expect to receive the rent payment.\n\n4. Sarah should inform her bank of the fraud and pursue compensation from them. The bank is legally obligated to reimburse the amount, as they failed in their duty to pay only the intended recipient.\n\n5. While the law theoretically protects Sarah, the practical reality (as mentioned in the documentation) is that she may face a lengthy dispute resolution process with the bank.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of legal principles, understanding of bank responsibilities, and consideration of practical implications.

In fact, under rules of English, it is impossible to construe \"is not employed on a full\\-time basis\" as referring to \"you\" (Eugene), and the clause can only refer to the \"children\". A non\\-technical common\\-sense way to see this comes from substituting your name in here and shortening the verbiage\n\n> Dependent means Eugene and your children, or a child for whom you or\n>  Eugene are the legal guardian. And that child must be under the\n>  termination age, not be full\\-time employed, and must be dependent\n>  on you or Eugene for support.\n\nThe idea that Eugene must be dependent on Eugene for support is a bit nonsensical and contradicts the plainer fact that Eugene is identified at the very start as being a dependent. \n\nThere *is* a possible ambiguity regarding the scope of the \"not\\-employed (etc.)\" clause. The sentence identifies two kinds of \"children\": natural, adopted or step\\-children, and also a child that you are a legal guardian of. The question is whether the clause \"who is under the termination age, is not employed on a full\\-time basis and is dependent on you or your spouse for support\" refers to all of those kinds of dependents, or just the legal guardian type. There is an interpretive doctrine, the [last antecedent rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_antecedent_rule), which would say that the restrictor only applies to \"or a child for whom you or your spouse are the legal guardian\".

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The definition states that a \"dependent\" means \"your spouse and your or your spouse's unmarried natural, adopted or step-child.\" This initially seems to include both the spouse and children.\n\n2. However, the clause \"who is under the termination age, is not employed on a full-time basis and is dependent on you or your spouse for support\" only applies to the children, not the spouse.

This could lead to the same or distinct results. I haven't read the laws in question, so it could also be that these regulations apply to the formation of contracts and not conduct during those contracts, so that the old law might remain in effect until one contractual period is over (e.g. if you have a yearly contract that will renew on 2022\\-12\\-01, the old regulation *might* be applicable until then).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A company signed a contract on 01/12/2021 referencing Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 in its Terms and Conditions.

The correct answer is B because the written contract explicitly stated overtime would be paid at 1.5 times the regular rate. Even though the employee is classified as exempt (which means overtime pay is not legally required), the employer is still bound by the terms of the contract they offered and the employee accepted.\n\nThe doctrine of contra proferentem supports this interpretation, as any ambiguity in the contract would be construed against the drafter (the employer in this case). The employer's attempt to unilaterally change the terms mid-contract by stopping overtime pay would likely be considered a breach of contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while exempt status means overtime pay isn't legally mandated, it doesn't override explicit contractual agreements. Option C introduces a concept (offsetting compensation) not mentioned in the documentation and isn't legally required. Option D is a distractor that misrepresents how employment rights work; continuing to work doesn't automatically waive contractual rights.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal principles to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts (contract law, employment classification, and interpretation of agreements) and critical thinking about the implications of contractual terms versus statutory requirements."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55496/laws-blocking-the-use-of-dogs-to-detect-the-coronavirus-at-airports", "docs_id": 55496, "title": "Laws blocking the use of dogs to detect the coronavirus at airports?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a law or regulation that prevents the use of dogs to detect the coronavirus at airports in the United States [as it is done already somewhere else](https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Coronavirus-sniffing-dogs-dubai-15454175.php#photo-19761801)? Do other countries have laws like these which block the use of dogs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The issue is more likely that there is no law or regulation allowing the use of dogs to sniff passengers in the US for matters not related to crime, whereas Dubai, a monarchy, has a different political system. In general, you have the constitutional right to move about in the U and the right not to be unreasonably seized, a right which may not exist in some other jurisdictions. That right can be restricted in accordance with law, but there has to be some such law. It is not a crime to have covid, or to travel while infected (it is a crime to carry bombs and drugs on a plane).\n\nOne area where there is some restriction is where there always has been a restriction, namely entry into the US. There is (was) [covid screening](https://www.dhs.gov/coronavirus/protecting-air-travelers-and-american-public) at certain airports for flights from certain countries. [This directive](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020-05606.pdf) indicates the airport restrictions, but does not explain what screening will take place. The above DHS site says that \"the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities. Passengers will then be given written guidance about COVID\\-19 and directed to their final destination, and immediately home\\-quarantine in accordance with CDC best practices\". It is not clear whether a mandatory temperature check without even reasonable suspicion of a crime would constitute an unreasonable search (body searches are subject to higher standards than property searches, it seems), and constitutional law surrounding searches has emphasized the primacy of privacy in search law, not the fact of physically entering property of the body. Some airlines and airports offer voluntary temperature checking, so it might be possible if someone has a covid\\-sniffing dog to offer voluntary sniff testing, especially if it is offered by a private concern and does not have the appearance of government mandate (which would require a law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A private company has developed a highly accurate COVID-19 detection dog and wants to implement mandatory screening for all passengers at a major U.S. airport.

The constitutional right to move freely and not be unreasonably seized in the U.S.\n2. The lack of existing laws or regulations specifically allowing dog sniffs for non-crime related matters.\n3. The higher standards for body searches compared to property searches.\n4. The emphasis on privacy in U.S. constitutional search law.\n\nWhile option B (absence of specific legislation) is relevant, it's not the most significant barrier. The fundamental issue is the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches, which would require carefully crafted legislation to overcome.\n\nOption A is a distractor based on the misconception that FDA approval would be the primary concern, when in fact it's a constitutional issue.\n\nOption D is another distractor that might seem plausible but isn't mentioned in the documentation and wouldn't be the primary concern in the U.S. legal system.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the student to integrate multiple legal concepts and apply them to a novel scenario.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Applying concurrently for Express Entry and OINP maximizes chances of success by pursuing multiple paths simultaneously.\n2. The Masters Graduates Stream of OINP is specifically mentioned as a potential option, given the applicant's Canadian master's degree.\n3.

If you're a contractor, you may end up in small claims court if they haven't paid in a reasonable time.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The scenario strongly indicates an employee-employer relationship rather than a contractor relationship, based on the control test and organization test outlined in the documentation. Key factors include the agency setting the schedule, providing job instructions, and paying by time worked rather than by job.\n\n2. Retroactively sending a contract doesn't change the nature of the relationship that existed during the work period. This attempt likely indicates the agency's awareness of potential misclassification.\n\n3. As an employee under BC labor code, you would be entitled to payment within 6 days of the end of employment (or 48 hours if terminated by the employer).\n\n4.

If the company under their control violates the rights of the minority shareholder(s), they are entitled to compensation from the majority shareholder(s) and/or the company, and they can and will sue them for that. Furthermore, any accounting irregularities, misrepresentations, faked reports, etc done during that process may easily push it from a mere civil claim into criminal charges.\n\nInvestor agreements and company bylaws\n--------------------------------------\n\n\"They can also kick the VC rep from the board since they own majority share.\" will be prevented by an investor rights agreement and modifications to the company charter and bylaws that mandate (for example) that a particular board seat will be controlled by that VC, and that this board seat will have a veto right over certain types of decisions \\- so the majority *can't* do whatever they want. The majority shareholders will also generally have a binding contractual agreement that they must vote in a particular way in certain aspects. \n\nDue diligence\n-------------\n\nA key part of most investment is due diligence review of the company current situation \\- the founders would be expected to agree to an invasive, thorough audit of their operations by the investors. This will include a review of any legal clauses, liabilities, etc. In addition, often the founders (personally) will be expected to sign so\\-called representations that affirm these details, and that they have disclosed all material aspects, and that they'll be personally liable for misrepresentations and omissions. In case of outright fraud (taking the money and running away) this will also be evidence in a criminal case that some misrepresentation was not just an accidental omission but an intentional act.\n\nTranches and clawback provisions\n--------------------------------\n\nIt's not that uncommon to have money disbursed in tranches conditional upon meeting certain provisions, and for any money that goes directly to founders it's not uncommon to see clawback provisions that state that the consequences of any misrepresentations will be taken out of these funds, possibly with large part of that money held in escrow for some time to cover that.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about investor protections in startups, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A venture capital firm is considering investing in a promising startup.

Option B provides the most comprehensive and balanced approach to protecting the VC's interests:\n\n1. Tranched investments tied to milestones allow the VC to release funds gradually as the company meets agreed-upon targets, reducing risk.\n2. Modifying company bylaws to include VC veto rights addresses the concern of being \"kicked off the board\" and ensures the VC has a say in critical decisions, even without majority control.\n3.

Which of the following actions would most likely lead to legal issues for the business owner?\n\nA) Selling a glaze mix with the exact chemical composition as the \"Sapphire Sunset Glaze\" recipe\nB) Using the name \"Sapphire Sunset Glaze\" on their product packaging and marketing materials\nC) Including instructions with their product that closely resemble the original recipe's text\nD) Mentioning that their product was inspired by popular online glaze recipes\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because while recipes (including pottery glaze recipes) are generally not protected by copyright, the name \"Sapphire Sunset Glaze\" could potentially be protected under trademark law. The documentation states that \"a stylized individual name for a recipe, as opposed to a generic name for the same recipe, at a minimum under common law trademark rights even if it is not protected by a federal or state trademark registration, may have trademark protection.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the chemical composition of the glaze is part of the recipe, which is not subject to copyright protection. The documentation clearly states that \"Recipes are not subject to copyright.\"\n\nOption C is a distractor based on the fact that while recipes themselves are not copyrightable, the specific expression of the recipe (e.g., the text) might be. However, this option specifies \"closely resemble\" rather than exact copying, making it less likely to be a legal issue than using the potentially trademarked name.\n\nOption D is the least likely to cause legal issues, as it doesn't involve copying any potentially protected elements and merely references inspiration from public sources.\n\nThis question tests the applicant's ability to distinguish between copyright and trademark protections, apply these concepts to a specific scenario, and understand the nuances of intellectual property law as it relates to traditionally under-protected forms of creative work."}, "62": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53102/employer-listed-incorrect-end-date-in-contract", "docs_id": 53102, "title": "Employer listed incorrect end date in contract", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm working as an independent contractor and the agreement I signed says my start date is May 12th 2020 and my end date is July 10th 2020\\.\n\nI'm required to work 200 hours for the company between these two dates.\n\nAs I initiate the final goodbyes my employer is saying I have to stay on till July 23rd.

Apparently you are 25 hour short on that obligation, which may mean that you probably will be in breach of contract. I don't see what error there is w.r.t. the date: whatever the contract says, that is what you agreed to.\n\nPerhaps you are wholely responsible for the shortfall of hours, or perhaps the employer bears some responsibility (e.g. making it impossible for you to work). It sounds like the employer is offering you an accommodation so that you can fulfill the hours part of the contract, by extending the termination date. Technically, you also have to do the work by a particular date, but a reasonable delay in performance is standardly allowed under contract law, unless the contract has a \"time is of the essence\" clause which states that completion by the specific date is essential to the contract. If not, then there is reasonable flexibility in completion. Doing less than you contracted for, on the other hand, is not a standardly\\-available option.\n\nPursuant to the comment, it sort of sounds like the employer made it impossible to satisfy the conditions of the contract, and wants to use the end of contract date as a form of hardball to extract additional hours (i.e. \"we'll sue you for breach of contract for not having done this by the deadline, unless you agree to work an additional 15 hours\"). Hardcore deadlines without a time is of the essence clause don't support a claim for damages in case of minor delay, and even less so when the employer bears responsibility for the delay.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The contract specifies both a time frame (May 12th to July 10th) and a total number of hours (200). The contractor has not met the hours requirement, which could potentially constitute a breach.\n\n2. However, contract law typically allows for reasonable flexibility in completion dates, especially if there's no \"time is of the essence\" clause. This means the July 10th end date isn't necessarily a hard deadline.\n\n3. The contractor may bear some responsibility for the shortfall, but the employer might also share responsibility if they made it difficult to complete the hours within the original timeframe.\n\n4. The employer's willingness to extend the deadline suggests some flexibility, but their demand to work until July 23rd may be excessive given the original terms.\n\n5. The contractor's liability for the remaining hours depends on various factors, including the reasons for the shortfall and the specific terms of the contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes the employer has unilateral power to extend the contract terms.

Your situation resembles the notion of *quiet enjoyment*. See [*Midway Park Saver v.

Standpoints (1\\) and (2\\) are largely equivalent.\n\nThe terms of the lease are unlikely to \\[explicitly] sanction the landlord's non\\-enforcement of the clause. But there are at least two legal arguments that favor your position:\n\n* The mere existence of no\\-smoking clause induces a tenant's reasonable expectation that the landlord will enforce the clause across the board. That inducement occurs at the formation of the contract, if not earlier.\n* The landlord's pretext that it \"*can't do anything about it due to Covid\\-19*\" reflects landlord's implicit acknowledgment of the aforementioned expectation of enforcement. Make sure you have that landlord's statement *in writing* so you can file it in court if need be.\n\nThe option that involves suing the smoker has the purpose of making him responsible for the penalization if you breach the lease. There is no contract between you and the smoker\\-tenant, but his repeated violations of a clause of which he was aware clearly disrupt the enjoyment to which you as tenant are entitled (and ultimately your contract with the landlord). This type of claims is known as *tortious interference with relation*.\n\nPrior to suing the smoker, you might want to send him a *cease and desist letter* letting him know of the legal ramifications of his conduct. This might obviate both breaching your lease and court proceedings altogether. Regardless, make sure you have proof that the smoker received your letter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Understood.

Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in a non-smoking apartment building is experiencing persistent second-hand smoke from a neighboring unit, despite multiple notices from management. The property manager claims they can't address the issue due to COVID-19 restrictions. Which legal strategy would most likely succeed in allowing the tenant to break their lease without penalty?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against the smoking neighbor for tortious interference with the lease agreement\nB) Argue constructive eviction based on the landlord's failure to enforce the no-smoking clause\nC) Claim the landlord's inaction constitutes a violation of local health codes\nD) Assert that COVID-19 restrictions void all lease terms related to moving out\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective legal strategy in this situation would be to argue constructive eviction based on the landlord's failure to enforce the no-smoking clause. This approach aligns with the concept of \"quiet enjoyment\" mentioned in the documentation and addresses multiple key points:\n\n1. It targets the landlord's negligence in enforcing the no-smoking clause, which is a core issue in the scenario.\n2. It leverages the legal principle of constructive breach, where the landlord's conduct effectively forces the tenant to break the lease.\n3. It ties directly to the tenant's reasonable expectation that the landlord would enforce the no-smoking clause, which was implied at the formation of the contract.\n4. It addresses the landlord's weak excuse that they \"can't do anything about it due to Covid-19,\" which actually acknowledges their responsibility to enforce the clause.\n\nOption A, while potentially valid, is less likely to succeed in breaking the lease without penalty, as it targets the smoking neighbor rather than the landlord who is party to the lease agreement.\n\nOption C could be relevant, but there's no specific mention of health codes in the documentation, making it a less robust argument compared to the constructive eviction approach.\n\nOption D is incorrect, as COVID-19 restrictions don't automatically void lease terms, and the documentation doesn't support this interpretation.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the most effective legal strategy, aligning with the requested L3 or higher cognitive level."}, "64": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74822/how-much-does-civilian-jury-cases-impact-legal-precedent", "docs_id": 74822, "title": "How much does civilian-jury cases impact legal precedent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Apropos of the Kyle Rittenhouse case:\n\nIn the Rittenhouse case, one of the arguments made by the prosecution (I don't know if it was a \"main\" argument as I only watched snippets of the proceedings myself, but it was definitely presented by the prosecution) is that Kyle Rittenhouse lost his right to self\\-defence, or at least that right was impacted, by the fact that he chose to be in a plainly dangerous area (a riot zone) in a provocative manner (with a firearm).

The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, \"Only appellate court opinions have effect as legal precedent outside the dealings of the actual parties to the case in future litigation with each other.\" A jury verdict alone, regardless of the high-profile nature of the case, does not set legal precedent. Option A is incorrect because jury decisions do not set binding precedents. Option B, while partially true regarding public opinion, is not the most accurate answer in terms of legal precedent.

The correct answer is A because the documentation states that Hindu personal laws apply to \"any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion.\" Since Yazidis are not explicitly mentioned in this list, they would likely be treated as Hindus for legal purposes, such as matters of marriage and succession.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no indication that minority religions must register as new organizations.

The correct answer is based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Article 65 of the Indian Constitution states that in the event of a vacancy in the office of the President, the Vice-President shall act as President.\n2. Article 67 specifies that a Vice-President may resign by writing under his hand addressed to the President.\n3. The constitution does not explicitly require the resignation to be delivered to or accepted by a specific individual named as President.\n4. When acting as President, the Vice-President functions completely in that role.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the Vice-President, who is acting as President due to the President's incapacitation, can effectively submit and accept his own resignation in writing. This solution adheres to the constitutional requirements while addressing the unique circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because waiting for the President's recovery is not required by the constitution and could lead to an indefinite delay. Option B is incorrect because the Chief Justice is not specified in the constitution as having a role in this process.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The homeowner's contract is with the landscaping contractor, not the rental company. This means the contractor is responsible for all aspects of the job, including cleanup and removal of equipment.\n\n2. The job is not considered complete until all aspects, including cleanup, are finished. The bin's presence indicates incomplete work.\n\n3. Paying the rental company directly (option B) would be inappropriate as there's no contract between the homeowner and rental company. It could also complicate matters legally.\n\n4.

Not knowing how quick or diligent my medial provider would be, I attempted to do my due diligence in finding out what would be in stock before contacting the prescriber, thus reducing the size of the task I was asking for.\n\nI was told by the pharmacy staff that since this was a schedule II drug, they could not share that information of what they had on stock with a patient.

The devices are used by company technicians when fixing network speed problems reported by subscribers. For every measurement the devices store the location and the time of measurement, and the measured network speed. The location is stored as the **technical identifier** of the subscriber's **network endpoint**, which basically identifies the \"internet cable\" installed at the subscriber's home.\n\n**Question 1\\. Are technical identifiers personal data?** Inside private company databases, they are definitely linked to subscriber data. They are also printed on invoices sent to the subscriber. But they are not public information.\n\n**Question 2\\. Can technical identifiers be stored in measurement devices?** The devices I made only measure a physical parameter, the network speed, for a given location in the company's IP network. I think this has nothing to do with the subscribers themselves.\n\nSomeone told me endpoint identifiers **should not be stored** in the devices, or at least **should be deleted after a while**, \"because of GDPR\". I think deleting the endpoint identifiers would make the measurements unusable, because the location of the measurement is very important for solving network problems. Delayed deletion is also problematic: if there is a 2nd speed problem months later, then it would be useful to have previous measurements at the same location. What should I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Question 1\\. Are technical identifiers personal data?\n\nYes. If they identify a person. For example an IP Address is considered personal data, because a person or household can be identified by an IP. Yes, I know that technically there are a lot of exceptions. But in general, if you have an IP, you can identify the subscriber given the right databases. So if your identifier, lets say a generated GUID, identifies a customer or something the customer can be linked to, it is personal data.\n\n> Question 2\\. Can technical identifiers be stored in measurement devices?\n\nJust because something is personal data, does not mean you are forbidden from using it. As long as you *need* it to do your job, you can store it. The internet would not work, if everybody was forbidden from storing any IP address.\n\nSo to summarize it: yes, it is personal data since it identifies a subscriber. However, it is needed for the job your subscriber asked you to do. So for as long as the job takes, it is legal to store it.\n\nOnce your job is done, you would be required to delete it.\n\n**But** consent trumps everything. If your subscriber consents to you keeping all data of such incidents to improve your network and handle future incidents better, then it's legal. Just let them sign it with your other legal paperwork. Done. No problem. You could just periodically delete all records that have no consent for long term storage beyond the current incident.

The citation doesn't reference any specific regulation in the HOA's governing documents.

He could for example assert truthfully that he does not understand the question (pointing to the distinction between \"Charlie's body falling on the vase, causing it to fall and break\", and \"Charlie acting with apparent intent to break the vase\", since it's not patently obvious that the former scenario constitutes \"breaking the vase\"). However (changing the scenario a bit), he has to understand that if the question is \"Did Charlie shoot Delilah?\" and the fact is that Ethan forced Charlie to shoot Delilah, saying \"No\" based on a theory of blame is not reasonably interpreted as truthful testimony.\n\nTaking the 5th, without setting forth your basis (not understanding the question) runs the risk that the prosecution will grant immunity from prosecution, and therefore you don't get to avoid answering the question.

They can also detain people in connection with civil violations of immigration status, but US citizens cannot commit violations of immigration status. Of course, if CBP does not believe the claim of citizenship, they will treat the person as an alien who is therefore potentially subject to civil immigration detention.\n\nThe constitution guarantees a right to a speedy trial. That prevents (is supposed to prevent) indefinite detention of those suspected of crimes. I do not know what procedural guarantees exist for aliens in civil detention to prevent indefinite detention, nor whether a claim of US citizenship would affect the procedure.\n\n> Absent any indication of a crime or violation, does CBP have the authority to detain a US citizen if presented with proper identification documentation (passport card, passport)?\n\nNo. Absent any indication of crime or violation, they can't detain anyone except under specific circumstances for a very limited period of time. Specifically, they can stop people at Martinez Fuerte checkpoints, and they can stop people who are entering the country from foreign territory. In both cases, they need justification to hold them for more than a few minutes.\n\n> What obligation does CBP have to process a detained US citizen in a timely manner?\n\nThe same obligations that apply to anyone detained in connection with a crime, arising out of the speedy trial guarantee in the US constitution.\n\n> Does CBP \\\\ ICE have jurisdiction or authority to demand ID from citizens in a non\\-border or non\\-airport context?\n\nMore or less. If an officer charged with enforcing immigration law has reasonable suspicion that someone claiming to be a US citizen is not, the officer can ask the US citizen for evidence of citizenship. If the US citizen does not provide it, the officer can detain the US citizen while investigating the claim of citizenship. Remember, this is true only if there is a reasonable suspicion that the US citizen is lying.\n\n> Did the citizen do anything to warrant the detention?\n\nProbably not all 23 days. It looks like someone is trying to cover something up since they claimed that he never said he was a US citizen even though they seem to have filed a complaint alleging that he presented a falsified US birth certificate.\n\n> Is there anything the citizen could have done at the checkpoint to avoid detention?\n\nIt is hard to know without knowing more about what happened or definitely whether he was detained for civil immigration violations or for a crime. If the former only, a US passport might have helped.\n\n> If the citizen refused to answer CBP questions, could this produce a better outcome?\n\nI don't see how it would have.\n\n> Once detained, what could the citizen do to reduce the detention duration?\n\nIt sounds like not much in addition to what he did. Getting before an immigration judge should have resulted in his release, but immigration judges are very overloaded these days, I believe.\n\n> What are the lessons learned for other citizens?\n\nIt really seems to depend. Don't hang out with your out\\-of\\-status brother might be one. Get and carry a passport might be one. Move north might be one. For some people, none of those precautions would be necessary.\n\n> Why is it that the CBP process did not resolve the matter in timely manner and was not resolved until media indicated attention forced the issue?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. citizen is detained by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a checkpoint within the 100-mile border zone.

The documentation mentions that \"Getting before an immigration judge should have resulted in his release,\" indicating that this is a potentially effective legal avenue.\n\n2.

I'm interested in the theoretical here: if they have actual grounds.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **theoretical** is that the domain slutsofinstagram.com *does dilute or harm* Instagram's mark because of the use of \"Instagram\" in the domain and because of the unwanted association of the parody story; that's the theory and \"grounds\" that Instagram would use in their lawsuit.\n\nInstagram would have to prove their theory of dilution or harm to the jury or judge, and convince either that the harm is not theoretical but real and financially damaging in order to win their case. The owners of slutsofinstagram.com would have to defend themselves and argue that they are not damaging Instagram's mark and their parody is a parody and is protected as such.\n\nAny actual court outcome is also theoretical. If Instagram won their case, one of the legal remedies could be the court ordering the owner of slutsofinstagram.com to transfer ownership of the domain to Instagram so they could simply park the domain and effectively take down the parody story. Or, the owner of slutsofinstagram.com could prevail because they argued the fact \\- and the court agreed \\- that the domain name and creative contents of the site is a parody and is protected speech and doesn't dilute Instagram's mark because any reasonable person could see that the site is a parody and not related to Instagram.\n\nIn the US, a possible example of a parody not diluting a mark is [L.L.

The mark is being used to refer to, or **name**, the product (or service). It is not being used to sell a similar product, or anything else. No reasonable person could take it to indicate that the trademark owner has endorsed the person making the statement, nor that there is any sort of affiliation. \n\n[This page](https://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/Fair-Use-of-TrademarksNL.aspx) from the International Trademark Association describes the concept. \n\nThis concept is sometimes called \"fair use\" by analogy with the concept in US copyright law, but that term is not strictly accurate. It is better to simply say \"nominative use\" or \"descriptive use\". \n\nDigital Media Law's page on [\"Using the trademarks of others\"](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others) says:\n\n> As a general matter, if you are reporting on, commenting on, or criticizing a trademark owner, most ordinary consumers will not be confused about whether the company or organization is the source or sponsor of your work. You can reduce the likelihood of confusion further by avoiding a website design that looks like the trademark owner's site or resembles its product packaging, and you should never festoon your website with a company's logo (but isolated use when relevant to a discussion is OK)\n\n...\n\n> If someone threatens you with a lawsuit or sues you for trademark dilution, then a lack of consumer confusion will not help you. Here, one obvious line of defense is to argue that there is no likelihood of dilution. Federal and state dilution law protects a trademark owner against the whittling away of the distinctiveness of its famous trademark by association with other goods or services; it does not give a trademark owner the right to shut down all unflattering speech about it. If you do not associate a famous trademark with your own goods or services, then there can be no dilution (or at least that's how your argument goes).\n\n...\n\n> The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1\\) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2\\) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3\\) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits.

For example:\n\n> The 5th amendment was not designed as a shelter for the guilty (despite it often being used as such).

(I know the question asked about the UK, I just happen to know the US copyright rule.) It would seem on the face of it to include independent research on a subject totally unrelated to the person's employment, done off the company's premises and not during normal work hours, but while the person was an employee.. Indeed it would arguably include the copyright to a novel written off premises and during off hours. \n\nUse of \"course of employment\" (instead of \"term\") would improve the provision. so would \"as a part of his or her employment\" or \"closely related to the subject of his or her employment\". Another possible restriction would be \"Using the Company's facilities and/or equipment, or during normal working hours\".\n\nHowever, my experience is that an employer will have drafted whatever language it uses through its company lawyer, and will be quite unwilling to alter it in any way. A prospective employee will probably be faced with a take\\-it\\-or\\-leave\\-it choice unless that person is a nearly indispensable figure to the company.\n\nOne could send the company a certified letter saying, \"When i signed the contract agreeing to {company language} I did not intend to include any developments made off company premises, not using company equipment, and unrelated to the subject or scope of my employment.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The contract clause is very broad, stating \"All rights to any material and results, and all intellectual property rights related thereto, made, written, designed or produced by [employee] during the term of his/her employment shall be vested in the Company.\"\n\n2. This language uses \"term of employment\" rather than \"course of employment,\" which, as noted in the documentation, is more all-encompassing and could potentially include work done on personal time.\n\n3. The top answer in the documentation points out that this clause is \"broader than the default US rule for copyright\" and \"would seem on the face of it to include independent research on a subject totally unrelated to the person's employment, done off the company's premises and not during normal work hours.\"\n\n4. However, the documentation also suggests that such broad clauses might not hold up in court if challenged, especially if the employee can demonstrate that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" regarding non-work-related developments.\n\n5.

Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 99\\-100\\). A third\u2014unilateral declarations\u2014has also been recognized, but it is less well developed as a source (see Currie at p. 111\\-117; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France)*, [\\[1974] I.C.J. Rep. 253](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/58/058-19741220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf), [p. 266](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/58/058-19741220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf#page=18)):\n\n> It is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with the declaration. An undertaking of this kind, if given publicly, and with an intent to be bound, even though not made within the context of international negotiations, is binding. In these circumstances, nothing in the nature of a *quid pro quo* nor any subsequent acceptance of the declaration, nor even any reply or reaction from other States, is required for the declaration to take effect, since such a requirement would be inconsistent with the strictly unilateral nature of the juridical act by which the pronouncement by the State was made.\n\n### Treaties\n\nTreaties (also sometimes called \"conventions\", \"charters\", \"covenants\", \"protocols\", \"pacts\", \"acts\", \"statutes\", or \"agreements\" (Currie, p. 125\\)) express the will of the parties to be bound by their terms. The law of treaties is itself largely governed by a treaty: the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). The *Vienna Convention* describes the ratification process and how treaties come into force. It specifies that treaties are binding upon the parties and that treaties must be performed in good faith.\n\n### Customary International Law\n\nIt is also widely recognized that there exists customary international law that creates or reflects binding obligations on states. For something to be customary international law, a rule must satisfy two elements (see Currie, p. 188\\):\n\n1. general and uniform state practice; and\n2. *opinio juris* (the requirement that states believe that the rule is legally obligatory).\n\nSee also *Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya*, [2020 SCC 5](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18169/index.do):\n\n> \\[77] There are two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such: general but not necessarily universal practice, and opinio juris, namely the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation. \\[citations omitted]\n> \n> \n> \\[78] To meet the first requirement, the practice must be sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent. To meet the second requirement, opinio juris, the practice \u201cmust be undertaken with a sense of legal right or obligation\u201d, as \u201cdistinguished from mere usage or habit.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n> \n> \n> \\[80] When an international practice develops from being intermittent and voluntary into being widely accepted and believed to be obligatory, it becomes a norm of customary international law.\n> \n> \n> \\[82] Once a practice becomes a norm of customary international law, by its very nature it \u201cmust have equal force for all members of the international community, and cannot therefore be the subject of any right of unilateral exclusion exercisable at will by any one of them in its own favour.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n\n### *Jus cogens*\n\nThere are some elements of customary international law that are \"non\\-derogable\" (Currie, p. 206; [*Vienna Convention*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf), art. 53\\). These are called *jus cogens* or *peremptory norms*. These cannot be derogated from even by treaty. See *Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya*, [2020 SCC 5](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18169/index.do):\n\n> \\[83] Within customary international law, there is a subset of norms known as jus cogens, or peremptory norms, which have been \u201caccepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole . . . from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.\u201d This Court acknowledged that \u201ca peremptory norm, or jus cogens norm is a fundamental tenet of international law that is non\\-derogable.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n\n### Relationship to domestic law\n\nTreaties do not change domestic law. States must take actions in good faith towards implementing treaties in their domestic law. This is known as the *dualist* approach.\n\nHowever, even in countries that take a dualist approach to treaty implementation, the dominant approach to customary international law is that it is directly and automatically incorporated into domestic law (see *Nevsun*, paras. 86\\-89, in particular the empirical study of Professors Pierre\\-Hugues Verdier and Mila Versteeg cited at para. 88\\):\n\n> \\[P]erhaps the most striking pattern that emerges from our data is that in virtually all states, CIL \\[Customary International Law] rules are in principle directly applicable without legislative implementation. . . . \\[M]ost countries that require treaty implementation do not apply the same rule to international custom, but rather apply it directly.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A small island nation has recently discovered valuable mineral deposits in its coastal waters.

According to the documentation, treaties (also called conventions or agreements) are one of the primary sources of binding international law, as recognized in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stipulates that treaties are binding upon the parties and must be performed in good faith.\n\nC) A declaration made by a nation's leader at an international conference could potentially create a binding obligation through the concept of unilateral declarations. However, for this to be binding, it would need to be made with a clear intention to be bound, which is not explicitly stated in this option. Additionally, unilateral declarations are less well-developed as a source of international law compared to treaties.\n\nD) Academic papers, while potentially influential, fall under the category of \"teachings of the most highly qualified publicists\" in Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute. These are considered subsidiary means for determining rules of law and do not create binding obligations on their own.\n\nOption B is the most likely to create a binding obligation because bilateral treaties, when properly ratified, are a well-established source of binding international law. This scenario requires the integration of concepts related to sources of international law, the binding nature of treaties, and the process of treaty ratification. It also touches on real-world applications by framing the question in the context of resource exploitation, which is a common issue in international law."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60224/how-to-determine-what-frequency-of-gdpr-sar-is-not-excessive", "docs_id": 60224, "title": "How to determine what frequency of GDPR SAR is not excessive?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Repeat Subject Access Requests are limited in frequency by the [Manifestly unfounded and excessive requests rules](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-law-enforcement-processing/individual-rights/manifestly-unfounded-and-excessive-requests/). The critical bit seems to be \"A request may be excessive if it: repeats the substance of previous requests and a reasonable interval has not elapsed\". This is clarified \"how often the data is altered \u2013 if information is unlikely to have changed between requests, you may decide you do not need to respond to the same request twice.\" [The actual legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/53/enacted) says even less, but does say that it up to the controller to show that it is excessive.\n\nI was in the process of setting up a cron job to make an SAR to the DVLA requesting a list of organisations that have received my data. This is to know about claims such as parking fines being made under the [Protection of Freedoms Act 2012](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protection-of-freedoms-bill) when something goes wrong with the letters sent. I thought I had read that every 3 months was considered \"not excessive\" but I cannot find that now.\n\nI can think of 2 ways to make this decision, depending on what factors are important in the definition:\n\n* If the important factor is the use to which the data is to be put, then there is timing defined by the act, and this gives 14 days for a letter to be posted, received, acted upon than the response posted and received. I would say in this context 7 days would not be excessive for a process that could be completely automated.\n* If the important factor is \"information is unlikely to have changed between requests\" then I would take the distribution of information sharing events in the response to the 1st request, put them into a bayesian model and make requests at the frequency of the low end of the 95% credible interval of getting a change in the time period. It is quite possible, depending on the frequency of information sharing events , the time period for which information is provided as well as the model and prior, that this would be less than 7 days.\n\nI either case I would provide this rational in the initial data request, as well as informing them of my intention to make these follow up requests. It would then be up to the data controller to demonstrate that my rules are manifestly excessive.\n\nAs well as the DVLA, a similar argument could be made for many other organisations such as credit reference agencies. Many people may be interested in making these requests if it was demonstrated useful.\n\nAs a data subject, what aspects should be considered when making these decisions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no specific criteria for deciding whether a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, because this depends very much on context. The ICO has given some clarifications, but they still won't tell you an allowed frequency of requests.\n\nWe (as data subjects) should not invent particular criteria because they would be only our opinion. In any case, the data controller would have burden of proof to show that a request was indeed manifestly unfounded or excessive. That means that a data controller will generally err on the side of caution and allow repeated requests. But that doesn't mean you won't get pushback on your proposed frequency.\n\nI think your proposed approach is likely to be *both* unfounded and excessive.\n\nA controller has one month to respond to your request. Sending off a request while a previous request is still pending would likely demonstrate an excessive frequency of requests. Even if the data controller responds more quickly, it is doubtful whether that would entitle you to more frequent updates. Since the data controller will inform you about important events with a letter, this weakens your need to make frequent requests.\n\nYour \u201cBayesian model\u201d is also flawed, both in content and application. As your prior, you expect a very high rate of events. However, a normal citizen would expect to receive a parking fine approximately never. Your model should more correctly be based around the probability of missing an event, while also accounting for letters (which generally do arrive in time). It might also be incorrect to use *your* circumstances as the basis for determining a reasonable frequency. The ICO suggests multiple factors (nature of the data, purposes of processing, how often the data is altered, relationship with other GDPR rights). These factor's generally relate to the controller's processing, but not to your individual circumstances.\n\nNext, your requests seem unfounded: the purpose of your requests is not aligned with the GDPR, and automated requests raise doubt about whether the request is valid.\nYour motivation to make the requests is \u201cto know about claims such as parking fines \\[\u2026] when something goes wrong with the letters sent\u201d. This is a fairly speculative reason since letters generally do arrive well. In contrast, the GDPR provides for the right to access \u201cin order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing\u201d (Recital 63\\). You are not claiming the right to access for the purpose of verification and to obtain information about the processing, instead you're abusing the GDPR rights to create a kind of API that auto\\-updates.\n\nSo, is three months a hard and fast rule? Definitely not, but it seems like an unobjectionable, reasonable frequency. If a data controller thinks a request every three months is excessive, you'll likely be able to push back successfully. But with more frequent requests, you're entering a grey area.

If all of the primary beneficiaries are all dead, the company will check on the secondary beneficiaries. If there are no surviving secondary beneficiaries, the benefits go to the estate and are subject to probate. If a person is not specifically named as a beneficiary, the insurance company does not get involved in figuring out who gets the money. So then, as part of the estate, the benefit (and anything else) would go to whoever the state's intestacy laws dictate. Collateral heirs (sibling, parents, aunts, grandparents) are elegible only if there are no surviving descendants.\n\nIf (as it appears) this is not regular life insurance but rather an [ERISA\\-regulated employment benefit](https://www.buchanandisability.com/helpful-resourcesandarticles/how-to-tell-if-an-insurance-claim/), the situation changes. That law explicitly supersedes all state laws related to employee benefit plan. However, it explicitly does not supersede state law pertaining to insurance. One path would be to make the insurer prove in court that this is an ERISA plan (the burden is on the insurer, *Zavora v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.*, 145 F.3d 1118\\). If it is an ERISA plan, then you have to get a lawyer to challenge their finding. You should know that you have to submit all of the evidence to the insurance company first, and the legal presumption (\"deference\") is that the insurer is correct. There is a [very long article](https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context=lawreview) which addresses the legal matter of entitlement to survivor benefits under ERISA. Nothing therein suggests that the federal government dictates an order of succession. [This report to the Sec'y. of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/about-us/erisa-advisory-council/2012-current-challenges-and-best-practices-concerning-beneficiary-designations-in-retirement-and-life-insurance-plans.pdf), about beneficiary designations under ERISA, noting that \"The complexity of the rules under ERISA may, in some cases, lead to beneficiary designations that do not accurately reflect the participant\u2019s intent\". The document (which reports on common practice in the industry) notes that\n\n> If no beneficiary designation is made, the beneficiary is usually\n>  determined by the terms of the plan document. Retirement plan\n>  documents typically include default beneficiary provisions that apply\n>  in the event the retirement account owner fails to designate a\n>  beneficiary. The most common order used for a default is the current\n>  spouse, children, parents, siblings and the estate.\n\nIt is therefore possible that the *insurance company* included language in the plan that places siblings before the estate. Federal involvement could be a provision in the law that allows an insurer to specify default beneficiary provisions in case the insured's elections are deceased. (It is also possible that the insured made these elections decades ago and didn't understand the consequences of not mentioning grandchildren). Assuming that siblings precede grandchildren according to the language of the plan, then this is required by federal law in the sense that that is what the plan says, and the law requires the insurer to follow the plan (since the insured is assumed to have read and understood the plan, even though that is often not actually the case).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A grandmother's life insurance policy, originally started in 1983 with her employer, names her husband and son as beneficiaries.

Not only did he use that claim to get guest appearances on Fox News, but the government claims he used it to gain security clearances and a defense contractor gig that included advising senior military personnel overseas.

The contractor hires her based on these claims, and she gains access to sensitive information. Six months later, it's discovered that Sarah fabricated her experience. Which of the following legal consequences is Sarah most likely to face in the United States?\n\nA) Civil lawsuit for breach of contract, but no criminal charges\nB) Misdemeanor charges for false statements, with a maximum of 1 year in prison\nC) Felony charges including wire fraud and major fraud against the United States, facing up to 35 years in prison\nD) A fine and immediate termination, but no criminal prosecution due to it being a private sector job\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the provided information to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C, based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. The case is similar to Wayne Simmons, who falsely claimed CIA experience to gain government security clearances and a defense contractor position.\n2. Simmons was charged with wire fraud, major fraud against the United States, and making false statements to the government, facing up to 35 years in prison.\n3. The scenario involves a defense contractor, which likely involves government contracts and security clearances, making it a federal matter rather than just a private sector issue.\n4. The documentation emphasizes that lying to the government in resumes or during the course of work can lead to criminal charges, especially when it involves security clearances or government-related work.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the scenario goes beyond a civil matter, involving potential federal crimes. Option B underestimates the severity of the charges, as the documentation shows that such cases can lead to felony charges with much longer potential sentences. Option D is incorrect because, despite being hired by a private contractor, the involvement of government-related work and security clearances makes it a federal criminal matter, not just a private sector issue.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a novel scenario that mirrors real-world cases."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4611/how-should-software-licenses-be-displayed-in-multi-lingual-applications", "docs_id": 4611, "title": "How should software licenses be displayed in multi-lingual applications?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been hired by a Canadian governmental agency to release a version of my application on their behalf.

This is further supported by [my research](http://info.protecode.com/bid/33956/How-you-can-comply-with-open-source-license-attribution) which states\n\n> Most licenses, open source or commercial, require that a copy of the copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the source software be distributed **verbatim** with the product using that software.\n\nHowever, I don't have any official documentation that backs this understanding and this goes against what has been requested of me by this agency. They would like this page to also be translated. \n\nThis leads me to ask the additional following questions:\n\n* If it should *not* be translated, is there a legal reference I can provide to the agency to support this conclusion?\n* If it *is allowed* to be translated, is hiring a translator sufficient?\n\nThe licenses that are used in my application include: \n\n* Apache 2\\.0\n* MPLv2\n* BSD License\n* MIT license\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not your license. It's the MIT's license, for example. \n\nWhat all these licenses have in common is that they allow the user to use the software in the way that copyright law allows, and then give the user certain further rights. So all the users of the software can use it just fine without being able to read the license terms, as long as they don't do anything outside what copyright law allows. \n\nIf they want to do things that exceed what copyright law does, they must adhere to the license. That requires being confident that you understand the license text \\- if you don't understand it, it would be stupid to do things that might be copyright infringement. But all that is of no concern to users, only to software developers. \n\nAs an example, German courts have decided that GPL being in English is Ok in Germany, because German software developers can be expected to speak English. \n\nAll in all, I would say that a translation of these licenses isn't necessary because users don't need it, and the reason why you have to display the license is usually because the license itself requires you to display the unmodified license.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating an application for a Canadian government agency that must comply with the French Language Services Act. The application includes third-party software licensed under Apache 2.0, MPLv2, BSD, and MIT licenses. The agency requests that all content, including the attribution screen with copyright and license information, be translated to French. What is the most appropriate course of action for the developer?\n\nA) Translate all content, including licenses, to French using a professional translator\nB) Keep licenses in English but translate all other content, including copyright notices\nC) Maintain licenses and copyright notices in English, translating only user-facing content\nD) Create a bilingual attribution screen with licenses in both English and French\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that most licenses require distribution of copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices \"verbatim\" with the product.\n2. The top answer emphasizes that these are not the developer's licenses to modify, and the reason for displaying the license is usually because the license itself requires displaying the unmodified license.\n3. While the French Language Services Act requires French language services, this doesn't override the requirements of the software licenses.\n4. The licenses mentioned (Apache 2.0, MPLv2, BSD, MIT) are widely used and typically do not have official translations.\n5. The top answer notes that German courts have accepted English GPL licenses, suggesting that original English versions are acceptable in non-English speaking jurisdictions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it violates the \"verbatim\" distribution requirement. Option B is partially correct but still modifies the copyright notices, which should remain unaltered. Option D, while seemingly a compromise, could still be considered a modification of the license presentation.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to balance legal requirements (language laws) with software licensing obligations, requiring critical thinking about the implications of modifying license text and the purpose of attribution screens in software."}}
