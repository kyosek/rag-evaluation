According to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), arbitration awards can only be vacated on very limited grounds. These grounds include corruption, fraud, evident partiality of the arbitrator, arbitrator misconduct, or arbitrators exceeding their powers. The law does not provide for vacating an award simply because the arbitrator may have misinterpreted evidence or made a mistake in their factual findings. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a clear error in interpreting evidence is not one of the grounds for vacating an award under the FAA. \n\nOption B is wrong because contradicting witness testimony alone is not a basis for vacating an award.\n\nOption D is incorrect because inconsistency between factual findings and presented evidence is not sufficient grounds for vacating an award under the FAA.\n\nThe key point is that arbitration is designed to be final, with very limited options for appeal or vacatur, as parties have voluntarily chosen this method of dispute resolution over traditional court proceedings."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5458/is-it-allowed-for-the-driver-to-eat-in-the-car-not-alcoholic", "docs_id": 5458, "title": "Is it allowed for the driver to eat in the car?

The answer points out that even if eating while driving isn't explicitly illegal, it could result in charges of reckless driving if it contributes to an accident.

There is a provision for this inadmissibility to be waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security, but without such a waiver, the Department of State cannot issue a visa.\n\n> He was removed from the list once he became the PM.\n\nThis isn't precisely true.

Under [8 USC 1102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1102) the aforementioned ground of inadmissibility does not apply to diplomatic visa classes:\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, for so long as they continue in the nonimmigrant classes enumerated in this section, the provisions of this chapter relating to ineligibility to receive visas and the removal of aliens shall not be construed to apply to nonimmigrants\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) within the class described in paragraph (15\\)(A)(i) of section 1101(a) of this title, except those provisions relating to reasonable requirements of passports and visas as a means of identification and documentation necessary to establish their qualifications under such paragraph (15\\)(A)(i), and, under such rules and regulations as the President may deem to be necessary, the provisions of subparagraphs (A) through (C) of section 1182(a)(3\\) of this title;\n\nModi was ineligible to visit the US as a \"visitor for business or pleasure\" before he became prime minister, and he still is, and he will continue to be after he ceases to be prime minister.

According to the information provided, a foreign official who was previously deemed inadmissible under 8 USC 1182(a)(2)(G) for violations of religious freedom does not have this inadmissibility permanently removed when they become head of government. Instead, they become eligible for an A-1 visa as a foreign head of government, which allows them to enter the U.S. in that capacity despite their inadmissibility. This is due to 8 USC 1102, which exempts certain diplomatic visa classes from grounds of inadmissibility. However, the underlying inadmissibility remains in effect and would prevent them from entering the U.S. as a regular visitor before or after their term as head of government. Option A is incorrect because the inadmissibility is not permanently removed.

There is generally some room for reasonable people to disagree over what the market value of land really is, in practice.\n\nSo, if you are offered rs. 80000 per marla and you think it is really worth 100000, you have to decide if rs. 20000 per marla is worth the time and trouble to fight over, or whether the route of least resistance to simply accept the government offer is a better deal for you. \n\nIn addition to the time and trouble involved in the process, you also have to consider whether your evidence that your 14 marla is worth rs. 280,000, in the aggregate, more than the government is offering is solid enough that it would prevail in the legal process.\n\nYou need to consider how solid your evidence from an appraiser would be, how much it would cost you to get the appraiser's testimony, and how much time and effort the legal effort would cost you to make that decision.\n\nIn U.S. dollars, this is a fight over $3,640, give or take, based upon day to day variation in exchange rates.

This involves weighing the potential gain (Rs. 20,000 per marla) against the time, effort, and expenses associated with challenging the government's offer.

It seems like a silly question but I am genuinely curious and want to make sure my social experiment isn't subject to any sort of weird laws that I don't know about.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The way law works is that you don't need to find a law which says you *can* do something. Instead, there needs to be an absence of a law which says you *cannot* do that thing. In other words, you can do anything you want so long as there isn't a law which says you can't. It's unlikely that you will find a law in any jurisdiction which says you cannot charge for a handshake.\n\nIf you want the charge to be *legally binding* on the other party, then you need to ensure that the formalities of a valid contract are met. In particular, either each side needs to provide consideration (something of value) or the contract needs to be executed as a deed ([england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")).\n\nThe party who pays the charge is clearly providing consideration. What about the handshake? Is it something of value?\n\nThe rule is that consideration must be \"sufficient\" but does not need to be \"adequate\". That means that it must have *some* value (however small) but it doesn't need to be valuable enough to be a fair bargain for the parties. This was confirmed by the House of Lords in [Chappell \\& Co. v Nestle Co. Ltd (1960\\) AC 97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappell_%26_Co_Ltd_v_Nestle_Co_Ltd) ([england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")) which held that empty chocolate wrappers, which would be thrown away upon receipt, were sufficient consideration. A more common example of low\\-value but sufficient consideration is a \"peppercorn\" which is often used as token consideration where (in practical terms) a party is not offering anything of substance.\n\nNote that \"value\" doesn't need to mean something that benefits the recipient. It can also be something which detriments the person who provides it. The courts have held that a promise to do something you were not otherwise legally required to do is sufficient consideration. For example, in [Hamer v Sidway (1891\\) 27 NE 256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamer_v._Sidway) ([new\\-york\\-state](/questions/tagged/new-york-state \"show questions tagged 'new-york-state'\")), the court held that a promise to quit smoking was sufficient consideration.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the recipient values the consideration or not. In *Chappell* (see above) the court held:\n\n> It is said that when received the wrappers are of no value to\n> Nestle\u2019s. This I would have thought irrelevant. A contracting party\n> can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not\n> cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisee\n> does not like pepper and will throw away the corn.\n\nA handshake is almost certainly sufficient consideration because it involves doing something that you were under no legal obligation to do before you agreed the contract.\n\nHow you write a receipt is a matter of personal choice and therefore off\\-topic.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A street performer decides to charge $1 for a high-five as part of a social experiment.

According to the legal principle explained in the documentation, a high-five can be considered sufficient consideration for a contract, even if its monetary value is minimal. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. There is no specific law prohibiting charging for a gesture, and generally, actions are legal unless explicitly prohibited.\n\n2. Consideration must be \"sufficient\" but not necessarily \"adequate.\" Even items of very little value (like empty chocolate wrappers in the Chappell & Co. v Nestle Co. Ltd case) can be considered sufficient consideration.\n\n3. The act of giving a high-five is something the performer is not legally obligated to do, making it valid consideration.\n\n4. It doesn't matter if the recipient values the high-five or not; the fact that it's being offered as part of the agreement is what counts.\n\n5.

You set up an account with Big Company, which uses BigCo as a trademark. You want email about that account to reach you with a unique address, so you set up 'BigCo@RichDomain.Com\" and gave that as your email when setting up tha account. You don't plan to use that address for any purpose but communications from BigCo to you and from you to them. (Of course these aren't the actual names.) Have I understood the situation correctly?\n\nIt seems that you ar not using 'BigCo\" in trade, nor are you likely to be confused with an official representative of BigCo, so you are not infringing their trademark. However, someone using such an email more generally could perhaps be so confuse, so BigCo has a somewhat legitimate concern, as they cannot know the very limited use you plan to make of this address. \n\nThe only way that the could *force* you not to use such an email address would be via a court order as part of a suit for trademark infringement, whcih under the circumstances I doubt they would get. However, unless they have some sort of contract with you to the contrary, they can control who registers on **their** site. and could refuse to register you using an email address that includes their name or alias. Convincing them to accept your registration, even though it does no harm to them, will almost surely be more trouble than it is worth.\n\nGive them \"BigFirm@RichDomain.Com\" or something else that is not their name, but will suggest their name enough that you will know who it is. This will serve your purpose fully, and avoid a long argument with people who are reading from a script (once you get past the automated process, if you can even do that). \n\nThis is all assuming that I have understood the situation correctly.

While the company cannot legally force the user to change their email address without proving trademark infringement (which is unlikely in this case as the user is not using it in trade or causing confusion), they do have the right to control who registers on their site and under what conditions.

There is excruciating care taken to ensure that the sanctity of consent, notice, mutuality, etc are maintained in all of the common law rulings on what is and isn't a tenancy.\n\nBut when one considers the origins of tenancies, it was really a relationship of subordination to the lord where the tenant I would have imagined had few rights. So from where does it arise, all of this painstaking emphasis on mutuality etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Brief history of landlord and tenant**\n\nHistorically most \"tenancies\" have been defined by long\\-term obligations.\n\nIndeed one of the defining features of serfdom is that the serf *cannot be alienated from the land*. The overlord can be slain and replaced in wars and conquests, but the peasantry who actually operate the land to produce crops cannot be lawfully dispossessed from it so long as they are performing their customary obligations.\n\nThe nature of those customary obligations are such that a peasant family have wide latitude to fulfil them (in other words, it is not dependent on the competence or capability of only a single individual), and they are not so onerous to meet in ordinary times. In times of catastrophe, the lord would be expected to provide forbearance or relief.\n\nIn the event of a persistent and wilful failure to meet customary obligations, there could ultimately be dispossession for the serf, but there was large latitude to manage the situation before it reached the point of actual dispossession of the entire serf family.\n\nThe serf who is considered appurtenant to a agricultural landholding, is to be contrasted with the slave who is considered personal property of a master.\n\nThe laws in England and Wales governing landlord and tenant predate the industrial revolution. Slavery has been repugnant to the common law since time immemorial.\n\nUnder these historical circumstances, a landlord almost never has any right to possess the land itself \\- only to extract customary rents.\n\n**Market reforms**\n\nThere has been a tendency since the industrial revolution for land to change hands more frequently and for tenancies to be auctioned to the market more frequently.\n\nThe time since the industrial revolution has also essentially been characterised by increased violence towards people, sanctified by movements in market prices and the rights to enforce market demands against those who have little or no capability of meeting those demands. Such enforcement occurs by starving people or throwing people out of shelter onto the streets.\n\nIt's primarily under these circumstances of market violence that questions arise like \"what do you do to someone who won't or can't pay the market rent?\".\n\nThere have also been ups and downs, legally, in the balance of rights and obligations between landlords and tenants over the years and centuries. There has also been a shift from people holding primarily agricultural tenures in rural areas, to holding primarily residential tenures in urban areas.\n\n**Circumstances today**\n\nThe post\\-war period that preceded the current era, was characterised both by increasing security and stability of tenure, and by various measured to increase the supply of housing to control the scarcity which the market creates when left to itself.\n\nToday however, we are at a similar nadir of protection for residential tenants as in the Victorian period, and a similar merry\\-go\\-round of short tenancies and evictions of the poor which exists as a kind of violence sanctioned by market verdicts.\n\nIt's under these circumstances of violence that landlords are constantly considering how to enforce rack\\-rents, or enforce evictions on those who can't or won't pay those rents.\n\nBy historical standards, it is already quicker and easier to terminate a tenancy than at most times in history. So they are not particularly \"weighty\" or \"sacred\" today.\n\n**Illegal dispossession**\n\nThere is still a basic modicum of protection for the occupier of land, and this dates back to legal time immemorial, which is that those in current established possession are assumed by the law to have the *right of possession*.\n\nThe main evil with which the law has always been concerned, as far as possession is concerned, is over property disputes erupting into violence, and of gangster groups forming to enforce changes in possession against the will of the occupier (whether with legal rights or not, and whether at the behest of the landlord or merely another would\\-be tenant).\n\nThe solution to this has been to protect the right of *established* possession, and to redirect all other disputes into the courts.\n\nThe emphasis here is less about mutuality or consent, but of allowing enough time for a justice process to take place, and limiting the immediacy of any violent eviction (which can as easily provoke strong emotions in the tenant, and harm the landlord wanting possession as much as the tenant who has possession).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the historical evolution of tenant rights and the current state of residential tenancies in England and Wales?\n\nA) Tenant rights have consistently improved since feudal times, with modern tenants enjoying unprecedented protections and stability.\n\nB) Tenancies have always been short-term arrangements, with landlords historically having broad powers to evict tenants at will.\n\nC) The post-Thatcher era has seen a return to more limited tenant protections, despite a long history of increasingly secure tenancies since the industrial revolution.\n\nD) Serf rights in feudal times were weaker than modern tenant rights, but stronger than slave rights, with modern tenancies representing a middle ground between these historical extremes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage describes how tenant rights and protections have fluctuated over time. It notes that historically, tenancies were often long-term arrangements with significant protections for tenants, especially in agricultural settings. The post-war period saw increasing security and stability of tenure. However, the current \"post-Thatcher era\" is described as a \"nadir of protection for residential tenants,\" comparable to the Victorian period, with easier termination of tenancies and less stability. This represents a regression in tenant rights compared to the immediate post-war period, despite the long history of tenancies and their evolving nature since feudal times and through the industrial revolution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a consistent improvement in tenant rights, which the passage contradicts by describing the current era as having less protection.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it mischaracterizes historical tenancies, which were often long-term and stable, especially in agricultural settings.\n\nOption D, while touching on some correct points about serfs and slaves, oversimplifies the complex evolution of tenancy rights and incorrectly suggests that modern tenancies are a middle ground between these historical forms."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16267/why-is-the-cc-by-license-so-long", "docs_id": 16267, "title": "Why is the CC-BY license so long?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The [CC\\-BY 4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license is 1,958 words.\n\nAs I understand it, the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is functionally equivalent to CC\\-BY: it established that you can do *whatever* with the published work, as long as you give credit.\n\nBut the MIT license is just 162 words, most of which are in the disclaimer.

If a store in your area is advertising what looks to be a bogus \u201cgoing out of business sale,\u201d contact your state Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nIn their answer, they specify to contact your state Attorney General's office. Many states and localities have specific statutes that regulate \"going out of business sales.\"\n\nSan Diego, California, for example, requires a permit from the San Diego Police Department whenever a business has a \"closing\\-out sale.\" Their [permit application](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/treasurer/pdf/new_going_out_of_business_sale.pdf) indicates a list of the types of sales that are subject to the ordinance and closes with:\n\n> Or, any other term tending to convey to the public that upon the disposal of the stocks of goods on hand, the\n> business will cease and be discontinued.\n\nThe permit in San Diego is valid for 60 days and the business is required to provide an inventory of all goods that will be sold as part of the liquidation sale.\n\nThe requirements of the city of San Diego are similar to many other jurisdictions. Some of these requirements are specified at the state level, such as Texas ([Business \\& Commerce Code Section 17\\.45 Deceptive Trade Practices](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/BC/htm/BC.17.htm)), while other states leave it to the localities.\n\nCalifornia doesn't appear to have a statewide \"going out of business sale\" law but they do have other laws and regulations governing false advertising. [California Business and Profession Code section 17500](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=17500.) prohibits untrue or misleading advertising. The California Bureau of Home Furnishings has [promulgated regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/I98A0D020D45811DEA95CA4428EC25FA0?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)) based on this statute to prohibit such sales to only include items that are\n\n> on premises, in the warehouse or in process from previous orders the date the sale is announced\n\nThis regulation for furniture retailers in California is common among the \"going out of business sale\" regulations in that it prohibits the closing business from purchasing new merchandise while liquidating and is one of the reasons that inventory lists are required when applying for a permit for a liquidation sale.\n\nAs a side note, I was always amused by a store on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco that had a \"Going Out For Business\" sign in their store window.

However, in the US and many other countries, truth would be a valid defense, if the person making the statement could prove that the statement is true.\n\nI don't see how it could be construed as solicitation.\n\nIf worn on a shirt into ABC, the management could surely ask the wearer to remove it. If that request is refused, they could ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer has a valid membership, then it would depend on the exact terms of the membership contract, and provisions of local law, whether ABC could insist that the wearer leave, or have the wearer arrested for trespass should the wearer refuse. Any regulations incorporated by reference into the contract would also matter.\n\nAt least in the US. walking back and forth on a public sidewalk just outside ABC's door, wearing such a shirt or carrying a classic picket sign with such a message would be pretty clearly legal, provided that others are not unduly obstructed, and no valid local ordinance is violated.\n\nIn the wear\\-the\\-shirt\\-inside case, if the wearer refuses to remove the shirt or leave, the management would probably call law enforcement. LE will not want to decide whether wearer has the legal right to remain in the club wearing the shirt. They will probably ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer protests that s/he has a valid membership and thus a contractual right to stay, who knows what they would do. If they still ask the wearer to leave, the wearer would be wise to comply and perhaps take legal action to enforce his or her membership rights, which will depend on the contract details as mentioned above. A lawyer would probably be very helpful if the wearer wants to take that route.\n\nThe wearer would be wise to remain polite and appear calm, not yelling or using epithets.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A gym member is upset about a gym closure and wants to wear a shirt with a statement criticizing the gym.

Several years ago I went to the ER to have an injury treated. I presented my insurance at the time of the injury. About a month ago (several years after the ER visit) I was contacted by Phoenix Financial Services, a debt collection agency saying I owed a significant amount of money for the physician portion of the services (the hospital was paid separately). \n\nRecently, I found out from my insurance that the physician's billing services never billed them. My insurer notified me that per the insurer's contract with this physician group, the physician group may not bill the patient until they have submitted a claim. So, not only should this group have never sent this bill to a debt collector, they shouldn't have sent me a bill in the first place.\n\nI called the physician group today and they agreed they will write the bill off after confirming that I am eligible for my insurance.\n\nI have Googled around and learned briefly about the concept of debt validation. Here is what I don't understand. Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, it appears that a debt collector can demand payment (with the threat of harming your credit score) until you request a debt validation. Is it true that a debt collector has no responsibility to validate the debt (e.g. make sure it's legit) until **after** you ask them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is correct, per [15 USC 1692g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692g), that the collector can wait until the consumer files notifies the collector of the debt, before sending verification. The law does not state what form that verification must take, and it would suffice if the collector provided evidence that services were rendered and not paid for. The verification can't just be a restatement that \"you owe $10,000\", but it does not have to be in the form of a court's judgment that the consumer owes money. Taking all of the provisions of the act together, the debt\\-holder's ultimate recourse is to take you to court, so that you will be ordered to pay the debt. One of your options is to tell the debt collector to not contact you, which forces the debt\\-holder to sue you. Demanding verification of the debt is an option, potentially useful in case of a mistake, especially in overcoming the assumption that the collector can otherwise make, that the debt is valid. At some point, one might need to prove in court that the debt is *not* valid (and it didn't come to that in your case). In this case, the debt *is* valid (you did receive the services), the problem is something else.\n\nThere is no statutory requirement that an ER must submit claims to a person's insurance company. They may be required to do so as part of their contract with Acme Insurance, if they have a contract with Acme. That is a matter between Acme and the ER, and you cannot sue the ER for failing to follow the terms of their contract with Acme. You might sue Acme if they fail to perform a contractual obligation with you, but they have no obligation to sue an ER to keep you happy. Suing your insurance company would be pointless, because Acme didn't fail to do what they were supposed to do. Suing the ER would also be pointless, because (or, *assuming*) they didn't promise to bill your insurance first. You would need to look carefully at the terms of your contract with the ER Physicians Group (not the hospital). It is likely that they have some kind of liability disclaimer stating that they are not liable for damage arising from insurance screw\\-ups. And finally, suing the debt collector would be also pointless because from your report of the facts, they didn't violate the law and you don't have a contractual relationship with the collector.\n\nOne can always get a free initial consultation with an attorney to see if he thinks there is a case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of debt collection practices and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which of the following statements is correct regarding debt validation?\n\nA) Debt collectors must validate all debts before contacting consumers for payment.\nB) Consumers can sue debt collectors for failing to validate a debt without being asked.\nC) Debt collectors are only required to validate a debt after receiving a request from the consumer.\nD) Debt validation must always be in the form of a court judgment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, specifically 15 USC 1692g, debt collectors are only required to validate a debt after receiving a request from the consumer. They can initially demand payment without validating the debt. Option A is incorrect because collectors can contact consumers before validation. Option B is wrong because consumers cannot sue collectors for failing to validate without being asked.

While the document is only available in German, it is complete and rather authoritative. I summarize the main points here.\n\nOn a student visa, you are eligible for 120 full days or 240 half days in accordance with \u00a716b (3\\) AufenthG. This is a legal constraint. It is not up to interpretation. Only mandatory internships constitute a right to further work.\n\nIn individual cases, the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde (foreign registration office) can grant authorization for additional work. The authorization will only be granted if the extra work will not jeopardize the purpose of your stay in Germany, which is studying full\\-time. In particular, work in a study\\-related job such as a student assistant will generally be eligible for an extension. This is up to the judgement of the office. Thus, there can be differences between different cities.\n\nIf you intend to surpass the 120/240 day limit, you must get prior authorization. You are otherwise violating the conditions of your visa, which can result in fines and deportation. Additionally, no upstanding employer wants to provide illegal work as they would be subject to penalties themselves.\n\nLinks:\n\n* DAAD guidance on working in Germany (German): [https://static.daad.de/media/daad\\_de/pdfs\\_nicht\\_barrierefrei/in\\-deutschland\\-studieren\\-forschen\\-lehren/daad\\-infoblatt\\_erwerbstaetigkeit.pdf](https://static.daad.de/media/daad_de/pdfs_nicht_barrierefrei/in-deutschland-studieren-forschen-lehren/daad-infoblatt_erwerbstaetigkeit.pdf)\n* \u00a716b AufenthG (English): [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/englisch\\_aufenthg/englisch\\_aufenthg.html\\#p0275](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/englisch_aufenthg.html#p0275)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A foreign student in Germany has worked for 115 full days and is offered an additional 3-week full-time internship related to their field of study.

According to the information provided, foreign students in Germany are limited to 120 full days or 240 half days of work per year on a student visa. While study-related work may be more likely to receive approval for exceeding this limit, it is not automatically permitted. The student in this scenario has already worked 115 days, so the additional 3-week (approximately 15 working days) internship would cause them to exceed the 120-day limit. \n\nIn such cases, prior authorization from the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde (foreign registration office) is required before surpassing the limit, even for study-related work. The authorization is not guaranteed and depends on the office's judgment of whether the additional work will interfere with the student's primary purpose of studying. Failing to obtain this authorization before exceeding the work limit would be a violation of visa conditions, potentially resulting in fines or deportation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because prior authorization is needed, even for study-related work.

The U.S. taxes income, including unearned income such as interest and capital gains from investments, even if the original source of the money (lottery winnings) was from another country. Therefore, any income generated from investing the lottery winnings, whether in the U.S. or abroad, would be subject to U.S. income tax if the person becomes a tax resident of the U.S. Option D is incorrect because merely not working doesn't exempt a person from all tax obligations, especially on unearned income and property taxes.

An invalid provision of a contract is unenforceable. Likewise, and unenforceable provision of a contract is invalid. Here are the definitions of the two from Black's Law Dictionary. (10th. ed. 2014\\) defines them as follows: \n\n> **Unenforceable Contract** \\- An otherwise valid contract that,\n>  because of some technical defect, cannot be fully enforced; a contract\n>  that has some legal consequences but that may not be enforced in an\n>  action for damages or specific performance in the face of certain\n>  defenses, such as the statute of frauds.\n> \n> \n> \u00a0**Invalid Contract** \\- An agreement that is either void or voidable.\n\nAlso, be aware that invalid and unenforceable are *different* than void and voidable contracts. These terms often get confused.\n\nAgain, looking to Black's Law dictionary, \n\n> **Void Contract** 1\\. A contract that is of no legal effect, so that there is really no contract in existence at all. \u2022 A contract may be\n>  void because it is technically defective, contrary to public policy,\n>  or illegal. \u2014 Also termed void agreement. Cf. illegal contract;\n>  unenforceable contract; voidable contract.\n\nStrictly speaking, a \"void contract\" is a contradiction in terms. Void contract describes a situation where despite the intention of the parties, no contract has been made. \n\n> **Voidable Contract** \\- A contract that can be affirmed or rejected at the option of one of the parties; a contract that is void as to the\n>  wrongdoer but not void as to the party wronged, unless that party\n>  elects to treat it as void. \u2014 Also termed voidable agreement.\n> \n> \n> \n> > \u201cA voidable contract is a contract which, in its inception, is\n> >  valid and capable of producing the results of a valid contract, but\n> >  which may be \u2018avoided,\u2019 i.e. rendered void at the option of one (or\n> >  even, though rarely, of both) of the parties.\u201d P.S.

The existing terms already cover the concept of unenforceability.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while \"invalid\" and \"unenforceable\" are indeed synonymous, \"void\" and \"voidable\" are distinct legal concepts from \"invalid\" and \"unenforceable\".

There is a feature called fork. This is described here: [github fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo). What happens if a user forks a repository that contains illegally uploaded material like ebooks?\n\nI think the first thing is a takedown as a consequence of a dmca takedown request. What can happen afterwards? I have several questions:\n\n1. Can a person that forks such a repository be sued?\n2. There might be dozens or hundred of people worldwide who forked this repository as a way to bookmark it. How is this handled in practise? Does the content owner identify every user and sues them in their homecountry? Or is only the initial uploader sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"illegally uploaded material like ebooks\" I presume is meant content uploaded without permission from the copyright owner or any authorized agent, and not under any license which permits such uploading and use.\n\nForking a repository means making copies of the files it contains. If the files were uploaded without a proper license or permission from the copyright holder that would be an act of infringement.\n\nGithub's documentation about forking (linked in the question) says:\n\n> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n> \n> \n> Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.\n\nHowever, GitHub requires that users upload only content that the user owns or has the right to upload and license. (This means that any user who uploads unauthorized files is violating the Github terms.) Thus a forking user may be relying on that assurance from the uploading user. If the forking user is aware that the files are unauthorized (perhaps pirated) then forking is an act of knowing infringement. If the forking user is not aware, and has no reason to think that the files are unauthorized, then any act of infringement is not knowing, much less willful.\n\nUnder [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law, infringement is actionable even if it was not knowing. See [17 USC 501](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#501), which says:\n\n> Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.\n\nBut under [17 USC 504](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504) if the infringer proves that the infringement was \"innocent\" meaning:\n\n> ... that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright\n\nThen statutory damages may be as low as $200 per work infringed.\n\nOn the other hand US statutory damages can be as high as $30,000 or up to $150,000 if willful infringement is proved. The plaintiff has the option to instead get actual damages, plus any profits made by the infringer. In some cases legal fees and costs may be added to the amount of a judgement.\n\nThe details of copyright laws will be different in different countries, but the general principles will be similar.\n\nThus the copyright holder **could** sue any user who forks a repo containing unauthorized content.\n\nAs a practical matter, a holder is not likely to sue a user who merely forked a repo with no good reason to know that the content was unauthorized. The costs of bringing such a suit would probably exceed the damages. However, if any reasonable forking user would have known or suspected that the files were unauthorized, the situation would be different, and a suit might be more likely. A takedown notice might well be served in either case.

Roll cage \\- A protective structure, usually built from chromoly or mild steel tubing, meant to protect all occupants of the vehicle during a roll\\-over accident. This could directly affect crumple zones required by motor vehicle safety standards that are meant to absorb energy during a collision.\n2. Custom bumpers \\- A common upgrade to vehicles that allows mounting of a winch for recovery purposes. Commonly constructed using cold rolled mild steel plate. This also could directly affect crumple zones required by motor vehicle safety standards that are meant to absorb energy during a collision.\n3. Steering and suspension \\- Common upgrade that increases stability, durability, and safety. Usually changed or modified to accommodate other upgrades, and can significantly change the characteristics of the vehicle and increase payload.\n4. Roof\\-top tent \\- A tent usually mounted to the roof of the vehicle, or on a rack mounted above the bed of a pickup truck, made of either hard plastic or vinyl. This could directly affect the stability of the vehicle and raise the center of gravity, therefore possibly exceeding motor vehicle safety standards.\n\nSome states have passed laws that make it a crime to operate a motor vehicle that is \"in violation of state or federal motor vehicle safety standards.\"\n\nFor the purpose of federal safety standards\n\nIf an individual purchased a new vehicle, and outfitted it with aftermarket parts that are not certified under any motor vehicle safety standard, would their vehicle be in violation of U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards?\n\nWould the driver be subject to criminal charges under state statute?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Washington, there is no criminal sanction for installing an \"aftermarket\" product on your vehicle. If we are speaking of non\\-commercial vehicles, the penalties for violating the various safety regulations is a ticket.\n\nThe federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards can be consulted [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V). The criminal penalty provisions are [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-578), as authorized by [49 USC 30170](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/30170) \u2013 basically, lying in a report to the government will get you in trouble. You would have to track down all of the provisions in the regulations, but [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/32506) is the bumper prohibition. The rule prohibits manufacture or importation of a car or a part that doesn't meet the standard. Subsection (b) addresses the \"then added later\" question, generally saying that there is little prohibition against you tweaking your car. First, if you \"had no reason to know, by exercising reasonable care, that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with the standard\", you are not subject to penalty. Usually, people have absolutely no reason to know that some part is unsafe, which is not the same as non\\-compliant, but you might pick up a really cheap bumper having been told that it is cheap because it totally ignores the applicable standards: then you would have reason to know. Used cars and parts are not subject to any federal scrutiny.\n\nThe concept of a \"vehicle in violation\" is a legal misconception. Certain acts violate, objects do not violate. The chokepoint that controls car parts is the \"manufacture or sell\" part of the law, which prevents Auto Zone from selling you a bumper made of clay (it does not prevent you from installing such a bumper \u2013 unless your state has a specific law to that effect).

Based on the information provided, there are several key points to consider:\n\n1. Federal regulations primarily target manufacturers and importers of non-compliant parts, not individual vehicle owners.\n2. There is no blanket federal criminal penalty for installing aftermarket parts on a personal vehicle.\n3. Some states may have laws regarding vehicle modifications, but these typically result in tickets rather than criminal charges.\n4. The owner would likely not be held liable unless they had reason to know the parts were unsafe or non-compliant.\n5. Used cars and parts are generally not subject to the same level of federal scrutiny.\n\nWhile option A is incorrect because it overstates the likelihood of criminal charges, option B is too broad and doesn't account for varying state laws.

The guy led her to believe that he was registered financial advisor (though I didn't find anything to that effect in her contract or their message history). Then she had some bad luck: lost her job, wrecked her car, etc. So she wanted to dip into her savings. She contacted the guy, who agreed to start disbursements from her investments (which he claimed to have a value of several times the principal at that point; he gave an approximate dollar figure). He paid out a couple thousand, then started delaying, temporizing, and making excuses. After a while of this, she started asking for all of her funds to be returned. She continued regularly asking him for her money over the next number of months and this behaviour continued.\n\nNo doubt about it: my friend's trust in this guy was unwise.

Is this a felony?\n\nBoth parties here live in the US state of Washington.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fraud may be a crime, or a tort (civil wrong): only criminal fraud can be a \"felony\". The Washington criminal laws about fraud are [here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.45&full=true), and they are all fairly specific, such as selling or destroying encumbered property (which is a misdemeanor anyhow), or conducting a mock auction. Most frauds are misdemeanors, though forgeries are in the felony category. It also includes identity thefts, again the emphasis being on false documents. Based on your description, this is not a crime, it is a civil wrong, meaning that she will have to sue the guy to get her money back. The Attorney General's office will not get involved unless there is a widespread state interest (for example, very many Washington residents being victimized), and then the involvement would be suing on behalf of the victims.\n\nThat said, if the swindle was carried out by phone, then that is potentially a violation of a federal felony law, [18 USC 1343](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343). It would not matter if the parties are in the same state, because phone service counts as \"interstate commerce\". So the details of phone involvement matter.

Federal wire fraud (18 USC 1343) is a felony and applies even if both parties are in the same state, as phone service is considered interstate commerce. The other options are incorrect because: A) Washington state law doesn't clearly define this as a felony; B) While civil litigation is an option, there is potential for criminal charges under federal law; C) While many frauds in Washington are misdemeanors, this situation doesn't clearly fit state fraud definitions and could be more serious under federal law if phone communications were involved."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57503/is-selling-forgery-producing-equipment-a-crime-in-the-united-states", "docs_id": 57503, "title": "Is selling forgery-producing equipment a crime in the United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are new opportunities emerging in forgery, including digital forgery of e\\-documents, deep\\-fake technology for creating false evidence, and 3D printing of the equipment (e.g., embossing tools) for creating fake official documents.

John Wiley*, makes the \"not for sale in the U.S.\" language inapplicable under U.S. law to a consumer who purchases the book in the U.S. and then resells it used to someone in the U.S.\n\nWhether it bars someone who purchased the books on a wholesale basis in the U.K. from reselling the books in the U.S. depends to some extent on the nature of the contract between the wholesaler and the publisher. For example, if the wholesaler is selling the books on a consignment basis for the publisher and has a right to return the unsold books without payment to the publisher and doesn't have to pay for the books sold until they are sold at retail, the first sale doctrine likewise does not apply.\n\nIt also isn't entirely obvious that the \"first sale doctrine\" makes it illegal to count U.S. sales towards the amount due to the U.S. publisher rather than the U.K. publisher, even if they are sold by WB Books instead of Bathroom Books. (Re the faux names of the publishers, one of the first books I every handled copyright and licensing for, a year out of law school, involved bathroom humor.)\n\nAlso, if the case ends up in a U.K. court before it reaches a U.S. court, the first sale doctrine may or may not apply, but *Kirtsaeng v.

The GDPR creates obligations for data controllers and processors that cannot be waived by user agreements or Terms of Service. Even if users agree to broad terms, the website owner must still comply with GDPR requirements, including:\n\n1. Implementing appropriate data protection measures\n2.

Besides, IP addresses are widely considered as personal data.
