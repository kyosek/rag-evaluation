This makes it a derivative work under copyright law. The use of the same title and some character names contributes to this, but the underlying similarities in the basic premise (Lucifer leaving Hell and running a nightclub) are more crucial in determining its status as a derivative work requiring licensing.

In general, if you are an employee, and you get hurt doing your job (as it seems you did), your employer is liable.\n\nIn most states, employers are required to carry workers compensation policies that pay your injury claim.

Even if I were to list competitors, without me benefitting from any sales that still seems at worst a gray area. Am I misinterpreting soliciting?\n\nAs to recourse, sure they can ask me not to wear it. Were I to refuse to remove the shirt, could they bar me from using the membership without refund for doing something that is legal and within dress code, but deemed naughty in their sight? \n\n**Edit: Background**\n\nI joined XYZ 22 years ago. ABC bought XYZ four years ago. At the time of ABC buying the XYZ, my membership was specifically to location A. It remained so after the purchase and we continued under essentially that agreement (I now pay annual dues to ABC in return for membership to location A). \n\nIn late September, ABC accepted annual payment, then announced about five weeks later they were closing \"my\" gym (location A). It is, IMO, a bit disingenuous at this point to accept payment on an agreement they likely knew they were going to alter. On Nov. 30, they closed location A and transferred me to location B.\n\nAs to why it's bothersome, admittedly part of the issue is annoyance with just being told, in effect, \"We broke the agreement, and you'll take what we substitute.\" But more materially it's a matter of:\n\n1. adding 9\\-15 minutes travel to every workout;\n2. being more crowded;\n3. more tightly spacing equipment;\n4. less of the equipment I use;\n5. worse condition of the equipment;\n6. fewer \"spare\" weights; and\n7. smaller open training area.\n\n**Two have asked:**\n\nPrior to reaching this point, I attempted...\n\n* a request over their website without response;\n* speaking to a person in the cancellation department.

ABCGym has substituted an inferior\\-to\\-me option.\n\ncould certainly be considered as defamatory. However, in the US and many other countries, truth would be a valid defense, if the person making the statement could prove that the statement is true.\n\nI don't see how it could be construed as solicitation.\n\nIf worn on a shirt into ABC, the management could surely ask the wearer to remove it. If that request is refused, they could ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer has a valid membership, then it would depend on the exact terms of the membership contract, and provisions of local law, whether ABC could insist that the wearer leave, or have the wearer arrested for trespass should the wearer refuse. Any regulations incorporated by reference into the contract would also matter.\n\nAt least in the US. walking back and forth on a public sidewalk just outside ABC's door, wearing such a shirt or carrying a classic picket sign with such a message would be pretty clearly legal, provided that others are not unduly obstructed, and no valid local ordinance is violated.\n\nIn the wear\\-the\\-shirt\\-inside case, if the wearer refuses to remove the shirt or leave, the management would probably call law enforcement. LE will not want to decide whether wearer has the legal right to remain in the club wearing the shirt. They will probably ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer protests that s/he has a valid membership and thus a contractual right to stay, who knows what they would do. If they still ask the wearer to leave, the wearer would be wise to comply and perhaps take legal action to enforce his or her membership rights, which will depend on the contract details as mentioned above.

Several years ago I went to the ER to have an injury treated. I presented my insurance at the time of the injury. About a month ago (several years after the ER visit) I was contacted by Phoenix Financial Services, a debt collection agency saying I owed a significant amount of money for the physician portion of the services (the hospital was paid separately). \n\nRecently, I found out from my insurance that the physician's billing services never billed them. My insurer notified me that per the insurer's contract with this physician group, the physician group may not bill the patient until they have submitted a claim. So, not only should this group have never sent this bill to a debt collector, they shouldn't have sent me a bill in the first place.\n\nI called the physician group today and they agreed they will write the bill off after confirming that I am eligible for my insurance.\n\nI have Googled around and learned briefly about the concept of debt validation. Here is what I don't understand. Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, it appears that a debt collector can demand payment (with the threat of harming your credit score) until you request a debt validation. Is it true that a debt collector has no responsibility to validate the debt (e.g. make sure it's legit) until **after** you ask them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is correct, per [15 USC 1692g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692g), that the collector can wait until the consumer files notifies the collector of the debt, before sending verification. The law does not state what form that verification must take, and it would suffice if the collector provided evidence that services were rendered and not paid for. The verification can't just be a restatement that \"you owe $10,000\", but it does not have to be in the form of a court's judgment that the consumer owes money. Taking all of the provisions of the act together, the debt\\-holder's ultimate recourse is to take you to court, so that you will be ordered to pay the debt. One of your options is to tell the debt collector to not contact you, which forces the debt\\-holder to sue you. Demanding verification of the debt is an option, potentially useful in case of a mistake, especially in overcoming the assumption that the collector can otherwise make, that the debt is valid. At some point, one might need to prove in court that the debt is *not* valid (and it didn't come to that in your case). In this case, the debt *is* valid (you did receive the services), the problem is something else.\n\nThere is no statutory requirement that an ER must submit claims to a person's insurance company. They may be required to do so as part of their contract with Acme Insurance, if they have a contract with Acme. That is a matter between Acme and the ER, and you cannot sue the ER for failing to follow the terms of their contract with Acme. You might sue Acme if they fail to perform a contractual obligation with you, but they have no obligation to sue an ER to keep you happy. Suing your insurance company would be pointless, because Acme didn't fail to do what they were supposed to do. Suing the ER would also be pointless, because (or, *assuming*) they didn't promise to bill your insurance first. You would need to look carefully at the terms of your contract with the ER Physicians Group (not the hospital). It is likely that they have some kind of liability disclaimer stating that they are not liable for damage arising from insurance screw\\-ups. And finally, suing the debt collector would be also pointless because from your report of the facts, they didn't violate the law and you don't have a contractual relationship with the collector.\n\nOne can always get a free initial consultation with an attorney to see if he thinks there is a case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), when is a debt collector required to provide validation of a debt?\n\nA) Immediately upon contacting the consumer about the debt\nB) Only after the consumer requests debt validation in writing\nC) Within 30 days of first contacting the consumer, regardless of consumer request\nD) Never, as debt validation is not required by the FDCPA\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, specifically 15 USC 1692g, debt collectors are not required to validate a debt until after the consumer requests it. The law allows collectors to demand payment and even threaten credit score damage before validation is requested. Only when the consumer notifies the collector and requests validation does the collector become obligated to provide it. This means option B is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the collector is not required to provide validation immediately upon first contact. Option C is incorrect because the 30-day timeframe applies to the consumer's right to request validation, not the collector's obligation to provide it without request.

According to the information provided, written content that involves creativity, including contract language, is protected by copyright unless explicitly placed in the public domain. Using a specific clause verbatim from another company's terms of service would likely constitute copyright infringement. However, the validity of a contract is separate from copyright issues.

They are not linked to any user (there are no users in the system actually). Just the phone number in a hashed form (same things as storing a hashed password).\n\nFrom what I understand if the data is anonymised there is no problem, but I am still not sure, because if you have the salt you can still create hashes of phone numbers and compare them to the hashes that exists in the database. But this gives you nothing even if you succeed, except that the phone exists there.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: But that a phone number exists in your collection *is* interesting information. Since phone numbers are identifying and so short that they are guessable, hashing does not provide anonymization. Hashing could still be an appropriate safety measure or pseudonymization technique. Note that the salt is typically stored as part of the hash value, and should not be considered to be a secret key.\n\nIf the information had been anonymized it wouldn't be personal information and the GDPR wouldn't apply.

What is the purpose of processing?\n\t* Some purposes like national security or purely personal and household purposes are exempt from the GDPR\n2. What is the legal basis for this purpose?\n\t* E.g. consent, legitimate interest, legal obligations, \u2026\n3.

Those are examples involving special categories of data per GDPR Art 9, so likely far more sensitive than the context of this question.

Hashing phone numbers does not provide true anonymization, as phone numbers are short and guessable, making it possible to identify individuals indirectly.

It is not up to interpretation. Only mandatory internships constitute a right to further work.\n\nIn individual cases, the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde (foreign registration office) can grant authorization for additional work. The authorization will only be granted if the extra work will not jeopardize the purpose of your stay in Germany, which is studying full\\-time. In particular, work in a study\\-related job such as a student assistant will generally be eligible for an extension. This is up to the judgement of the office. Thus, there can be differences between different cities.\n\nIf you intend to surpass the 120/240 day limit, you must get prior authorization. You are otherwise violating the conditions of your visa, which can result in fines and deportation.

An invalid provision of a contract is unenforceable. Likewise, and unenforceable provision of a contract is invalid. Here are the definitions of the two from Black's Law Dictionary. (10th. ed. 2014\\) defines them as follows: \n\n> **Unenforceable Contract** \\- An otherwise valid contract that,\n>  because of some technical defect, cannot be fully enforced; a contract\n>  that has some legal consequences but that may not be enforced in an\n>  action for damages or specific performance in the face of certain\n>  defenses, such as the statute of frauds.\n> \n> \n> \u00a0**Invalid Contract** \\- An agreement that is either void or voidable.\n\nAlso, be aware that invalid and unenforceable are *different* than void and voidable contracts. These terms often get confused.\n\nAgain, looking to Black's Law dictionary, \n\n> **Void Contract** 1\\. A contract that is of no legal effect, so that there is really no contract in existence at all. \u2022 A contract may be\n>  void because it is technically defective, contrary to public policy,\n>  or illegal. \u2014 Also termed void agreement. Cf. illegal contract;\n>  unenforceable contract; voidable contract.\n\nStrictly speaking, a \"void contract\" is a contradiction in terms. Void contract describes a situation where despite the intention of the parties, no contract has been made. \n\n> **Voidable Contract** \\- A contract that can be affirmed or rejected at the option of one of the parties; a contract that is void as to the\n>  wrongdoer but not void as to the party wronged, unless that party\n>  elects to treat it as void. \u2014 Also termed voidable agreement.\n> \n> \n> \n> > \u201cA voidable contract is a contract which, in its inception, is\n> >  valid and capable of producing the results of a valid contract, but\n> >  which may be \u2018avoided,\u2019 i.e. rendered void at the option of one (or\n> >  even, though rarely, of both) of the parties.\u201d P.S.

According to the information provided, invalid and unenforceable are equivalent terms in contract law. The severability clause allows for such an invalid/unenforceable provision to be removed from the contract while the rest remains in force. Option A is incorrect because the severability clause prevents the entire contract from being void. Option B is incorrect because the usurious clause is not voidable, but invalid/unenforceable.

There is a feature called fork. This is described here: [github fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo). What happens if a user forks a repository that contains illegally uploaded material like ebooks?\n\nI think the first thing is a takedown as a consequence of a dmca takedown request. What can happen afterwards? I have several questions:\n\n1. Can a person that forks such a repository be sued?\n2. There might be dozens or hundred of people worldwide who forked this repository as a way to bookmark it. How is this handled in practise? Does the content owner identify every user and sues them in their homecountry? Or is only the initial uploader sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"illegally uploaded material like ebooks\" I presume is meant content uploaded without permission from the copyright owner or any authorized agent, and not under any license which permits such uploading and use.\n\nForking a repository means making copies of the files it contains. If the files were uploaded without a proper license or permission from the copyright holder that would be an act of infringement.\n\nGithub's documentation about forking (linked in the question) says:\n\n> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n> \n> \n> Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.\n\nHowever, GitHub requires that users upload only content that the user owns or has the right to upload and license. (This means that any user who uploads unauthorized files is violating the Github terms.) Thus a forking user may be relying on that assurance from the uploading user. If the forking user is aware that the files are unauthorized (perhaps pirated) then forking is an act of knowing infringement. If the forking user is not aware, and has no reason to think that the files are unauthorized, then any act of infringement is not knowing, much less willful.\n\nUnder [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law, infringement is actionable even if it was not knowing. See [17 USC 501](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#501), which says:\n\n> Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.\n\nBut under [17 USC 504](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504) if the infringer proves that the infringement was \"innocent\" meaning:\n\n> ... that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright\n\nThen statutory damages may be as low as $200 per work infringed.\n\nOn the other hand US statutory damages can be as high as $30,000 or up to $150,000 if willful infringement is proved. The plaintiff has the option to instead get actual damages, plus any profits made by the infringer. In some cases legal fees and costs may be added to the amount of a judgement.\n\nThe details of copyright laws will be different in different countries, but the general principles will be similar.\n\nThus the copyright holder **could** sue any user who forks a repo containing unauthorized content.\n\nAs a practical matter, a holder is not likely to sue a user who merely forked a repo with no good reason to know that the content was unauthorized. The costs of bringing such a suit would probably exceed the damages. However, if any reasonable forking user would have known or suspected that the files were unauthorized, the situation would be different, and a suit might be more likely. A takedown notice might well be served in either case. Such a notice might cause Github to delete or lock the repository.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A GitHub user forks a repository containing unauthorized copyrighted ebooks.

However, if the user can prove they were unaware and had no reason to believe their actions constituted copyright infringement (i.e., \"innocent infringement\"), statutory damages may be reduced to as low as $200 per work infringed. This aligns with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lack of awareness doesn't prevent a lawsuit. Option B is false because profit is not a requirement for infringement.

They could be custom ordered to fit. They could be designed, built, and installed by a local specialty auto shop or the owner of the vehicle.\n\nThese aftermarket parts could include:\n\n1.

You would have to track down all of the provisions in the regulations, but [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/32506) is the bumper prohibition. The rule prohibits manufacture or importation of a car or a part that doesn't meet the standard. Subsection (b) addresses the \"then added later\" question, generally saying that there is little prohibition against you tweaking your car. First, if you \"had no reason to know, by exercising reasonable care, that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with the standard\", you are not subject to penalty. Usually, people have absolutely no reason to know that some part is unsafe, which is not the same as non\\-compliant, but you might pick up a really cheap bumper having been told that it is cheap because it totally ignores the applicable standards: then you would have reason to know. Used cars and parts are not subject to any federal scrutiny.\n\nThe concept of a \"vehicle in violation\" is a legal misconception. Certain acts violate, objects do not violate. The chokepoint that controls car parts is the \"manufacture or sell\" part of the law, which prevents Auto Zone from selling you a bumper made of clay (it does not prevent you from installing such a bumper \u2013 unless your state has a specific law to that effect).

Based on your description, this is not a crime, it is a civil wrong, meaning that she will have to sue the guy to get her money back. The Attorney General's office will not get involved unless there is a widespread state interest (for example, very many Washington residents being victimized), and then the involvement would be suing on behalf of the victims.\n\nThat said, if the swindle was carried out by phone, then that is potentially a violation of a federal felony law, [18 USC 1343](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343).

John Wiley*, makes the \"not for sale in the U.S.\" language inapplicable under U.S. law to a consumer who purchases the book in the U.S. and then resells it used to someone in the U.S.\n\nWhether it bars someone who purchased the books on a wholesale basis in the U.K. from reselling the books in the U.S. depends to some extent on the nature of the contract between the wholesaler and the publisher. For example, if the wholesaler is selling the books on a consignment basis for the publisher and has a right to return the unsold books without payment to the publisher and doesn't have to pay for the books sold until they are sold at retail, the first sale doctrine likewise does not apply.\n\nIt also isn't entirely obvious that the \"first sale doctrine\" makes it illegal to count U.S. sales towards the amount due to the U.S. publisher rather than the U.K. publisher, even if they are sold by WB Books instead of Bathroom Books. (Re the faux names of the publishers, one of the first books I every handled copyright and licensing for, a year out of law school, involved bathroom humor.)\n\nAlso, if the case ends up in a U.K. court before it reaches a U.S. court, the first sale doctrine may or may not apply, but *Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley* will not be binding precedent, so the applicable rule of law might be different.

(this was explained to me to be the case)\n\nSo, in short, I received a hit and run without any knowledge of there being a hit. I have not received a court date yet(this all happened yesterday morning), but I am very anxious and frankly, scared. What can I do now?\n\nextra info: I am in the state of Florida and both vehicles are insured.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So I found information from a [law firm in Florida](http://www.husseinandwebber.com/crimes/traffic-crimes/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident/) about Hit and Run Cases. You definitely want a lawyer as it is a $500 fine and/or 60 days in jail for your case (property damage, no injury or loss of life).\n\nThe good news is that if you can argue the case correctly, it's very easy to get a Not Guilty verdict. Under Florida Law, a Hit and Run must meet the following criteria to legally find someone guilty:\n\n> 1. Disputes as to the identity of the driver;\n> 2. Lack of knowledge that a crash occurred;\n> 3. Lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property;\n> 4. The failure to stop was not willful, but was dictated by circumstances;\n> 5. The defendant stopped as close as possible to the site of the accident;\n> 6. The other driver refused to receive identifying information\n> 7. The other driver became belligerent, necessitating that the defendant leave the scene to call police;\n> 8. The assistance rendered was \u2018reasonable\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\n\nGiven that you had no lack of knowledge that a crash occurred (2\\) AND lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property (3\\.) AND you would have stopped but for the circumstances of the event prevented you from recieiving knowledge of that the crash had occured (4\\) you already fail to meet 3 of the 8 criteria. This should be easy to argue in and of itself, but where you need a lawyer to assist is in criteria 7\\. While you were never fearing the other driver to such a degree that you needed to call the police, his behavior was interpreted by you as \"road rage\" and you had a reasonable fear to not wish to engage him. It's not rules as written, but it could be that the rules allow for leaving the scene because of the plaintiff's behavior and could be valid in other forms. I'll admit, this will vary wildly on the judge's own interpretation of that rule, BUT it's worth a try.\n\nKeep in mind with all of these, the Prosecution will be required to prove all 8 facts against you, while you only have to disprove one, to some level of doubt. As an armchair jury, I have no facts to support your story, but I have no facts to doubt it either. And when doubt happens, you must assume innocence.\n\nIt would help if you had any hint of the officers attitude at the time. Was he friendly? Dismissive? Distracted? What was the guy who hit you's attitude towards the situation? Was he constantly yelling at you and the officer? Was he quiet and separated?\n\nEither way, get a lawyer because 60 days of jail time and a $500 fine is not something you want to fight by yourself. Make calls (the ticketing officer should have a work number or other contact information on the ticket.).

According to the documentation, if the prosecution cannot prove all eight facts, the defendant may be found Not Guilty. The three factors in option C - no knowledge of the crash, no knowledge of impact, and failure to stop being dictated by circumstances - are specifically mentioned as criteria 2, 3, and 4 in the list provided. These factors directly relate to the scenario described in the question where the driver claims to be unaware of the collision.

For any such *x* and *y* I can imagine that clause occurring in a *pre*nuptial agreement. And it would be enforceable under [contract law](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/contract-law/info) because I suspect that *marriage* is a form of *consideration*.\n\nBut after the marriage has been established, why would anyone unilaterally forfeit a right? I can only think of twothree reasons:\n\n1. The forfeit is mutual: I.e., both spouses agree to an identical clause. *Or*, the spouses agree to substantially equal clauses. (E.g., one spouse forfeits *y* if *x*, and the other forfeits *b* if *a*; where a\u00b7b \u2248 x\u00b7y.)\n2. One spouse requires the contract as a condition of continuing the marriage. However, **I am dubious that this scenario is enforceable**. I.e., if I one day say to my spouse, \"I'm divorcing you unless you agree to give up your marital right to *y*,\" I have a suspicion that such an \"agreement\" might not withstand an artful legal challenge for several reasons: The *consideration* I'm offering is something I already pledged. This is like demanding a contract renegotiation once a counterparty has undertaken work. It *seems* like something that would be ripe for estoppel.\n3. (Thanks to @ohwilleke for noting this one:) The spouse forfeiting a right stands to gain something in exchange. E.g., in order for one spouse to receive an inheritance, the other must disclaim any right to it should the marriage later be dissolved.

The exception to double jeopardy you're referring to applies to charges from separate sovereigns. When considering whether two entities can both charge someone, you trace back each of them to the sovereign power that gives them their authority. States are considered sovereign, as are Indian tribes with respect to crimes committed by Indians (although for certain serious crimes like murder, Congress arguably stripped tribal courts of jurisdiction with the Major Crimes Act). The United States is of course sovereign.\n\nThe military is *not* sovereign. Military charges are based on the sovereignty of the United States, so double jeopardy applies between military and civilian federal courts. Likewise, US territories (and DC) are not sovereign and have criminal jurisdiction based on the sovereignty of the United States, so territorial (and DC) charges are subject to double jeopardy with each other, with military charges, and with civilian federal charges.

There is no formal contract between the owner and the individual storing goods, as there was no exchange of consideration - an essential element of a contract. However, the owner has allowed the goods to be stored on their property, creating a situation where they have taken possession of someone else's property. In such cases, the owner must provide reasonable notice before disposing of the goods to allow the owner time to retrieve them. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no implicit contract due to the lack of consideration. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because although there's no formal agreement, the owner can't immediately dispose of someone else's property without notice. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while promissory estoppel could potentially be claimed, it's unlikely to succeed in forcing indefinite free storage, especially given the informal nature of the arrangement."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86825/how-do-you-prove-a-fact-at-issue-in-litigation", "docs_id": 86825, "title": "How do you prove a fact at issue in litigation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many questions on this site ask some variant of the question: \"how does one prove something in court?\" Paraphrasing a few:\n\n* [How do you prove that someone forged your signature](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/5778/46948)?\n* [How do you prove that you didn't misuse a product](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86479/when-claiming-under-manufacturers-warranty-how-can-plaintiff-prove-never-breac)?\n* [How do you prove money went missing](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86813/is-there-a-limit-to-how-far-and-deep-a-judge-can-look-into-familys-finances-as)?\n* [How do you prove somebody accepted an EULA](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7254/proof-of-eula-acceptance)?\n* [How do you prove that you owned an object before a certain date](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/86109/46948)?\n* [How do you prove ownership of a pseudonym?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/86736/3066)\n\nGenerally, how do you prove a fact in issue in litigation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Special regimes\n\nFor some kinds of questions there are special presumptions or forms of evidence that are specified by statute. For example, in Canada and the United States, registering a copyright creates presumptive proof that the copyright exists and is owned by the registrant. In Canada, breathalyzer results are conclusive proof of the blood alcohol concentration if certain conditions are met.\n\nSome of these regimes are not subject to challenge: they are legal facts even if they are not objectively true (e.g. the breathalyser results). Others create presumptions that can be overcome by contrary evidence (e.g. copyright ownership).\n\n### The default: present relevant evidence, including testimonial evidence\n\nBut outside of special regimes, **you prove a fact by introducing evidence**. The default is that **all relevant evidence that bears on a material fact is admissible**. Evidence is relevant when, if is were to be accepted, it would make the fact in issue more or less likely to be true. Evidence comes in many forms: testimony of the parties or witnesses, documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert opinion evidence.\n\nIf you are wondering, \"How do I prove X?\" Ask yourself, why do you believe X? Or, how do you know X? Or, how has the event X left its mark on the world? Whatever has led you to believe X probably is the evidence that you would want to introduce to the court to help prove X. Perhaps you saw X: you can tell the court you saw X. Perhaps you took a photo of X: you can present that photo in court. Perhaps you have a receipt for X: you can show that receipt in court. Perhaps X is a proposition about your own actions: you can tell the court about those.\n\n### Obtaining the evidence\n\nEvidence can be obtained from the other party during the discovery process, or from third\\-parties using subpoenas, subject to objections relating to relevance or privilege.\n\n### Not all (potentially) relevant evidence is admissible\n\nHowever, some evidence will be inadmissible despite it being potentially relevant. I will only present a few categories, some very general and some more specific:\n\n* hearsay (unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay exclusion),\n* privileged material (unless it is a case\\-by\\-case privilege or a discretionary privilege and the person seeking to admit the evidence demonstrates to the judge that it should be admitted),\n* sexual history evidence of a sexual assault complainant when it will be used to support an inference that the complainant is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject\\-matter of the charge or is less worthy of belief (this is because it has been recognized as *not* relevant for this purpose),\n* material that was obtained in contravention of the *Charter* and where the court has decided that the remedy for the *Charter* violation is exclusion of the evidence (in the United States, there is stricter, exclusionary rule),\n* there are many more.\n\nThere are also some meta\\-rules about the evidence that may be used to impugn a witness's credibility, themselves at trial to provide evidence, but for now I am leaving those out of this fairly summary answer.\n\n### Weighing the evidence\n\nThe trier of fact (the judge or a jury) then is to weigh all the admissible evidence, including by weighing the witness and party testimony according to its [credibility and reliability](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/85118/46948) after testing through cross\\-examination, to come to a conclusion on the ultimate question(s) at issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit, the plaintiff claims the defendant forged their signature on a contract.

Similarly, the tenant remains bound by their obligations under the lease. This ensures continuity and protects the tenant's rights even if the property changes hands. The situation in Hong Kong, where specific clauses may be needed to protect tenants, appears to be an exception rather than the norm in common law systems."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19877/what-do-you-sue-for-in-a-breach-of-warranty-case-when-no-other-repair-is-availab", "docs_id": 19877, "title": "What do you sue for in a breach of warranty case when no other repair is available?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We purchased a spa from a local dealer and had it delivered approximately one year ago. We immediately reported that over 50% of the jets were not working or working poorly, and were also not adjustable. Since then we've gone back and forth with the seller, with them insisting that they will only replace the jets if we pay several hundred dollars for a warranty trip fee, plus the cost of the jets and labor if they deem the problem not their fault.\n\nI'm unwilling to agree to the above because I don't believe the warranty trip fee is valid, as they have breached the initial contract by not delivering the spa in working order. So this is a contracts issue before a warranty issue (even if I accepted that a \"warranty trip fee\" is anything other than criminally unethical). Further, I'm unwilling to put the determination of whether they are at fault or not solely in their hands, as that gives them complete freedom to avoid responsibility. In any case, both they and the manufacturer are no longer responding to me.\n\nNormally in a case like this I'd look for the next closest authorized servicer, pay them to come out and do the repair, then sue the seller for the cost of said repairs. However, the next closest servicer is 82 miles away and won't go outside their area. And even if we could get the seller to respond, they will not come out unless we agree to the conditions noted above, which I won't agree to as I believe that would constitute a settlement and negate my right to sue for the charges back. So we're now in the position of owning a $6k spa that doesn't work right, and that cannot be serviced (because the seller will no longer respond).\n\nIn this case I'm unsure how to quantify the damages, as no amount of money will allow us to get a spa in working order as agreed upon in the original contract. Do we sue under breach of contract and demand the return of 100% of our money and for them to come take the spa? Is there some legal value placed upon a warranty that we can sue for? Do we hire a non\\-authorized servicer and sue for their cost plus the cost of any future issues caused by them being non\\-authorized? Do we sue under some theory of 'emotional suffering'?\n\nWhat is the appropriate way to quantify this case for submission to small claims, given that the courts cannot technically compel the seller to service our spa?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of issues here. One is whether they can charge a warranty trip fee: that would depend on what the contract says \u2013 such fees are possible (but may be prohibited by state law). Such a charge could be motivated by the manufacturer not compensating a dealer for warranty repair travel (also by granting a low number of hours of compensation for a warranty job). The second is whether you are at fault, the dealer is at fault, or the manufacturer is at fault: and, what evidence is there for that conclusion. A standard approach is to get an independent expert to look at the problem and determine what the probable cause of failure is \u2013 that may however be impossible. In that case, you are pretty much at the mercy of the dealer's employees, who hopefully will write up an accurate assessment of the problem. Especially if the manufacturer and seller are not responding, you can't count on ordinary business goodwill to ease the process.\n\nIf the seller can legally charge a warranty trip fee, then you can't legally force them to perform service without paying the fee. If they *can't* legally charge that fee, then you have a different problem, because they should have come and repaired the unit. They are not, however, obligated to replace the defective stuff or give a refund (without court order), assuming that your state does not have a spa lemon law (I've never heard of such a thing: lemon laws are about new vehicles).\n\nIf the dealer and manufacturer simply refuse to service your unit, the basic scheme would be to get it repaired by someone else (at whatever cost) and sue after the fact for damages \u2013 that's not at all a risk\\-free proposition. Alternatively, you could sue one or both for specific performance, i.e. get the court to force them to fix the problem, but as you know that is beyond the reach of small claims court. Or, you sue for a refund of the sale price (up to the state limit). The sale price should be easy to establish; dealer and seller refusal should be easy to establish (but be sure that you don't extrapolate from \"refuse to do in a way I want\" to \"refuse\"). Having the evidence in hand is mandatory. Evidence of non\\-functioning shouldn't be too hard, and you would also need to show that you are not the cause of the spa not functioning. If they have some fact in their possession that constitutes evidence that you are to blame, you have a right to see that evidence (through discovery), and they can do likewise to you.\n\nIf their refusal is based on your insistence that they drop the trip fee but they will do the work if you pay the fee, then you could do that, and if the fee is not legal, then you can sue to recover that amount. \n\nThere is nothing special about suing for a refund vs. suing for the cost of repair, in terms of what small claims court does.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchases a $6,000 spa that arrives with over 50% of the jets not working properly.

This is not the case in Wisconsin (at least not usually). So my question is, are there any states/countries you know of where propensity evidence is allowed, whether generally or in exceptional cases?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThe following is in response to @ohwilleke's answer.\n\n> (2\\) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\nThe item *(...) such as proving motive (...)* catches my eye. If I understand correctly, the propensity evidence must suggest motive without invoking an argument reliant on character. Let me explain my (mis)understanding with an example:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for theft. They have a criminal history of theft. The prosecutors say that due to the propensity evidence, the defendant has a thieving character (or more extremely, has kleptomania), and thus, has motives for theft.\n\nIn the above example, the propensity evidence is inadmissible, because it argues **via** character, despite ultimately making a claim about motive.\n\nAn allowed example would then be:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for the theft of ancient Egyptian relics. The defendant has a criminal history of stealing ancient Egyptian relics. The prosecutors use this propensity evidence to suggest the defendant has a collection of Egyptian relics, and/or a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics.\n\nThe first suggestion is not a matter of character, but simply a claim about the defendant possessing a collection. The second suggestion is more borderline, as whether one is to view \"a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics\" as a part of their character, or as merely a non\\-physical possession/quirk is hard to say for me.\n\nSo, is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that propensity evidence can only be circumstantial evidence and that it is generally inadmissible.\n\nBut we should start by clarifying what \"circumstantial evidence\" means. It is not the opposite of legal evidence, but more like the opposite of direct evidence. Direct evidence is evidence that independently establishes a fact in question, while circumstantial evidence is evidence that gives rise to an inference that a fact in question is true. There is a misconception that circumstantial evidence is somehow inadmissible or inferior to direct evidence, but the truth is that the vast majority of evidence is circumstantial.\n\nSo if you are on trial for murder, direct evidence would include your confession, an eyewitness account of the murder, and surveillance video of you killing the victim. Circumstantial evidence would include things like the victim's blood on your clothes, a taxi driver's testimony that he dropped you off at the victim's apartment just before the murder happened, or surveillance video of you exiting the cab and entering the apartment.\n\nPropensity evidence is evidence that a person is likely to have acted one way in this case because they have acted that same way in the past. It is therefore never going to be direct evidence and always going to be circumstantial evidence, because it never explicitly says \"the defendant did it,\" but rather says \"the defendant did it before, so maybe he did it again.\"\n\nThe general rule is that propensity evidence is inadmissible. [Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404). It sometimes comes in anyway, though, for various reasons. If a defendant is facing trespass charges, for instance, a prosecutor would want to introduce evidence that the defendant has previously been convicted of trespassing. The defense will object that it's propensity evidence, but the prosecutor will respond that it's admissible if he's using it to establish something *other than* the likelihood that the defendant did the same thing again. If the prosecutor needs to prove that the defendant knew he was not allowed on the property, the trespass conviction is very strong evidence on that point.\n\nAnother common exception is in sexual\\-assault cases, where some jurisdictions allow this type of evidence. Indeed, Wisconsin is among the states that explicitly permit evidence of the defendant's previous convictions for certain sex crimes to demonstrate that he committed a sex crime again in the current case. [WI Stat \u00a7 904\\.04(2\\)(b)](https://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2012/chapter-904/section-904.04).\n\nLouisiana likewise allows propensity evidence to establish that the defendant has a history of \"sexually assaultive behavior\" or a \"lustful disposition toward children.\" [C.E. 412\\.2\\.](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.2.html) Likewise, the defendant may be able to introduce evidence that the victim previously consented to sex and is therefore likely to have consented to sex in the current case. [C.E. 412](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.html).\n\n**EDIT:**\nTo address your examples, then, I would say that that the first would probably not survive a Rule 404(b) objection, and the second one would stand a better chance. On the second one, the defense should argue that the court should allow evidence of the defendant's interest in Egyptology, but not evidence of the convictions, as that would allow the jury to consider his motive without being diverted into propensity territory. The prosecution should probably counter that the defendant's convictions show more than just the *existence* of a motive, but also the *strength* of that motive, as well as perhaps that the defendant had the prior knowledge and skill that would be necessary to pull off a museum heist. The judge could go probably rule either way without being reversed.\n\nI would clarify one point on how to analyze and characterize this evidence: Rule 404 deals with propensity evidence, i.e., evidence that is meant to demonstrate that a person acted in conformity with his character. Subsection (a) deals with establishing propensity through \"character evidence,\" which is evidence that the defendant's character or character traits are consistent with the conduct in question at trial; while subsection (b) deals with establishing propensity through \"other acts\" evidence, which is evidence that the defendant previously engaged in conduct that is consistent with the conduct at question of trial.\n\nBoth types of evidence \\-\\- character evidence and other\\-acts evidence \\-\\- are inadmissible to establish propensity, but they may be admissible to establish motive, plan, preparation, etc. So when your defendant's previous convictions are offered to prove motive to expand his Egyptology collection and not to establish propensity, the court could allow them into evidence not because they are *admissible* propensity evidence, but rather because they are not propensity evidence at all.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal trial for art theft, the prosecution wants to introduce evidence of the defendant's prior convictions for stealing ancient Egyptian artifacts.

It avoids using the prior convictions as propensity or character evidence, which would generally be inadmissible under Rule 404. Instead, it offers the evidence to prove motive, which is one of the permitted uses under Rule 404(b)(2). This approach demonstrates the defendant's specific interest in Egyptian artifacts without relying on general character traits or propensity to commit theft.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it explicitly uses the evidence to show propensity, which is generally not allowed. Option B is also incorrect as it relies on character evidence, which is typically inadmissible. Option D is incorrect because circumstantial evidence does not directly prove a fact, and this evidence would not directly prove the defendant committed this specific crime."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82161/does-a-company-own-third-party-freebies-given-to-employees-based-on-said-employe", "docs_id": 82161, "title": "Does a company own third-party freebies given to employees based on said employees&#39; status outside the company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a company paid the money for goods/services, and a special extra was provided to the employee on the virtue of the employee's life outside the company, who owns that something extra?
