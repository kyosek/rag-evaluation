The life tenant is generally responsible for expenses belonging to the tenant, which are usually variable costs. The tenancy agreement should specify which expenses belong to the owners and which to the tenant.

Therefore, the passport itself remains valid despite the deportation stamp. However, the presence of this stamp will likely lead to increased scrutiny from visa officers and border guards when the individual attempts to enter other countries. This is because a prior deportation is often seen as a red flag in immigration processes, potentially indicating previous non-compliance with immigration laws.

In the seventeenth century, English courts of law exercised an ancient jurisdiction that was inflexible and formalistic, while courts of equity exercised a more wide\\-ranging [ecclesiastical jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_jurisdiction) according to the Lord Chancellor's conscience. Law and equity were 'fused' to some extent by the [*Judicature Acts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicature_Acts) from 1873 onwards, but the distinction still has practical significance.\n\nIn many cases, equity provides a remedy where the strict application of the common law could result in **unconscionable** outcomes. For example, it is equity which requires a [trustee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee) to manage trust property in the interest of beneficiaries, even though the trustee is the legal owner of the property. Equity may also require people to return money they have received by accident or where it would be unconscionable for them to retain it, even though there is no relationship between the parties under the common law of tort or contract.\n\nThe concept of unconscionability is closely linked to the idea of exercising powers 'faithfully.' Equity is the source of [**fiduciary** duties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary), which are essentially legally\\-enforceable duties to be **faithful** to a principal.

The concept of \"faithful execution\" of laws is closely related to the principles of equity in common law systems. Equity developed as a way to provide remedies where strict application of common law could result in unconscionable outcomes. The idea of faithfully executing laws similarly aims to ensure that the spirit and intent of the law are upheld, not just its letter.\n\nOption A is incorrect because faithful execution has historical roots in equity principles, not a modern concept.\n\nOption B is wrong as equity and faithful execution are complementary, not opposing principles.\n\nOption D is incorrect because equity is not limited to property law but applies broadly, including to fiduciary duties which are about being \"faithful\" to a principal.\n\nThe connection between equity and faithful execution is evidenced by their shared emphasis on preventing unconscionable outcomes and their etymological link to the concept of trust (fidere in Latin)."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92700/is-it-legal-to-create-a-website-that-freely-provides-the-contents-of-books-which", "docs_id": 92700, "title": "Is it legal to create a website that freely provides the contents of books which are another company&#39;s IP?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is rather specific.

[In 2005, a group of entertainers created an Internet comedy series called \"Yacht Rock,\"](http://www.yachtrock.com/yacht-rock-episodes) which told the imaginary histories of the careers of a number of AM Gold/West Coast musicians (Kenny Loggins, Michael McDonald, The Doobie Bros., Steely Dan, Toto, etc.). They coined the phrase \"yacht rock\" to describe the (artificial, arbitrary) smooth\\-music genre in which these acts circulated. The series was produced as a parody, drawing inspiration from real\\-life figures and events, and inventing a fictional narrative around them.\n2. The success of the Yacht Rock web series has materially benefited the real\\-life musicians whose stories it purports to tell. Its success renewed popular interest in their catalogues sufficient for them to tour again. Some of these artists have acknowledged this publicly, [even seeking to promote their tours as \"yacht rock.\"](https://music.mxdwn.com/2018/07/14/reviews/concert-review-monsters-of-yacht-rock-christopher-cross-kenny-loggins-and-michael-mcdonald-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl/) Satellite radio entity [SIRIUS/XM created a \"yacht rock\" genre channel](https://www.siriusxm.com/yachtrockradio), while Rock Band [video game developers Harmonix recently released a \"yacht rock\" song pack](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/yacht-rock-pack-01-sets-sail), capitalizing on this renewed interest.\n3. [In 2008, a cover act from Atlanta formed, calling itself \"Yacht Rock Revue,\"](http://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/confessions-cover-band-yacht-rock-revue/) and playing a number of songs both consistent and inconsistent with the genre, as defined by the comedy group that coined the term \"yacht rock.\" However, what Yacht Rock Revue did that the comedy series writers did not is trademark the term \"yacht rock.\" (A USPTO search reveals that Yacht Rock Revue claims ownership of U.S. Registration Number 3834195, and in June 2018 filed an additional TEAS Plus application for its merchandise.) The band has since used its trademark to cease\\-and\\-desist \"yacht rock\" marketing used by other musicians, including the recording artists whose work they perform.\n4. In 2016, the creators of the Yacht Rock comedy series began a podcast called \"Beyond Yacht Rock,\" which creates and defines artificial/arbitrary genres of music. In the process, they honed their definition of \"yacht rock\" as a musical style, [created a \"Yachtski Scale\" to score the \"yachtiness\" of a given song](http://www.yachtrock.com/yacht-or-nyacht-jay-gradient/) along a series of (principally arbitrary) metrics, and wrote vigorous critical defenses of these definitions in a \"Captain's Blog.\" They even interviewed Yacht Rock Revue on the show, and discussed the merits of the band's \"yacht rock\" material vis\\-a\\-vis their definitions.\n5. Yacht Rock Revue has openly acknowledged that it nicked the term \"yacht rock\" from the web comedy series. *Yacht Rock*'s creators have been acknowledged as founders of the genre in interviews with with [Rolling Stone magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/sail-away-the-oral-history-of-yacht-rock-49343/) and the NPR music show World Cafe.

Did the original series writers have a trademark in the phrase either at common law, or by registering it?\n2. If they did have a trademark, what was the scope of goods or services covered by the trademark? Generally, a trademark can only be acquired for goods or services actually used by the person claiming it. There is no such thing as a trademark that applies universally.\n3. If they did have a trademark was it diluted to the point of becoming a generic term a la the term \"Xerox\" that lost its secondary meaning association with the goods or services of the original user of the trademark.\n4. Does the use by the radio program deceive the ordinary listener in a manner that causes the ordinarily listen to believe that the radio program is affiliated with the comedy show creators and benefits from the \"secondary meaning\" association with their show that they imparted to the term. A trademark isn't a prohibition on using the phrase, it is a prohibition on using the mark to deceptively market goods as associated with something that they are not associated with.\n5. Who owns any rights to the trademark, if there is one, and was it licensed? Often intellectual property in entertainment media is managed by multi\\-copyright owner association on behalf of IP owners who are often media companies. Typically radio stations including Sirius XM has a licensing agreement with all major management companies controlling the rights to the content that they play. It could be that a trademark is controlled by such an organization and within the scope of the station's license.\n6. Also, in addition to trademark claims, there could be claims that the station is creative derivative works of its work that is protected by copyright, subject to fair use, [sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire) (i.e. has yacht rock become a genre rather than a particular comedy group's baby), and licensing considerations.\n\nThe answers to these questions must be resolved to know that answer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A comedy group creates a web series called \"Yacht Rock\" in 2005, coining the term to describe a specific music genre.

If the term has lost its association with the original creators and become widely used to describe the genre, it may no longer be eligible for trademark protection. This concept of genericide is fundamental in trademark law and can override other considerations. Even if the original creators used the term first (A) or consistently (D), or if there's potential confusion (C), a generic term cannot be trademarked.

Do they need a reason to believe that you committed a crime, or can they just detain you without any reason at all?\n\nIf you need a state, use Texas, if you need a city, use McKinney. Please make it clear under what scope the laws actually reside.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Brief detentions and reasonable suspicion\n\nYou can be briefly detained by police if they have reasonable suspicion that you committed a crime. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968\\)\n\nWhat reasonable suspicion \"means\" can only be fully understood by reference to subsequent case law (which I will expand this answer to do), but as a basis, the court said in Terry that:\n\n> the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion\n\nThis standard has been reiterated as recently as in Heien v. North Carolina 574 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\), where they say \"All parties agree that to justify this type of seizure \\[a traffic stop, in the case of Heien], officers need only reasonable suspicion \u2014 that is, a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of breaking the law\" (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe reasonable suspicion standard was also used recently in Navarette v. California 572 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\). They reiterated that reasonable suspicion is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability, quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330 (1990\\). A mere \"hunch\" does not create reasonable suspicion, but the level of suspicion required by the reasonable suspicion standard is \"obviously less than is necessary for probable cause\".\n\n### Arrests and probable cause\n\nTo be arrested, police require probable cause. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160 (1949\\)\n\nIn more detail, probable cause exists (from Brinegar v. U.S.):\n\n> where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed\n\nAlso:\n\n> The rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these often opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly hamper law enforcement. To allow less would be to leave law\\-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers' whim or caprice.\n\nAs in the case of reasonable suspicion, the probable cause analysis is case\\-by\\-case and fact\\-intensive, so to understand the contours of probable cause will require reference to much subsequent case law.\n\nIn Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964\\) the question before the court was entirely \"whether or not the record in the case before us can support a finding of probable cause for the petitioner's arrest\". In that case, it turned out that the information they had received about the arrestee was not sufficient for probable cause, but regardless, the test the court applied was whether the police had probable cause for the arrest.\n\n### Notes\n\nWhile I am confident in the correctness of this answer, what each of these standards means will take hours of work to flesh out, which I plan to do. The courts have repeatedly reiterated and referred to these decisions/standards, but the analysis is very fact\\-intensive and is done case\\-by\\-case. Also, I realize the presentation is a little scattershot, as I'm first just looking to include relevant cases and statements the court has made about these standards, but I'll re\\-make it into a coherent story every once in a while.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a small town in Texas, Officer Smith responds to a noise complaint at a local park. Upon arrival, he sees a group of teenagers, some of whom start to walk away as he approaches. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Officer Smith's authority to detain these individuals?\n\nA) Officer Smith can detain any of the teenagers indefinitely without any specific reason, as long as he's investigating the noise complaint.\n\nB) Officer Smith needs probable cause that a specific crime has been committed to detain any of the teenagers.\n\nC) Officer Smith can briefly detain the teenagers if he has reasonable suspicion that they were involved in criminal activity related to the noise complaint.\n\nD) Officer Smith has no authority to detain any of the teenagers unless he witnessed them committing a crime firsthand.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Terry v. Ohio case and subsequent rulings, police officers can briefly detain individuals if they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. In this scenario, Officer Smith is responding to a noise complaint, which could potentially involve criminal activity (such as disturbing the peace). If he can point to specific, articulable facts that lead him to reasonably suspect particular teenagers were involved in the reported disturbance, he can briefly detain them for investigation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because officers cannot detain individuals indefinitely without reason. This would violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizures.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because probable cause is the higher standard required for arrests, not brief detentions. Reasonable suspicion, a lower standard, is sufficient for brief investigative detentions.\n\nAnswer D is too restrictive.

However, territories are federal entities and so in theory, any federal matter could be devolved to the territorial legislatures. This is hinted at with the s. 8 in your question. However, with the exception of some Aboriginal matters, the territorial acts are clear that the territorial legislatures do **not** have any competencies beyond that of the provinces (*Yukon Act* s. 20(1\\), *Northwest Territories Act* s. 25(1\\), *Nunavut Act* s. 23(2\\))\n\nThis makes our job easier: since the territorial legislatures can't legislate on criminal matters, any inconsistency with the *Criminal Code* would have to lie directly in those three territorial acts. While I could have missed something, I was unable to find any inconsistency in either the Yukon or Northwest Territory acts. So why does s. 8 of the *Criminal Code* exist? It seems to be a matter of how the legislation was historically structured: The *Criminal Code* would set the country\\-wide default, and any derogations could be placed in the territorial acts. See for example *[The King v. Standard Soap Company](https://www.canlii.org/en/nt/ntsc/doc/1907/1907canlii134/1907canlii134.html)*, 1907 CanLII 134 (NWT SC):\n\n> When the Criminal Code, 1892, was enacted, it was, by sec. 983, made applicable to the North\\-West Territories, except in so far as it was inconsistent with the provisions of the North\\-West Territories Act and the amendments thereto. As far as this case is concerned, the only Changes made in the Code by that Act are that instead of an indictment being presented by a grand jury to the Court where a person is charged with a criminal offence, the proceedings are commenced by a charge in writing setting forth the offence in the same manner as in an indictment.\n\nGrand juries no longer exist in Canada, so this inconsistency doesn't either (I speculate the original reason would have been the difficulty and expense of convening grand juries in such a sparsely populated territory).\n\nAs for Nunavut, well it seems Parliament threw the historical structure out the [Peace Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Tower) window. If you search for \"Yukon\" or \"Northwest\" in the *Criminal Code*, you'll find about 20 results each where they are mostly being treated the same as the provinces.

I will be the only owner and employee. I've been looking into sites like legalzoom and incfile as well as local business lawyers. Both business lawyers' websites and people on random online forums regarding the topic have suggested that forming an LLC using online services such as these will only provide you with generic documents that will not provide the necessary protection you need. Furthermore, once people realize that their documents from these online services do not serve their purposes or have screwed them over, they must go to a lawyer anyway to fix the mess.\n\nWhat are some concrete examples of ways using documents from online services would not provide the proper protection? What is the approximate cost to have a lawyer fix said mistakes and in what situations would I come to realize the need to consult a lawyer in person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A single person LLC document is one where it probably makes less of a difference to have it drafted by a lawyer than many other documents because it has very few tax implications and governance is elementary. The main issues would be choosing a proper LLC name and correctly choosing whether it should be member managed or manager managed (almost always, manager managed is preferred).\n\nBut, the main reason to consult a lawyer is to determine if a single person LLC as opposed, for example, to an S corporation, is really the most appropriate entity form for your business.\n\nAmong the concerns would be how this form would interact with California's community property laws, determining whether the LLC is disregarded for [state franchise taxes as well as federal income taxes](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/businesses/Structures/Limited-Liability-Company.shtml), determining what impact the LLC makes on Medicaid planning and estate planning, determining whether the ability to reduce FICA taxation in an S\\-corporation makes it worth choosing that form rather than an LLC, determining whether there are liability insurance requirements that are triggered, and determining how this form impacts health insurance structures v. other alternatives.\n\nAn attorney could also advise you on the \"care and feeding\" of the LLC so that you are clear on how to observe the proper formalities. For example, many people forget to, or don't know how to, title property in the LLC name, don't know when to obtain a separate EIN for the LLC, don't know how to sign documents in the name of the LLC, don't know how to draft an LLC authorization, don't know that the LLC must be an insured on insurance policies, etc.\n\nAlso, an attorney normally wouldn't charge very much for a very simple entity like a single member LLC Operating Agreement.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that getting a lawyer to fix a problem after the fact caused by DIY work by a client is about ten times as great as the cost of hiring a lawyer to do it correctly in the first place.\n\nFor example, a single person LLC might cost $500\\-$750 to draft in the first place including a consultation about whether it was really appropriate and a care and feeding discussion. Fixing a problem caused by inappropriately using a single person LLC might typically cost $5000\\-$7500\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in California is considering forming a single-member LLC using an online service.

As best I can tell, *in practice* so long as police assert that the seized item is potentially useful in their investigation of a crime (which, if serious but unsolved, may never be formally abandoned), they can avoid returning seized property \u2013 even if the ownership is uncontested and the items are not contraband. I.e., even when the owner is *effectively permanently deprived* of their property, I have not found any practical legal mechanism for them to seek compensation. (The only redress I have found is a right to petition for return of property, which is apparently denied so long as police assert the property has value in a criminal investigation or prosecution.)\n\nAre there any particular laws, rules, or procedures that provide for payment of compensation in these cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a good question, which I am going to answer from a practical perspective, rather than a theoretical one, which would probably justify a law review article (applications of the takings clause to criminal justice fact patterns is actually one of my pet areas of legal scholarship, but a lot of it calls for dramatic changes in established practice and precedents reached from other perspectives, making it impractical to pursue in real life). \n\nI recently had a case along these lines in my office where my client's property was seized as evidence in a criminal case against a third\\-party.\n\nThe crime involved a gun shop where all of the guns that were in the possession of the shop owner for repairs at the time of the bust (i.e. as bailments), including ours worth several thousand dollars in addition to having some sentimental value, were seized as evidence of charges against a shop owner who was fencing stolen goods, making sales to felons off the books, falsifying excise tax returns, etc. \n\nHe seemed legitimate and had been in business for many years in what was not a fly by night operation. He had all of the proper licenses. Who knew we were dealing with a crook?\n\nIn that case, we intervened on behalf of our client in the primary case to seek the physical return of the property (basically a replevin claim), as have others affected by the bust. It took a few months and some legal fees, but we prevailed without too much effort, as have the other intervenors.\n\nGenerally speaking, to make a 5th Amendment claim, you would have to show a total taking and move into some legal gray areas in this context, while it is usually hard for authorities to show a continuing need for possession of third\\-party property in the face of a demand for its return, especially when photography and other scientific tools can document the evidence in great detail these days. In that case, showing that our client's particular gun was not involved in any illegitimate transaction also simultaneously made it less important as evidence, although that would not necessarily be true in general in these kinds of situations.\n\nThere is a pending case in Colorado posing similar issues, where a suburban police department essentially destroyed a guy's home in order to catch a felon with no relation to the homeowner whatsoever, who had fled into it and taken refuge there.

First, you are expected to report the injury to the employer within 30 days, and if you do not, your claim may be denied. You have actually done that (they have actual knowledge of the injury so a future petition is not barred by [the 30 day rule](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.185.html)). Then within 7 days they are to report the injury to their insurance company. They acknowledge that employers may refuse to report injuries, and clarify that the employee has a right to report the injury to the insurance company (they offer assistance in doing that). Your medical expenses would be covered. There is also a provision that you can get compensation for lost time.\n\nIt is [against the law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.205.html) for them to fire you for filing a claim or attempting to file a claim (\"No employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee by reason of such employee\u2019s valid claim for compensation or attempt to claim compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law\").\n\nRegardless of the effect on the location's record of reported accidents or the amount of paperwork involved, it is not obviously in the interest of an employee to forgo their rights to compensation. The employee's attorney can advise the employee whether the company's alternative offer is advantageous. If one does not take action (notifying the insurance company for example), eventually they will have waived your rights for compensation.\n\nSupposing that the employee files a report with the insurance company, and the company then fires her in retaliation. This would not involve any unemployment compensation. There is no provision under the law for the state to litigate on her behalf, although the attorney general might file a class action suit if the company is engaged in widespread illegal terminations. So it would fall on the employee to litigate the matter: retaliation for filing a workman's comp claim is one of the recognized grounds for a wrongful termination suit.

If the employer refuses to do so, the employee has the right to report the injury directly to the insurance company. The employee should report the injury to the employer within 30 days to ensure their claim is not denied, but this is not a deadline for filing a lawsuit.

What does \"hate crime\" add to the situation, especially given it covers only a small subset?\n\nAs for the claim that \"hate speech\" in general causes suicide in the group, it is impossible to establish a direct connection between the speech and the death, let alone that it caused the death, given that you have to exclude other factors.\n\nAlleging direct psychological harm from the speech means, basically, that anyone, anywhere, can be silenced at any time in the absence of actual evidence.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of forms of speech can cause people to commit suicide.

However, the example given shows that there are limits to this protection. Specifically, if hate speech directly counsels someone to commit suicide, it can be prosecuted, as evidenced by the Ottawa case mentioned where two girls were charged for counselling suicide. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that hate speech is a form of protected speech. Option B is incorrect because the passage indicates that psychological harm alone is not enough to restrict hate speech. Option C is too absolute, as the example shows there are some situations where hate speech can be prosecuted.

The exact details vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n1. The statute of limitations for bringing suit based upon the alleged statement has passed. Many jurisdictions have especially short statutes of limitations for defamation claims. For example, in Colorado, the statute of limitations for a defamation claim is just one year, while other civil claims have two to six year statutes of limitations.\n2. The quoted statement isn't actually what was said.\n3. The statement is not defamatory in nature (i.e. it doesn't tend to harm the Plaintiff's reputation).\n4. The Plaintiff's reputation is so bad that no further statement could harm it.\n5. The court lacks jurisdiction over the claim or the case is filed in the wrong venue.\n6. The statement was substantially true. Note that this is not a defense to all types of claims called defamation in all jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions prohibit certain kinds of inflammatory negative statements (e.g. about religious figures, monarchs, dead people, family members, or disabled people) without regard to their truth, in causes of action that are seen as a subset of defamation actions. For example, Germany's criminal defamation statute prohibits some kinds of speech that would be considered insulting or \"fighting words\", effectively imposing a standing of civility in every day contexts, that applies without regard to truth. U.S. law carefully distinguishes between remedies for fraudulent lies about someone, statements that are objectionable because they implicate privacy concerns, statements that are objectionable because a person has a contractual or particularized legal duty not to say negative things about a particular individual, and statements that are disrespectful and disorderly, but not all jurisdictions draw these careful and fine lines.\n7. In context, the statement could not reasonably have been understood to be true as opposed to puffing, hyperbole, or an opinion.\n8. Failure to prove damages in jurisdictions where this is required on claims where it is required (proof of damages is not required for libel or slander per se in some jurisdictions). Some jurisdictions allow only economic damages, others allow emotional harm damages, others allow punitive damages, some allow statutory damages, and some allow some but not all of these kinds of damages.\n9. The statement is privileged or subject to a qualified privilege (e.g. statements made to law enforcement investigators, by attorneys in litigation, in court documents, by legislators in legislative debate, etc.)\n10. The statement was false but believed in good faith and with a reasonable basis to be true at the time, and at the time of the litigation, the person making the statement acknowledges its inaccuracies or a sense in which a statement meant as true could be misunderstood.\n11. Some jurisdictions make retraction of full defense or a partial defense. Some jurisdictions even make a request for a retraction a condition precedent to bringing a defamation lawsuit in some circumstances.\n12. The person bringing the lawsuit doesn't meet their burden of proof at trial. Usually, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, but truth is sometimes considered an affirmative defense which some jurisdictions place on the defendant to prove. The burden of proof could be quite relevant to the answer.

Bob's 0% interest loan with no set repayment schedule fails to meet these criteria. Tax law typically treats such arrangements as what they effectively are - in this case, likely a form of salary or dividend.

[403\\.1](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-88.html#docCont) criminalizes pretending to be another person for gain or disadvantage.

There are also [general laws against fraud](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-81.html#h-102), where making a material false statement for the purpose of material gain is fraud, but if the person was just trying to be a pill, that does not rise to the level of being fraud. It is a crime to impersonate a lawyer (unauthorized practice of law) or a [peace/public officer](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-130.html).

If a platform violates these guidelines, then they are open to litigation, which they have previously been protected from. Here is a link to a draft of the order: [https://kateklonick.com/wp\\-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT\\-EO\\-Preventing\\-Online\\-Censorship.pdf](https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf)\n\nSome questions I have...\n\n* Is my summary an accurate description?\n* A common part of the debate has been \"free speech\", which isn't relevant to a private company. However, are there other times the FCC has set guidelines that effectively influence free speech?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Addressing only the document that you link to without assumption of accuracy or finality, it says that \"It is the policy of the United States to foster clear, nondiscriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the Internet. Prominent among those rules is the immunity from liability\", referring to [47 USC 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230), and specifically \"the scope of that immunity should be clarified\". It is clear that the law say nothing about what counts as \"good faith\", nor does it say anything about what constitutes \"otherwise objectionable\". The document correctly say that the law \"does not extend to deceptive or pretextual actions restricting online content\", at leas as long as we understand \"extend to\" as meaning \"explicitly mention\". Similarly, the law does not explicitly say anything about whether a provider violating its own TOS nullifies the \"good faith restriction\" clause.\n\nThe order then directs the Dept. of Commerce to petition the **FCC** for regulations clarifying the interpretation of this law (I assume you meant FCC and not FTC). It specifically proposes explicitly interpreting \"taken in good faith\" to exclude actions that are deceptive, pretextual or inconsistent with a provider's TOS, or \"the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or having been undertaking \\[sic] without a meaningful opportunity to be heard\".\n\nEverybody is presently open to litigation for defamation (for example), because you can allege that pretextual or \"unreasonable\" restrictions on speech *are* in bad faith, then the courts have to evaluate that question. What the regulations would do is provide a default answer (\"yes, it is\"), which the courts would follow unless the regulation is overturned in court or is rescinded. \n\nThere are vast numbers of restrictions on free speech by the FCC: the whole purpose of the FCC is to restrict the freedom to speak as one may please. The initial premise was that the government didn't want broadcaster A to functionally obliterate broadcaster B due to the strength of his signal on a particular frequency, so you are not free to speak in certain ways. There are numerous other restrictions on what you may say within the sphere regulated by the FCC, e.g. you can't broadcast live sex acts on network TV during Saturday morning cartoon time. The [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) and the [equal time rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule) are / were other examples of restrictions on free speech (via compelled speech). \"Free speech\" is an open\\-enough concept that it is reasonable to consider anything with a governmentally\\-mandated \"non\\-level playing field\" to be a restriction on free speech (for example, statutory immunizations of a certain class of individuals against legal consequences of their acts). The problem with saying what acts of the FCC \"restrict free speech\" is that there isn't a clear definition of \"free speech\" that is consistent with laws against threatening, fraud, perjury and defamation.\n\nAs for the accuracy of your summary, there are also provisions regarding [deceptive practices](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45). There is more to it than you summarized (obviously: that's what a summary is), but apart from misspelling FCC I'd say that the summary is brief and not as informative (or verbose) as the original, but it is not deceptive. If you want a well\\-intentioned criticism, I think it is important to be specific about the fact that there is been some statutory immunization against liability which is the core of the order, but you didn't clarify that point. Governments litigate against companies (mostly) all the time, but governments do not litigate against companies or individuals for defamation or violating a TOS, and nothing in the order suggests that the government could start to sue social media companies for defamation or breach of contract, that is, the scope of the potential litigation is limited in an important way.

Using Washington as [an example](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=74.34), and trying to make the best case possible that bailing out is against the law, the potential legal concern is \"abandonment\", which is defined as an\n\n> action or inaction by a person or entity with a duty of care for a\n> vulnerable adult that leaves the vulnerable person without the means\n> or ability to obtain necessary food, clothing, shelter, or health\n> care.\n\nthe failure of a vulnerable adult, not living in a facility, to provide for himself or herself the goods and services necessary for the vulnerable adult's physical or mental health, and the absence of which impairs or threatens the vulnerable adult's well\\-being. This definition may include a vulnerable adult who is receiving services through home health, hospice, or a home care agency, or an individual provider when the neglect is not a result of inaction by that agency or individual provider.\n\nRCW 74\\.34\\.200 creates a legal cause of action for abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult.

If it would change the answer, assume that these demands would not be written into a renewal contract, rather they only form the basis of whether the employer chooses to offer a renewal.\n\nThe original question regards a German employer, and probably in the public sector, but information about other jurisdictions may be interesting too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Restatement of facts\n\n* Employee Kaya3 has been working for 22 months with employer E under a 2\u2011year fixed term employment contract.\n* E has informally hinted they would like to extend/renew the contract with Kaya3\\.\n* Yet there is no employment contract about the subsequent period yet.\n* E cites Kaya3\u2019s distant place of residence and living conditions (a shared apartment) as the reasons for not concluding an employment contract.\nE fears Kaya3\u2019s performance would suffer under these circumstances.\n* Kaya3 comes from a developing country and likes to save as much earnings as possible, i.\u202fe. prefers cheaper accommodation.\n* There is no public or internal job posting concerning the subsequent period.\n\n### ~~Opinion~~ Thoughts\n\n1. **Contractual obligations**  \n\nThere *is no contract* obligating the parties to conclude an employment contract.\nThere is also no legal obligation to conclude a contract.\nThis is an expression of freedom of contract.\nThere *are* restrictions:\nFor instance, the [Universal Equal Treatment Act](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_agg/index.html) (AGG) forbids discrimination based on grounds of sex, ethnicity, age, among others.\nYet violation of none the restrictions bear the consequence that a contract is concluded, as emphasized for instance in \u00a7\u00a015\u00a0\u2165\u00a0AGG.\n2. **Quasi\\-contractual obligations**  \n\nInstead German labor law is completely focused on damages.\n\n\t1. *culpa in contrahendo*  \n\n\tBy starting business relations you are already entering a semi\\-contractual relationship, \u00a7\u00a0311\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tHere E and Kaya3 started talking about a future employment (\\=\u00a0*start* of business relationship possibly culminating in conclusion of a contract).\n\tThis \u201ccontract\u201d imposes the duty to take account of each other\u2019s interest, \u00a7\u00a0241\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tThat means e.\u202fg. gaslighting someone, say, *pretending* you *would* like to conclude a contract even though there has never been such intent, is forbidden, because it is not in good faith, \u00a7\u00a0242\u00a0BGB.\n\tBreaching this duty could lead to a claim in damages, \u00a7\u00a0280\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0BGB.\n\tHowever, in the present case there is not enough evidence that E was trying to \u201churt\u201d Kaya3\\.\n\tQuite the contrary, it is in the *fixed\\-term* contract\u2019s nature to fulfill a *temporary* need.\n\tFurthermore, since Kaya3 still has 2 months to work, there is still time to conclude a follow\\-up contract.\n\tA damage\u00a0\u2013 here lack of income\u00a0\u2013 has not even occurred yet.\n\t2. unequal treatment *c.\u202fi.\u202fc.*  \n\n\tE\u2019s decisions to not (yet) hire Kaya3 could be *veiled* racial discrimination or xenophobia, illegal considerations as per \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07\u00a0\u2160,\u00a06\u202f\u2160\u202f2,\u00a01\u202fAlt.\u202f1\u202f\\+\u202f2\u00a0AGG.\n\tE says he was afraid of Kaya3\u2019s work performance suffering when in fact he does not want to hire foreigners (here characterized by the circumstance that Kaya3 in fact prefers his current living situation which is quite normal in his country of origin).\n\tOn the one hand E having already hired Kaya3 once indicates he does not discriminate based on such criteria.\n\tOn the other hand it is possible that there was a change in HR\u2019s personnel so a different recruiter (for which E is responsible) is in charge now.\n\tOn the one hand Kaya3\u2019s performance on the job never gave rise to consider firing him.\n\tOn the other hand the fixed\\-term contract fulfilled a temporary need, thus a subsequent open\\-ended contract could have legitimately higher standards.\n\n\tAnswering this will require complete details, but this kind of question is in fact very frequent in practice:\n\tIs it still a *legitimate reason* or already *indirect discrimination*?\n3. **Tort obligations**  \n\nThe regulations of the Universal Equal Treatment Act (AGG) could be considered guard statutes for \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0823\u00a0\u2160,\u00a0\u2161\u00a01\u00a0BGB, yet the AGG is *lex specialis* to the general provisions of the BGB.\nIn general, damages are those legal rights the damaged party would have without the damaging event, \u00a7\u00a0249\u00a0\u2160\u00a0BGB.\nThus you could say, \u201crefusing to contract\u201d was the damaging event; if we omit the \u201cdamaging event\u201d there would have been an employment contract.\nHowever, as \u00a7 15 \u2165 AGG emphasizes, conclusion of a contract cannot be damages.\nThis is again a consequence of the freedom of contract which is an expression of the universal personal rights enshrined in the Basic Law, Art.\u00a02\u00a0\u2160 in conjunction with\u00a0Art.\u00a01\u00a0\u2160\u00a0GG (partially applicable to a company, Art.\u00a019\u00a0\u2162\u00a0GG, even though a company doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpersonality\u201d).\n4. **Conclusion**  \n\nKaya3 is not entitled to get an employment contract, nor does he have a claim for damages.\n\n### Answer\n\nJust to answer your question:\nYes, generally speaking an employer is allowed to discriminate based on where and how someone lives.\nAn employment contract, \u00a7\u00a0611\u00a0BGB, has to be fulfilled in person.\nYou cannot, say, send *your brother* to do the work which *you* are supposed to do (the employer will rightfully reject such performance).\nThus the employer can have arbitrary standards when filling a vacancy, even criteria that do not seem related to the job.\nThere are just the criteria like religion, beliefs, sex, ethnicity, and so on, which may not be taken into consideration.\nSo, even though an employer\u2019s question like \u201cHave you visited a mosque before?\u201d is neutral in nature, it creates exposure to litigation (potential indirect discrimination again).\n\nIt is also perfectly legal not to hire somebody, simply because they have already worked for the same employer (or predecessor) under a fixed\\-term contract and thus *the next* employment contract (if any) *must* be an open\\-ended contract (unless there is a good reason) \\[simplified summary of the TzBfG].\nThis practice has been repeatedly criticized by (left\\-leaning) labor unions and other parties.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Social insurance:\nAlways inform the employment agency (3 months ahead) about looming unemployment even if the current employer says \u201cwe\u2019ll extend your contract\u201d.\nOtherwise you run the risk of a period of disqualification (*Sperrzeit*, \u00a7\u00a0159\u00a0\u2160\u00a02\u00a0No.\u00a09\u00a0SGB\u00a0\u2162), because the employer might change his mind until you have concluded a contract.\n* Switching employers:\nNever terminate an open\\-end employment contract until you *have signed* the contract with the new employer.\nOtherwise, the new employer might retract his (informal) offer and then you\u2019re out of work completely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal analysis provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employer's decision not to renew Kaya3's fixed-term contract due to their living situation?\n\nA) The employer's decision is illegal because it discriminates against Kaya3's personal choices.\nB) The employer is legally obligated to renew the contract if Kaya3's performance has been satisfactory.\nC) The employer's decision is likely legal, as they can generally discriminate based on living situation, but it could potentially be challenged if it's masking indirect discrimination.\nD) Kaya3 has a strong legal claim for damages due to the employer's refusal to renew the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The analysis indicates that employers are generally allowed to discriminate based on where and how someone lives, as it's not a protected characteristic under laws like the Universal Equal Treatment Act (AGG). However, if this reasoning is being used to mask indirect discrimination based on protected characteristics (such as ethnicity or national origin), it could potentially be challenged. The employer's decision itself is likely legal, but the situation warrants closer examination for potential hidden discriminatory practices.

The most I can own is up to the high tide mark. However, if the sea level rises then the amount of land I own would also decrease, in which case do I get compensation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") and [scotland](/questions/tagged/scotland \"show questions tagged 'scotland'\"), no.\n\nAt common law, with a hefty influence from Roman writers such as [Gaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_(jurist)) who tackled the topic, gradual changes in a natural boundary are distinguished from others. This is usually encountered in the case of a river, whose course may change slightly from year to year. New deposits are laid down and other parts are eroded, generally imperceptibly. These processes are called *alluvion* and *diluvion*, and distinguished from *avulsion* where a chunk of identifiable land is washed downriver. Deliberately\\-induced changes are also different.\n\nFor those slow and natural changes, the position is that where ownership of the land is defined with reference to the natural boundary, the extent of ownership also changes when the boundary moves. This is a sensible rule in the absence of modern surveying methods, and generally matches what people expect \\- I own the land on the south bank, you own it on the north, and it doesn't make sense for me to gain a sliver of land on the other side if the river should happen to meander a bit. It is possible to override that assumption by agreement between the landowners (or else litigate it) but that is the starting point.\n\nThe sea works in the same way, except that the \"landowner\" on the other side is the Crown. (Quotation marks because it is not the same kind of ownership that ordinary people exercise.) The intermediate area, the foreshore, has its own rules, so in fact there are multiple boundaries to think about \\- the mean high water mark, the mean low water mark \\- but it's the same idea. The foreshore might be owned by the Crown, as the sea is, but maybe by somebody else. Perhaps what was my land is now underwater at high tide, but exposed at low tide; and some other bit of land used to be foreshore and now is totally submerged.\n\nEveryday tidal changes do not affect ownership, nor do unusually large tides either way. But if I own land next to the sea, I may gain some land, or lose it, by natural action. Gradually rising sea levels move the tide lines and the property rights follow. Some riverbeds are also owned by the Crown, so the same principle is at work there too for the motion of Crown boundaries.\n\nThe rationale for *why* the Crown owns these places is not clear: there are several possible explanations to do with it being for the common good, or alternatively just an old feudal rule. That might affect adjudication of rights in some cases, such as for access to the \"new foreshore\" for particular activities: see [*R (Newhaven Port and Properties Ltd) v East Sussex CC* \\[2015] UKSC 7](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html) for an investigation of the public right to swim on an English beach. Even in the case of Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, ownership does not extend to the sea beyond the low\\-tide mark, since the Crown has sovereign rights (*Shetland Salmon Farmers Association v Crown Estate Commissioners* 1991 SLT 166\\).\n\nIn land registration, a boundary marked on a cadastral map is not taken as authoritative when the underlying geographical feature moves. That's in the [Land Registration Act 2002, section 61(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/61) for England and Wales, and the [Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2002, sections 66](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/66) and [73(2\\)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/73) in Scotland. Courts have inferred that a boundary coinciding with such a feature is \"meant\" to be this way, even if it wasn't defined like that in words \\- see for example [*Southern Centre of Theosophy Incorporated v The State of South Australia (Australia)* \\[1981] UKPC 41](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_41.html) in the Privy Council.

According to the information provided, gradual changes in natural boundaries, including sea level rise, affect property rights. The newly submerged area would likely become part of the foreshore, which is the area between mean high water and mean low water marks. The foreshore is often, but not always, owned by the Crown. However, the original landowner may retain certain rights or partial ownership, depending on the specific circumstances. This reflects the principle that property rights follow natural boundary changes in cases of gradual sea level rise, without the landowner completely losing all rights to the affected area.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the legal principle that gradual natural changes affect property boundaries. Answer C is too extreme, as the landowner doesn't necessarily lose all rights to the area. Answer D is incorrect because there is an established legal framework for handling such situations, rather than leaving it in a state of limbo."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46545/why-did-mcalpine-m-sue-under-the-main-contract-between-m-and-panatown-rather", "docs_id": 46545, "title": "Why did McAlpine (M) sue under the main contract between M and Panatown, rather than under the duty of care deed between M and UIPL?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Richard](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/staff_profiles/richard-taylor.php) and [Damian](https://www.slaughterandmay.com/who-we-are/partners/damian-taylor/) Taylor.

The passage explains that while suing under the main contract through Panatown presented difficulties in proving Panatown's loss, it offered several advantages over suing under the duty of care deed. These advantages included:\n\n1. An arbitration clause, allowing for resolution without involving numerous subcontractors.\n2. More extensive rights, including strict obligations and liquidated damages for delay.\n3.

That's evidence in favor of the site, and an adverse party has to have stronger evidence in order to overcome it. If the person didn't save a copy of the terms themselves, they'll have a hard time on this.\n\nThen the other party's attorney tries to discredit the programmer by asking questions like \"how do you know there are no bugs in the software which could have allowed somebody to reach this without agreeing to the terms of service\" etc. Apparently, [some sites don't require users to click indicating agreement](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3330/what-if-the-user-disagreed-with-the-terms-of-service-but-still-registered-on-a). \n\nIf the company has significantly changed the site, terms of service, etc. since the time the user registered, and doesn't keep any copies of old versions around, and admits this, they'll have a hard time enforcing an agreement (as they can't produce a copy of it).

It combines expert testimony about the technical impossibility of accessing the site without agreeing to the terms, along with physical evidence of the exact terms agreed to at the time. This provides both procedural and substantive evidence of the agreement.\n\nOption A is weaker because, while it includes expert testimony, it lacks the crucial evidence of the actual terms agreed to.\n\nOption B significantly weakens the website owner's case by admitting to changes and lack of record-keeping.\n\nOption D relies on a weaker form of implied consent, which is less likely to be upheld than an explicit click-wrap agreement."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15875/what-is-the-law-regarding-christmas-activities-in-public-school-systems", "docs_id": 15875, "title": "What is the law regarding Christmas activities in public school systems?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider a scenario where a public school that set aside some time to show Christmas themed movies and for the students to exchange some gifts with each other.\n\nIs this permitted?

Is that permitted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law of Texas is controlled by federal law, viz. the First Amendment. [This item](https://www.aclu.org/other/joint-statement-current-law-religion-public-schools) by the ACLU summarizes what that law is. Regarding your concern, public schools are not required to be \"religion\\-free zones\". Individuals have the right to hold and express their religious beliefs, or their lack of such beliefs, as long as it is contextually appropriate. That is, you don't get to invoke the First Amendment in the middle of a math lesson in order to engage in a rant. Students are allowed to try to persuade others to believe whatever they want, and students are allowed to be snarky about people who don't share their beliefs. Schools can teach about religion as part of the curriculum, though they cannot teach religion. It is okay to teach the historical fact that some guy decided based on the Bible that the world was created 10,000 years ago, but it not not okay to teach as a scientific fact that the world was created 10,000 years ago.\n\nAlthough I can't name a specific movie about Christmas that would be plainly objectionable to a non\\-Christian, we could assume that there is some such movie which is plainly advocacy of a religious viewpoint and which mocks Yazidism.

The key is to focus on the secular aspects of the holiday rather than religious doctrine. \n\nOption A is incorrect because religious-themed activities are not completely prohibited in public schools. \n\nOption B goes too far in requiring alternative activities, which isn't necessarily mandated by law (though it might be a good practice). \n\nOption C is correct because it aligns with the principle that schools can acknowledge religious holidays without promoting religious beliefs. \n\nOption D is incorrect because schools are not obligated to cancel activities solely based on complaints of feeling excluded or offended, as long as the activities are conducted in a constitutionally appropriate manner."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53321/helping-a-friend-too-many-fines-and-not-enough-money", "docs_id": 53321, "title": "Helping a friend = Too many fines and not enough money", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A insured a motor bike for B, who signed it over to A.
