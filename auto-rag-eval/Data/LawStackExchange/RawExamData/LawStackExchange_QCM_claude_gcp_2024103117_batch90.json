They (should) know that you can\u2019t get married **accidentally**. Marriage requires genuine consent of both parties which participation in a **rehearsal** denies is there.\n\nTechnically, the parties are married when all the legal formalities are complete. Practically, they are married when they believe they are. \n\nLegally, they are married when the court considering the question in the case decides they are \\- a court would only be doing this if there was some issue that hinged on it and it would look at all the evidence.

Even though the clip is short (25 seconds) and intended for educational purposes, it's still likely to be considered copyright infringement. The melody of a song is protected by copyright, not just the lyrics. The fact that it's on a commercial (monetized) channel further weakens any fair use argument.

The insurer would then have the opportunity\nto claim profits on a timely schedule, while the insured could claim the collateral provided by the insurer, if the requirements both parties agreed upon were to be met.\nThe insurance contracts themselves would be initialized, maintained and eventually resolved through a series of transparent open sourced smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially little programs, that run on the blockchain. The can\nbe reviewed by anyone interested.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is it legally necessary to formally record such a relation between two (or more) private persons? With the crypto space currently being so very unregulated, are there even laws applicable to this matter?\n2. How difficult would it be for users of such a service to declare the income generated through anything related to the platform? Would this be regarded\nas a form of self\\-employment, would they have to register a company or any of the likes?\n3. Would the platform itself, being the service provider, have to be registered in any way? The main aim of the platform would of course be income generation.\n\n**Legal accountability:**\n\n1. Would we need to explicitly declare a disclaimer to prevent being sued if a user considers the rejection of their claim unjust?\nSince this is a peer\\-to\\-peer system, the platform itself will mostly be uninvolved in the decision process. Instead this will be the duty of an independant third party comprised of individual users.\n2. Could the platform be held accountable in case of lost user funds? Only if the platform were at fault? (as in, did the platform's source code cause the issue?)\n3. Can a strictly blockchain based platform even be sued? Only if it is legally registered?\n4. Is there an exact legal counterpart as to the role the platform would assume in this system? It provides the framework upon wich the insurance policies are designed, contracts are established\nand payouts are issued. It does not directly take part in insurance business.\n\nFeel free to let me know, if any further clarification is needed.\n\n**Edit:**\nSince jurisdictional specification was suggested, let's assume it to be Switzerland and the U.S.A.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Although crypto space may be little regulated, insurance is in most jurisdictions highly regulated. Any such arrangement would need to comply with current laws on insurance, until and unless modified laws to cover this sort of thing are passed, and then it would need to comply with those.\n2. Tax authorities generally allow one to declare \"other business income\" or \"other investment income\" without forming a legal entity. I cannot say how such income would be classified in any given jurisdiction.\n3. Whether the platform, or some legal entity associated with the platform, would need to be registered will depend on the current laws and regulations governing insurance, and on the way in which teh contracts are structured.\n4. A disclaimer cannot prevent one from being sued. The contracts would need to carefully and explicitly state who is liable for what.\n5. Programs cannot be held accountable for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. If negligence in the creation or operation of a program causes a loss, the operator may well be liable.\n6. Programs cannot be sued for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. It may well be essential to constitute the \"platform\" as a legal entity of some sort. Otherwise its operator will be liable for its actions.\n7. I cannot be sure. I once encountered a somewhat similar system in which insurance was provided by individuals exchanging contracts, so that in a sense each member insured all the others. There was a company that supervised and provided legal and administrative services to the group of individuals, and collected fees for this.

There's a famous case that illustrates this: A\\&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001\\).\n\nA number of record companies successfully sued *Napster* for infringing their various intellectual property rights.\n\nEssentially, the finding came down to the fact that:\n\n* Napster's program (of the same name) allows for the exchange of copyrighted material, ***and*** *Napster* had actual knowledge that specific infringing material was available using its system, and that it did not remote the material (by blocking access to the system or otherwise).\n* Napster did not police the index of files that they maintained, and so were liable for vicarious infringement.\n\nThe longer answer to your question is *it depends*. Based on the Napster precedent, it seems it would depend (at least) on whether: \n\n* the program may have legitimate uses\n* you are aware that it can be used for illegal purpose\n* you have a means of monitoring the activity\n* you have a means of restricting use of the program\n* you financially benefit from the activities of the users\n\nMany developers will include some warning about using the software only for legal purposes.

The ability to monitor or restrict use\n3. Financial benefit from the activities\n\nOption C combines all these elements.

Like witnesses, judges are human and subject to biases and external pressures, and it seems like it would be reasonable to assume that their jury instructions could reflect that.\n\nViewing jury instructions this way I think would mean that it is part of the role of the jury to determine which parts of the jury instructions should be considered fact, and I think it would also mean that jury nullification wouldn't necessarily mean that a jury [returns \"a verdict of 'Not Guilty' despite its belief that the defendant is guilty of the violation charged\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/112); it could just mean that the jury doesn't accept all of the statements in the jury instructions, such as the judge's interpretation of the law, as fact.\n\nCould jury instructions reasonably be viewed as a kind of expert witness testimony? If not, what are the main problems with viewing them this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. There is a clear distinction between:\n\n* evidence (or testimony), which consists of statements of fact given by witnesses on oath (subject to prosecution for perjury), governed by the rules of evidence, and which the jury is required to consider but not accept (in the sense that a verdict which is not supported by the evidence can be set aside on appeal),\n* submissions, which consist of argument by the lawyers for the parties, which the jury is not required to consider or accept, and\n* directions, which consist of statements of law given by the judge, which the jury is required to accept.\n\nThe jury is required by its oath to follow the law as stated by the judge, even if it is wrong. The remedy for erroneous trial directions (an appeal) is different to the remedy for erroneous evidence (a perjury prosecution in the case of deliberate lies; nothing in the case of innocent errors).\n\nBecause the jury has the power, but not the right, to nullify a charge by disobeying the judge\u2019s directions, there is a sense in which the jury is free to reject the judge\u2019s directions just as it is free to reject evidence. However, this is completely inconsistent with the theory that defines the roles of judge and jury. There is no *legal* basis for viewing judicial directions as a kind of expert testimony.\n\n\u2018The power, but not the right\u2019\n------------------------------\n\nObie 2\\.0 asked about this phrase. It coems from the [Case of the Dean of St Asaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_of_the_Dean_of_St_Asaph), which is reported at *R v Shipley* (1784\\) [4 Doug 73](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hSdFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA73). The relevant passage is summarised in Lord Devlin's *[Trial by Jury](https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf)* (1956\\), at p 87:\n\n> **Jury\u2019s Power of Acquittal**\n> \n> \n> There may well be cases in which the killing is not in doubt and the formal direction not to return a verdict of manslaughter is therefore tantamount to a direction to return a verdict of Guilty. Still, if the direction is ignored, the court must, I think, accept the verdict. There is no way in which a verdict of acquittal can be nullified. As Lord Chief Justice Mansfield put it in 1784: \u201cIt is the duty of the judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in *their power* to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.\u201d Mr. Justice Willes said: \u201cI admit the jury have the *power* of finding a verdict against the law and so they have of finding a verdict against evidence, but I deny they have the *right* to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Justice of Australia held to similar effect in *Gammage v The Queen* (1969\\) [122 CLR 444](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/68.html?context=1;query=gammage;mask_path=), writing:\n\n> \\[The jury] have no right, in my opinion, to return a verdict of manslaughter where they are satisfied of murder. But, as I have said, persistence by them in returning another verdict must ultimately result in the acceptance of that verdict. In that sense, but in no other sense, it is both within their power and, if you will, their privilege to return a wrong verdict.\n\nTo answer Obie 2\\.0's question, the jury has the *power* to ignore the judge's directions, because \u2013 at least at the time Lord Devlin was writing in 1956 \u2013 a verdict of acquittal could not be nullified. However, the jury does not have the *right* to do so because the law requires it to follow the directions.\n\nAs Ed999 observes, the law governing jury trials does vary between jurisdictions. In particular, some jurisdictions (which lack the United States' constitutional [double jeopardy clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause)) now allow for a jury acquittal to be set aside on appeal. However, the fundamental distinction between a witness\u2019s evidence and a judge\u2019s directions was established in England centuries ago, and remains applicable throughout the common law world.\n\nIt is worth specifically mentioning the United States because [jury nullification remains a controversial topic in that jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification_in_the_United_States). However, the basic principle that the jury is legally required to follow the judge\u2019s directions was established in *[Sparf v.

However, over recent months, Medium has become increasingly focused on their own partnerships and internal publications, to the point where it's hard to argue that there is not an ethical conflict of interest. My question is whether there's a legal conflict of interest.\n\n---\n\n**General Idea**\n\nTo put it into general terms, consider three parties, A, B, and C. Party A offers party B and C the opportunity to profit from an operation, where parties B and C are in competition with one another for a finite amount of revenue in a given month (the total available from subscription fees in this case). Further suppose that the operation relies on party C for success (it seems easy to argue that Medium would have trouble surviving if only their own content was on the platform), and that party A provides biased support to party B. Finally, B and C are paid by A, from the revenue generated by the operation, rather than B and C obtaining the revenue directly from the operation's customers.\n\nIn such a scenario, there seems to be both an ethical issue and potentially legal issue. However, I am not familiar with any specific civil statutes that may come into play. Does it appear that the above scenario might violate any specific statute? The one potential reason why Medium might be saved from a valid lawsuit is that an author does not have to pay for the service. However, they are providing support, in their aggregate, through the massive volume of writing that they provide to the platform, without very much chance of being able to actually generate revenue. Precedent from cases involving pyramid schemes may apply here.\n\n---\n\nMichael Seifert raised an interesting question: \"How would this be different from Publishing House A promoting a more profitable Author B instead of a less profitable Author C?\"\n\nThe difference is that the publishing house does not rely on C's work for sales. To continue this analogy, consider a situation where the publishing house put in a request for chapters for an anthology, where the majority of the chapters came from C, and a few came from B. Further suppose that the publishing house paid its authors based on how many sales the respective authors generated, but almost exclusively promoted author B's website that sold the anthology. Even though readers likely would not purchase the anthology, without the chapters provided by C, because of A's disproportionate support of B, C would receive very little of the revenue stream.\n\n---\n\nBlueDogRanch made a point that Medium's terms of services \"says nothing about being fair, or ethical.\" Agreed. Its terms of services say nothing, and therefore it does not say that they reserve the right to unfair, unequal, or unethical, biases. If the terms of service stated that Medium reserves the right to unequal promotion of work regardless of whether it reduces the potential revenue by other authors, then Medium would have a greater chance of winning in court, and greater justification for their actions. However, without such statements, it becomes less certain that one should assume that a content facilitator that provides revenue streams as part of a ***partner program*** would engage in actions that disproportionately shift revenue streams towards their own content. \n\n---\n\nA final point. It seems that in California, an individual must pass the \"ABC\" test, at least when it comes to wage orders. Specifically, Medium's authors do not pass B: *the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business*. It seems that, contrary to the suggestion that Medium's authors are subcontractors, they are, at least as far as California law is concerned, employees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> *Is Medium at risk of legal action?*\n\nThey are, in as much as anyone or any company is due to the nature of civil law, i.e. just about anyone can take anyone else to civil court. That is where \"legal conflicts of interest\" are worked out. But I'd assume that Medium's lawyers have covered the bases in terms of adhering to state and federal laws that govern their business, their business model of paying authors and changing their business model; and ensure that they have a strong terms of service document for the site, and that document is legally binding for Medium's users.\n\nNow, a disgruntled author could file against Medium, alleging fraud, uncompetitive practices, unfairness, conflicts of interest or anything else and attempt to recover damages for what they allege is a skewed payoff to authors or Medium's self\\-serving policies. That said, authors and Medium are bound by the [Medium Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f).

US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/332/), 420 U.S. 332\\). The reason is that the acquittal could be disposed of on appeal without subjecting the person to a second trial. In contrast, in [Fong Foo v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/369/141/), 369 U.S. 141 the trial judge ordered the jury to enter a verdict of acquittal. The appeals court rejected the judges basis for ordering an acquittal: but Fong Foo was \"protected\" because there could not be a second trial (double jeopardy), and it does not follow that the jury would have convicted but for the judge's order.\n\nThe question reduces to the limited circumstances under which the prosecution can appeal a verdict. For instance, the prosecution can appeal a tre\\-trial motion to dismiss, and since there was no trial, there is no second jeopardy.

I actually did kill her, but you can't touch me now!\" Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The judge can immediately reverse the acquittal and find the defendant guilty based on this new confession.\n\nB) The prosecution can appeal the verdict and seek a new trial based on this new evidence.\n\nC) The defendant is fully protected by double jeopardy, and no further legal action can be taken against him for this specific crime.\n\nD) The defendant can be charged with a new crime of obstruction of justice, but cannot be retried for the original murder charge.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the United States, the principle of double jeopardy, as protected by the Fifth Amendment, prevents a person from being tried twice for the same offense after an acquittal. Even if new evidence comes to light immediately after the verdict - including a confession from the defendant - the acquittal stands and the defendant cannot be retried for the same crime.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a judge cannot reverse an acquittal once it has been entered, regardless of new evidence.\n\nOption B is wrong because the prosecution cannot appeal an acquittal or seek a new trial based on new evidence, no matter how compelling.\n\nOption D, while creative, is not correct. While the defendant's behavior might be considered contemptuous, it doesn't constitute a separate crime of obstruction of justice, and in any case, this wouldn't allow for a retrial on the original murder charge.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the double jeopardy principle and its application even in extreme circumstances where new evidence emerges immediately after a verdict."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78631/was-derek-chauvin-protected-by-castle-rock-v-gonzales-545-u-s-748-2005", "docs_id": 78631, "title": "Was Derek Chauvin protected by Castle Rock v.

Gonzales* holds that the police do not have a duty to enforce the law that may be enforced by a private party in a civil action. Police instead have broad discretion regarding whether they will or will not take action to enforce a law.\n\nBut, when a police officer does take action affirmatively, this case does not apply. Instead, the question then, is whether the affirmative use of force by the officer was justified by the applicable substantive criminal law.\n\n> If Chauvin had not touched Floyd at all, would Chauvin be protected by\n> *Castle Rock v. Gonzales*?\n> \n> \n> Meaning no attempt at arrest, no confrontation, nothing. Just let\n> Floyd leave with his cigarettes.\n\nYes. (A much more complicated analysis applied if a fellow officer did what he did and he stood back and did nothing, but that is beyond the scope of this question as I understand it and would call for a separate question.)\n\n> Given the apparent huge disparity in the risk\\-reward calculation of a\n> police officer taking action versus just sitting in the car, why don't\n> all police just sit in their car all day?\n\nPolice officers who do that are routinely fired and given bad recommendation by their superiors when applying for a new law enforcement position. Law enforcement supervisors routinely punish police officers for inaction construing that as being a \"coward\" but are much less likely to punish a police officer for being unlawfully overzealous without strong pressure from civilians in the relevant government agency or local government.\n\nEmpirically, sitting in their car all day is not how police act. They are much more likely to be overzealous than to be docile.\n\nThis said, there is [some statistical evidence](https://www.vox.com/22360290/black-lives-matter-protest-crime-ferguson-effects-murder) that has been construed to show that following the announcement of the Chauvin prosecution and related protests before and after that was done, that police took a less active role in policing that led to higher crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements best describes the implications of Castle Rock v.

Gonzales established that police officers have discretion in enforcing laws and cannot be sued for failing to enforce a particular law. However, this protection does not extend to affirmative actions taken by officers. The case specifically relates to inaction, not actions that officers choose to take.

The station as a business and the DJ as an individual would have some legal exposure to \"out\" or reveal affairs on the air, so if the show is not a total act, all callers will have signed or agreed to verbal releases which state that all participants are recorded and the outcomes may be unpredictable, the station and the DJ are not liable, etc. One or two party consent for recording and broadcasting will be respected; if they weren't, the station would be sued out of existence.\n\nThe idea that they ask for consent on the air and act like that is required is simply more of the act. 99% of the listeners have no legal training, and the magic word \"consent\" makes the show sound more real and lawful. As above, there *could* be releases agreed to on the phone before the call is switch to broadcast, i.e. *\"do you agree to let us broadcast you and are you aware of this and any ramifications?\"* and that would be recorded by the station for their legal protection.

These types of radio segments are often staged with actors to avoid legal complications. In cases where real people might be involved, the radio station would need to obtain extensive off-air legal agreements and releases from all parties to protect themselves from potential lawsuits. The on-air request for consent is likely part of the act to make the segment seem more authentic to listeners.

The requirement under that '34 Act is to disclose all material information about the company that a reasonable investor would be influenced by in making an investment decision. There are regulations and there is case law governing what does and does not have to be disclosed, but there is still a great deal of discretion in deciding what to include.\n\nBut if your company fails to disclose information under the '34 Act and an investor sues the company for failing to disclose it, and a judge and jury handling the case determine in the court process that the information had to be disclosed under this vague standard and that someone was harmed economically as a result of the non\\-disclosure, then the company (and often people affiliated with the company) have liability to the people who the court finds were harmed by the non\\-disclosure for securities fraud and that liability cannot be discharged in bankruptcy in most cases (and is also eligible for special treatment in the debt collection process to enforce the judgment).\n\n**Application**\n\n> If I run a publicly traded company that's releasing hardware and that\n> hardware is compromised and customer data is harvested, do I have to\n> publicize that leak's existence?\n\nYou do if it is of a magnitude covered by state law, or if the existence of the leak would be material to an investor in the company's securities (either stock or bonds).\n\n> What if the people that found that data are presumed to be trustworthy\n> and are willing to destroy the data upon payment?\n\nThis depends on the language of an individual state disclosure law at the state level.

The use of a beep-tone warning device is a federally regulated method to give lawful notice of potential monitoring or recording, which can rebut an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. This method doesn't require verbal confirmation and is generally considered lawful even in states that typically require all-party consent.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the employee is not legally required to tell you if they are recording, even if directly asked. They may simply state that the conversation is not confidential.\n\nAnswer B is false because while some states require all-party consent, federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d)) permits recording with single-party consent.

Rather it defines what is protected by copyright, and specifies some cases in whch a work is not protected. (For nexample, [17 USC 105](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105) provides tht works of the US Federal Government are not protected.) Anything not included in the protection of copyright is in the public domain. This has been confirmed by many cour cases and legal writings. Law generally follows the rule \"Anything not forbidden is allowed.\"\n\n#### Audio as Derivitive Work\n\nAn audio recording of a person reading a text aloud would be a derivative work of that text, and would normally have its own copyright, if created lawfully. (If the recording was of a text protected by copyright, made without permission and outside of fair use, it was not made lawfully and the infringer has no copyright in the recording at all.) But US courts have held that a work created by a mechanical or automatic process, including many computer programs, is not an \"original work of authorship\" and thus is not protected by copyright at all, and is thus in the Public Domain. The case of the \"Monkey Selfie\" is on point. ([\"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, \u00a7 313\\.2\" (PDF)](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf). United States Copyright Office. 22 December 2014\\. p. 22\\. \"To qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being.... Works that do not satisfy this requirement are not copyrightable. The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.\"\n\nMoreover, if the audio were protected by copyright, it would presumably be owned by the person who ran the program, and [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) specifically grants the copyright owner permission to distribute copies.\n\n### Sources\n\n* The [Wikipedia article \"Public Domain\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) reads in relevant part (citations omitted):\n\n> The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply.

How about services like YouTube(they have income from ads from posted videos)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're talking about sites *like Youtube*, so I'll focus on that.\n\nThat quote, which you bolded, was over\\-simplified. The actual law is\n\n> **17 USC 512 (c) Information Residing on Systems or Networks At Direction of Users.**\n> \n> \n> **(1\\) In general.** A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider\n> \n> \n> **(A)**  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(I)** does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(ii)** in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(iii)** upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;  \n> \n> **(B)** does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and  \n> \n> (C says and complies with a DMCA takedown notice).\n\nWhat you're talking about is membership fees (e.g. [Youtube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium))... or general advertisements that would be placed on **any** video without awareness of it being infringing.\n\nThat does not violate Safe Harbor *per se*. At least not on a legitimate site which is dominated by legitimate content and makes an honest, credible effort to keep it that way.\n\nThe important clause in (B) is \"In a case...\" Under (B), they lack the *ability* to control each activity (upload or view).\n\nYoutube's inability is due to receiving 500 hours (30,000 minutes) of uploaded video *every minute*, obviously requiring 30,000\\+\\+ staff seats working 24x7 to curate. That would amount to about 200,000 staff \\- all of Google is around 50,000 right now.\n\nEven if a small site were able to moderate all content, they might still have a Safe Harbor defense if they could credibly say that they did not know the material was infringing. If someone created a \"Juan Brown\" username and uploaded blancolirio's videos from YouTube, they could say \"we did not know that was not the real person\". *But if the video started with an HBO splash screen and tones, then heck no.*\n\nBut non\\-moderation is not an airtight defense. When sites are neglectful toward removal, they can soon develop a reputation as a haven for such infringing content \\- which the sites tend to embrace, since it brings many customers! This was the undoing of several music sharing sites in the 00's, since this awareness of their reputation, plus a lack of diligent removal, failed them on all three arms of 1(A) above.\n\n---\n\nRemember that a competently run website that relies on user submissions is well aware of the DMCA and its case law, and has tailored its rules and enforcement to make it easy to defend a copyright claim. For instance, in the case of music, Youtube uses some human intervention but largely automated means to either\n\n* take it down and give the uploader a copyright \"strike\" leading to a ban (which alienates their biggest contributors, especially when a popular Youtuber like blancolirio winds up with a distant car stereo in background noise, remember the detection is by \"bot\" and no human ever sanity\\-checks it).\n* de\\-monetize the suspect video (uploader gets nothing, but, neither does YouTube).\n* monetize it, but give the revenue stream to the rights holder due to an agreement with them.\n\nThe last one is Youtube's preference with regards to music. As this was vastly easier, more practical and better for the community all\\-around, allowing whole classes of content to be created that would be *prima\\-facie* illegal otherwise.

You have no obligation to continue using an email account that causes problems for you. Simply abandoning the account is not the wisest choice, since there is some chance that someone may gain access to the account and they do bad things with it. You are not liable for things that others do with your email, but it may be a nuisance to establish that it was someone else who used your account to do bad things.

If so, the alternative question seems to be, can you legally log into that account (assuming that you know the password to the electric account), and change the email address to something else. This would almost certainly be a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, because you are not authorized to access that account \u2013 it's not your account, despite your email address being associated with it.

This is because licenses are contracts, and contracts only have as much force as the law provides for.\n\nAs [previously mentioned](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/7835/3209) on this site, Creative Commons acknowledges that even a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (the least restrictive CC licence) cannot necessarily revoke all of an author's rights, particularly moral rights. \n\nIn France, [moral rights](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=131517FC37031E1B642057DA59DE084D.tpdila12v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006161636&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&dateTexte=20161027) include a *droit de retrait*.

The \"droit de retrait\" is a moral right recognized in French Intellectual Property law, which allows authors to withdraw their work from publication. This right can override the irrevocability clause of a CC license, as licenses are contracts that only have as much force as the law provides. However, this doesn't necessarily invalidate the entire CC license - other aspects may remain valid. It's important to note that invoking \"droit de retrait\" is difficult and not applicable to software. Option A is incorrect because the entire license isn't necessarily void.

A second defendant was cleared of only 52 of the 65 charges but two jurors would not acquit on the remaining counts. The second trial of 6 of those charges lasted 2 months and resulted in a hung jury, at which point the prosecutor gave up.

Therefore, under section (b), criminal trials take precedence over civil cases; criminal trials are to commence within 60 days or 90 days, depending on whether defendant is incarcerated. There are a number of factors that allow the deadline clock to reset, such as failure to appear, mistrial, change of venue etc. This also includes \"exclusions\" (events not counted for the 60/90 day rule) such as competency hearings, continuances and of particular interest for covid:\n\n> (8\\) Unavoidable or\n> unforeseen circumstances affecting the time for trial beyond the\n> control of the court or of the parties.\n\nIf that doesn't work out, then there is a \"cure\":\n\n> (g) The court may continue the case beyond the limits specified in\n> section (b) on motion of the court or a party made within five days\n> after the time for trial has expired.

Obviously, tax audits are done by tax collection officials.\n\nIn the United States, financial accounting standards for non\\-profits are primarily set by a private organization controlled by the accounting profession called the [Not\\-for\\-Profit Advisory Committee](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/BridgePage&cid=1351027226246) which provides advise that is usually followed to the accounting profession controlled private [Financial Accounting Standards Board](http://www.fasb.org/home) that defines \"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\" (GAAP) in the United States for the for profit and non\\-profit sectors. This is the main body that sets industry accounting standards particular to non\\-profits and for fund accounting.\n\nThe private sector financial standards set by organizations like the FASC and NAC which are controlled by the accounting profession, are then adopted by reference by public or private organizations that want to specify accounting rules without having to devise them from scratch themselves.\n\nThese financial accounting standards are subject to specific tax law rules set by the IRS (under the Internal Revenue Code, [ERISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act), and related regulations and regulatory guidance) and state tax collection agencies, and by other industry specific regulations.\n\nIn cases where non\\-profits issue publicly held debt, the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or other applicable state and federal securities regulators, and the governing body of any exchange upon which the bonds issued by the non\\-profit are traded can also impose accounting standards. \n\nState probate statute also set some of the accounting standards for non\\-profits such as the rules for distinguishing between principal and interest.\n\nPublic or private donors to non\\-profits usually make grants that condition receipt of grant funds on a right to audit the non\\-profit, and investors in bonds issued by a non\\-profit generally have either a contractual or statutory right to obtain audited financial statements from the non\\-profit as well. These audits would usually be performance by Certified Public Accountants in private practice (and regulated under state administered licensing schemes) who are hired on an audit by audit basis.\n\nIn addition to tax collection authorities, and private people who have audit rights because they have invested in bonds from the entity or have given grants to the entity, **state attorneys\\-general** will generally have broad supervisory authority over non\\-profits including the same kinds of rights with respect to a non\\-profit that a beneficiary of a private trust would have (although sometimes a different official in state government is given this authority). \n\nState attorneys\\-general are given this authority so that there is someone with jurisdiction to oversee the affairs of, and prosecute misconduct in, charitable organizations with no well defined individuals or entities that are permanent beneficiaries of the charities.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following organizations is primarily responsible for setting financial accounting standards for non-profits in the United States?\n\nA) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nB) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\nC) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nD) The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO)\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the correct answer.

In medieval times, all educated people in the British isles, not just judges wore robes and these were customs descended from the Gaelic people who originally ruled Britain and Ireland. This custom differed from that of the Romans who wore togas.\n\nThe Gaelic elite wore robes with color signifying rank, black being the lowest rank, that of a docent, the lowest level of a professor. Later, when the Saxons invaded they eventually adopted some of the customs of the Gaels. The culmination of this was the founding of what is now known as Oxford University by [King Alfred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great), the greatest of the Saxon kings. This tradition was preserved and developed at Oxford which affected the dress of all academics, including lawyers and justices.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)\n\n**Thomas More in his regalia typical of an Oxford Don, c. 1500**\n\nThese patterns of dress also were influenced somewhat by Italian clerical styles.

Shutting down the current company and starting a new one wouldn't automatically allow the developer to use the same software, as it would be considered an asset of the original company.

In Arizona, DBA (Doing Business As) names are typically recorded at the county level. This is the most effective first step because:\n\n1. The name \"SuperMart\" might be a DBA name rather than the legal entity name.\n2. Arizona Corporation Commission records might not have the DBA name listed, making it difficult to find the correct entity.\n3. Contacting the store manager (option A) may not yield accurate legal information.\n4. Filing a lawsuit without knowing the correct entity (option D) could lead to dismissal or delays.\n5. Searching county-level DBA records allows the customer to find the link between the public-facing name and the legal entity name.\n\nOption B is not the best first step because the Arizona Corporation Commission might not have the DBA name listed, making it difficult to find the correct entity without knowing its legal name.\n\nOnce the correct legal entity is identified through the DBA records, the customer can then search for the registered agent information through the Arizona Corporation Commission to properly serve the lawsuit."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/62547/what-was-wrong-with-the-warrant-application-in-malley-v-briggs", "docs_id": 62547, "title": "What was wrong with the warrant application in Malley v.

Briggs*, 475 U.S. 335 (1986\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/475/335/#tab-opinion-1956513) describes a wiretapped phone call that led police to obtain a warrant against Plaintiff James Briggs:\n\n> \"General conversation re. a party they went to last night . . . caller says I can't believe I was token \\[sic] in front of Jimmy Briggs \\-\\- caller states he passed it to Louisa . . . Paul says Nancy was sitting in his lap rolling her thing.\"\n\nPolice brought drug\\-possession charges against the plaintiff, but the grand jury declined to indict. Briggs then brought a Section 1983 claim for malicious prosecution, and the Court held that the claim was viable if the officer should have known \"that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause, and that he should not have applied for the warrant.\"\n\nIt may not even be the point of the case, but does the Court's decision give any indication that the affidavit did or did not meet that standard?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. It affirmed the appeals decision and remanded the case to the lower court to decide that as a matter of fact, it was irrelevant to the ruling whether the officer and/or magistrate had probable cause.\n\nBasically the ruling said that should have been addressed before giving a judgement, and not glossed over. If the lower court had said, and the court of appeals had affirmed, that there was probable cause and thus the officer was entitled to qualified immunity, the high court would have denied certiorari and let the decision stand.\n\nInstead, the lower court said, true statements, immune, which puts the total burden on the magistrate.\n\nSay that officer had a sworn statement saying that John Doe of 123 Main Street was seen committing murder. The officer goes to a magistrate and says that they have a sworn statement that John Doe was seen committing murder, and there is a John Doe at 321 First Street, please issue an arrest and search warrant for John Doe at 321 First Avenue. Omitting the fact that the identified John Doe is at a different address, doesn\u2019t change the truth of the rest of the information submitted to the magistrate.\n\nAccording to the lower courts ruling, that would be entirely legal and the officer could not be held accountable.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the officer would be liable because while the facts were true no reasonable officer would believe there was probable cause to issue a warrant for a different John Doe under the circumstances.\n\nThe dissenting opinion in this case amounts to saying that the affidavit was good, and they could directly affirm the appeals court ruling.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Malley v. Briggs (1986), the Supreme Court ruled on the liability of police officers in obtaining warrants.

The Supreme Court's decision in Malley v. Briggs established that police officers can be held liable under Section 1983 if they should have known that their affidavit failed to establish probable cause, even if the facts presented were true. This ruling rejected the lower courts' position that officers were immune as long as they presented truthful information, regardless of omissions or context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reflects the lower courts' position that the Supreme Court explicitly rejected. The Court emphasized that truthfulness alone does not guarantee immunity.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Court specifically held that officers could be liable, not just magistrates. This was a key point in rejecting the idea that the entire burden should fall on the magistrate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Court did not make any determination about whether probable cause existed in this specific case. In fact, the Court remanded the case for further proceedings on this issue, indicating that it was not making a judgment on the merits of the probable cause in this instance.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the Court's nuanced approach, recognizing that officers have a responsibility to apply reasonable judgment in seeking warrants, beyond merely presenting truthful information."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23708/uploading-code-of-php-course-to-github", "docs_id": 23708, "title": "Uploading code of php course to github", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am learning a PHP course from Udemy.

[This rather long document](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf) analyzes the notion of \"declaration of war\". The primary significance of a \"declaration of war\" lies in international law, see the [Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907). Articles 1 and 2 say:\n\n> The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves\n>  must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form\n>  either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with\n>  conditional declaration of war\n\nand\n\n> The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers\n>  without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after\n>  the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by\n>  telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of\n>  notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware\n>  of the existence of a state of war\n\nSo if the US were to declare war on Canada, we would need to officially notify the government of Canada of this fact, which we could do because there is a country Canada whose government we can inform. This is not possible with \"terrorism\", which is not a nation. There were official declarations for the War of 1812, against Mexico, Spain, and WW I, WW II (11 declarations). Since \"the South\" was not (from the perspective of \"the North\") a separate country, the United States did not declare war on itself to conduct the Civil War. In fact, since the congressional action authorizing military action against the Algerine Cruisers (the [2nd Barbary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War)) in 1815, the actions authorized by Congress have not used the word \"war\" (except in mentioning a specific law, the War Powers Act), except in the aforementioned declared wars.

The information provided indicates that while the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, formal declarations of war have been rare in U.S. history. Since 1815, most congressional authorizations for military action have not used the word \"war\" but instead described specific actions to be taken. The U.S. has engaged in numerous military conflicts without formal declarations of war, including against non-state actors like terrorist organizations. This flexibility allows the U.S. to conduct military operations against various types of adversaries, not just recognized nation-states, without the need for a formal declaration of war in each instance."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7108/buying-for-someone-else-with-reimbursement-uk-is-it-a-sale", "docs_id": 7108, "title": "Buying for someone else with reimbursement (UK): is it a sale?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I buy a Steam game as a gift for someone, as a favor, under the condition I will be reimbursed as soon as possible, and that the sum I'm going to receive only covers my expense.\n\nUnder UK law, does exchanging the gift and the reimbursement constitute a sale involving me and the recipient of the gift?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK law, if Person A buys a Steam game as a gift for Person B, with the understanding that Person B will reimburse Person A for the exact cost, which of the following best describes the legal nature of this transaction?\n\nA) It constitutes a sale between Person A and Person B\nB) It is considered a gift with no legal obligation for reimbursement\nC) It is a loan agreement between Person A and Person B\nD) It is an informal arrangement with no clear legal classification\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThis scenario falls into a gray area in UK law. It's not clearly defined as a sale, gift, or loan. Option A is incorrect because Person A is not acting as a retailer or making a profit. Option B is incorrect because there is an expectation of reimbursement, unlike a typical gift. Option C is not accurate as it's not structured as a formal loan. \n\nOption D is the most appropriate answer because this arrangement lacks the formal elements of a sale, gift, or loan.
