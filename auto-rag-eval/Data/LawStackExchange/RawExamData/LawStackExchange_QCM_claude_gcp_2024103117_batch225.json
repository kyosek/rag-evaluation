Is it correct that withdrawing a job offer based on a test positive for THC products would be illegal by this legislation?

It is *not* an absolute prohibition. \u00a72103(b)(3\\) states that\n\n> Nothing in this act shall require an employer to commit any act that\n> would put the employer or any person acting on its behalf in violation\n> of Federal law.\n\nSince employers may be subject to federal drug\\-free workplace rules, detectable usage of medical marijuana is a fireable offense on such jobs, until the federal regulations are eliminated. The law is also clear that this does not create a right to be under the influence while on the job, and [\u00a7510](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&yr=2016&sessInd=0&smthLwInd=0&act=16&chpt=5&sctn=10&subsctn=0) lists definite prohibitions against actions while under the influence.\n\nAs for the question of whether the law prohibits discrimination based on simple possession of a card but does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of actual use (leaving aside the preceding disclaimers), this has been decided in\n[Palmiter v.

A police officer came to the door of the house I was living in, and told us that someone had stolen a large theta from the front of a frat house, and that someone walking down our street at around 6:00am had seen the letter on the lawn in our front yard. Given that it was stolen property the police officer told us that he could get a search warrant for our house, and if we didn't let him in he would block our cars in with his car and wait for the search warrant. We had nothing to do with the stealing of the letter and woke up long after it was gone. We assumed someone had drunkenly stolen it and dropped it on our front lawn. One of my roommates ended up getting scared and letting the officer in so the point was moot, but I did not think the officer was being truthful in saying he could obtain a search warrant. The stolen property had been seen on our lawn, but there was no way anyone could prove (because it was false) that we had anything to do with stealing the letter, or that the letter was even still around.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Keep in mind that a warrant doesn't require proof that you stole the property or have the property. Instead, the warrant is just authorization to look for that proof.\n\nThe standard for securing a warrant is probable cause, which is a much lower bar to clear than people seem to think. It just requires that given everything the officer knows, there's a \"substantial probability\" that a piece of evidence will be in a given place at a given time.\n\nIf the officer swore to a judge that a reliable source had told him that the letter was stolen, then seen in your front yard, and not seen since, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the judge gave him a search warrant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of search warrants and probable cause, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) A search warrant requires definitive proof that stolen property is inside a specific location.\n\nB) Probable cause for a search warrant necessitates evidence that the occupants of a property were directly involved in a crime.\n\nC) A police officer needs to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that evidence will be found before obtaining a search warrant.\n\nD) Probable cause for a search warrant can be established if there's a substantial probability that evidence related to a crime may be present at a location.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As stated in the documentation, the standard for securing a search warrant is probable cause, which requires a \"substantial probability\" that evidence will be found in a particular place at a particular time. This is a lower threshold than many people assume.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because a search warrant does not require definitive proof, only probable cause.\n\nAnswer B is false because probable cause does not necessitate evidence of direct involvement by the occupants. In this case, the mere presence of stolen property on the lawn could potentially be enough for probable cause.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as it sets the bar too high. \"Beyond a reasonable doubt\" is the standard for criminal conviction, not for obtaining a search warrant.\n\nAnswer D correctly reflects the actual standard for probable cause as described in the documentation, making it the most accurate statement among the options provided."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29682/are-employers-liable-for-employee-safety-if-the-workplace-is-declared-a-gun-fre", "docs_id": 29682, "title": "Are employers liable for employee safety if the workplace is declared a &quot;gun free&quot; zone?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a company prohibits their employees from carrying a firearm while on their property, are they legally liable for the safety of their employees in an active shooter situation?\n\nIf they refuse to allow their employees to protect themselves, should the company not then be required to protect them?

(An employer who doesn't have worker's compensation in place is strictly liable to the worker for all injuries suffered by an employee whatsoever at work, without the prohibition of a worker's compensation insurance policy plan on paying things like pain and suffering damages as well.)\n\nWorker's compensation insurance provides coverage (in principle) for all medical costs incurred, all lost wages, and in the event of a death support for dependents if any and a modest death benefit sufficient to provide a funeral if there are no dependents. Often, in practice, worker's compensation insurance payments tend to be rather stingy.\n\nOne of the most common big worker's compensation claims these days, especially in office and retail workplaces, is for employees who are seriously injured or killed in crimes at work.\n\nOften, a worker's compensation insurer will give an employer a discount if they have a \"gun free\" zone, because, statistically, doing so greatly reduces the average amount of harm experienced by employees at work.

In the United States, employees are generally covered by worker's compensation insurance for injuries sustained at work, including those from violent incidents like active shooters. This system operates on a no-fault basis, meaning the employee doesn't need to prove the employer was negligent. \n\nOption A is incorrect because employees typically can't sue their employers for negligence due to the worker's compensation system.\n\nOption C is incorrect as Second Amendment rights are not directly relevant to workplace injury compensation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because pain and suffering damages are usually not available under worker's compensation, which focuses on medical costs and lost wages.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the worker's compensation system and its role in workplace injury scenarios, including violent incidents."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11878/what-is-the-underlying-meaning-of-the-phrase-no-reason-to-believe", "docs_id": 11878, "title": "What is the Underlying Meaning of the Phrase &quot;no reason to believe&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've searched online for this, to no avail.

Of course one has to allow for the possibility that the attorney using the phrase \"no reason to believe,\" may have been doing so more as a hackneyed phrase, trying to give his position emphasis, rather than as part of a statement of logic in which reasons \\[i.e., evidence] support conclusions \\[i.e., allegations].

This is a stronger position than simply denying the allegations, as it puts the burden back on the opposing side to prove both the allegations and the credibility of their evidence.

According to patent law principles, the scope of a patent claim is not determined solely by the actual success of expressing a gene in one organism, but rather by the enablement described in the patent application. Enablement means that the application must describe how to achieve the claimed invention without undue experimentation. \n\nIf the company's patent application describes techniques for expressing gene-X that can be easily applied to other organisms without significant additional effort, then they may be able to claim rights for those organisms as well. However, for organisms where expression would require substantial additional research or non-trivial modifications to the technique, the company would not be able to claim rights as it would not be considered enabled by their application.\n\nOption A is incorrect because successful expression in one organism doesn't automatically grant rights to all organisms.

However, Dasha does not know Boris.

Each side has an account in Russia and an account in Germany. Most day to day transfers happen by directing that money go from one German account to another German account, or from one Russian account to another Russian account.\n\nThe big benefit of correspondent banking, aside from being transparent, is that it avoids currency exchange risks, fees and considerations for small, ordinary transactions.\n\nOf course, it simply isn't difficult or expensive to simply wire money from Russia to Germany, and vice versa, now and then.

Even if the fault was not visible, for example if the product lasts only one year because of a faulty component. \n\nNow with modern electronics, it often happens that the manufacturer updates the software in the product long after the product is purchased. How does that work out legally if let's say I purchased a product 18 months ago, it worked fine because it was actually faultless when I purchased it, and the manufacturer updates the software on the product and breaks it? \n\nNormally if it breaks after 18 months I would have rights against the store where I bought. In this case the store is arguably without fault. So who has to fix this, and how do I get it fixed without going to court?\n\n(A recent example is many Bose headphones suddenly not working anymore after a firmware update).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **Consumer Rights Act 2015** makes provision for consumers to obtain a\nrepair or replacement for an item on which a fault becomes apparant\nafter the consumer has accepted the goods. For six months after\npurchase, the onus is on the retailer to demonstrate that the fault\nwas *not* inherent at the time of purchase, while after six months the\nonus is on the consumer to demonstrate that it was. \n\nYou might argue the forced firmware update was an inherent design flaw in the product as sold. Like any goods supplied that stop working for whatever reason during their\nexpected life, the consumer's rights are against the retailer. \n\nThe CRA gives consumers no recourse against the manufacturer; their\ncontract (and all liability) is solely with the retailer. But, if \nthe item was fine when they bought it, they have no recourse against\nthe retailer if the fault was not inherent at time of purchase.\n\nAn action emedy against the manufacturer in tort might be more possible. If it is inherent in the purchase that the manufacturer will be supplying firmware updates this may create a duty of care for the manufacturer, stopping the device working is direct harm and it seems likely to be negligent to design firmware that does this. \n\nThe manufacturer might be subecj to a civil action taken under the **Computer Misuse Act** and it could well be criminal damage by whoever forced the faulty update.\n\nIf the manufacturer offers a guarantee in addition to the consumer's statutory rights, this may provide another avenue for remedy.\n\nSummarised from [uk.legal.moderated newsgroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/uk.legal.moderated/-HVseYnFM44)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer in the UK purchased wireless headphones 18 months ago.

Option D is the most comprehensive and accurate approach:\n\n1. Checking for an existing manufacturer's guarantee is a practical first step that could provide an immediate solution.\n\n2. The consumer might have a case against the retailer under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, arguing that the susceptibility to a breaking firmware update was an inherent flaw in the product at the time of purchase. However, this argument may be challenging after 18 months.\n\n3. Action against the manufacturer could be considered, potentially in tort (if a duty of care can be established regarding firmware updates) or under the Computer Misuse Act if the update was forced and damaging.\n\n4. The nature of the firmware update and how it was implemented (forced vs. optional, with or without warnings) would be crucial in determining the strength of any legal action.\n\nThis approach acknowledges the complexity of the situation and suggests a step-by-step process to seek remedy, considering multiple angles rather than assuming a single clear-cut solution."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90985/do-atheistic-men-have-the-right-to-cover-their-heads-though-not-faces-with-hij", "docs_id": 90985, "title": "Do atheistic men have the right to cover their heads (though not faces) with hijabs in mugshots in New York city?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In 2020, the NYPD reached a settlement with three Muslim women who were forced to remove their hijabs (which obscured their heads, but not their faces) for the purpose of having their mugshots taken ([https://ecbawm.com/wp\\-content/uploads/2020/11/ClarkSettlement.pdf](https://ecbawm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ClarkSettlement.pdf))\n\nAs a result, Muslim women in New York are no longer required to remove their hijabs during mugshots.\n\nAn obvious consequence of being able to cover one's head in a mugshot is that allows one to be less identifiable (to law enforcement, to the public who may see the mugshot on the news, etc) than someone whose entire head is visible.

It also wouldn't really be relevant in a *Daubert* hearing which goes to the reliability of the field and methodologies relied upon in general, not to the way that a particular expert chooses to apply those methodologies to the particular facts of the case before the court.\n\nYou could argue that the evidence is more or less reliable as a result and explain why this is the case in non\\-technical terms to a trier of fact (i.e. to a jury in a jury trial, or a judge in a bench trial). One could also introduce discussion of these underlying factual issues or a frequentist analysis to impeach or rebut the testimony of an expert witness giving testimony on a frequentist basis about its accuracy.\n\nThe weight given to the admitted evidence is in the exclusive province of the trier of fact.\n\nA Bayes Theorem analysis would be inadmissible at trial because it would intrude on the authority of the trier of facts to be the sole person or persons weighing the evidence and determining its credibility. This is because Bayes Theorem is essentially a specific methodology for determining how much weight to give evidence based upon prior experience outside the circumstances upon which admissible evidence has been presented at trial that is used to generate a Bayesian prior.\n\nBut Bayes Theorem is not really within its domain of applicability in the context of something as global as a guilt/innocence determination in a criminal case which is too complex for that to be applied with the kind of scientific certainty that posing the question in that manner suggests. So, this rule is basically a wise one.\n\nWhen the law wants to apply something comparable to a Bayesian prior into a legal analysis, the usual form that this takes in legal doctrine is some sort of rebuttable legal presumption (e.g. the docrrine of *res ipsa loquitor* in tort law).

Singleton predates Marbury v. Madison and involved a state court striking down a state law.\n\nB is incorrect because Bayard v. Singleton shows that state courts were exercising judicial review before Marbury v. Madison.\n\nC is incorrect because Bayard v.

Madison (1803), which established judicial review for federal laws by the U.S. Supreme Court."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21543/imaginary-potential-murder-situation", "docs_id": 21543, "title": "Imaginary potential murder situation", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend and I were discussing moral and legal aspects of an interesting hypothetical situation, but since neither of us are lawyers we would like to ask somebody here how it would be treated from the legal perspective. So here is our imaginary situation :\n\nA person is driving an SUV, and suddenly sees somebody lying on the road and not moving, as if he is either dead or passed out or drunk sleeping. It is too late to break. The driver could make a split second decision : either to immediately turn the steering wheel to the side to avoid running over the person on the ground, in which case he would damage his SUV by going off\\-road and hitting various obstacles, (but the speed is not so high to threaten the life of the driver himself), or \\- simply run over the person believing he is already dead, so why not at least save the damage to the SUV. The driver (who is kind of scumbag), loving his SUV, decides that the guy on the ground is already dead and runs him over.\n\nNow I will give some important \"rules\" in this case that I would like you to take as facts and answer as if they were true :\n\n* Once the person is run over with SUV, he is definitely dead now.\n* There is absolutely no way to establish forensically (or by any other means) whether the person was dead or passed out or drunk before he was ran over. (Lets forget that there is toxicology that could establish alcohol level and all that stuff \\- imagine simply that we just can't know whether he was dead already).\n* At the moment the person was ran over, he did not react in any way (in a sense that he did not scream or something similar, so we again, can not know whether he was already dead). There are no any kind of clues that suggest anything \\- how long has he been lying on the road, there are no alcohol bottles nearby, nobody knows him \\- he has no family/friends or anyone he called etc. \\- in other words again \\- we absolutely cannot establish or even guess in any way whether the person was already dead before being run over.\n* Driver explained perfectly honestly what happened, so the court/police/prosecutor know exactly what happened as I have described \\- they know everything you know reading this :)\n\nSo how would the driver be prosecuted for this \"potential murder\" ? If the court can not in any way establish whether the person was already dead or not, can driver be charged with murder ? Is there such thing as \"potential murder\" in law ? Or will the person be considered dead already, in which case the driver \"just\" mutilated the dead body of a man ?\n\n**Edit : some additional explanation about the question**\n\nThank you all for great and detailed answers. Just if you were curious, this question relates to some thoughts of my friend and myself, related to abortion actually. This is how we were thinking : if science can not give us a definitive answer (the definite scientific proof that is universally agreed upon) when the fetus becomes alive (at what week), and it is allowed for us to perform abortion at 12th week, then the abortion is like running over a person on the road in the above question, because :\n\n* Once the abortion is performed, the fetus is definitely dead (or not alive).\n* We cannot in any way be sure (universally agree \\- beyond reasonable doubt as you professionally put it) whether he was alive or not before the abortion.\n\nTherefore there is no crime in performing abortion while not knowing whether the fetus was alive before the abortion.\n\nWe were interested whether this would be something like \"potential murder\" as I called it in the question. Thanks to your answers I conclude that if it so happens that fetus was actually alive right before 12th week, than I guess something like \"unproveable involuntary manslaughter\" was committed since it can not be proven that fetus was actually alive (although it was) before abortion. This is equivalent in the question to running over alive person, who either passed out or was drunk, killing him, but without knowledge or evidence of him being killed. On the other hand, if fetus was not alive right before 12th week, that is equivalent to running over a guy that is already dead (or not alive), so no damage or crime whatsoever was done anyway.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n===\n\nI'm going to assume we're talking about the US, where being convicted of a crime requires proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Thus, our hypothetical friend has NOT committed murder. Nor has he committed manslaughter (as this too requires that somebody die) or attempted murder or manslaughter (as that requires an intent that the person should die). If it could be proven that the person our hypothetical scumbag ran over died as a result of being run over, our hypothetical scumbag would likely have committed negligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter; however, as these imply a lack of intent, they lack \"attempted\" versions (see People v. Hernandez, [http://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/court\\-of\\-appeals/1980/76\\-813\\.html](http://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/court-of-appeals/1980/76-813.html) though state laws differ and some may be weird). In short, he has not committed any flavor of murder or manslaughter.\n\n**So, what other enterprising charge or legal proceeding might we be able to level against him? I'm sure one exists. ~~I'll edit it in once I find it.~~**\n\nCivil suit for wrongful death\n=============================\n\nNormally, our hypothetical scumbag would find himself on the receiving end of a wrongful death lawsuit. This would require that he **(1\\)** owed the dead man a duty of care (which he clearly did; all motorists are obliged to exhibit reasonable care in operating their motor vehicles) and that he **(2\\)** breached that duty (which he presumably did), but also that **(3\\)** this failure caused the death of the guy he ran over (which you have stipulated that we cannot \"even guess,\" which precludes a \"preponderance of the evidence\" (the standard for civil matters)) and that **(4\\)** that person's death has caused actual, quantifiable damages to the plaintiff (which it can't as \"nobody knows him\").\n\nReckless driving charge\n=======================\n\nIn most states, our hypothetical scumbag's behavior meets the threshold for reckless driving. For example, in VA law:\n\n> \\[In reckless driving cases, e]ither the driver is believed to have driven recklessly in a manner that threatened people or property, to have driven 20 miles per hour or more in excess of the speed limit, or to have exceeded 80 miles per hour, no matter the speed limit.\n\n[http://manassascriminalattorney.com/2015/10/can\\-reckless\\-driving\\-in\\-virginia\\-be\\-a\\-felony\\-charge/](http://manassascriminalattorney.com/2015/10/can-reckless-driving-in-virginia-be-a-felony-charge/)\n\nIn some states, this may be felony reckless driving; in others, it may be a mere misdemeanor.\n\nMisc links\n==========\n\n[https://www.virginia\\-criminallawyer.com/homicide\\-laws\\-virginia\\-code.html](https://www.virginia-criminallawyer.com/homicide-laws-virginia-code.html)\n[http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/proving\\-wrongful\\-death\\-civil\\-case.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/proving-wrongful-death-civil-case.html)\n\nA forum discussion that (thank heaven) cited its sources:\n[http://www.top\\-law\\-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t\\=155412](http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=155412)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the hypothetical scenario where a driver runs over a person lying on the road, believing them to be already dead, and it's impossible to determine if the person was alive or dead before being hit, which of the following legal outcomes is most likely in the United States, assuming all facts are known to the court?\n\nA) The driver would be charged with murder, as they made a conscious decision to run over the body.\n\nB) The driver would be charged with attempted murder or manslaughter, as they intended to run over a potentially living person.\n\nC) The driver would be charged with negligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter, as they caused a death through negligent actions.\n\nD) The driver would be charged with reckless driving, as their actions endangered people or property, but murder charges couldn't be proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In this scenario, murder charges cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt because it's impossible to determine if the person was alive before being hit. Attempted murder or manslaughter also require intent to harm a living person, which can't be established. Negligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter require proof that the driver's actions caused a death, which again can't be established beyond doubt. However, the driver's decision to run over the body instead of avoiding it clearly demonstrates reckless behavior that endangered people or property, meeting the threshold for a reckless driving charge in most states. This charge can be pursued regardless of whether the person was alive or dead before being hit, making it the most likely legal outcome given the circumstances."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45533/what-an-employer-can-legally-ask-to-monitor-about-user-activity", "docs_id": 45533, "title": "What an employer can legally ask to monitor about user activity", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work for a **Belgian** company as systems engineer, and I'm asked by the HR department to **give them logs of a specific user's activity**.

This, along with the GDPR, are the key legislative references that relate to your question.\n\nOn 5th September 2017 the ECHR judged that it \"considers that States should ensure that, when an employer takes measures to monitor employees' communications, these measures are accompanied by adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse\". This case set a precedent relevant to employee monitoring in Belgium.\n\nThis is most definitely a data protection or privacy law matter and the DPO should be consulted. If they have to do research, that shouldn't be your concern as that is their job. The company must support the DPO in what they need to do that job, as such is literally written into the GDPR. Furthermore, in this case it would, by my evaluation, be necessary to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the monitoring activity, and if one has been done, it should document the recommendations and requirements or what is already in place.\n\nYou as an individual may also ask a question of the Data Protection Authority:\n\n* (NL) [https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/verzoek\\-klacht\\-indienen](https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/verzoek-klacht-indienen)\n* (FR) [https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/introduire\\-une\\-requete\\-une\\-plainte](https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/introduire-une-requete-une-plainte)\n\nYou might ask them about your position and liability as an employee, but I would be more concerned, if I were you, with verifying that your actions are above board rather than trying to cover your ass just in case they aren't. Do the right thing, even if that means questioning the direction you've been given.\n\nAD logons still identify the person logging on, and may include source IP, which is specifically listed in the GDPR as within the scope of 'personal data'. So while there may be a legitimate need to process such data, it needs to be gone about in the right way.\n\nActions taken by an employee are taken by the organisation in terms of processing personal data, so whatever you are asked or ordered to do, will be done by the company. If you are being offered no legal justification for doing so, you might document the direction you are given and question it respectfully, pointing out that if found to be unlawful, it is the company that would be in trouble, all while knowing that should there be for example an unfair dismissal, you have a record of who asked you to do what, how you challenged or questioned it, and what was the outcome.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: As a systems engineer in a Belgian company, you are asked by HR to provide logs of a specific user's activity while working from home.

In this case, I'd receive $900\\.00 in credits after all was said and done.\n\nI've spent the past 6\\-7\\+ months trying to get these credits. I've talked with *literally* 50\\+ different respresentatives over 30\\+ separate days. My family and I have spent dozens of hours trying to work with the store, the phone reps, in chat, etc. and I'm burnt on putting more effort into this. This is a very cut\\-down synopsis of the chronology:\n\n* The first month was solely trying to receive the promotional codes after the phones were activated. Repeatedly calling/driving to the store to check on this and being told to wait. Eventually the codes had to be manually created since they agreed the codes were not actually processing.\n* The second/third month was various attempts to bring in phones to redeem the credits with. Multiple stores over multiple days couldn't get the codes to go through. Dozens of hours into calling to try and resolve this. Eventually, after the two months they agreed the codes were defective and that they'd manually credit the promotion to me after taking my three trade\\-in phones.\n* The fourth/fifth month was waiting out the billing cycles and keeping ahead of checking on my status. Nothing went through and I was even told they didn't have a record of where the phones I brought in were due to no tracking number.\n* The sixth month has been my ongoing attempt to voice my complains over how long this has taken. I've wrote a formal letter to their correspondence team and called multiple times to try and come to some kind of settlement before considering legal options. It's been two weeks and I haven't received any formal response to my letter or calls.\n\n**Questions:** \n\n* What, if any, legal boundary have they crossed by not having this resolved in a timely manner; or by having such issues with the entire process (still ongoing)?\n* Would punitive charges/compensation be possible if I brought this to small claims court?

Many legal lines are thin and dull, and can only be discerned by a practicing attorney, if then, and I would say that there's nothing we could add that wouldn't constitute the illegal practice of law, when it comes to the matter of you succeeding in a lawsuit. We also can't advise about the likelihood of punes in small claims court, but we can tell you what the law is. In [Gage v. Hagen](https://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&seqNo=14832), Gage sued in small claims court asking for nominal damages of $1 and punitive damages of $4,999 (thus keeping it in the $5,000 small claims court threshold). The small claims court dismissed on a \"technicality\" which was not that they can't award punitive damages (the argument was \"one cannot sue for punitive damages if only nominal compensatory damages are found\"). The appeals court overturned that summary judgment. In Wisconsin, there isn't a specific limit on punitive damages and small claims court (and only a legal professional can advise you as to the likelihood of prevaling given your particular circumstance).\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nUser662852's point about going as far up the food chain as you can is correct. Phone talk isn't much good, formal letters are. Phone support people frequently say things that they don't know. Put in writing what go gave them, what you were promised, provide as much proof as you can of this, say why you believe you are entitled to something (that is, don't treat it as obvious, *be explicit* as you would be, were you to file a case in court), and request action by a specific (reasonable) date \\-\\- 10 business days is a common reasonable time to act.

Their starting position is \"complain directly to the person or organisation; use someone else to help you sort it out (called \u2018mediation\u2019 or \u2018alternative dispute resolution\u2019); make a claim in a court or tribunal\". So for example you can complain to the director of the library. This may result in the reply \"we're sorry, we can't\", so you seek mediation (presumably a university ombudsman). If that doesn't work in your favor (and if you still believe you can compel the university to create some alternative medium), then you take it to the courts. [EASS](https://www.gov.uk/equality-advisory-support-service) is happy to help.\n\nThe court will then try to determine if you're suing the right person (it could be the publisher). Under the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/2/crossheading/adjustments-for-disabled-persons) Chapter 2 Section 20, there is a duty to make adjustments: \n\n> Where this Act imposes a duty to make **reasonable** adjustments on a\n>  person, this section, sections 21 and 22 and the applicable Schedule\n>  apply; and for those purposes, a person on whom the duty is imposed is\n>  referred to as A\n\nOne of the central questions would be whether it is reasonable to require a library to create a particular alternative format of a given book. Let's say that you are taking a class on history of science and one of the required texts in Bacon's *Novum Organon*, and you require an audio version of the text. If you cannot comprehend written words but can comprehend spoken words, you are at a substantial disadvantage relative to others, so the university has a duty to eliminate that disadvantage. Then it is simply a matter of determining what actions could eliminate the disadvantage. (In this instance, it is trivial: direct the student to one of the free audio versions, but in some instances, it is an actually hard thing to do).\n\nYou should presume that your university is aware of the law, so you can inquire about their methods for complying with this act. If, by \"challenge (the policy)\" you mean that they have refused to make accommodations, then you probably need to initiate a legal challenge, whereas if you mean \"how do I get what I want\", you start by asking the director of the library how the library will comply with the act, given your specific circumstances.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student with a print disability at a university in England is denied Alternative Format (AF) materials for recommended books that are not on the core reading list.

This approach follows the recommended process outlined in the government link, which suggests starting by complaining directly to the organization. It allows the student to formally raise the issue, seek clarification on the university's policy, and understand how it aligns with legal requirements. This step may resolve the issue without escalation and provides an opportunity for the university to explain or potentially revise their policy. If this doesn't yield satisfactory results, the student can then proceed to other options such as mediation or seeking assistance from EASS before considering legal action."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51577/not-able-go-back-to-china-with-a-b2-tourist-visa", "docs_id": 51577, "title": "Not able go back to China with a B2 Tourist visa", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My relatives came to America from China (not Wuhan) in the middle of January, and they have a B2 tourist visa, meaning that they can only stay in the US for 6 months.

Does he mean that the arbitrator's decision have to be based in the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred? Or could the decision be based on the rules that the litigants have agreed to for the arbitration?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> he makes the assertion that an arbitrator can make any decision that\n> they want, but their decision has to be based in law.\n\nThe question isn't entirely settled.\n\nWhile an arbitrator may have a moral obligation to make a decision based in law, there is usually no legally enforceable way to enforce that obligation, and even when there is a legal obligation it is so deferential that it is almost impossible to enforce in practice.\n\nFor all practical purposes, in the usual case where a contract establishes that certain kinds of disputes are subject to arbitration and someone subject to the contract takes a case to arbitration, the arbitrator can completely disregard the law and is not subject to judicial review for doing so.\\<1\\>\n\nHistorically, the U.S. Supreme Court noted in dictum that \u201cthe\ninterpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard, are not subject, in federal courts, to judicial review for\nerror in interpretation,\" *Wilko v. Swan*, 346 U.S. 427, 436\\-437 (1953\\). This led all U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal to recognize a manifest disregard of the law ground for invalidating an arbitration award.\n\nBut, some lower courts concluded that the U.S. Supreme Court implicitly eliminated this ground for review of arbitration awards when it decided *Hall Street Assoc., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.*, 128 S. Ct. 1396 (2008\\) (holding that the grounds set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) at 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10(a) (1\\)\\-(4\\) and 11 are the exclusive grounds upon which an arbitral award may be vacated or modified.)\n\nSince then, the U.S. Supreme Court has, at a minimum, strongly disfavored the manifest disregard of the law ground for invalidating an arbitration award, but hasn't stated whether this historically recognized ground for setting aside an arbitration award is available at all or not under the Federal Arbitration Act as a clearly as it might. *See, e.g., Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter*, 569 U.S. 564, 572\\-573 (2013\\) (\u201cThe potential for . . . mistakes \\[by the arbitrator] is the price for agreeing to arbitration.\u201d).\n\nAs a result, there is now a circuit split between U.S. Court of Appeals circuits over the ultimate issue of whether even \"manifest disregard for the law\", which was once widely accepted as a ground for setting aside an arbitration award, is still a basis for invalidating an arbitration award under the Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA). *Compare, e.g., Weiss v. Sallie Mae, Inc.*, 939 F.3d 105 (2d Cir. 2019\\) (reversing a lower federal trial court\u2019s decision to vacate that award on grounds that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law), to *Wachovia Securities, LLC v. Brand*, 671 F.3d 472, 483 (4th Cir. 2012\\) (recognizing that \"manifest disregard\" of the law also exists as either an independent ground for overturning arbitral awards or as a judicial gloss on the grounds for vacatur set forth in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\\). *See also* Liz Kramer and Bri\u2019An Davis, \"Manifest Disregard: The Circuit Split Persists\", American Bar Ass\u2019n. (Jul. 6, 2015\\) (the Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuits have held that manifest disregard did not survive *Hall Street Assoc., LLC*, while the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits continue to allow manifest disregard challenges) (with the 2nd Circuit subsequently changing sides in the circuit split in *Weiss* in 2019 leaving four circuits on each side of the split and five circuits with no binding precedents addressing the issue since 2008\\).\n\nIn circuits where manifest disregard for the law is a ground for setting aside an arbitration award the standard to do so is as follows:\n\n> \\[A] court's belief that an arbitrator misapplied the law will not\n> justify vacation of an arbitral award. Rather, appellant is required\n> to show that the arbitrators were aware of the law, understood it\n> correctly, found it applicable to the case before them, and yet chose\n> to ignore it in propounding their decision.\n\n*Remmey v. PaineWebber, Inc.*, 32 F.3d 143, 149 (4th Cir. 1994\\).\n\nGenerally, conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court have disfavored allowing arbitration awards to be vacated on the ground of manifest disregard for the law, while liberals have favored allowing these challenges, although the issue is not entirely partisan. So, given the current very conservative 6\\-3 majority on the current U.S. Supreme Court, if it resolved the split, it would probably be most likely to resolve it in favor of not allowing arbitration awards to be challenged on the ground of manifest disregard for the law.\n\n> Does he mean that the arbitrator's decision have to be based in the\n> laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred?\n\nNo. Choice of law is a question that has been solely in the arbiters discretion for a long time (certainly since 1953\\), at least if there is any colorable reason for applying the law of a jurisdiction other than where the incident occurred even if it is not supported on the merits by applicable law made by courts or is contrary to enacted statutes that should be controlling.\n\n> Or could the decision be based on the rules that the litigants have\n> agreed to for the arbitration?\n\nThis would be permissible, but failure to do so is only rarely enforceable as discussed above.\n\n\\<1\\> One can imagine a very atypically drafted arbitration agreement that somehow changes this predominant rule, but it almost never happens that way.

The suspension of law and rights under martial law is not absolute.

If Alex rescinded, he would return to Phillippa the\n>  car worth \u00a32,200 and get his \u00a32,500 back from Phillippa. So he has his \u00a32,500 back in\n>  his hands.\n> \n> \n> If the court decides to award damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2\\), such damages\n>  would have to achieve the same result. Since no rescission is being ordered, Alex keeps\n>  the car worth \u00a32,200 so he needs another \u00a3300 to bring him up to the \u00a32,500 he could\n>  have got under rescission. What these damages should not cover, however, is any other\n>  items of loss, for example suppose Alex has purchased \u00a3100 of accessories which only\n>  fit models of the year he thought he was purchasing and which are now useless to him.\n>  Such losses would have been left equally uncompensated if rescission plus indemnity\n>  had been awarded and they can only be recovered if Alex establishes some other right\n>  to damages, for example under s.2(1\\), which is considered later. **\\[1\\.] Similarly, if the car\n>  would have been worth \u00a33,000 if of the age represented, there should be no question\n>  of getting an award of \u00a3800** (\u00a33,000 less the \u00a32,200 value of the car received) since that\n>  would be to give him **\\[2\\.]\u00b8his contractual loss of bargain rather than returning each party to\n>  their starting positions**. To gain such loss of bargain damages, Alex would have to prove\n>  that the age of the car was a term, not just a representation and that there was therefore\n>  a breach of contract.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Its the difference between two different causes of action\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Facts**\n\n* Phillipa says she is selling a 2003 Super\\-X car\n* The market value of a 2003 Super\\-X is \u00a33,000\n* Alex and Phillipa agree on a price of \u00a32,500 and complete the transfer\n* The car is actually a 1999 Super\\-X\n* The market value of a 1999 Super\\-X is \u00a32,200\n\nQuestion: Is the error (1999 vs 2003\\) a misrepresentation or a term of the contract?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Misrepresentation**\n\nIt is clearly misrepresentation and this gives Alex grounds to sue. His remedies for misrepresentation are:\n\n* Recision of the contract: Alex gets his \u00a32,500 back and Phillipa gets the car back, or\n* Damages for his **loss**. He gets \u00a3300 (\u00a32,500 \\- \u00a32,200\\) keeps the car and Phillipa keeps the balance of the money.\n\n**Misrepresentation restores you to the position you would have been in if the contract had not happened**\n\n**Breach of contract**\n\nIf Alex can prove that the misrepresentation was more than a pre\\-contractural statement that induced him to enter the contract, that is, he can show that the year of the car is actually a term of the contract, then he can sue for breach of contract. His remedies for breach of contract are:\n\n* Recision (as above) **plus** damages based on his **expectation** of profit from the contract. Alex gets his \u00a32,500 plus the \u00a3500 profit he expected; Phillipa gets the car back, or\n* Damages based on his **expectation** of realizing \u00a33,000\\. He keeps the car (worth \u00a32,200\\) and Phillipa pays him the \u00a3800 difference between that and the value of the car.\n\n**Breach of contract puts you into the position you would have been in if the contract had been completed without the breach**\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\nNot all legal remedies are equal.

This action would be considered battery and is illegal. The legal process for involuntary commitment in India involves either a psychiatric professional or a relative initiating the process (under Article 20 of the Mental Health Act 1987), followed by a court determination. Even in cases where involuntary commitment is ordered, only authorized personnel such as police officers can physically restrain the individual, and they are not permitted to administer sedatives without consent.

It may or may not be investigated, and if it is, charges may or may not be brought, and she has no control over any of that, although she may be able to use persuasion or political pressure to influence the decision.\n\nIn New York, persuading a child to make pornography is a class C felony. Possessing child pornography is a class E felony. Promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child is a class D felony. Disseminating obscene material to a minor is a class E felony, unless the defendant solicits the child to engage in sexual activity, in which case it's a class D felony. All of these have 5\\-year statutes of limitation. (N.Y. Pen.

This answer accurately reflects the current state of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in cases involving states. As explained in Cohens v.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 further clarified this by making the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction exclusive only in suits between two or more states.

Her house was untouched, but it destroyed the fence that stood between her backyard and the backyard of a neighbor.  \n\nInsurance has already approved the construction of a replacement fence; however, the neighbor is refusing to sign off on the construction. The neighbor works in construction, and is claiming that he and his friends in the industry will replace the fence themselves.

There are two issues, his share of the costs, and his permission to construct in part on his property. You mother has the same rights, so she likewise can refuse to sign off on his scheme (the lawyers negotiate a resolution). Assuming both parties are insured and (to make it more complex) have different insurance companies, the companies limit how much they will contribute for their part of the damage. Normally, you find a contractor who will do it for a given price, let's say $10,000, and the parties split the cost. Both parties have an interest in the choice of contractor because of cost issues, and quality of product and service (though the insurance company cares about the cost). If one of the parties is a contractor, they too can legitimately submit a bid, and then the parties can decide which is the best bid.\n\nIt is not fraud if a contractor, who is an insured, submits a bid and makes a profit on the job. It would be fraud if that party withheld material facts from an insurance company. In the context of massive disaster insurance claims, the insurance companies may not perform a rigorous investigation (e.g. may not ask for multiple bids). It would then be a material fact that one of the insureds stood to profit from this arrangement, so the insurance companies would likely wish to see evidence that the costs were not unreasonably inflated. If the neighbors bid is in line with industry standard (and the insurance companies know who the contractor is), there is nothing fishy about the arrangement.\n\nThis assumes that both parties are being cooperative with each other.

According to the documentation, both parties have equal rights in the decision-making process for replacing the shared fence. Neither party can unilaterally decide on the contractor or the terms of the replacement. If they cannot agree, they may need to involve lawyers to negotiate a resolution. The contractor neighbor can legitimately submit a bid, but the other neighbor has the right to consider other options as well. It's not automatically fraud for the contractor neighbor to offer his services, as long as he discloses all material facts to the insurance company. The insurance companies may not always perform rigorous investigations, especially in the context of massive disaster claims, which is why option D is incorrect.

Encryption technology, while classified as a munition by the US government, would likely fall under the category of \"unusual\" weapons.

It is part of an road, utility and drainage easement that I can't change, or would be difficult (and likely pricey) to do.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Kansas evaluates these kinds of cases, known as premises liability cases, under the general law of negligence (which is a common law claim governed by case law in Kansas, rather than a statute, except as modified by specific statutes in some respect or other).\n\nWhen you own or control a piece of property, you are responsible for making reasonable efforts to ensure that visitors are safe. If you fail to identify safety risks that you should have reasonably known about, or if you fail to correct potentially hazardous conditions, you could be held liable for any injuries that result. The law is just that vague and is interpreted by judges and juries on a case by case basis.\n\nWhen that happens Kansas uses a [comparative negligence system](http://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch60/060_002_0058a.html) that evaluates the percentage of the fault attributable to everyone who is alleged to have been negligent including the person injured. Damages are allocated based upon those percentages (unless the person injured is more than 50% at fault, in which case the person injured recovers nothing in the lawsuit).\n\nKansas is not among the states that make a formalistic distinction between the duties owed to \"invitees\", \"licensees\" and \"trespassers\" as the common law historically did. If a risk is foreseeable and you could have taken affordable precautions (relative to the value of the activity the not taking the precaution made possible) to address it, and you didn't, you could be held liable. Trespassing is just one of an infinite number of factors that the jury considers in assigning comparative fault.\n\nThe main pro\\-active actions that you can take are to purchase homeowner's insurance with reasonable liability policy limits and ideally umbrella insurance as well (which increases your policy limits at a modest additional cost), and to communicate in writing to the neighbor (in a way that you can prove if anything happens later) warning your neighbor of the risks that you foresee and urging your neighbor to take care to avoid those risks.\n\nThe statute of limitations in these cases in Kansas is [usually two years](http://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch60/060_005_0013.html) although exceptions apply.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Kansas, a homeowner is concerned about potential liability if their neighbor gets injured while mowing a steep ditch on the homeowner's property without permission.

Property owners are responsible for making reasonable efforts to ensure visitors' safety, regardless of whether they have permission to be there. The state uses a comparative negligence system, where fault is attributed to all parties involved, including the injured person. Trespassing is just one factor considered in assigning comparative fault. The homeowner could potentially be held liable if a risk was foreseeable and they failed to take affordable precautions or warn about the danger. Therefore, even without giving permission, the homeowner may still face some liability if the neighbor is injured while mowing the ditch."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19067/why-dont-prisoners-go-through-rigorous-life-transforming-training-in-prisons", "docs_id": 19067, "title": "Why don&#39;t prisoners go through rigorous life transforming training in prisons?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A prisoner can be forced to learn and train on what they are naturally/ philosophically opposed to.\n\nFor instance, \n\n1. in general, prisoners can be taught army\\-style discipline training, and forced to study, and sit for exams/tests.\n2. if someone is jailed for breaking some kind of law, he can be forced to study law books and pass the law test.\n\nand so on...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The purposes of criminal justice include (this list is based on the Sentencing Act 1991 in Victoria):\n\n* Deterrence\n* Rehabilitation of offenders\n* Denunciation ('this behaviour is wrong')\n\n(Retribution can also be a purpose.)\n\nWhat the question is talking about is rehabilitation. As discussed in the book 'Starship Troopers', you can't expect a person to improve their behaviour if they are not shown how. Some simple examples in practice include violent offenders being sent to anger management classes, or bad drivers being sentenced to remedial training.\n\nWhy aren't all offenders put into rehabilitation programs? Some reasons include:\n\n* Cost. It would be very expensive to offer all the rehabilitation which would help all offenders.\n* Often this kind of thing is court\\-ordered, so if the judge does not know about relevant programs or does not assess the offender's needs correctly, then the offender will not be sent to them.\n* The offender is unwilling to participate in programs that are available, and there are limits to how much coercion a given society is comfortable applying.\n\nThere is no 'one size fits all' rehabilitation. Some people need to talk about what makes them use drugs, others need to talk through their childhood issues, others need training so they can get a job and not fall back into bad habits when they are released from prison. Perhaps North Korea has a great curriculum for putting lots of people in a camp and they come out model citizens, but I'm not aware of the details.\n\nCan a person really be forced to do anything? Even the army can't do that. The army might put you in prison, but that's redundant for a person who is already a prisoner. You can always threaten to kill them, I suppose, whip them, or brainwash them with electrodes perhaps, but that depends on your principles as a society. \n\nI think it's fair to say that, these days, the trend is towards what the question suggests, which is putting as many offenders as possible into rehabilitation. In 2014 it was [reported](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30275026) that Texas took the money it would have spent on building a new prison and used it on rehabilitation instead, and there were suggestions that that worked well.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the current trend in criminal justice systems regarding prisoner rehabilitation?\n\nA) Rehabilitation programs are being abandoned in favor of stricter punitive measures.\nB) All prisoners are now required to undergo mandatory law education and military-style discipline training.\nC) Rehabilitation efforts are increasingly tailored to individual offender needs, but implementation faces practical challenges.\nD) The use of extreme coercion methods, such as electrodes for brainwashing, is becoming more prevalent in rehabilitation efforts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage indicates that the current trend in criminal justice systems is moving towards increased focus on rehabilitation, with efforts being made to match offenders with appropriate programs. However, this approach faces challenges such as cost constraints, judicial discretion in sentencing, and limitations on coercion. The correct answer reflects this nuanced reality, acknowledging both the trend towards individualized rehabilitation and the practical difficulties in implementation.\n\nOption A is incorrect as the passage suggests a trend towards more rehabilitation, not abandonment.

While verbal agreements between family members are generally presumed not to create legally binding contracts, there is an important exception known as estoppel. If either child acted to their detriment based on the father's promise (such as the younger child purchasing a house instead of waiting for an inheritance), and the father was aware of this, it could create an estoppel. This legal principle might prevent the father from changing the inheritance plan if it would unfairly disadvantage the child who relied on the promise.\n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal promises between family members are generally not considered binding contracts.

While the presence of the witness can be important for impeachment purposes, it's not always necessary for an attorney to reference preliminary hearing testimony, especially in opening arguments where they are outlining what they expect the evidence to show."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11833/reading-comprehension-for-law-source-material", "docs_id": 11833, "title": "Reading comprehension for law: source material", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have no legal training, but suddenly find myself, as a part of my duties, asked to read legal documents, \\-\\- principally regulations, draft regulations, and tribunal outcomes \\-\\- in a nominated non\\-executive and observer role (in international law, to the extent that this is relevant).\n\nThe purpose of this activity is mainly to look for trends, ambiguities, possible policy matters, the general \"lie of the land\" in some area, finding important issues among a great volume of material, and so on.\n\nOne area where I have found some weakness is in reading comprehension, particularly in he\\-said/she\\-said tribunal reports.

The respondent, an Adjudicator, notes that initial impressions can be very different from final decisions, and that one must \"read carefully to determine the matters in dispute.\" This aligns with option C, which emphasizes careful reading and taking time to understand the full context of the legal documents."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82439/eminent-domain-payout", "docs_id": 82439, "title": "Eminent domain payout", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: America builds 400,000 acres of road a year.

They also don't seize land when they just rebuild a road, but that is still part of the 400k acres of road.

For example, Colorado saw only 87 cases in 2018, many of which were for condemning uninhabitable buildings rather than seizing land for new development. The document also states that eminent domain cases are RARE, contradicting the claims in options A, B, and C. The data shows that the scale of land seizure through eminent domain is much smaller than initially suggested, making option D the most accurate statement among the choices given."}}
