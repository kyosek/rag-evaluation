Horsley;\nMay 1988;\nDNA evidence admitted in rape case. Defendant convicted.\n(LifeCodes)\n\nThank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *State v. Todd Horsley*, 117 Idaho 920, 792 P.2d 945 (Idaho 1990\\) is the first reported appellate case in Idaho involving DNA evidence (which was only a conditional plea bargain, reserving the appellate issue of the admissibility of the DNA evidence). The trial court judge was James R. Michaud in a trial in Bonner County. The conditional plea was entered sometime between February 8, 1988 and May 10, 1988, followed by an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court argued on April 5, 1989 (the opinion contains a typo that in one instance states that the oral argument was on April 5, 1988 rather than April 5, 1989\\). The ruling was delayed due to the death of one of the justices who heard the oral argument and the resignation of another justice who heard to oral argument. The ruling was deferred until those two vacancies were filled and was made by the full reconstituted court on the basis of the briefing and a recording of the oral argument that was conducted on April 5, 1989\\.\n\nAnother early appellate case involving a plea bargain was *State of Idaho v. Roy R. Garcia*, 126 Idaho 836, 892 P.2d 903 (Idaho App. 1995\\). This case was charged as a rape case with DNA evidence, but downgraded to a battery conviction in connection with a plea bargain entered mid\\-trial during a trial commenced on October 12, 1993 after two previous continuances were granted on speedy trial grounds. The court of appeals held that the speed trial objection was waived by the plea bargain.\n\nThe first reported appellate case involving DNA evidence where the defendant was convicted following an evidentiary trial on the merits (in this case to a jury) was *State of Idaho v. Gene Allen Faught*, 127 Idaho 873, 908 P.2d 566 (Idaho 1995\\). The jury trial took place in March of 1994 and involved the defendant's alleged rape of his fourteen year old step\\-daughter (a conviction affirmed on appeal with the admission of the DNA evidence upheld as proper). The trial court judge was Judge George D. Carey presiding over a trial in Ada County.\n\nThe underlying trial in the appellate case *State of Idaho v. Robert Andrew Amerson*, 129 Idaho 395, 925 P.2d 399 (Idaho App. 1996\\), however, commenced September 13, 1993 in Lincoln County before Judge Phillip M. Becker, and resulted in a conviction for the crimes of rape and robbery. The convictions were affirmed although the sentence was modified on appeal. This conviction took place in the trial court about six months before the conviction in *Fraught*.\n\nIt is possible that there was an earlier case than either of these two cases in Idaho that did not result in an appeal because the defendant did not appeal the conviction. There is no good database with that kind of information, other than media reports. Unreported appellate decisions are also not always available. But given the novelty of DNA evidence at the time, the severity of the kind of charges typically proven with DNA evidence in its early days, and the right of a defendant to an appeal at state expense on a novel legal issue, it is fairly unlikely that the appellate cases listed overlook a trial court conviction following a trial that was based upon DNA evidence in Idaho.\n\nI included the full name of the defendant in these cases and other information not customarily mentioned in a summarized case report or citation in order to assist in the search for additional media reports, even though customary citation practice is to include only the surname of the defendant in the citation. It is possible that media reports from one of these earlier cases might allude to earlier cases where there was a conviction that was not appealed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following cases represents the first reported appellate case in Idaho involving DNA evidence that resulted in a conviction following an evidentiary trial on the merits?\n\nA) State v. Todd Horsley (1990)\nB) State of Idaho v. Roy R. Garcia (1995)\nC) State of Idaho v. Gene Allen Faught (1995)\nD) State of Idaho v. Robert Andrew Amerson (1996)\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThis question requires careful analysis of the information provided. Let's break down each option:\n\nA) State v. Todd Horsley (1990) was indeed the first reported appellate case in Idaho involving DNA evidence, but it involved a conditional plea bargain, not a full trial.\n\nB) State of Idaho v. Roy R. Garcia (1995) involved DNA evidence initially, but was downgraded to a battery conviction through a plea bargain mid-trial.\n\nC) State of Idaho v. Gene Allen Faught (1995) is described as the first reported appellate case involving DNA evidence where the defendant was convicted following an evidentiary trial on the merits. The trial took place in March 1994.\n\nD) State of Idaho v. Robert Andrew Amerson (1996) is the correct answer. Although the appellate decision came after Faught, the underlying trial commenced on September 13, 1993, resulting in a conviction for rape and robbery. This trial occurred about six months before the Faught trial.\n\nThe key to this question is recognizing that while the Faught case is described as the first reported appellate case with a conviction after a full trial, the Amerson case actually had an earlier trial date, making it the first case that fits all the criteria: DNA evidence, conviction following a full evidentiary trial, and an appellate decision."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35881/tax-law-and-holding-accounts-like-kickstarter", "docs_id": 35881, "title": "Tax law and holding accounts (like Kickstarter)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Kickstarter is a simple example to highlight the question.\n\nLet's say I'm Kickstarter's malformed cousin Rickstarter and someone is raising 100k for a project between November and April on my site. Rickstarter charges and holds funds in an account to distribute if the backer hits the 100k threshold, they fully refund in the case of the not hitting the milestone. \n\nLet's say by New Years the fund has 50k in it's account. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How would taxes be resolved if the funds are distributed for a successful campaign (say 5% cut for Rickstarter if we need specific metrics) before they file in April?\n2. How would taxes be resolved if the funds are refunded for a failed campaign before they file in April?\n3. How would taxes be resolved if they filed in February before it became clear either way what was happening with the funds?\n\nBy my understanding taxes are based on the prior year so I'm quite confused who exactly owns (and owes) what here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note: I do not know the internal mechanics of Kickstarter (some comment states that it does not work as explained), so I will work on Rickstarter description by the OP.\n\nThe funds are managed and held by Rickstarter but they are not owned by Rickstarter; it works as a scrow service.\n\nFor each $1 of cash directed to funding a project Rickstarter accrues an obligation (either towards the donor or the project to be funded)1 of exactly $1; in the books there is neither profit nor loss. At some point of time RS will get its cut from that $1\\.\n\nIt is similar to getting a $100\\.000 loan from a bank: you are not any richer because with the money comes the obligation to pay it back.\n\nA point of interest is *when Rickstarter gets its profits*. The basic rule is that Rickstarter can only put into the books its income when it has earned it and can be reasonably sure to get the money.\n\nFor example, Rickstarter could stablish in its service terms that it gets a 5% rate from any donation, and in this case it could be reasonable to consider a 5% of any received money to count towards the profits immediately. If there were a time for the investor to retreat his money without penalties, then the profits should only be accounted after that period. Or Rickstarter could apply a 5% rate to the money directed at projects that get enough funds, and in that case it could only write his profits in the book the moment the project gets that limit. In case that Rickstarter allowed people just to pledge the money, it would be unwise to count the profits before people had actually paid the money....3\n\nNow, direct taxes4 on business are almost always directly linked to profits, not to the size of assets, so Rickstarter's taxes would be linked to its cut of the money (minus all expenses, of course) and not related to the size of assets that it keeps in scrow.\n\nA different (and a lot more complicated) issue would come from regulatory obligations: there could be laws mandating that if Rickstarter manages more than $X assets then it has to start making audits and comply with other rules. But, while following those rules can have a cost, that would not make them \"taxes\".\n\n1The specific details of which kind of account would be convenient to reflect this obligation is beyond my knowledge of accounting.\n\n2Here [the prudence concept](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-the-prudence-concept-in-accounting.html) comes into play, you cannot consider that you got your cut until you are reasonably sure that you have earned it.\n\n3This can become very complex. For example, in the case of a pledge RS would probably write as an asset \"the $1000 SJuan76 owes us\", but at the same time if there are doubts about SJuan76 ability or willingness to pay it should also anotate a liability of \"the $1000 (or $500\\) SJuan76 might default\" so it would not be count (at least totally) towards profits.\n\n4There may be taxes based on activity (e.g. sales tax) or related to some assets (for example property taxes on the buildings owned by the company), but I think you are not asking about those.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Rickstarter, a crowdfunding platform, holds $50,000 in its account on New Year's Eve for a campaign aiming to raise $100,000 by April. How should Rickstarter handle this money for tax purposes?\n\nA) Rickstarter should report the entire $50,000 as income for the current tax year.\nB) Rickstarter should only report its potential 5% cut ($2,500) as income for the current tax year.\nC) Rickstarter should not report any of the $50,000 as income until the campaign ends and its outcome is known.\nD) Rickstarter should report the $50,000 as an asset but also record a corresponding $50,000 liability.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Rickstarter acts as an escrow service, holding funds that it does not own. The $50,000 should be recorded as an asset (cash) on Rickstarter's books, but it must also record a corresponding $50,000 liability representing its obligation to either the project creator or the backers, depending on the campaign's outcome. Rickstarter cannot recognize any income from its potential 5% cut until the campaign succeeds and it has earned that fee. This approach adheres to the prudence concept in accounting and accurately reflects Rickstarter's financial position without prematurely recognizing income."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33706/can-i-get-sued-for-using-another-persons-companys-code-without-knowing-it-belo", "docs_id": 33706, "title": "Can i get sued for using another person&#39;s/company&#39;s code without knowing it belongs to them", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say i made an app that notifies the user when a game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) became free for a limited time.

I use his/her/their code without knowing that it's under license and it belongs to them. Can i get sued for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your factual claims are a bit unclear, specifically where you say that you don't know them but you use their code. I take it you mean that you are not personally acquainted with the other party, but you did somehow acquire his code, and then you used it in your own work.\n\nThis is copyright infringement, and you can easily get sued. Anytime you copy someone else's code without their permission, you have infringed their copyright. It is not a defense that you didn't know they you're required to have permission, and it is not a defense that you changed the code (since copyright is about copying, not verbatim copying). It would be particularly difficult to maintain that you didn't know that permission is required since you say that their code has a license. (If your code has no license, that means nobody other than yourself can legally use it).\n\nOn the off chance that you did not actually mean to say that you used their code, and you meant to say that you accidentally or coincidentally wrote similar\\-looking code, then the legal question is more complicated (essentially unanswerable in a useful way, at least here). One way to establish violation of copyright law is to prove actual copying (eyewitness accounts, confessions, etc.). Alternatively, the fact\\-finders (jury or judge) would have to look at the degree of similarity between the works, to determine whether the similarity is so great that it could not be coincidence or functionally necessary. For example, all examples of bubble sort have a certain necessary similarity. All music with a certain genre is somewhat similar, given the nature of the genre. You would then need to hire an attorney (one experienced in software copyright and substantial similarity doctrines) to assess the particular facts. The point is that even if you did not in fact copy, you could be found guilty of having copied based on such similarity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates an app that notifies users about free games on Steam. Another developer independently creates a similar app for Steam market notifications. The second app has a license, while the first doesn't.

According to the documentation, using someone else's code without permission constitutes copyright infringement, regardless of whether the infringer knew about the license or not. Lack of knowledge about the requirement for permission is not a valid defense. The fact that the apps serve different purposes or whether the first developer profited from it doesn't change the fundamental issue of copyright infringement. Even unintentional use of copyrighted code can lead to legal action. Option A is incorrect because ignorance of the license doesn't prevent legal consequences. B is wrong because the similarity of app purposes doesn't mitigate the infringement. D is incorrect because profit is not a necessary condition for copyright infringement to occur."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45296/legality-of-creating-a-se-replica-using-ses-content", "docs_id": 45296, "title": "Legality of creating a SE replica using SE&#39;s content", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Due to the [recent controversy(s)](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/333965) regarding StackExchange, a couple other users and I were discussing the legality of creating a copy of SE and scraping the content.\n\nIf we did not copy SE's actual code, just the content that users put on the site, and we created another public site that was completely nonprofit, and **we attributed all content taken to StackExchange** would it be legal?

In this situation, person B will need to prove *actual malice* only if person A can reasonably advance the defense of *qualified privilege* (which is unlikely in the situation you describe) or if person B is a public figure.\n\nOther claims such as *tortious interference with relations* derive from *defamation*, and thus they are treated as a claim of defamation.\n\n> Would impersonating someone with the purpose of trashing someone's name and promoting it be enough to pursue something more than a civil case?\n\nImpersonation with *intent to deceive* others as to someone's identity is a crime (regardless of the propensity \\-\\-in each jurisdiction\\-\\- to prosecute it).\n\nThat being said, there is an important distinction between \"*intent or reasonable effect of deceiving*\" and *parody*. The latter usually is obvious enough in that it does not attempt to mislead others as to the source or authorship of statements. Was person A's impersonation of B a parody that made truthful but uncomfortable disclosures?\n\nIn the case of parody, what matters is whether the *import* is defamatory. For instance, in the latter portion of [this post](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/2018/11/judge-carol-kuhnkes-imbecile.html), I make a parody of judge felon Carol Kuhnke, who last year endorsed a sexual harasser for judicial reelection. The parody simulates as if felon Kuhnke wrote a letter to the assistant who for years was sexually harassed by Kuhnke's judicial buddy.\n\nThe parody\\-letter obviously **does not** intend to deceive others as to its authorship: you will notice that the line preceding the parody letter presents it as a *plausible adaptation* of Kuhnke's statements in court.

Since the famous case of **NY Times vs Sullivan**, a President who wished to sue for alleged defamation about any aspect of his official conduct or fitness for office would need to prove \"actual malice\" which is a high (but not impossible) bar to clear.\n\nAs described in [This article](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/can-presidential-candidates-sue-media-outlets-for-defamation/) *Goldwater v.

Goldwater won the suit, although he got much less than he sought. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict, finding that the \"actual malice\" standard had been clearly met.

Extravagant, reckless statements and even claims which may not be true seem to me an inevitable and perhaps essential part of the process by which the voting public informs itself of the qualities of a man who would be president.\n\naccording to Black.

A quitclaim deed does not convey after\\-acquired property except when an exception to the general rule applies.\n\nA bargain and sale deed conveys what is described with a promise that the person executing the deed had not encumbered (e.g. mortgaged) or sold the property at any time after it came to be titled in their name that are not described in the deed, but does not promise that the person that they obtained the property from had good title or that their title was free of liens or encumbrances. A bargain and sale deed preserves title insurance policy protections from the previous owner, while a quitclaim deed does not. I don't know what affect a bargain and sale deed has with respect to after\\-acquired property.\n\nWarranty deeds are not normally used for this purpose. Warranty deeds are normally used in arms\\-length sales for fair market value between unrelated parties and are normally processed by title insurance companies who insure the buyer and anyone financing the buyer's purchase of the property with a mortgage against the possibility that the seller didn't have good title to the property sold or had undisclosed liens or encumbrances. A warranty deed contains a promise that the seller owns all real property described in the deed subject only to the liens and encumbrances stated in the deed. A warranty deed also conveys after\\-acquired property.\n\n### ACRIS\n\nYou [don't have to use the ACRIS system](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-recording-documents.page).

See also a discussion of the impact of the 2019 law [here](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/amendment-to-nys-tax-law-affects-36462/).\n\nIncidentally, you do not need to file with the IRS Form 709, a gift tax form, because a transfer from the owners of real property to an LLC that they own is not a taxable gift.

In particular, I leave unanswered the questions of whether you need to file the following forms:\n\n* Affidavit of smoke detector\n* Tax form IT\\-2663 (for non\\-residents in our case)\n* Water utility form\n\nI suspect, but do not know that the smoke detector and water utility forms may be New York City specific.\n\nI also do not analyze the filing fees due, but *see* [this chart](https://www.tax.ny.gov/research/property/assess/sales/deedevents.htm). The basic fee for filing a quitclaim deed to residential real estate is $125\\.\n\n(FWIW, for comparison's sake, [in Colorado](https://www.arapahoegov.com/1423/Recording-Fees), the filing fee is $13 plus $5 per page, LLC ownership does not have to be disclosed, one information form similar to Form 584 in NY has to be filed, but doesn't prevent a deed from being recorded and isn't a matter of public record, affidavits related to smoke detectors don't have to be filed, and utility transfers are handled outside the real estate recording system.

It involves understanding what a trademark really means, and understanding which country's intellectual property laws are relevant and how they gain international effectiveness, which a short You Tube video can't teach you.\n\nAlso, if you can't afford to hire a lawyer to determine where you should file your trademark application, filing a trademark application at all is pretty pointless.\n\nThis is because it probably costs something like $2,000\\-$5000 to hire a lawyer to file a trademark application in a way that has international effect, but it probably costs $50,000 to $250,000 to bring a lawsuit to enforce an international trademark dispute.\n\nIf you can't conceivably ever afford to bring a lawsuit to enforce your trademark rights if you acquire them somehow, despite your lack of legal assistance, the rights you have gained are worthless anyway, because you can't afford to enforce them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A Hungarian app developer wants to trademark their mobile application available on both App Store and Google Play. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their situation?\n\nA) They should only register the trademark with the Hungarian trademark institute as it will provide sufficient international protection.\n\nB) They can easily register the trademark themselves through USPTO for $225, which will provide comprehensive global protection.\n\nC) Registering with WIPO alone will suffice for international trademark protection.\n\nD) They should consult with a lawyer to determine the best course of action for international trademark protection, considering the complexities and potential enforcement costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The situation described involves complex international intellectual property laws and considerations. While it may seem tempting to pursue a low-cost DIY approach (option B) or rely solely on local registration (option A), these methods may not provide adequate protection for an app available globally. Option C is incorrect because WIPO registration alone doesn't automatically grant worldwide protection. \n\nThe most prudent course of action is to consult with a lawyer who specializes in international trademark law. This is because:\n\n1. Trademark protection needs vary based on where the app is distributed and where potential infringement might occur.\n2. The process involves more than just filling out forms; it requires understanding of various countries' intellectual property laws.\n3. Proper trademark registration can be costly ($2,000-$5,000 for international effect), and enforcement even more so ($50,000-$250,000 for international disputes).\n4. A lawyer can help determine the most cost-effective strategy for protection, balancing the app developer's budget with their need for international coverage.\n5. Without the ability to enforce trademark rights (which requires significant financial resources), simply holding a trademark may be pointless.\n\nTherefore, professional legal advice is crucial to make informed decisions about trademark protection in this scenario."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14095/legal-documents-confirming-previous-maiden-name-uk", "docs_id": 14095, "title": "Legal documents confirming previous/maiden name (uk)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My wife is enrolling at university, however her previous qualifications were earned whilst she had her maiden name.

For example, in Hanson v. Denckla, the Court proclaimed the \"unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State. The application of that rule will vary with the nature and quality of the defendant's activity, but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protection of its laws.\"\n\nFor the abortion bill, an organisation that provides funding to Texas residents probably has \u201cminimum contacts\u201d, an out\\-of\\-state doctor who treats all\\-comers probably doesn\u2019t.\n\nFor employment laws: if the employee is based and work takes place in the state, yes.\n\nThere is a separate question of *which* state's law applies which is independent of which state's courts can hear the case.

This could potentially be the case if the company actively markets its services to Texas residents or has a significant number of Texas patients.

With the rise of modern police forces, the police inherited this general right to make arrest but it still remained a power of every citizen.\n\nHow much of this right remains depends on your jurisdiction and how the common law of \"arrest\" has been transformed by statute and case law.\n\nThe common law right **only** extends to arresting someone in the **commission** of a crime. In the example you cite, the *arrests* are probably unlawful and amount to the crime of kidnapping/deprivation of liberty/whatever its called where you are because the person is not *at that moment* committing a crime.\n\nTo arrest someone who you believe committed a crime *in the past*, you need a warrant or a power granted to you by some other statute (e.g. powers granted to police officers).\n\nIn either case, a person making an arrest is allowed to use reasonable force to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A private citizen witnesses what they believe to be a crime in progress at a local park.

According to the common law principle described, private citizens retain the power to make arrests, but this is limited to crimes in progress. They cannot arrest for past crimes without special authority (like a warrant or statutory power typically granted to law enforcement). The use of force must be reasonable. Option A is incorrect because citizens cannot arrest for past crimes and cannot use unlimited force. Option B is wrong because warrants are not required for in-progress crimes.

Result: Nothing happens.\n\nAre there general measures or other legal measures taken when the executive branch doesn't follow orders from the judicial branch?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two things that bind any given branch of a constitutional government to the dictates of another branch:\n\n1. The dictates of the constitution itself.\n2. The will of the people.\n\nThe first one, however, has only the force that each branch and its constituent members give it. If the Executive branch collectively decides to selectively (or wholly) ignore the constitutional dictates of the judicial branch (as in your case), then the constitution itself has no force to stop the Executive branch. The branches willfully imposing upon themselves the dictates of the constitution, even when it seems inconvenient or undesirable, falls under the concept of \"respect for the rule of law\". The belief being that it is better to be guided by (democratic) laws and constitutions than to allow particular governments or individuals to dictate things according to their whims. Otherwise we end up with things like dictatorships, which have historically proven themselves to be undesirable for all but the few people in power (and even they sometimes meet an awful end).\n\nThis then pulls us into the second point, which is the will of the people. If one branch of a (democratic) government starts ignoring and disrespecting the rule of law, it then falls to the people to make them pay the consequences: demand rectifying legislation or other measures, elect new officials, recall existing ones, engage in protests, and in extreme situations outright rebellion. Of course, if the people by and large don't mind what's happening, or have too little power to effect change, then the offending branch can continue to do as it pleases. \n\nChina, for example, is considered by many, including its own people, to have a corrupt government. But the people are either too powerless or too unwilling to stop it. Keep in mind that before the current style of government the country was under significant duress from overpopulation, including widespread food shortages, and economic underdevelopment. This rendered many of the people desperate and willing to accept a certain degree of corruption and non\\-democratic rule provided the government solved and prevented such problems; it also led them to essentially accept the [One Child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).

This is required for certain kinds of claims in certain jurisdictions as a matter of statute or court rule, which vary widely.**\n\nFor example, in Colorado, a \"replevin claim\" (i.e. a claim for expedited recovery of possession of specific tangible personal property) must be verified, and the object will be repossessed by force under court order if a timely response is not filed, often in a matter of a week or two, when the lack of a response could be due to reasons other than a lack of a good defense to the seizure.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is required when the relief requested is extraordinary relative to an ordinary lawsuit to collect an unpaid bill or recover damages from an injury in an accident, but requirements vary considerably from one jurisdiction to another.\n\nHistorically, at least, there have been jurisdictions in which all complaints must be verified, and there are other jurisdictions where it is almost never required.\n\n**2\\.

A motion for summary judgment is likely.**\n\nIn most U.S. jurisdictions, if a party defending a claim provides a factually detailed affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss a case because the facts alleged in the complaint are not true, the claim against that party will be dismissed unless the party bringing the claim files a response to the motion for summary judgment supported by a factually detailed affidavit disputing the facts alleged in the defending party's affidavit on material issues that creates a \"disputed issue of fact\" that must be resolved in an evidentiary hearing or trial by a judge or jury.\n\nIf the initial complaint contains factually detailed assertions in support of its allegations that are verified, i.e. sworn it as if by an affidavit, then that route to ending the case prematurely with a motion for summary judgment is largely thwarted.

The Tesla detects the pedestrian, but elects to continue through the crossing without stopping (presumably because the pedestrian was not on their side of the road).\n\nVarious comments to that article state that what the Tesla did was illegal. But in my various googling attempts, I have not found any source that definitely states that the car *has* to stop. For example, the [CA DMV Drivers handbook](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/laws-and-rules-of-the-road/) says:\n\n> When there is a pedestrian crossing a roadway with or without a\n> crosswalk, you must use caution, reduce your speed, or stop to allow\n> the pedestrian to safely finish crossing.\n\nThe use of \"or\" here seems to imply that stopping is optional (of course I assume that means only if you have taken due care/caution)\n\nBut some of the commentators quote this from the same DMV handbook:\n\n> Pedestrians have the right\\-of\\-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks. If\n> there is a limit line before the crosswalk, stop at the limit line and\n> allow pedestrians to cross the street.\n\nAnd take it to imply that the Tesla should have stopped because the crossing does have a \"limit line\".\n\nMy question is pretty simple. Did the Tesla break an actual law in California? Or is it simply a dick move that technically is not illegal?\n\nGiven the specificity of this video, I'm only really looking for answers that relate to California. I know that in other jurisdictions in the US and in other countries there may be other definitions of legality \\- which does make producing generic software for an automated car rather complex.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am aware of a view of the California law that if a pedestrian looks like they might want to cross the street, any car must stop, but this is not supported by the law, which is about \"yielding\". The law incorporates both \"yield\" and \"stop\", the former being \"and allow the other person to proceed\".\nIgnoring the photo for a moment, the requirement to yield (not stop) allows a car to continue driving when the driver is e.g. 10 ft from the crosswalk and the pedestrian is three lanes over when they enter the crosswalk, remaining in compliance with the law. The pedestrian and the driven can continue with their journey because there is no conflict.\n\nThe requirement to yield states whose right to proceed is subordinated to the other person's, in case of conflict. Turning to the video which shows what is in front but not behind, it is evident that the vehicle did not actually conflict with the pedestrian, who did not slow down in order to let the vehicle pass.

So, usually I just paste a scanned image of my signature into the signature block of the form, then send the file without ever having to go through the print/scan cycle.\n\nHowever, I recently did this with a stack of forms where the receiving party apparently noticed that all my signatures were identical and deduced that I used a digitized signature instead of manually signing the forms. They rejected the forms saying that they needed \"original\" signatures. I pointed out that the signature becomes digital when I scan the form anyway, but they insisted that I manually sign, then scan, then email the forms. All illogicality aside, is there any legal reason for this policy?\n\nBTW, this is in the United States, though I imagine if there is a legal principle behind this that it would be fairly universal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Digital signatures are sometimes allowed in the U.S., but, when they are allowed, they are allowed only in the context of a fairly specific statutory procedure for doing so.\n\nPart of the idea of a manual signature is that a human being manually writing something creates an original document that can be pulled out if necessary and has some rather distinctive aspects to it that can be examined to see if the signature is a forgery. But, in contrast, when you cut and paste a signature into a document, there is no way to know if the person doing the cutting and the pasting is really the person identified in the signature, even after the fact with forensic expert attention.\n\nAnother part of the idea of a manual signature is that the physical act of putting a pen in your hand and putting it on a physical piece of paper is a time honored and traditional way of symbolically giving assent to what it on the paper. This physical act *is* what legally constitutes your consent. Indeed, it isn't even terribly important for this aspect of the idea that it be your name. The practice of having illiterate people write an \"X\" on a signature line with the intent that they will be bound is used for this same purpose, even though it is probably not identifiable forensically (although it rules out a signature by a literate person). Tapping keys on a keyboard that cause a copy of a signature to appear in a document is arguably not distinct enough from other kinds of keyboard use to make it stand out from the other actions of a person to make it a distinctively symbolic act of assent in the way that a manual signature is distinct from simply typing or writing prose.\n\nIndeed, the importance of this manual signing activity in conferring the significance of important legal actions is memorialized in a group of statutes collectively known as the \"statute of frauds\" which says that certain kinds of legal acts are only legally effective if they are in writing and \"signed\" by the party against whom the document will be enforced. A cut and paste of a signature, even if authorized by the person whose signature it purports to be, doesn't count as a signature for statute of frauds purposes, unless legislation specifically authorizes that and the legislation that does so has limitations and safeguards built into it.\n\nThe important part is not that it is digitized \\-\\- photocopies and electronic reproductions (such as scanning and faxing) are often allowed in lieu of originals. The important part is that the signer engaged in a distinctive, individualized symbolic act to authorize the matters set forth in a document by the conventional manual means or a statutorily approved alternative.\n\nOf course, cutting and pasting scanned signatures is a very new thing under the sun. Mimeographs were expensive and were not considered individualized assent signatures either. Before that, the recognized and valid alternative to a manual signature was a seal, often in wax. But, seals fell out of favor before they were replaced with digital cutting and pasting.\n\nWe are still in transition. This transition is particularly hard certain documents that are \"real\" as opposed to being mere evidence of your intent, such as checks and promissory notes and wills where a photocopy is not considered to be equivalent to the original. It has been accepted practice to allow faxes of many kinds of contracts to be considered valid for 30 years or more, but allowing people to deposit a \"real\" document like a check electronically has only been possible for a few years.\n\nSooner or later, this requirement will cease. But, it will take time. Consider that for almost a thousand years, in order to validly sell real estate, the seller had to physically hand some dirt from that location to the buyer in what was called the \"livery of seizen\". A couple of hundred years ago, we finally dispensed with that tradition and let a signed and notarized deed take its place. The complete transition to digital signatures will no doubt happen sooner. But, we aren't there yet. \n\nThere are several \"uniform acts\" proposed as models for states to adopt on the subject such as the \"Uniform Computer information Transactions Act\", and the \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\", and the \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\", but these have not been more or less uniformly adopted by the states. \n\nThere is also federal legislation on this subject in the U.S. called the \"E\\-Sign Act\" (formally the \"Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act\", 15 USC \u00a7 7001 et seq.) adopted on June 30, 2000\\.

This type of road has two outer lanes for traffic moving in opposing directions, with a center lane that can be used for passing by traffic moving in either direction. This configuration explains why the law mentions using the center lane for overtaking and passing, which would not be allowed in a modern two-way left turn lane. The law also specifies conditions for using the center lane, such as ensuring it's clear of traffic within a safe distance, which is consistent with this older road design.

Looking into this further, some of these websites require \"proof that you are an immediate family member or executor for account removal.\" As a business, we need to be in the latter category. What is required to be an executor? Do we have to be a part of the will for each deceased individual, or is there an alternative?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Executors and Administrators\n----------------------------\n\nThe executor of an estate is the person(s) named by the testator in their will. The executor is the legal representative of the deceased and is responsible for winding\\-up their affairs and distributing the estate's assets to the beneficiaries in accordance with the will. The executor will apply to the court for a \"grant of probate\" which gives them the legal authority (and protection) to act.\n\nIf a person dies without a will (intestate) then the person who fulfills this role is called the administrator. An administrator is appointed by the court by their issuing \"Letters of Administration\". The administrator is responsible for winding\\-up the deceased's affairs and distributing the estate's assets to the beneficiaries in accordance with the law.\n\nEither role can be filled by any legal person which means an individual or a body corporate (company). They have a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries and are legally liable if they screw things up.\n\nYour business\n-------------\n\nGreat idea!\n\nUnfortunately, with the current state of the law in most parts of the world its a non\\-starter. An executor holds a position of extreme personal and legal trust \\- they are the person that the deceased trusts to do the right thing by everyone they leave behind. I'm sure that you are trustworthy people but I (and most people) are going to want their executor to be someone like a spouse, sibling or child with whom they have familial ties, a close personal friend or a government public trustee.\n\nAt the same time, banks, insurance companies etc. will not deal with anyone but the trustee (executor or administrator) and usually not until probate has been granted. They will also require that any funds be paid into a bank account set up by the trustee in their name in trust for the deceased unless the amounts are trivial.\n\nOwnership of social media accounts is a grey area of the law at present \\- they will not release passwords except to legally authorized representatives and sometimes not even then.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A new business aims to automate the process of closing accounts for deceased individuals. According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the role of an executor and the feasibility of this business model?\n\nA) An executor must always be a family member of the deceased and cannot be a company or business entity.\n\nB) The business could easily become the executor for any deceased individual by applying to the court, regardless of the deceased's wishes.\n\nC) An executor can be any legal person, including a company, but must typically be named in the deceased's will or appointed by the court, making this business model challenging to implement.\n\nD) Social media companies and banks are legally required to work with any business claiming to represent a deceased individual, making this a viable business model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that an executor can be any legal person, including an individual or a company. However, executors are typically named in the deceased's will or appointed by the court (in the case of administrators for those who die intestate). This makes it difficult for a business to become an executor for multiple individuals unless specifically named in their wills. The business model faces significant challenges due to the personal nature of the executor role and the legal requirements for handling a deceased person's affairs. Additionally, financial institutions and social media companies typically only deal with legally authorized representatives, further complicating the proposed business model."}}
