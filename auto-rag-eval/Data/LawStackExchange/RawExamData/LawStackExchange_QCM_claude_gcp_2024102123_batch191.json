However, in the mean time, they are responsible for the outgoings of the property 50/50 with the other tenant in common. I think it is also equitable to have expenses of a capital nature (those expenses that affect the structural integrity of the property) looked after by all of the tenants in common and same with insuring the physical house. Day\\-to\\-day expenses, repairs, and costs should be met by those who live on the property or alternatively a rental agreement should be arranged at the market rate.\n\nYes, the specifics of the laws regarding this may vary from country to country but overall from what I've researched the agreements are fairly similar and this is a common occurrence.

The life tenant is generally responsible for expenses belonging to the tenant, which are usually \"variable\" costs. The specific division of expenses can be determined by agreement among the parties, but the primary legal responsibility for owner expenses falls on the tenants in common, regardless of who occupies the property."

The modified image linked to from the question (and previously included in it) is certainly a derivative work of the Bugs Bunny image, and is probably close enough to be a trademark infringement as well, if used to advertise or sell goods and services. Therefore using it without permission from the rights\\-holder (Warner Bros) will be both a copyright and trademark infringement. Warner Bros could and might well sue, obtaining damages. If Warner Bros does not choose to sue, it is unlikely that any government action for criminal copyright infringement would be taken, although if the image were used on a large scale with a profit motive, criminal action could be taken.\n\nCopyright, in particular, is not lost even if many people infringe, and the copyright holder can choose freely which infringements to sue over, and which ones to ignore.",

Using it in a commercial video game without permission would likely infringe on both copyright and trademark rights. Widespread use on the internet does not put the image in the public domain, nor does it automatically make it fair use.

One of my points is that, supposing what they're already doing is technically legal, it is not \"faithfully executing\" the law.\n\nIn the abstract, is there any history that might suggest there are two differing standards of legality...one which is \"faithful\" and one which merely passes a base level test of legality?\n\nObviously I am referring to clauses in different constitutions which require the executive to (in so many words) \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The distinction you have drawn resembles the traditional distinction between (common) **[law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Connotation_3._Law_as_opposed_to_equity) and [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law))**. In the seventeenth century, English courts of law exercised an ancient jurisdiction that was inflexible and formalistic, while courts of equity exercised a more wide\\-ranging [ecclesiastical jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_jurisdiction) according to the Lord Chancellor's conscience. Law and equity were 'fused' to some extent by the [*Judicature Acts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicature_Acts) from 1873 onwards, but the distinction still has practical significance.\n\nIn many cases, equity provides a remedy where the strict application of the common law could result in **unconscionable** outcomes. For example, it is equity which requires a [trustee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee) to manage trust property in the interest of beneficiaries, even though the trustee is the legal owner of the property. Equity may also require people to return money they have received by accident or where it would be unconscionable for them to retain it, even though there is no relationship between the parties under the common law of tort or contract.\n\nThe concept of unconscionability is closely linked to the idea of exercising powers 'faithfully.' Equity is the source of [**fiduciary** duties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary), which are essentially legally\\-enforceable duties to be **faithful** to a principal. Both words are derived from the Latin root *fidere*, \"to trust.\"",

Both equity and the idea of faithful execution are concerned with going beyond mere technical compliance with the law to ensure that the spirit and intent of the law are upheld. The connection between equity and faithfulness is further reinforced by their shared etymological root in the Latin \"fidere\" (to trust).\n\nOption A is incorrect because equity is not separate from faithful execution; rather, it provides principles that can inform our understanding of what constitutes faithful execution.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while equity and faithful execution are related concepts, they are not synonymous or interchangeable terms.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although equity originated in private law, its principles have been applied more broadly, including in matters of public law and constitutional interpretation."

They are 99\\.9%\\* territorial. A patent issued by the USPTO is the only patent relevant to the making, selling, offering for sale, importing, or using a patented product in the U.S.\n\nAnd the same for all other countries.

TechUSA's US patent is valid and enforceable in the US, regardless of Sakura Corp's earlier Japanese patent. The Japanese patent has no direct legal effect in the US. However, if Sakura Corp's earlier patent publication makes TechUSA's invention not novel, TechUSA's patent could potentially be challenged and invalidated in the US. But this would require a separate legal process and is not automatic. The fact that TechUSA was granted a patent suggests that either their invention was sufficiently different or that the US Patent Office was unaware of the Japanese patent during examination."

[In 2005, a group of entertainers created an Internet comedy series called \"Yacht Rock,\"](http://www.yachtrock.com/yacht-rock-episodes) which told the imaginary histories of the careers of a number of AM Gold/West Coast musicians (Kenny Loggins, Michael McDonald, The Doobie Bros., Steely Dan, Toto, etc.). They coined the phrase \"yacht rock\" to describe the (artificial, arbitrary) smooth\\-music genre in which these acts circulated. The series was produced as a parody, drawing inspiration from real\\-life figures and events, and inventing a fictional narrative around them.\n2. The success of the Yacht Rock web series has materially benefited the real\\-life musicians whose stories it purports to tell. Its success renewed popular interest in their catalogues sufficient for them to tour again. Some of these artists have acknowledged this publicly, [even seeking to promote their tours as \"yacht rock.\"](https://music.mxdwn.com/2018/07/14/reviews/concert-review-monsters-of-yacht-rock-christopher-cross-kenny-loggins-and-michael-mcdonald-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl/) Satellite radio entity [SIRIUS/XM created a \"yacht rock\" genre channel](https://www.siriusxm.com/yachtrockradio), while Rock Band [video game developers Harmonix recently released a \"yacht rock\" song pack](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/yacht-rock-pack-01-sets-sail), capitalizing on this renewed interest.\n3. [In 2008, a cover act from Atlanta formed, calling itself \"Yacht Rock Revue,\"](http://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/confessions-cover-band-yacht-rock-revue/) and playing a number of songs both consistent and inconsistent with the genre, as defined by the comedy group that coined the term \"yacht rock.\" However, what Yacht Rock Revue did that the comedy series writers did not is trademark the term \"yacht rock.\" (A USPTO search reveals that Yacht Rock Revue claims ownership of U.S. Registration Number 3834195, and in June 2018 filed an additional TEAS Plus application for its merchandise.) The band has since used its trademark to cease\\-and\\-desist \"yacht rock\" marketing used by other musicians, including the recording artists whose work they perform.\n4. In 2016, the creators of the Yacht Rock comedy series began a podcast called \"Beyond Yacht Rock,\" which creates and defines artificial/arbitrary genres of music. In the process, they honed their definition of \"yacht rock\" as a musical style, [created a \"Yachtski Scale\" to score the \"yachtiness\" of a given song](http://www.yachtrock.com/yacht-or-nyacht-jay-gradient/) along a series of (principally arbitrary) metrics, and wrote vigorous critical defenses of these definitions in a \"Captain's Blog.\" They even interviewed Yacht Rock Revue on the show, and discussed the merits of the band's \"yacht rock\" material vis\\-a\\-vis their definitions.\n5. Yacht Rock Revue has openly acknowledged that it nicked the term \"yacht rock\" from the web comedy series. *Yacht Rock*'s creators have been acknowledged as founders of the genre in interviews with with [Rolling Stone magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/sail-away-the-oral-history-of-yacht-rock-49343/) and the NPR music show World Cafe. Yet various parties ([recently, sports writer Bill Simmons among them](https://twitter.com/billsimmons/status/903346781273985024?lang=en)) continue to claim ownership of the \"yacht rock\" concept under some personal definition, Yacht Rock Revue included.\n\nAre there any legal remedies for the writers of the web comedy series to:\n\n1. keep the \"yacht rock\" term from being leveraged by parties like\nYacht Rock Revue\n2. profit from their original coinage\n3. trademark their evolving definition/terminology\n4. protect their future endeavors from similar behavior, which to me seems at least partly analogous to patent trolling\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Are there any legal remedies for the writers of the web comedy series\n>  to:\n> \n> \n> 1. keep the \"yacht rock\" term from being leveraged by parties like Yacht Rock Revue\n> 2. profit from their original coinage\n> 3. trademark their evolving definition/terminology\n> 4. protect their future endeavors from similar behavior, which to me seems at least partly analogous to patent trolling\n\nMultiple facts and issues matter:\n\n1. Did the original series writers have a trademark in the phrase either at common law, or by registering it?\n2. If they did have a trademark, what was the scope of goods or services covered by the trademark? Generally, a trademark can only be acquired for goods or services actually used by the person claiming it. There is no such thing as a trademark that applies universally.\n3. If they did have a trademark was it diluted to the point of becoming a generic term a la the term \"Xerox\" that lost its secondary meaning association with the goods or services of the original user of the trademark.\n4. Does the use by the radio program deceive the ordinary listener in a manner that causes the ordinarily listen to believe that the radio program is affiliated with the comedy show creators and benefits from the \"secondary meaning\" association with their show that they imparted to the term. A trademark isn't a prohibition on using the phrase, it is a prohibition on using the mark to deceptively market goods as associated with something that they are not associated with.\n5. Who owns any rights to the trademark, if there is one, and was it licensed? Often intellectual property in entertainment media is managed by multi\\-copyright owner association on behalf of IP owners who are often media companies. Typically radio stations including Sirius XM has a licensing agreement with all major management companies controlling the rights to the content that they play. It could be that a trademark is controlled by such an organization and within the scope of the station's license.\n6. Also, in addition to trademark claims, there could be claims that the station is creative derivative works of its work that is protected by copyright, subject to fair use, [sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire) (i.e. has yacht rock become a genre rather than a particular comedy group's baby), and licensing considerations.\n\nThe answers to these questions must be resolved to know that answer.",

In 2008, a cover band trademarks \"Yacht Rock\" and uses it to market their performances. The comedy group wants to protect their creation. Which of the following is the MOST relevant factor in determining the comedy group's ability to claim rights over the term \"Yacht Rock\"?\n\nA) Whether the comedy group registered the trademark first\nB) Whether the term \"Yacht Rock\" has become generic through widespread use\nC) Whether the cover band's use of the term deceives listeners about its affiliation with the original creators\nD) Whether the comedy group has profited from the term's popularity\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While all factors mentioned are relevant, the most crucial element in this scenario is whether the term \"Yacht Rock\" has become generic (option B). If a term becomes generic, it loses its trademark protection, regardless of who coined it or registered it first. This is because generic terms cannot function as trademarks.\n\nOption A is important but not the most relevant, as common law trademark rights can exist without registration. Option C relates to trademark infringement, which is a separate issue from whether the term can be protected at all.

That means, even if the witnesses testify it and don't get discredited, no reasonable jury would convict anyway.\n\nThe judge, when determining such an application, evaluates the would\\-be\\-given evidence and decides if it is capable of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. If it is, the application gets dismissed and the case proceeds to trial. If it is not, the charges get dismissed.\n\nIs there an equivalent motion in the US? What is it called? How does it work? The closest thing I heard of is \"probable cause\" but is it a full equivalent of \"no case to answer\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At the federal level, there is no real equivalent to what you're describing.\n\nA probable cause hearing evaluates the government's evidence in a similar way, but it doesn't ask whether a reasonable jury would convict. The closest I can think of is a Rule 29 motion, which *does* ask that question, but not until trial has already begun. You typically make the motion at the close of the government's case, and (if it was not successful) again at the close of your own, though I've heard tales of judges granting the motion at the end of the government's opening statement.\n\nThe states all have their own rules, but they're generally pretty similar to the federal rules in this respect, as I understand it. I don't know of any state that allows the kind of motion you're talking about, in criminal cases, at least. In civil cases, I think everyone has Rule 12(b)(6\\) motions, which ask the court for a pretrial determination that there's no set of facts that could establish liability on the plaintiff's theory of the case.",

A Rule 29 motion during trial is the closest equivalent in the US federal system to the \"no case to answer\" application used in New Zealand and the UK. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while a probable cause hearing evaluates evidence similarly, it doesn't consider whether a reasonable jury would convict.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it applies to civil cases, not criminal ones, and asks a different question about the plaintiff's theory of the case.\n\nOption C is correct because a Rule 29 motion, like the \"no case to answer\" application, asks whether the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict. However, it differs in timing, as it's made during trial rather than before.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the question states that there is no real equivalent to the pretrial \"no case to answer\" motion in the US federal system for criminal cases.\n\nThis question tests understanding of comparative legal procedures and the nuances of US federal criminal procedure."

This is described as a fact-dependent analysis considering readily available information. Posting a sign prohibiting alcohol and addressing clear violations is specifically mentioned as an example of a reasonable measure. Option A (thorough bag searches) would likely be considered excessive for most situations. Option C (requiring legal contracts) goes beyond what's typically expected for reasonable measures. Option D (installing breathalyzers) would be an extreme and likely unreasonable step for most art studios.

Do they need a reason to believe that you committed a crime, or can they just detain you without any reason at all?\n\nIf you need a state, use Texas, if you need a city, use McKinney. Please make it clear under what scope the laws actually reside.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Brief detentions and reasonable suspicion\n\nYou can be briefly detained by police if they have reasonable suspicion that you committed a crime. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968\\)\n\nWhat reasonable suspicion \"means\" can only be fully understood by reference to subsequent case law (which I will expand this answer to do), but as a basis, the court said in Terry that:\n\n> the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion\n\nThis standard has been reiterated as recently as in Heien v. North Carolina 574 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\), where they say \"All parties agree that to justify this type of seizure \\[a traffic stop, in the case of Heien], officers need only reasonable suspicion \u2014 that is, a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of breaking the law\" (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe reasonable suspicion standard was also used recently in Navarette v. California 572 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\). They reiterated that reasonable suspicion is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability, quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330 (1990\\). A mere \"hunch\" does not create reasonable suspicion, but the level of suspicion required by the reasonable suspicion standard is \"obviously less than is necessary for probable cause\".\n\n### Arrests and probable cause\n\nTo be arrested, police require probable cause. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160 (1949\\)\n\nIn more detail, probable cause exists (from Brinegar v. U.S.):\n\n> where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed\n\nAlso:\n\n> The rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these often opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly hamper law enforcement. To allow less would be to leave law\\-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers' whim or caprice.\n\nAs in the case of reasonable suspicion, the probable cause analysis is case\\-by\\-case and fact\\-intensive, so to understand the contours of probable cause will require reference to much subsequent case law.\n\nIn Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964\\) the question before the court was entirely \"whether or not the record in the case before us can support a finding of probable cause for the petitioner's arrest\". In that case, it turned out that the information they had received about the arrestee was not sufficient for probable cause, but regardless, the test the court applied was whether the police had probable cause for the arrest.\n\n### Notes\n\nWhile I am confident in the correctness of this answer, what each of these standards means will take hours of work to flesh out, which I plan to do. The courts have repeatedly reiterated and referred to these decisions/standards, but the analysis is very fact\\-intensive and is done case\\-by\\-case. Also, I realize the presentation is a little scattershot, as I'm first just looking to include relevant cases and statements the court has made about these standards, but I'll re\\-make it into a coherent story every once in a while.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In McKinney, Texas, a police officer detains a group of teenagers at a pool party after receiving a call about a disturbance. The officer has not personally witnessed any criminal activity. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal standard for this detention?\n\nA) The officer needs probable cause that a specific crime has been committed to detain the teenagers.\n\nB) The officer can detain the teenagers without any suspicion of criminal activity, as long as it's brief.\n\nC) The officer needs reasonable suspicion based on specific, articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot to briefly detain the teenagers.\n\nD) The officer can only detain teenagers who were directly involved in the reported disturbance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Terry v. Ohio case and subsequent rulings, police officers can briefly detain individuals if they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. This standard requires \"specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\" In this scenario, the officer has received a call about a disturbance, which could potentially provide the basis for reasonable suspicion, depending on the specific information received and observations made upon arrival.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because probable cause is a higher standard required for arrests, not brief detentions. Answer B is incorrect because officers cannot detain individuals without any suspicion; they need at least reasonable suspicion. Answer D is too restrictive, as reasonable suspicion can apply to individuals who may not have been directly involved in the reported incident but whose behavior or circumstances contribute to the officer's suspicion."

However, territories are federal entities and so in theory, any federal matter could be devolved to the territorial legislatures. This is hinted at with the s. 8 in your question. However, with the exception of some Aboriginal matters, the territorial acts are clear that the territorial legislatures do **not** have any competencies beyond that of the provinces (*Yukon Act* s. 20(1\\), *Northwest Territories Act* s. 25(1\\), *Nunavut Act* s. 23(2\\))\n\nThis makes our job easier: since the territorial legislatures can't legislate on criminal matters, any inconsistency with the *Criminal Code* would have to lie directly in those three territorial acts. While I could have missed something, I was unable to find any inconsistency in either the Yukon or Northwest Territory acts. So why does s. 8 of the *Criminal Code* exist? It seems to be a matter of how the legislation was historically structured: The *Criminal Code* would set the country\\-wide default, and any derogations could be placed in the territorial acts. See for example *[The King v. Standard Soap Company](https://www.canlii.org/en/nt/ntsc/doc/1907/1907canlii134/1907canlii134.html)*, 1907 CanLII 134 (NWT SC):\n\n> When the Criminal Code, 1892, was enacted, it was, by sec. 983, made applicable to the North\\-West Territories, except in so far as it was inconsistent with the provisions of the North\\-West Territories Act and the amendments thereto. As far as this case is concerned, the only Changes made in the Code by that Act are that instead of an indictment being presented by a grand jury to the Court where a person is charged with a criminal offence, the proceedings are commenced by a charge in writing setting forth the offence in the same manner as in an indictment.\n\nGrand juries no longer exist in Canada, so this inconsistency doesn't either (I speculate the original reason would have been the difficulty and expense of convening grand juries in such a sparsely populated territory).\n\nAs for Nunavut, well it seems Parliament threw the historical structure out the [Peace Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Tower) window. If you search for \"Yukon\" or \"Northwest\" in the *Criminal Code*, you'll find about 20 results each where they are mostly being treated the same as the provinces. If you search for \"Nunavut\", you'll get about 140 results. Therefore, I will leave finding any potential inconsistencies as an exercise to the reader.",

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the purpose and implications of this provision?\n\nA) It allows territories to create their own criminal laws that supersede the Criminal Code.\n\nB) It primarily exists as a historical artifact from when territorial acts contained specific derogations from the Criminal Code.\n\nC) It grants territorial legislatures the power to legislate on criminal matters independently of federal authority.\n\nD) It exclusively deals with current inconsistencies between the Criminal Code and territorial acts regarding grand juries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The information provided suggests that Section 8 of the Criminal Code exists mainly as a remnant of how legislation was historically structured. It allowed for potential derogations from the Criminal Code to be placed in territorial acts, even though current territorial acts generally do not contain such inconsistencies. \n\nOption A is incorrect because territories cannot create criminal laws that supersede the Criminal Code, as criminal law is under federal jurisdiction.\n\nOption C is wrong because the passage explicitly states that territorial legislatures do not have competencies beyond those of the provinces in criminal matters.\n\nOption D is too narrow and outdated. While the grand jury example is given, it's presented as a historical instance and no longer applies.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the apparent current status of Section 8 as primarily a historical provision, maintaining a structure that allowed for potential territorial-specific variations in criminal procedure, even though such variations are now rare or non-existent."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this parking?\n\nA) The contractors have an absolute right to park on the road as part of the \"right of way\" easement.\nB) Parking is strictly prohibited under any \"right of way\" easement, as it only allows for passing through.\nC) The legality of parking depends on the specific scope of the easement, which is determined on a case-by-case basis.\nD) The property owner has the right to tow any vehicles parked on the road immediately, regardless of the easement terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, the scope of a \"right of way\" easement is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific facts and circumstances. There is no universal rule that applies to all easements regarding parking. The legality of parking would depend on the particular terms of the easement agreement and how it has been interpreted or used over time. Options A and B are incorrect because they make absolute statements that don't account for the variability in easement terms. Option D is incorrect because it assumes the property owner has rights that may be limited by the easement, which again depends on the specific terms of the agreement."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to form an LLC in California for my new business. I will be the only owner and employee. I've been looking into sites like legalzoom and incfile as well as local business lawyers. Both business lawyers' websites and people on random online forums regarding the topic have suggested that forming an LLC using online services such as these will only provide you with generic documents that will not provide the necessary protection you need. Furthermore, once people realize that their documents from these online services do not serve their purposes or have screwed them over, they must go to a lawyer anyway to fix the mess.\n\nWhat are some concrete examples of ways using documents from online services would not provide the proper protection? What is the approximate cost to have a lawyer fix said mistakes and in what situations would I come to realize the need to consult a lawyer in person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A single person LLC document is one where it probably makes less of a difference to have it drafted by a lawyer than many other documents because it has very few tax implications and governance is elementary. The main issues would be choosing a proper LLC name and correctly choosing whether it should be member managed or manager managed (almost always, manager managed is preferred).\n\nBut, the main reason to consult a lawyer is to determine if a single person LLC as opposed, for example, to an S corporation, is really the most appropriate entity form for your business.\n\nAmong the concerns would be how this form would interact with California's community property laws, determining whether the LLC is disregarded for [state franchise taxes as well as federal income taxes](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/businesses/Structures/Limited-Liability-Company.shtml), determining what impact the LLC makes on Medicaid planning and estate planning, determining whether the ability to reduce FICA taxation in an S\\-corporation makes it worth choosing that form rather than an LLC, determining whether there are liability insurance requirements that are triggered, and determining how this form impacts health insurance structures v. other alternatives.\n\nAn attorney could also advise you on the \"care and feeding\" of the LLC so that you are clear on how to observe the proper formalities. For example, many people forget to, or don't know how to, title property in the LLC name, don't know when to obtain a separate EIN for the LLC, don't know how to sign documents in the name of the LLC, don't know how to draft an LLC authorization, don't know that the LLC must be an insured on insurance policies, etc.\n\nAlso, an attorney normally wouldn't charge very much for a very simple entity like a single member LLC Operating Agreement.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that getting a lawyer to fix a problem after the fact caused by DIY work by a client is about ten times as great as the cost of hiring a lawyer to do it correctly in the first place.\n\nFor example, a single person LLC might cost $500\\-$750 to draft in the first place including a consultation about whether it was really appropriate and a care and feeding discussion. Fixing a problem caused by inappropriately using a single person LLC might typically cost $5000\\-$7500\\.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in California is considering forming a single-member LLC using online legal services. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the potential risks and considerations of this approach?\n\nA) Online services always provide adequate protection for single-member LLCs, making lawyer consultation unnecessary.\n\nB) The main risk of using online services is choosing an improper LLC name, which can be easily corrected later.\n\nC) Using online services may result in inadequate protection, missed tax implications, and failure to consider alternative business structures that might be more beneficial.\n\nD) The only significant difference between online services and lawyer consultation is the cost, with no impact on the quality of protection provided.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation highlights several important points that support this choice:\n\n1. While single-member LLC documents are simpler than many other legal documents, there are still important considerations that online services might miss.\n\n2. A lawyer can help determine if an LLC is the most appropriate entity for the business, considering factors like tax implications, community property laws, and potential benefits of alternative structures like S-corporations.\n\n3. Attorneys can provide guidance on proper LLC management, including titling property, obtaining an EIN, signing documents, and insurance considerations.\n\n4. The cost of fixing problems caused by DIY work is estimated to be about ten times higher than the cost of hiring a lawyer to do it correctly from the start.\n\n5. Online services may provide generic documents that don't address the specific needs of the business or provide necessary protections.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they underestimate the value of legal consultation. Option B is too narrow in focus, as the risks extend beyond just choosing a proper name. Option C most comprehensively addresses the potential issues and considerations raised in the documentation."

I mean, as they say, \"on the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.\" (Or, for that matter, a lawyer).\n\nBut can a court send summons and subpoenas by email? Could you respond in email? Or are we still at the FAX stage, if that.\n\nWhat about an attorney? Can email be a legal method of sending documents between attorneys?\n\nWhat about electronic signatures for emails? Does sending an email effectively sign and date it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Australia a summons has been legally served by posting it on Facebook. Facebook showed that the document had been accessed by the account user and the court accepted that as the person who owned the account and the person summonsed were the same that service had occurred.\n\nIn general, it doesn't matter how a document was served so long as there is evidence that it was *received*: email and other forms of electronic messaging may or may not provide such evidence. For example, if an email is part of a conversation then each response provides evidence that the previous email was received \\- the only room for doubt is in the last email in the chain.\n\nAn exception to this is the [postal rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_rule) where something that is mailed is deemed to be received when it is dropped in the mailbox or, for some legislation, \"in the ordinary time for delivery\", usually 1 or 2 days.",

The information provided indicates that various forms of electronic communication, including email and even social media platforms like Facebook, can be used to serve legal documents if there is evidence that the document was received. This is exemplified by the case in Australia where a summons was legally served via Facebook, and the court accepted it as valid service because there was evidence that the document had been accessed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage clearly shows that email and other electronic methods can be used in some jurisdictions.\n\nAnswer B is false because the example of Facebook service in Australia demonstrates that non-traditional methods can be legally valid.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the postal rule is specifically mentioned as applying to mailed items, not to all forms of communication. The passage does not suggest that this rule extends to electronic communications.\n\nThe key point is that the validity of service often depends on evidence of receipt, regardless of the method used, with some exceptions like the postal rule for traditional mail."

As best I can tell, *in practice* so long as police assert that the seized item is potentially useful in their investigation of a crime (which, if serious but unsolved, may never be formally abandoned), they can avoid returning seized property \u2013 even if the ownership is uncontested and the items are not contraband. I.e., even when the owner is *effectively permanently deprived* of their property, I have not found any practical legal mechanism for them to seek compensation. (The only redress I have found is a right to petition for return of property, which is apparently denied so long as police assert the property has value in a criminal investigation or prosecution.)\n\nAre there any particular laws, rules, or procedures that provide for payment of compensation in these cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a good question, which I am going to answer from a practical perspective, rather than a theoretical one, which would probably justify a law review article (applications of the takings clause to criminal justice fact patterns is actually one of my pet areas of legal scholarship, but a lot of it calls for dramatic changes in established practice and precedents reached from other perspectives, making it impractical to pursue in real life). \n\nI recently had a case along these lines in my office where my client's property was seized as evidence in a criminal case against a third\\-party.\n\nThe crime involved a gun shop where all of the guns that were in the possession of the shop owner for repairs at the time of the bust (i.e. as bailments), including ours worth several thousand dollars in addition to having some sentimental value, were seized as evidence of charges against a shop owner who was fencing stolen goods, making sales to felons off the books, falsifying excise tax returns, etc. \n\nHe seemed legitimate and had been in business for many years in what was not a fly by night operation. He had all of the proper licenses. Who knew we were dealing with a crook?\n\nIn that case, we intervened on behalf of our client in the primary case to seek the physical return of the property (basically a replevin claim), as have others affected by the bust. It took a few months and some legal fees, but we prevailed without too much effort, as have the other intervenors.\n\nGenerally speaking, to make a 5th Amendment claim, you would have to show a total taking and move into some legal gray areas in this context, while it is usually hard for authorities to show a continuing need for possession of third\\-party property in the face of a demand for its return, especially when photography and other scientific tools can document the evidence in great detail these days. In that case, showing that our client's particular gun was not involved in any illegitimate transaction also simultaneously made it less important as evidence, although that would not necessarily be true in general in these kinds of situations.\n\nThere is a pending case in Colorado posing similar issues, where a suburban police department essentially destroyed a guy's home in order to catch a felon with no relation to the homeowner whatsoever, who had fled into it and taken refuge there. But, that case, as far as I know, has not yet been resolved on the merits.",

Which of the following is the most appropriate legal action for the business owner to take?\n\nA) File a Fifth Amendment claim for just compensation, arguing that the seizure constitutes a taking of private property for public use\nB) Petition the court for return of property, emphasizing the lack of direct involvement in the crime and the economic hardship caused by the seizure\nC) Sue the police department for violation of Fourth Amendment rights, claiming the seizure was unreasonable\nD) Demand immediate return of the computer, citing the length of time passed since the initial seizure as unreasonable\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, the most appropriate and practical action for the business owner would be to petition the court for the return of property (option B). This approach aligns with the example given in the documentation, where intervention in the primary case to seek physical return of property was successful. \n\nOption A, while theoretically interesting, faces significant practical and legal hurdles. The documentation suggests that making a 5th Amendment claim would require showing a total taking and involve complex legal gray areas.\n\nOption C is unlikely to succeed because the initial seizure was likely conducted with a valid warrant based on probable cause, making it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nOption D, while understandable from the owner's perspective, lacks the formal legal process necessary to compel action from law enforcement.\n\nPetitioning the court allows the owner to formally challenge the continued retention of the property, emphasizing their lack of involvement in the crime and the economic impact of the seizure. This approach provides a structured legal mechanism to address the issue while respecting the ongoing nature of the investigation."

First, you are expected to report the injury to the employer within 30 days, and if you do not, your claim may be denied. You have actually done that (they have actual knowledge of the injury so a future petition is not barred by [the 30 day rule](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.185.html)). Then within 7 days they are to report the injury to their insurance company. They acknowledge that employers may refuse to report injuries, and clarify that the employee has a right to report the injury to the insurance company (they offer assistance in doing that). Your medical expenses would be covered. There is also a provision that you can get compensation for lost time.\n\nIt is [against the law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.205.html) for them to fire you for filing a claim or attempting to file a claim (\"No employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee by reason of such employee\u2019s valid claim for compensation or attempt to claim compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law\").\n\nRegardless of the effect on the location's record of reported accidents or the amount of paperwork involved, it is not obviously in the interest of an employee to forgo their rights to compensation. The employee's attorney can advise the employee whether the company's alternative offer is advantageous. If one does not take action (notifying the insurance company for example), eventually they will have waived your rights for compensation.\n\nSupposing that the employee files a report with the insurance company, and the company then fires her in retaliation. This would not involve any unemployment compensation. There is no provision under the law for the state to litigate on her behalf, although the attorney general might file a class action suit if the company is engaged in widespread illegal terminations. So it would fall on the employee to litigate the matter: retaliation for filing a workman's comp claim is one of the recognized grounds for a wrongful termination suit. There are numerous attorneys who may take such a case on a contingency basis (it would depend on the actual details, to be discussed with the attorney).",

If the employer refuses to do so, the employee has the right to report the injury directly to the insurance company. This ensures that the employee's rights to workers' compensation benefits, including medical expenses and potentially lost wages, are protected.

It happens, you just don't notice it;\n2. It doesn't happen because banks haven't figured out a way to do it;\n3. It doesn't happen because it's been outlawed.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have the time to traverse Indonesian legislation to determine which laws may or may not apply to banks but not insurance. However, I will say this: generally, the financial services industry, and in particular, deposit\\-taking institutions, are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than many others. (I'd usually say that insurance is also fairly\\-heavily regulated, generally.) So it's likely that there are laws and regulations that prevent banks, for instance from doing it.\n\nAs for other places... I don't intend to traverse the trillions of contracts made each day.\n\n> Why only in insurance we have this problem?\n\nYou haven't proven this. You've only proven that you've only *noticed* this in insurance. And, if that's the case, see above \\- perhaps insurance isn't as highly regulated as it is in other places around the world.\n\n> When we put money in bank we don't check that all money are \"debited\" right?\n\nNot sure what you mean. If you mean that you don't give your statement at least a cursory overview when you receive it, or monitor your account online regularly to make sure that everything looks okay... well, that's not really a legal issue, but maybe it's something worth considering.\n\n> We don't make sure that there is no 100% acquisition fee on all money we deposit?\n\nI guess not. Maybe you pay bank fees on deposit products, or interest on credit products, or other fees, instead.

The passage suggests that the main reason this practice occurs in the insurance industry but not in banks or other sectors is likely due to differences in regulation. The answer states that \"generally, the financial services industry, and in particular, deposit-taking institutions, are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than many others.\" It also mentions that \"it's likely that there are laws and regulations that prevent banks, for instance from doing it.\" The key point is that \"it can happen because the law allows it to happen\" in the insurance industry in Indonesia, implying that the law may not allow similar practices in other sectors.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it makes an unsupported ethical judgment.

(Even if he \"merely\" puts her in a vegetative state or drives her insane, he can still be arrested and tried for that.)\n* Yet, if Ronald kills Kayleigh by using incessant transphobic hate speech to drive her to suicide (or \"merely\" causes massive psychological trauma resulting in various delightful severe psychological and psychiatric disorders), he gets off scot\\-free.\n\nWhy this perplexing inconsistency in what, harmful\\-speech\\-wise, is constitutionally\\-permissible and what is not?\n\n---\n\n1: The argument given in [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/57068/12499) to [a related question](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/13367/12499), that\n\n> The key is that holding these beliefs, and stating these beliefs, hurts nobody.\n\ndoesn't hold water, as, while *holding* hateful beliefs (*without* stating or acting on them in any way) is indeed harmless, *stating* hateful beliefs can cause real, concrete, immense, and potentially\\-*lethal*2 psychological harm to the victim of this speech.\n\n2: As (among many many other examples) the countless LGBTQ\\+ children and teenagers who've been driven to suicide by being victims to incessant hateful speech could testify (were you to reanimate them with their mental faculties intact, at least).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One notes your third example is rather more specific: you describe someone as being driven to suicide.

What does \"hate crime\" add to the situation, especially given it covers only a small subset?\n\nAs for the claim that \"hate speech\" in general causes suicide in the group, it is impossible to establish a direct connection between the speech and the death, let alone that it caused the death, given that you have to exclude other factors.\n\nAlleging direct psychological harm from the speech means, basically, that anyone, anywhere, can be silenced at any time in the absence of actual evidence.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of forms of speech can cause people to commit suicide. A son may commit suicide on hearing that his comatose father is recovering, because he was embezzling his father's property and realizes he will be found out. That speech is not punishable, and it's far more direct.",

The passage suggests that while hate speech can potentially cause psychological harm, it is generally protected under the First Amendment because it is difficult to establish a direct causal link between the speech and specific harmful outcomes, such as suicide. This difficulty in proving direct harm distinguishes hate speech from other forms of unprotected speech where the harm is more immediately evident or provable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage acknowledges that hate speech can cause real psychological harm. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the Constitution does not explicitly protect hate speech; rather, it is protected as a form of free speech unless it falls into specific unprotected categories.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not claim that hate speech is necessarily less harmful than other forms of unprotected speech. Instead, it emphasizes the difficulty in proving direct harm from hate speech compared to other forms of harmful speech."

Anyone who is not ks\u0323atriya, brahmin, vais\u0301ya or s\u0301udra is avarna (\"outcaste; dalit; untouchable\"). [Article 17](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1987997/) simply asserts that \"Untouchability\" is forbidden, leaving it to ordinary interpretation to figure out what that really means.\n\n[The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989](https://www.cvmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PoA-Act-English.pdf). \"Scheduled Caste\" is invoked in [Art. 341](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/68762/) of the constitution, which simply says\n\n> (1\\) The President may with respect to any State or Union territory,\n> and where it is a State after consultation with the Governor thereof,\n> by public notification, specify the castes, races or tribes or parts\n> of or groups within castes, races or tribes which shall for the\n> purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in\n> relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of\n> Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause ( 1 )\n> any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or\n> tribe, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said\n> clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification\n\nLeaving aside the further definition of those in a Scheduled Caste, the act lists numerous specific actions which are prohibited, the Offenses of Atrocities in Ch II, for example\n\n> (a) puts any inedible or obnoxious substance into the mouth of a\n> member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe or forces such member\n> to drink or eat such inedible or obnoxious substance\n\nYou can summarize this as \"you cannot commit crimes against a member of a Scheduled Caste\".\n\nThe membership question is reduced to lists, for example\n[The Constitution, (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950](https://socialjustice.gov.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/CONSTITUTION%20(SC)%20ORDER%201950%20dated%2010081950.pdf). There are about 7 such orders for caste, and as many for tribes. Note that only Hindus can be in Scheduled Castes, and Sikhs are dealt with by listing relevant caste members as Hindus irrespective of their religious profession.

Which of the following actions would be most appropriate and ethical for the attorney to take?\n\nA) Immediately withdraw from the case and inform the court of the client's guilt\nB) Continue representing the client, but focus solely on negotiating a plea bargain\nC) Proceed with the defense, challenging the prosecution's evidence and cross-examining witnesses, but avoid putting the client on the stand\nD) Advise the client to plead guilty and refuse to continue representation if they decline\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because it violates attorney-client privilege and the ethical obligation to maintain client confidentiality.\n\nB) is incorrect because it limits the attorney's ability to provide a full defense and may not be in the client's best interest if there are potential defenses or mitigating factors.\n\nC) is correct because it allows the attorney to fulfill their ethical duty to zealously represent their client without engaging in or facilitating perjury. The attorney can still challenge the prosecution's case and protect the client's rights without knowingly presenting false evidence.\n\nD) is incorrect because it oversteps the attorney's role. While the attorney cannot assist in perjury, they should not coerce the client into a specific plea. The decision to plead guilty ultimately belongs to the client.\n\nThis question tests understanding of legal ethics, the role of defense attorneys, and the balance between zealous representation and ethical obligations."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer in North Carolina sues a national bank for unfair practices related to non-receipt of paperless billing statements. The consumer signed three agreements: a cardmember agreement (governed by Delaware law), an online service agreement (governed by New York law), and an electronic communication consent agreement (no specified governing law). Which of the following is most likely to be true regarding the applicable law for the consumer's claim?\n\nA) The claim will definitely be governed by Delaware law due to the cardmember agreement's choice-of-law provision.\nB) The claim will definitely be governed by New York law due to the online service agreement's choice-of-law provision.\nC) The claim will definitely be governed by North Carolina law as the consumer's state of residence.\nD) The applicable law will depend on which agreement is determined to be most relevant to the specific claim, and may be subject to North Carolina public policy considerations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the situation involves multiple agreements with different choice-of-law provisions, and the specific nature of the claim (non-receipt of paperless billing statements) could potentially fall under any of the three agreements. The court will need to determine which agreement is most relevant to the specific claim. Additionally, even if an out-of-state law is deemed applicable, North Carolina public policy considerations may override certain provisions. The complexity of the situation means that a definitive answer cannot be given without more specific analysis of the claim and the agreements. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they oversimplify the situation and fail to account for the potential interplay between the different agreements and public policy considerations."

The female celeb is now suing him for defamation as she says that this is false; she never slept with him.\n\nIf the male celebrity decided to say he can't remember the specifics for example where and when this alleged encounter happened, is that enough of a defence for the male celebrity or does he have to provide specifics of encounter to win this case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a variety of reasons someone might not win a defamation case, some of which are defenses, and others of which are part of the basic prima facie case that every person pursing a claim must establish. The exact details vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n1. The statute of limitations for bringing suit based upon the alleged statement has passed. Many jurisdictions have especially short statutes of limitations for defamation claims. For example, in Colorado, the statute of limitations for a defamation claim is just one year, while other civil claims have two to six year statutes of limitations.\n2. The quoted statement isn't actually what was said.\n3. The statement is not defamatory in nature (i.e. it doesn't tend to harm the Plaintiff's reputation).\n4. The Plaintiff's reputation is so bad that no further statement could harm it.\n5. The court lacks jurisdiction over the claim or the case is filed in the wrong venue.\n6. The statement was substantially true. Note that this is not a defense to all types of claims called defamation in all jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions prohibit certain kinds of inflammatory negative statements (e.g. about religious figures, monarchs, dead people, family members, or disabled people) without regard to their truth, in causes of action that are seen as a subset of defamation actions. For example, Germany's criminal defamation statute prohibits some kinds of speech that would be considered insulting or \"fighting words\", effectively imposing a standing of civility in every day contexts, that applies without regard to truth. U.S. law carefully distinguishes between remedies for fraudulent lies about someone, statements that are objectionable because they implicate privacy concerns, statements that are objectionable because a person has a contractual or particularized legal duty not to say negative things about a particular individual, and statements that are disrespectful and disorderly, but not all jurisdictions draw these careful and fine lines.\n7. In context, the statement could not reasonably have been understood to be true as opposed to puffing, hyperbole, or an opinion.\n8. Failure to prove damages in jurisdictions where this is required on claims where it is required (proof of damages is not required for libel or slander per se in some jurisdictions). Some jurisdictions allow only economic damages, others allow emotional harm damages, others allow punitive damages, some allow statutory damages, and some allow some but not all of these kinds of damages.\n9. The statement is privileged or subject to a qualified privilege (e.g. statements made to law enforcement investigators, by attorneys in litigation, in court documents, by legislators in legislative debate, etc.)\n10. The statement was false but believed in good faith and with a reasonable basis to be true at the time, and at the time of the litigation, the person making the statement acknowledges its inaccuracies or a sense in which a statement meant as true could be misunderstood.\n11. Some jurisdictions make retraction of full defense or a partial defense. Some jurisdictions even make a request for a retraction a condition precedent to bringing a defamation lawsuit in some circumstances.\n12. The person bringing the lawsuit doesn't meet their burden of proof at trial. Usually, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, but truth is sometimes considered an affirmative defense which some jurisdictions place on the defendant to prove. The burden of proof could be quite relevant to the answer. Ultimately, if truth is an issue in a case, the finder of fact (jury or judge depending upon the jurisdiction and whether a jury is demanded) would have to decide what evidence is sufficient. There is no black and white rule that applies.",

Option A relates to retraction and acknowledgment of potential misunderstanding, which can be a defense in some jurisdictions. Option B refers to proving the truth of the statement, which is a strong defense against defamation claims. Option C involves the statute of limitations, which can prevent a case from proceeding if too much time has passed.\n\nOption D, however, is not necessarily a defense or a reason to avoid losing the case. Providing specific details about the alleged encounter doesn't automatically protect the male celebrity from a defamation claim. In fact, the original question suggests that lack of specific details (e.g., not remembering where and when the encounter happened) might be used as part of a defense strategy. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it is NOT a potential defense or reason the male celebrity might avoid losing the case."

So\\-called \"moral rights\" (or non\\-economic rights) are also determined by authorship.\n\nSo is it possible for a corporation, business, or other legal entity to be the legal author of a work for purposes of copyright law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, Yes\n--------------\n\n[17 USC 201 (b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html) provides that:\n\n> (b) Works Made for Hire.\u2014In the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author for purposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.\n\n\"Work Made for Hire\" is defined in [17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101), which reads:\n\n> A \u201cwork made for hire\u201d is\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) a work prepared by an employee **within the scope** of his or her employment; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, **if** the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a \u201csupplementary work\u201d is a work prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting in the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an \u201cinstructional text\u201d is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.\n\nIn Germany, No\n--------------\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_Germany)\n\n> The author is the creator of their work, which enjoys copyright protection in accordance with the UrhG, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 1, 2 UrhG. Accordingly, all work resulting from a personal intellectual activity is copyright protected.(Gruber: Gewerblicher Rechtsschutz und Urheberrecht, 2nd Ed., Altenberge 2008, p.73\\) The \u201eprinciple of non\\-transferability\u201c of full or divided authorship according to \u00a7 29 I UrhG is valid. Therefore, the creator of an original work can neither transfer their personal right as a creator,\\[(Cf. G\u00f6tting: Gewerblicher Rechtsschutz und Urheberrecht, 1st Ed., M\u00fcnchen 2005, p.250\\) nor the complete rights for the exploitation of their work to others. (Cf.

Keep in mind that GitHub is not an autonomous system with no humans involved; it's run by a company of people, many of whom could theoretically access the code in private repositories.\n\n---\n\nThat said, from a practical standpoint, most companies aren't going to fire someone for a mistake made in good faith, especially if actual disclosure to any humans is rather unlikely.

Today, while walking in a nearby town, he spots his car parked on the street. What is the most appropriate and legally safe course of action for John?\n\nA) John should immediately take possession of the car and drive it home, as he is the rightful owner.\n\nB) John should call the police, inform them of the car's location, and wait for their arrival before approaching the vehicle.\n\nC) John can take possession of the car and drive it home, but must immediately inform the police that he has recovered it.\n\nD) John should leave an note on the car informing the current driver that it's stolen, and then report the location to the police.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate action. As the rightful owner with evidence of registration, John can legally repossess his stolen car without going through the police. However, it's crucial that he immediately informs the police that he has recovered the vehicle. This action serves two important purposes:\n\n1. It prevents John from potentially being pulled over and arrested in a felony stop, as the car is still listed as stolen in police records.\n2. It allows for proper documentation of the recovery, which may be necessary for insurance claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while John can legally repossess the car, failing to inform the police could lead to dangerous misunderstandings.\n\nOption B, while cautious, is not necessary. The documentation states that involving the police in the recovery is not absolutely required.\n\nOption D is not advisable as it could potentially alert the thief and lead to the car being moved or further damaged."

Additionally I am not asking whether a landlord can *evict* a tenant for smoking, since it is not necessary for a landlord to enter unannounced to observe smoking in a unit to evict.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [landlord tenant act of Wisconsin](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/704/05/2) states\n\n> ...The landlord may upon advance notice and at reasonable times\n>  inspect the premises, make repairs and show the premises to\n>  prospective tenants or purchasers; and if the tenant is absent from\n>  the premises and the landlord reasonably believes that entry is\n>  necessary to preserve or protect the premises, the landlord may enter\n>  without notice and with such force as appears necessary.\n\nThere is no \"emergency\" clause. It would be far\\-fetched to maintain that a reasonable person would deem entry to be necessary to enter the premises in these circumstances. Note also that the tenant has to be absent (it does *not* say that the landlord has a reasonable belief that the tenant is absent).\n\nThe administrative interpretation in [the administrative code](http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/atcp/090/134/09/2/b) restates the statutory condition that states the conditions under which a landlord may enter, adding the condition that \"A health or safety emergency exists\".

Additionally, issuing a blanket notice does not override the legal requirements for entry. The law also specifies that for non-emergency situations, advance notice and reasonable timing are required for inspections or repairs. Smoking, while against the lease, does not constitute a health or safety emergency that would justify immediate entry without notice."

We all 3 inherited her house in equal shares, two of us live there. I am being told because they were executors that they can decide to sell, without my consent as they are still in charge, due to being executors. Is this true? I was under the impression that when probate was settled and all the affairs of the deceased person had been settled, that the duty and/or authority of an executor is done.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If three people inherited a house in equal shares, then a new deed should have been prepared and filed with the appropriate governmental authority (the county in most US states) before probate is closed. When that is done the authority of the executors over the house **as executors** has ended.\n\nHowever, if I understand you correctly, the two former executors are also two of the three heirs to the house. Thus they own a 2/3rds interest in the house. At least they can sell their interests without your consent, leaving you a minority owner with the purchaser owner a majority. In some jurisdictions they may be able to force a sale, paying you your share of the purchase price. But this would be because of their majority ownership, not because of their former status as executors.\n\n**Addition**:\nIn some states co\\-owners who are joint tenants may not sell their interests without the consent of the other co\\-owners, but this is jnot true in North Carolina\n\nAccording to the site of the [Hutchens Law office](https://hutchenslawfirm.com/blog/real-estate/forms-ownership-interest-nc-real-property):\n\n> ownership as tenants in common provides each party with the right to\n> sell, gift, devise, or otherwise convey their interest in the property\n> without the permission of the other owners. This means that the\n> ownership interest is freely alienable or transferable. As a result,\n> an owner may sell or give their interest in the property to anyone\n> they want, or they may willingly or by judgment use their interest in\n> the property to secure or satisfy a debt with a creditor. Therefore,\n> parties entering into an agreement to purchase property as tenants in\n> common should be aware that they may ultimately end up owning the\n> property with a stranger. If this were to happen, there is a way out,\n> but it may be costly. At any time, if the parties can't agree, any\n> owner may petition the court for a partition of the property. The\n> court could require one owner to buy another out or force the sale of\n> the property. The court will decide the ultimate outcome based on\n> equity.\n\n...\n\n> \\[I]f the intent of co\\-owners holding interest as joint tenants is to\n> automatically transfer their interest at death to the survivor, the\n> language must be on the conveying instrument as right of survivorship\n> is not automatic with joint tenancy in North Carolina and if the\n> language in not included, the decedent's interest will pass to his\n> heirs.\n\n...\n\n> However, any owner has the right to convey their ownership interest\n> during their life; and if they do, the survivorship agreement ends,\n> and owners simply become joint tenants by operation of law.\n\nIn North Carolina there seems to be little practical difference between co\\-owners who are tenants in common, and those who are joint tenants without a right of survivorship. But whichever form of co\\-ownership is chosen: tenants in common, joint tenants without a right of survivorship, or joint tenants with a right of survivorship, each of the co\\-owners has a right during his or her lifetime to sell, give away, or use as collateral on a loan his or her share of the property, without consulting the other co\\-owners. They cannot force the other co\\-owner(s) to sell, except by starting an action of partition in a court, when a judge would decide. An unrelated buyer might be unwilling to purchase only a 1/3 or 2/3rds interest, because the remaining co\\-owner(s) would still have full rights to use and occupy the house, can could sell to a different buyer.\n\nAll co\\-owners are responsible for their proportionate shares of all expenses, including mortgage payments, repairs, and taxes.",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) As co-executors, Alice and Bob retain the authority to sell the house without Charlie's consent, even after probate is completed.\n\nB) Charlie can prevent the sale of the house entirely, as all three siblings must agree unanimously to sell the property.\n\nC) Alice and Bob can sell their 2/3 interest in the house without Charlie's consent, but cannot force Charlie to sell his 1/3 share.\n\nD) The property can only be sold if Alice and Bob petition the court for a partition, regardless of the type of co-ownership.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In North Carolina, co-owners of property (whether as tenants in common or joint tenants without right of survivorship) have the right to sell their individual interests without the consent of other co-owners. Alice and Bob, owning 2/3 of the property, can sell their shares without Charlie's permission. However, they cannot force Charlie to sell his 1/3 share unless they petition the court for a partition. The executor status is irrelevant after probate is completed. While a court-ordered partition is possible, it's not the only way to sell their shares.

The article [\"Challenges of Retirement Plans with Union Members\"](https://www.planadviser.com/challenges-of-retirement-plans-with-union-members/) says:\n\n> Retirement plans at organizations where the workforce is largely unionized have the unique challenge of being obligated to negotiate plan terms with the union.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it, Trump is planning to issue an executive order that claims some social media platforms are violating the Communication Decency Act Section 230 by not acting in good faith, and as a result, wants new FCC guidelines on the behavior of the platforms. If a platform violates these guidelines, then they are open to litigation, which they have previously been protected from. Here is a link to a draft of the order: [https://kateklonick.com/wp\\-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT\\-EO\\-Preventing\\-Online\\-Censorship.pdf](https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf)\n\nSome questions I have...\n\n* Is my summary an accurate description?\n* A common part of the debate has been \"free speech\", which isn't relevant to a private company. However, are there other times the FCC has set guidelines that effectively influence free speech?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Addressing only the document that you link to without assumption of accuracy or finality, it says that \"It is the policy of the United States to foster clear, nondiscriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the Internet. Prominent among those rules is the immunity from liability\", referring to [47 USC 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230), and specifically \"the scope of that immunity should be clarified\". It is clear that the law say nothing about what counts as \"good faith\", nor does it say anything about what constitutes \"otherwise objectionable\". The document correctly say that the law \"does not extend to deceptive or pretextual actions restricting online content\", at leas as long as we understand \"extend to\" as meaning \"explicitly mention\". Similarly, the law does not explicitly say anything about whether a provider violating its own TOS nullifies the \"good faith restriction\" clause.\n\nThe order then directs the Dept. of Commerce to petition the **FCC** for regulations clarifying the interpretation of this law (I assume you meant FCC and not FTC). It specifically proposes explicitly interpreting \"taken in good faith\" to exclude actions that are deceptive, pretextual or inconsistent with a provider's TOS, or \"the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or having been undertaking \\[sic] without a meaningful opportunity to be heard\".\n\nEverybody is presently open to litigation for defamation (for example), because you can allege that pretextual or \"unreasonable\" restrictions on speech *are* in bad faith, then the courts have to evaluate that question. What the regulations would do is provide a default answer (\"yes, it is\"), which the courts would follow unless the regulation is overturned in court or is rescinded. \n\nThere are vast numbers of restrictions on free speech by the FCC: the whole purpose of the FCC is to restrict the freedom to speak as one may please. The initial premise was that the government didn't want broadcaster A to functionally obliterate broadcaster B due to the strength of his signal on a particular frequency, so you are not free to speak in certain ways. There are numerous other restrictions on what you may say within the sphere regulated by the FCC, e.g. you can't broadcast live sex acts on network TV during Saturday morning cartoon time. The [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) and the [equal time rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule) are / were other examples of restrictions on free speech (via compelled speech). \"Free speech\" is an open\\-enough concept that it is reasonable to consider anything with a governmentally\\-mandated \"non\\-level playing field\" to be a restriction on free speech (for example, statutory immunizations of a certain class of individuals against legal consequences of their acts). The problem with saying what acts of the FCC \"restrict free speech\" is that there isn't a clear definition of \"free speech\" that is consistent with laws against threatening, fraud, perjury and defamation.\n\nAs for the accuracy of your summary, there are also provisions regarding [deceptive practices](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45). There is more to it than you summarized (obviously: that's what a summary is), but apart from misspelling FCC I'd say that the summary is brief and not as informative (or verbose) as the original, but it is not deceptive. If you want a well\\-intentioned criticism, I think it is important to be specific about the fact that there is been some statutory immunization against liability which is the core of the order, but you didn't clarify that point. Governments litigate against companies (mostly) all the time, but governments do not litigate against companies or individuals for defamation or violating a TOS, and nothing in the order suggests that the government could start to sue social media companies for defamation or breach of contract, that is, the scope of the potential litigation is limited in an important way. I would (did) include that information, and don't assume \"bad faith\" in your omission.\nYou have a First Amendment right to omit any details that you want.",

The document directs the Department of Commerce to petition the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) for regulations that would clarify the interpretation of Section 230, particularly regarding what constitutes \"good faith\" in content moderation practices. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the order does not immediately revoke liability protections. It seeks to clarify and potentially limit them through new regulations.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the order does not directly instruct social media companies to change their policies. Instead, it aims to create new guidelines that could influence how these companies operate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the order does mention concerns about online platforms, it does not specifically instruct the FTC to conduct antitrust investigations. The focus is on Section 230 interpretations and the FCC's role in clarifying them."

It is the mother's house and the adult child has been trying to help the mother. Then one day the two get into a heated verbal argument and the mother tells the adult child to move out?\n\nDoes the adult child have to move out that night? If the adult child does move out, can be charged with elder abuse for leaving the mother alone when the adult child believes it is not safe for the mother to live alone. Part of the problem with the mother living alone is that she would need to get to the food store and her driving skills have detoriated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, a landlord cannot just expel a tenant, this involved getting a court order where the judge tells the tenant to leave. Second, she might think that \"You're not a tenant, you're just living here\" but that is pretty much what it means to be a tenant \u2013 she agreed to let the relative live there. There does not have to be a detailed lease written up, though the term of such unwritten agreements is usually month\\-to\\-month (this is all about the laws of the particular state, but no state authorizes instant expulsion).\n\nYou would need to look at the laws of your state for the \"abuse\" question. Using Washington as [an example](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=74.34), and trying to make the best case possible that bailing out is against the law, the potential legal concern is \"abandonment\", which is defined as an\n\n> action or inaction by a person or entity with a duty of care for a\n> vulnerable adult that leaves the vulnerable person without the means\n> or ability to obtain necessary food, clothing, shelter, or health\n> care.\n\nthe failure of a vulnerable adult, not living in a facility, to provide for himself or herself the goods and services necessary for the vulnerable adult's physical or mental health, and the absence of which impairs or threatens the vulnerable adult's well\\-being. This definition may include a vulnerable adult who is receiving services through home health, hospice, or a home care agency, or an individual provider when the neglect is not a result of inaction by that agency or individual provider.\n\nRCW 74\\.34\\.200 creates a legal cause of action for abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult. Then one might sue for abandonment if one is living at home and\n\n> receives care from a home health, hospice, or home care agency, or an\n> individual provider\n\nBut, \"individual provider\" is a defined legal term:\n\n> a person under contract with the department to provide services in the\n> home under chapter 74\\.09 or 74\\.39A RCW\n\nIf the tenant is under contract with the state to provide services, then abandoning the vulnerable adult could get you sued. The courts do not declare that a duty of care exists because of a genetic relationship. A duty of care might be found from a contractual relation (one not involving a state social services agency), for example \"You can live here if you take care of me\". So there is a legal concern over abandonment, which the person should talk out with an attorney (which is possible since instant\\-eviction is not an option). Said attorney might also discuss the concept of guardianship.",

It's obvious that if you spend 3\\-4 hours a day commuting and share a flat with a bunch of people, your performance at work is bound to be suboptimal, even though we have no specific complaints about your performance. Your work is critically important to our group, so we want to get the most from you and expect you to rent a comfortable apartment solely for yourself and close to work. That's why we pay you that much and your salary is supposed to cover this.\n\nThere are some other details in the secretary's message regarding dress code and eating together with colleagues, but for this question I want to focus only on the matter of how far away the employee lives and whether they live with other people or alone.\n\nGiven that there are admittedly no issues with the employee's performance, would it be legal for the employer to decline to renew the employee's fixed term contract solely because their commute is long and they live in a shared flat? Suppose for the sake of this question that the employer would definitely renew the contract if the employee acceded to the demand that they move closer and live alone, and the employer's demand is not related to the nature of the work (e.g. the employee is not required to get to the office quickly in case of emergency, and they do not take home sensitive information which would need to be kept from others in their household). If it would change the answer, assume that these demands would not be written into a renewal contract, rather they only form the basis of whether the employer chooses to offer a renewal.\n\nThe original question regards a German employer, and probably in the public sector, but information about other jurisdictions may be interesting too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Restatement of facts\n\n* Employee Kaya3 has been working for 22 months with employer E under a 2\u2011year fixed term employment contract.\n* E has informally hinted they would like to extend/renew the contract with Kaya3\\.\n* Yet there is no employment contract about the subsequent period yet.\n* E cites Kaya3\u2019s distant place of residence and living conditions (a shared apartment) as the reasons for not concluding an employment contract.\nE fears Kaya3\u2019s performance would suffer under these circumstances.\n* Kaya3 comes from a developing country and likes to save as much earnings as possible, i.\u202fe. prefers cheaper accommodation.\n* There is no public or internal job posting concerning the subsequent period.\n\n### ~~Opinion~~ Thoughts\n\n1. **Contractual obligations**  \n\nThere *is no contract* obligating the parties to conclude an employment contract.\nThere is also no legal obligation to conclude a contract.\nThis is an expression of freedom of contract.\nThere *are* restrictions:\nFor instance, the [Universal Equal Treatment Act](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_agg/index.html) (AGG) forbids discrimination based on grounds of sex, ethnicity, age, among others.\nYet violation of none the restrictions bear the consequence that a contract is concluded, as emphasized for instance in \u00a7\u00a015\u00a0\u2165\u00a0AGG.\n2. **Quasi\\-contractual obligations**  \n\nInstead German labor law is completely focused on damages.\n\n\t1. *culpa in contrahendo*  \n\n\tBy starting business relations you are already entering a semi\\-contractual relationship, \u00a7\u00a0311\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tHere E and Kaya3 started talking about a future employment (\\=\u00a0*start* of business relationship possibly culminating in conclusion of a contract).\n\tThis \u201ccontract\u201d imposes the duty to take account of each other\u2019s interest, \u00a7\u00a0241\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tThat means e.\u202fg. gaslighting someone, say, *pretending* you *would* like to conclude a contract even though there has never been such intent, is forbidden, because it is not in good faith, \u00a7\u00a0242\u00a0BGB.\n\tBreaching this duty could lead to a claim in damages, \u00a7\u00a0280\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0BGB.\n\tHowever, in the present case there is not enough evidence that E was trying to \u201churt\u201d Kaya3\\.\n\tQuite the contrary, it is in the *fixed\\-term* contract\u2019s nature to fulfill a *temporary* need.\n\tFurthermore, since Kaya3 still has 2 months to work, there is still time to conclude a follow\\-up contract.\n\tA damage\u00a0\u2013 here lack of income\u00a0\u2013 has not even occurred yet.\n\t2. unequal treatment *c.\u202fi.\u202fc.*  \n\n\tE\u2019s decisions to not (yet) hire Kaya3 could be *veiled* racial discrimination or xenophobia, illegal considerations as per \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07\u00a0\u2160,\u00a06\u202f\u2160\u202f2,\u00a01\u202fAlt.\u202f1\u202f\\+\u202f2\u00a0AGG.\n\tE says he was afraid of Kaya3\u2019s work performance suffering when in fact he does not want to hire foreigners (here characterized by the circumstance that Kaya3 in fact prefers his current living situation which is quite normal in his country of origin).\n\tOn the one hand E having already hired Kaya3 once indicates he does not discriminate based on such criteria.\n\tOn the other hand it is possible that there was a change in HR\u2019s personnel so a different recruiter (for which E is responsible) is in charge now.\n\tOn the one hand Kaya3\u2019s performance on the job never gave rise to consider firing him.\n\tOn the other hand the fixed\\-term contract fulfilled a temporary need, thus a subsequent open\\-ended contract could have legitimately higher standards.\n\n\tAnswering this will require complete details, but this kind of question is in fact very frequent in practice:\n\tIs it still a *legitimate reason* or already *indirect discrimination*?\n3. **Tort obligations**  \n\nThe regulations of the Universal Equal Treatment Act (AGG) could be considered guard statutes for \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0823\u00a0\u2160,\u00a0\u2161\u00a01\u00a0BGB, yet the AGG is *lex specialis* to the general provisions of the BGB.\nIn general, damages are those legal rights the damaged party would have without the damaging event, \u00a7\u00a0249\u00a0\u2160\u00a0BGB.\nThus you could say, \u201crefusing to contract\u201d was the damaging event; if we omit the \u201cdamaging event\u201d there would have been an employment contract.\nHowever, as \u00a7 15 \u2165 AGG emphasizes, conclusion of a contract cannot be damages.\nThis is again a consequence of the freedom of contract which is an expression of the universal personal rights enshrined in the Basic Law, Art.\u00a02\u00a0\u2160 in conjunction with\u00a0Art.\u00a01\u00a0\u2160\u00a0GG (partially applicable to a company, Art.\u00a019\u00a0\u2162\u00a0GG, even though a company doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpersonality\u201d).\n4. **Conclusion**  \n\nKaya3 is not entitled to get an employment contract, nor does he have a claim for damages.\n\n### Answer\n\nJust to answer your question:\nYes, generally speaking an employer is allowed to discriminate based on where and how someone lives.\nAn employment contract, \u00a7\u00a0611\u00a0BGB, has to be fulfilled in person.\nYou cannot, say, send *your brother* to do the work which *you* are supposed to do (the employer will rightfully reject such performance).\nThus the employer can have arbitrary standards when filling a vacancy, even criteria that do not seem related to the job.\nThere are just the criteria like religion, beliefs, sex, ethnicity, and so on, which may not be taken into consideration.\nSo, even though an employer\u2019s question like \u201cHave you visited a mosque before?\u201d is neutral in nature, it creates exposure to litigation (potential indirect discrimination again).\n\nIt is also perfectly legal not to hire somebody, simply because they have already worked for the same employer (or predecessor) under a fixed\\-term contract and thus *the next* employment contract (if any) *must* be an open\\-ended contract (unless there is a good reason) \\[simplified summary of the TzBfG].\nThis practice has been repeatedly criticized by (left\\-leaning) labor unions and other parties.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Social insurance:\nAlways inform the employment agency (3 months ahead) about looming unemployment even if the current employer says \u201cwe\u2019ll extend your contract\u201d.\nOtherwise you run the risk of a period of disqualification (*Sperrzeit*, \u00a7\u00a0159\u00a0\u2160\u00a02\u00a0No.\u00a09\u00a0SGB\u00a0\u2162), because the employer might change his mind until you have concluded a contract.\n* Switching employers:\nNever terminate an open\\-end employment contract until you *have signed* the contract with the new employer.\nOtherwise, the new employer might retract his (informal) offer and then you\u2019re out of work completely.",

The other options are incorrect: A) There is no legal obligation to renew, B) Damages likely cannot be claimed in this situation, and D) The demands do not need to be in a written contract to be considered in renewal decisions."

However, should the question end up before judge or jury, they will decide on the basis of evidence presented to them whether the author copied the press publication, or independently came up with the same wording.\n\nShould it be found that the author did in fact copy a portion of the press publication, they still have a few defences left. Many are found in [Article 15(1\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.130.01.0092.01.ENG) itself (previously draft Article 11\\), including one for \"very short extracts\":\n\n> Member States shall provide publishers of press publications established in a Member State with the rights provided for in Article 2 and Article 3(2\\) of [Directive 2001/29/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32001L0029) for the online use of their press publications by information society service providers.\n> \n> \n> The rights provided for in the first subparagraph shall not apply to private or non\\-commercial uses of press publications by individual users.\n> \n> \n> The protection granted under the first subparagraph shall not apply to acts of hyperlinking.\n> \n> \n> The rights provided for in the first subparagraph shall not apply in respect of the use of individual words or very short extracts of a press publication.\n\nShould none of these defences apply, Article 15(3\\) makes clear that the [fair dealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing) defences found in the [original Copyright Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32001L0029) still apply, though those vary somewhat by country.",

Article 15(1) of the Directive explicitly states that \"The rights provided for in the first subparagraph shall not apply in respect of the use of individual words or very short extracts of a press publication.\" This means that using very small portions of a press publication is not protected under the Ancillary Copyright provision.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the directive does provide exceptions and limitations, including for very short extracts.\n\nOption B is false because while there are some exemptions (such as for private or non-commercial use), authors of blogs and scientific publications are not automatically exempt.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the directive specifically states that \"The protection granted under the first subparagraph shall not apply to acts of hyperlinking.\"\n\nThis question tests understanding of the key provisions and exceptions in the Ancillary Copyright legislation, particularly the nuances around what is and isn't protected."

What, exactly, constitutes such actions? I'm particularly interested in the situation in the United States, since that's where the StackExchange servers are.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends highly on which jurisdiction you're referring to. This is one of the areas where it varies state to state. \"Practicing law\" is not generally defined in statute, but the [Wikipedia definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law) defines it as (emphasis mine):\n\n> **giving legal advice** to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal negotiations and court proceedings such as lawsuits, and is applied to the professional services of a lawyer or attorney at law, barrister, solicitor, or civil law notary.\n\nWikipedia defines [Legal advice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_advice) as\n\n> the giving of a professional or formal opinion regarding the substance or procedure of the law in relation to a particular factual situation.\n\nand displays the following enforcement provision (emphasis mine):\n\n> Criminal laws and enforcement of \"Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)\" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. Thus, New Jersey has a law which makes it a \u201c**disorderly persons offense**\u201d to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a \u201c**crime in the fourth degree**\u201d to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL.\n\nSee also [IANAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL), which has some information about usage on the Internet:\n\n> The case law standard for determining what comments cross the line is generally \"the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice\".",

This aligns with the definition that legal advice involves \"the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice.\"\n\nOption A could be considered legal advice as it involves analyzing how a law applies to a specific situation and recommending action.\n\nOption C involves drafting legal documents, which is explicitly mentioned in the definition of practicing law.\n\nOption D not only involves representing someone in legal negotiations (a form of practicing law) but also creates a false impression that the user is a lawyer, which is specifically mentioned as a more serious offense in some jurisdictions like New Jersey."

They payed me via paypal, and used a credit card to do it. As the months went on, they would put money in my paypal, for me to buy them stuff online, and let me keep a little for fees and the trouble. Nothing in writing. Few months later, they did a chargeback for everything. The total, fittingly, was $2,666 dollars.\n\nI always took money out of paypal asap, since I don't trust them to hold money, so now my paypal balance is massively negative. I know it is my fault for trusting them. But all seemed well.\n\nThe question is, will I get charged with credit card fraud? I understand getting ripped off, but don't want to goto jail.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From what you have written, they have committed fraud, not you (by paying and then attempting to steal back funds).

This is not the same thing as saying no fraud occurred, just that withdrawing funds from your paypal account is not an act of fraud.\n\nYou also did not commit CREDIT CARD FRAUD as you did not use their credit card (unless you knew the card they were using did not belong to them).

Based on the information provided, the company that initiated the chargebacks after receiving services and goods is likely committing fraud by attempting to reclaim funds for services and items they received. The individual who performed the work and withdrew funds from their own PayPal account is not committing credit card fraud, as they were given the money for services rendered. Credit card fraud typically involves using someone else's card without permission, which is not the case here.

By signing the contract, the buyer is presumed to agree to pay another $1500 insurance for a $950 worth of good.\n\n[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sim\\-lim\\-square\\-still\\-reeling\\-from\\-jover\\-chew\\-case](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sim-lim-square-still-reeling-from-jover-chew-case)\n\n[https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/sim\\-lim\\-scams\\-student\\-reduced\\-tears\\-after\\-being\\-charged\\-1k\\-iphone\\-warranty](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/sim-lim-scams-student-reduced-tears-after-being-charged-1k-iphone-warranty)\n\nHere, the written contract says that the customer agrees to pay $1500\\. However, we also know but the customers would never have agreed to pay if he knows there is a $1500 fee.\n\nIn case of Sim Lim scam, the seller is put to jail.\n\nWhat about in other jurisdiction?\n\nIn particular, what about in Indonesia?\n\nBasically how court deals with grossly obfuscated written terms when there are evidence that the drafters of the contract try to obfuscate the terms?\n\nTo simplify:\n\nThe very bad term is technically written. For example, say there is a fee for an insurance that cost $5000\\. The normal fee for such insurance worth only $50\\.\n\nNo customers would agree to pay $5k for something worth $50\\. So instead of writing $5k fee, the insurance would write that certain percentage some terms are invented. Then the terms are written a bit differently on other pages.\n\nSo a customer that want to know there is a $5k fee will have to combine info from a few different pages with slightly different terms. Otherwise, the way it's written, it's kind of expected that most customers would fail to see the fee.\n\nAnd that's what the insurance company wants.\n\nOf course there is a term that says that you understand the whole contract bla bla that users tend to sign.\n\nA judge can see the contract and see that the very unreasonable fee is technically written. However, a judge can also see that it's grossly obfuscated.\n\nSample:\n\n[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl\\=auto\\&tl\\=en\\&u\\=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaskus.co.id%2Fpost%2F5c7f0655facb955ae505b6df%2F%3Fref%3Dprofile%26med%3Dpost](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaskus.co.id%2Fpost%2F5c7f0655facb955ae505b6df%2F%3Fref%3Dprofile%26med%3Dpost)\n\nYou may need to translate the letter. However, from the letter and simulation, it's pretty clear that the life insurance coverage is $20k (worth about $40 a year), and the letter complicatedly explain that there is a $4000k fee in first year and about $9k fee in first 5 years.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contracts\n---------\n\nContracts can be oral or written or partially oral and partially written.\n\nWhere a contract is reduced to writing (i.e. the parties intend that the contract is only written) then the terms of the contract are those and only those that are written down (barring implied terms). Where a contract contains an oral component then those oral terms are part of the contract as well.\n\nFraud\n-----\n\nBased on a (very brief) reading of the linked articles it seems that this was a case of criminal fraud and coercion.

When a party is induced to enter a contract through fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment of material facts (like hiding expensive insurance terms), the contract becomes voidable at the option of the defrauded party. This is known as \"fraud in the inducement.\"\n\nC is incorrect because price disparity alone does not automatically void a contract, though it may be evidence of unfair dealing.\n\nD is incorrect because courts generally do not rewrite contract terms.

If a candidate dies after early voting has begun but before the general election, the votes cast for that candidate remain valid. However, the Electors pledged to that candidate are not bound to vote for the deceased candidate when the Electoral College meets. They can choose to vote for another candidate, potentially one selected by the party to replace the deceased candidate. This system allows for flexibility in addressing such unusual circumstances without invalidating votes or automatically transferring them to another candidate. The 1912 case when Vice-Presidential candidate James Sherman died shortly before the election serves as a historical precedent for handling such situations within the Electoral College system."

They are not automatically granted jurisdiction (eliminating option B), nor are they automatically excluded from considering the case (eliminating option A).

The most I can own is up to the high tide mark. However, if the sea level rises then the amount of land I own would also decrease, in which case do I get compensation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") and [scotland](/questions/tagged/scotland \"show questions tagged 'scotland'\"), no.\n\nAt common law, with a hefty influence from Roman writers such as [Gaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_(jurist)) who tackled the topic, gradual changes in a natural boundary are distinguished from others. This is usually encountered in the case of a river, whose course may change slightly from year to year. New deposits are laid down and other parts are eroded, generally imperceptibly. These processes are called *alluvion* and *diluvion*, and distinguished from *avulsion* where a chunk of identifiable land is washed downriver. Deliberately\\-induced changes are also different.\n\nFor those slow and natural changes, the position is that where ownership of the land is defined with reference to the natural boundary, the extent of ownership also changes when the boundary moves. This is a sensible rule in the absence of modern surveying methods, and generally matches what people expect \\- I own the land on the south bank, you own it on the north, and it doesn't make sense for me to gain a sliver of land on the other side if the river should happen to meander a bit. It is possible to override that assumption by agreement between the landowners (or else litigate it) but that is the starting point.\n\nThe sea works in the same way, except that the \"landowner\" on the other side is the Crown. (Quotation marks because it is not the same kind of ownership that ordinary people exercise.) The intermediate area, the foreshore, has its own rules, so in fact there are multiple boundaries to think about \\- the mean high water mark, the mean low water mark \\- but it's the same idea. The foreshore might be owned by the Crown, as the sea is, but maybe by somebody else. Perhaps what was my land is now underwater at high tide, but exposed at low tide; and some other bit of land used to be foreshore and now is totally submerged.\n\nEveryday tidal changes do not affect ownership, nor do unusually large tides either way. But if I own land next to the sea, I may gain some land, or lose it, by natural action. Gradually rising sea levels move the tide lines and the property rights follow. Some riverbeds are also owned by the Crown, so the same principle is at work there too for the motion of Crown boundaries.\n\nThe rationale for *why* the Crown owns these places is not clear: there are several possible explanations to do with it being for the common good, or alternatively just an old feudal rule. That might affect adjudication of rights in some cases, such as for access to the \"new foreshore\" for particular activities: see [*R (Newhaven Port and Properties Ltd) v East Sussex CC* \\[2015] UKSC 7](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html) for an investigation of the public right to swim on an English beach. Even in the case of Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, ownership does not extend to the sea beyond the low\\-tide mark, since the Crown has sovereign rights (*Shetland Salmon Farmers Association v Crown Estate Commissioners* 1991 SLT 166\\).\n\nIn land registration, a boundary marked on a cadastral map is not taken as authoritative when the underlying geographical feature moves. That's in the [Land Registration Act 2002, section 61(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/61) for England and Wales, and the [Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2002, sections 66](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/66) and [73(2\\)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/73) in Scotland. Courts have inferred that a boundary coinciding with such a feature is \"meant\" to be this way, even if it wasn't defined like that in words \\- see for example [*Southern Centre of Theosophy Incorporated v The State of South Australia (Australia)* \\[1981] UKPC 41](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_41.html) in the Privy Council. So, even if the map shows my coastal property apparently extending into the large blue area, that is not the real situation \\- it just means that the registries are not required to keep those maps up to date when the waters shift.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In England and Wales, a landowner's property borders the sea. Due to gradual sea level rise over several years, part of the land that was previously above the high tide mark is now regularly submerged at high tide. What is the legal status of this newly submerged area?\n\nA) The landowner retains full ownership rights to the submerged area, as their original property boundaries remain unchanged.\nB) The submerged area becomes part of the foreshore, owned by the Crown, but the landowner is entitled to monetary compensation for the lost land.\nC) The submerged area becomes Crown property, and the landowner's property boundary shifts to the new mean high water mark without compensation.\nD) The landowner and the Crown enter into a shared ownership agreement for the submerged area, with rights divided equally between them.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, in cases of gradual changes to natural boundaries like coastlines, property rights follow these changes. As sea levels rise, the mean high water mark moves inland, and the Crown's ownership extends accordingly. The landowner's property boundary shifts to the new mean high water mark without any entitlement to compensation. This follows the principle of alluvion and diluvion for slow, natural changes to boundaries. Option A is incorrect because property boundaries do change with sea level rise. Option B is wrong because no compensation is provided for this type of natural change. Option D is incorrect as there is no provision for shared ownership in this scenario - the boundary simply moves."

It combines two crucial elements: 1) A dated copy of the terms of service, which shows the exact agreement at the time of alleged acceptance, and 2) Expert testimony that users must accept these terms to access certain parts of the site, with no evidence of significant changes to the user flow. This scenario addresses the court's need for evidence of both the content of the agreement and the user's action of acceptance.\n\nOption A is weaker because the admission of significant changes to the user flow could cast doubt on the reliability of the expert's testimony about past user actions.\n\nOption B is problematic because without the specific terms from the time of alleged acceptance, the website owner cannot prove what the user agreed to.\n\nOption D is the weakest because it relies on implied consent, which is generally not sufficient for click-wrap agreements where explicit acceptance is expected."

What is the law about religious holidays and public schools?\n\nWhat if some of the students gave dirty looks to other students who didn't bring presents? Is that permitted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law of Texas is controlled by federal law, viz. the First Amendment. [This item](https://www.aclu.org/other/joint-statement-current-law-religion-public-schools) by the ACLU summarizes what that law is. Regarding your concern, public schools are not required to be \"religion\\-free zones\". Individuals have the right to hold and express their religious beliefs, or their lack of such beliefs, as long as it is contextually appropriate. That is, you don't get to invoke the First Amendment in the middle of a math lesson in order to engage in a rant. Students are allowed to try to persuade others to believe whatever they want, and students are allowed to be snarky about people who don't share their beliefs. Schools can teach about religion as part of the curriculum, though they cannot teach religion. It is okay to teach the historical fact that some guy decided based on the Bible that the world was created 10,000 years ago, but it not not okay to teach as a scientific fact that the world was created 10,000 years ago.\n\nAlthough I can't name a specific movie about Christmas that would be plainly objectionable to a non\\-Christian, we could assume that there is some such movie which is plainly advocacy of a religious viewpoint and which mocks Yazidism. A Yazidi student could then be excused from this movie, just as Christian students could be excused from attending an analogous Yazidi\\-advocating movie.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A public school decides to show a movie about Christmas traditions and allows students to exchange gifts. Some students give disapproving looks to those who don't participate. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) The school is violating the First Amendment by promoting Christianity and must cancel the event.\n\nB) The school can show the movie and allow gift exchange, but must prevent students from expressing disapproval of non-participants.\n\nC) The school can proceed with the event, but must provide alternative activities for non-Christian students.\n\nD) The school can show the movie and allow gift exchange, and students are free to express their opinions about others' participation or non-participation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, public schools are not required to be \"religion-free zones.\" Teaching about religious holidays and traditions is permitted as long as it's done in an educational context rather than promoting a specific religion. Students are allowed to express their beliefs and opinions, including disapproval of others, as long as it doesn't disrupt the educational environment. The school isn't obligated to prevent students from giving \"dirty looks\" to non-participants. Option D most accurately reflects the balance between allowing religious-themed activities in an educational context and protecting students' freedom of expression."

By identifying B as the driver, A can avoid personal liability for the tickets. Additionally, pursuing legal action to recover costs is within A's rights as the legal owner of the bike.\nD) Cancelling insurance and ignoring tickets is not a responsible or legal solution and could lead to further complications for A.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the importance of properly addressing the tickets and taking appropriate legal steps to resolve the situation, which aligns with the advice given in the original response."

The author died in 1980, so copyright in the US will expire on January 1, 2051 (1980 + 70 years, then to the end of the calendar year).\n\nIn Uruguay, copyright duration is the author's lifetime plus 50 years. The author died in 1980, so copyright in Uruguay expired on January 1, 2031 (1980 + 50 years, then to the end of the calendar year).\n\nAs of 2023, the book is still under copyright protection in the United States but has entered the public domain in Uruguay. This question tests understanding of different copyright durations across countries and the concept of public domain."
