There is no law against taking a picture of a child who is entirely naked or exposing certain body parts. The laws in question such as [18 USC 2251](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2251) refer to the fact that the minor \"engage\\[s] in, any sexually explicit conduct\". Sexually explicit conduct is defined in [18 USC 2256](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256), and would include \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\" (which does not include nipples of anyone). Federal law does not define \"lascivious\", but the ordinary meaning of the word does not include the situation that you describe. The Justice Department, which goes after child pornographers, provides [this guide to federal child porn laws](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography).\n\n[Georgia's child porn law](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-12/article-3/part-2/16-12-100) is only marginally different, referring to \"Lewd exhibition\" rather than \"Lascivious exhibition\" , and including the \"Condition of being fettered, bound, or otherwise physically restrained on the part of a person who is nude\" (so a picture of a person holding a naked baby would technically qualify, but is highly unlikely to be prosecuted as production of child porn).\n\nThese laws pertain to any form of child porn, including \"private use only\".

The key elements are the suggestive poses and deliberate focus on genitals, which could be considered a \"lascivious exhibition\" as defined in 18 USC 2256.\n\nThe correct answer is D because it involves the intentional sexualization of minors, which is the core concern of child pornography laws. The other options describe non-sexual situations that, while involving partially unclothed children, lack the element of sexual exploitation required for classification as child pornography."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46366/given-the-doctrine-of-contra-proferentem-wouldnt-it-be-better-for-the-non-draft", "docs_id": 46366, "title": "Given the doctrine of Contra proferentem wouldn&#39;t it be better for the non-drafting party to not point out ambiguity?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is a follow up to [If a party says something about interpretation of contract, is it binding?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38269/if-a-party-says-something-about-interpretation-of-contract-is-it-binding) Since courts usually interpret an ambiguous term [in the favor of the party that did not draft it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem), why would the non\\-drafting party want clarification?

As a tenant, the person living in the apartment is generally not responsible for building maintenance issues like leaks, unless their lease specifically states otherwise or they were negligent (e.g., allowing the bathtub to overflow). The landlord, as the owner of the unit, is typically responsible for maintaining the property and fixing issues like leaks. \n\nAdditionally, since the leak caused damage to the downstairs neighbor's property (even though they opened their own ceiling), the source of the damage (the leak) came from the landlord's property. Therefore, the landlord would likely be responsible for repairing both the leak and the neighbor's ceiling.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the tenant is not responsible for building maintenance. Option B is partially correct about the landlord's responsibility for the leak, but incorrect about the ceiling repair.

Religious organizations, as private employers, have significant latitude in setting employment policies that align with their religious beliefs and values. While there are some protections for employees' off-duty conduct in certain states, generally, private employers can restrict their employees' speech, even outside of work, particularly when it conflicts with the organization's core beliefs or mission.

Everett WA has [local ordinances](https://www.codepublishing.com/WA/Everett/html/Everett10/Everett1024.html#10.24.010) against \"lewd conduct\" (there are versions of this at the state level and in most municipalities). Having sex and masturbation are included in the class of \"lewd acts\", and are also included in \"sexual conduct\". An activity is \"obscene\" if three things are true. First, \n\n> the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would\n>  find, when considered as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n\nand\n\n> when considered as a whole, and in the context in which it is used,\n>  lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nI think having sex or masturbating could pass these two tests. The third condition is that the act\n\n> explicitly depicts or describes patently offensive representations or\n>  descriptions of... \\[sex, masturbation, or excretion]\n\nThe prohibition is more narrow:\n\n> A person is guilty of lewd conduct if he or she intentionally performs\n>  any lewd act in a public place or under circumstances where such act\n>  is likely to be observed by any member of the public.\n\nIf lewd conduct were completely illegal, you could not excrete or have sex withing the city limits. Now we have to turn to the definition of \"public place\":\n\n> an area generally visible to public view, and includes streets,\n>  sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots,\n>  automobiles (whether moving or not), buildings open to the general\n>  public, including those which serve food or drink or provide\n>  entertainment and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings\n>  and the grounds enclosing them, and businesses contained in structures\n>  which can serve customers who remain in their vehicles, by means of a\n>  drive\\-up window\n\nFocusing not on the probable intent but on the words, it is primarily defined as \"an area generally visible to public view\". Your house *qua* building is probably generally visible to public view, as is a public toilet or hotel. The inside of your bedroom is probably not generally visible to public view, nor is the inside of a toilet stall. While the building is probably a public place, a closed stall within the building does not meet the definition (nor does a hotel room). It *might* however qualify under the clause \"or under circumstances where such act is likely to be observed by any member of the public\". The statute does not give a definition of \"observe\", but under ordinary language interpretation, observation may be seeing or hearing. Silent sex, masturbation or defecation might not qualify as being public. \n\nObviously, excretion in a stall of a public bathroom cannot be a lewd act, presumably because the average person does not generally consider ordinary excretion as appealing to the prurient interest: but there could be contexts where it does.\n\nAnother avenue for prosecution is the [Indecent Exposure](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.88.010) state law which is when one\n\n> intentionally makes any open and obscene exposure of his or her person\n>  or the person of another knowing that such conduct is likely to cause\n>  reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nIt is totally non\\-obvious that sex or masturbation in a toilet stall is \"open\". There is a slippery slope regarding quiet sex or masturbation w.r.t. knowing that the conduct is likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nBecause the contexts where sex and masturbation are not clearly spelled out by statutory law, the matter would depend on how courts had interpreted previous cases. There have been arrests in Washington of people having bathroom sex, but I don't know if anyone has ever or recently\\-enough been convicted for having quiet sex out of view in a toilet stall, or similar place. There is a potentially applicable case, [Seattle v. Johnson](https://casetext.com/case/seattle-v-johnson), 58 Wn. App. 64, which seems to involve public sex, and the conviction was overturned because the complaint was defective, in not including the element \"that the defendant must know 'that such conduct is likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm'\". It is not clear from the appeal what the act actually was \u2013 it probably was for public nudity. There is also an decision by the state appeal court division 3 (not publicly available) in Spokane v. Ismail which, in connection with a charge of public urination declares that \"A toilet stall is not a public place. The center of Riverfront Park during the lunch hour is a public place\", in connection with an ordinance just like the Everett one against public lewd acts."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given legal documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Washington state, which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to be considered illegal under lewd conduct or indecent exposure laws?\n\nA) A couple having loud sex in an unlocked public restroom stall\nB) An individual quietly masturbating in a locked public restroom stall\nC) A person urinating in the middle of a public park during lunchtime\nD) Two people engaging in sexual acts in a parked car on a busy street\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the least likely to be considered illegal based on the information provided.

Investigation to that point had revealed that the decedent had jumped from the top of a ten\\-story building with the intent to commit suicide. (He left a note indicating his despondency.) As he passed the 9th floor on the way down, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, killing him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the 8th floor level to protect some window washers, and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this.\n> \n> \n> Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even if the mechanism might not be what they intended, is defined as having committed suicide. That he was shot on the way to certain death nine storeys below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to homicide, but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands.\n> \n> \n> Further investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9th floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. He was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight. Therefore, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife, and the pellets went through the window, striking the decedent.\n> \n> \n> When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.\n> \n> \n> But further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal accident. That investigation showed that the mother (the old lady) had cut off her son's financial support, and her son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.\n> \n> \n> Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, Ronald Opus himself, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered.

The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. **He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.**\n\nThere's a riddle that many people who are teaching gun safety courses like to ask their class to drive the point home early: \"How can you tell if a gun is unloaded? Answer: The Gun is always loaded!\" The point here is that one should never, ever treat a gun as if it is unloaded. Always assume that it is loaded and ready to be fired, and will destroy the thing it is pointed at. Because of this, in the United States, the act of pointing a gun at someone in a threatening manner (and without affirmative defense of self\\-defense) constitutes an assault **even if the person pointing the gun knows it's not loaded, inoperable, or not even a real gun.** So the husband, by dint of the fact that he pointed a gun that the wife reasonably believed was a work, albeit unloaded, gun at her, had assaulted his spouse (assault need not include physical harm aka Battery but only the threat of physical harm, by most legal definitions.).\n\nIn addition, in U.S. common law, there is a provision called \"Felony Murder\" in all jurisdictions. This legal concept states that if, while in the comission of a felony crime, someone dies, you are guilty of 1st Degree Murder (if the crime is a misdemenor, you are guilty of \"Misdemenor Manslaughter/3rd degree murder). This is not something you want to face because you need not prove that you killed the person but that you committed a crime and someone in proximity to this act died (The classic example is a bank robber yells \"this is a stick up! Nobod move unless I tell you. Teller, give me all the money in the vault!\" and after saying this, a little old lady who was there to deposit her social security check has a fatal heart attack and dies. Even though the robber didn't even point the gun at her, he is now guilty of Felony Murder because she died while he robbed the bank. Doesn't matter if her heart attack was induced by the excitement of the situation or she didn't get proper medical attention because EMS will not enter a hostile situation until the police clear it or that her heart attack had nothing to do with this.). Thus, because the Husband was committing a felonious crime (assault) upon his wife, the fact that the man jumping had the misfortune of being at the wrong place at the wrong time does not matter. The Husband murdered the man with intent because he intended to assault his wife by threatening her with his gun and thus is liable for the legal consequences related to that crime. Intent to committ murder does not factor here.\n\nWhat's more, at trial this is easy to prove as the investigating officers would be able to testify that the husband and wife both told them at the scene that they believed the gun was unloaded (Stupid but not a crime) when he pointed the gun at her (stupid and a crime).\nThis is not a violation of hearsay as statements against the opposite party's interests are admissable under U.S. rules of evidence. The Husband would not be required to testify as he has a fifth amendment right against self\\-incrimination and the prosecution could not call the wife under spousal\\-immunity privilege (unless she waived it), but this is something their attorney would need them to try and refute.\n\nFurthermore, the cornor would likely not rule this a suicide unless he/she learned of the details of the man's death prior to or during the course of the autopsy. There would be trace evidence (glass from the window) or lack of trace evidence (lack of Gun Shot Residue) to lead the cornor to conclude the fatal injury was a gun shot, not a suicide by jump. I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure the two injuries look nothing alike.\n\nAdditionally, there are cases that would come into play even if somehow the fall (and not the sudden stop) killed our jumper. As a general rule, it's murder if you inflict a fatal injury to what you reasonabley believe to be a dead person that is infact a living person (or if you inflict a seemingly fatal injury to what you reasonably believe to be a living person that is in fact a dead person), so the fact that the jumper was going to die no matter what doesn't mitigate that the death by fall was not what killed him.\n\nFinally, as crazy as it may seem, humans have survived falls from greater heights. There are multiple recorded instances of people who tried to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge (the second most popular suicide spot in the world) and seemingly miraculously lived to tell of the experience. The deck of the Golden Gate bridge is 245 feet from the water's surface, which makes this a fall from 23 stories up, more than double the building height in this scenario. As a general rule, it's a good bet someone jumping from 10 stories (108 feet) will die, it's not a garentee as we have multiple survivors who jumped from 245 feet and lived.\n\nIn conclusion, Coronors do not work that way, nor does the law. The only thing saving the man from conviction is a sympathetic jury that finds that it's not illegal to accidentally kill a man who is in the process of committing suicide. Given the facts of this case, I find it hard to get twelve people to sympathize with the man, but hey, stranger things have happened."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Ronald Opus, if the elderly man who fired the shotgun was charged with a crime, what would be the most appropriate charge under U.S. common law, assuming the facts as presented?\n\nA) Manslaughter, because he did not intend to kill Ronald Opus\nB) Assault, because he only intended to threaten his wife\nC) Felony Murder, because a death occurred during the commission of a felony (assault)\nD) Accidental death, because he believed the gun was unloaded\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) Felony Murder. Under U.S. common law, the concept of Felony Murder states that if someone dies during the commission of a felony crime, the perpetrator is guilty of first-degree murder. In this case, the elderly man was committing assault (a felony) by pointing a gun at his wife in a threatening manner, regardless of whether he believed it was unloaded. The fact that Ronald Opus died as a result of this felony, even though he was not the intended target, makes the elderly man liable for Felony Murder.\n\nA) is incorrect because manslaughter typically involves a death caused by criminal negligence or recklessness, but not during the commission of a felony.\n\nB) is incorrect because while assault did occur, the resulting death elevates the charge to Felony Murder.\n\nD) is incorrect because the belief that the gun was unloaded does not negate the fact that pointing a gun at someone is still considered assault, and the resulting death during this felony leads to a Felony Murder charge."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58719/what-is-the-legal-understanding-of-institutional-racism", "docs_id": 58719, "title": "What is the legal understanding of &#39;institutional racism&#39;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is racism and there is institutionsed racism.

It is also unlawful to discriminate on the basis of race in several other situations, such as jury service, law enforcement actions, and official governmental business. There are similar prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age. Some states or localities add additional classes that are protected against discrimination and some add additional situations where protection id available.\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of race is prohibited regardless of whether the motive is individual or institutional racism. From a legal standpoint, there is no difference. However, if institutional racism is know to exist in a particular setting, or can be proved to exist, that might be evidence which will help to prove that a particular action was racial discrimination.\n\nNote that it is not illegal in the US to discriminate on the basis of race where no anti\\-discrimination law applies, nor to discriminate against people on a basis that is not a protected class (for example against left\\-handed people). Such actions may incur public disfavor, but not legal redress.\n\nSo (in the US at least) there really is no \"legal understanding\" of *institutional racism* or indeed of *racism* in any form. There is only the legal concept of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.

It's an efficiency apartment in the basement of my girlfriend co\\-workers house. Prior to us living there the space was used as an office and work space for a dog grooming business (there is a very small bedroom, bathroom, shower and another room kept constantly locked because they're growing pot in it, supposedly legally.) We are not allowed to have anything in the main entry way because they still come down frequently to tend their marijuana plants and occasionally wash dogs. The lease is for a set duration of time (through the end of July).\n\nThey did not provide us with a copy of the lease agreement, although we asked, and my understanding is that any part of a lease that violates tenant law is unenforceable.\n\nFrom memory, I recall the lease stating that they may enter the unit whenever they wish with or without notice, that although they are permitting us to have our 2 cats, in situations where they need to use the unit for dog washing, the cats are to be confined to the small bedroom. Also that they may, at any point, with our without cause, terminate the lease, at which point we must vacate within 5 days.\n\nThe \"landlord\" isn't exactly the nicest of people, and the floor/ceiling is extremely thin, so every small noise from the main house is heard in our living area, yet we're expected to stay extremely quiet. We constantly hear him shouting and swearing at his young (10 or 11 year old) son and his two large dogs sound like elephants walking around above us.\n\nTo put the icing on the cake, today I came home and was immediately greeted with anger because I left the bedroom door open for the cats and they needed to wash a dog, something they told me they were going to do yesterday. While I was trying to apologize for the misunderstanding, the landlord lost his temper, swearing and shouting at me to \"shut my f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* mouth\", then proceeded to threaten to \"knock my b\\*\\*\\*\\* a\\*\\* out\" and ended by telling me that I needed to \"get the f\\*\\*\\* out, but my girlfriend could stay\". Through all of this, I was denied entry to my living area because the landlord's girlfriend was washing a large and unfriendly dog.\n\nI'm very sorry for the long winded post.

Growing pot without a license (they do not have one: it cannot be grown at home, and certainly not if there is a minor present) is not legal, not even in Seattle (medical marijuana now requires a general marijuana license, and home\\-grown is not legal \u2013 some Dept. of Health pages don't reflect the new law).\n\nUnder [RCW 59\\.18\\.065](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.065), the landlord must provide a copy of the executed agreement to each tenant, and a replacement copy on request.

If there is such a clause in the lease then that would be allowed, but they can't now decide that they have this right (the terms of a lease can't be changed in the middle).

According to the information provided, Border Patrol officers can intervene in crimes they witness, even if they're not directly related to border control. However, most theft cases would be prosecuted under state law, not federal law. Federal theft laws typically only apply in specific contexts, which may not be relevant in this scenario. The Border Patrol officer can detain the suspect, but unless the theft violates a specific federal statute, the case would likely be turned over to state authorities for prosecution.

On September 2nd we visited a property in the area we will be moving to and we really liked it. After getting the info for the available units from the woman in the office we then went online to apply.\n\nWe applied for a specific unit, lets just say unit \\#1A for example. We completed the entire application and paid the application fees and the 'Holding/Starting Security Deposit'(this is the exact wording from the page where we agreed to pay. \n\nWe found out 2 days late that we had been approved and I was sent what I would call the welcome packet. These documents specify that we need to have renters insurance and how and when to switch the electric to our names. I also includes a list of the fees paid. On this list is says 'Application Fee Per Applicant: $60x2 PAID' and 'Administration Fee: $150 PAID'. I noticed here that it now says 'Admin Fee' and not Deposit, but didn't much of it. \n\nThe next day I received an email saying the lease was ready for us to sign. So I logged in to take a look. When I opened it I noticed that the unit number had changed to unit \\#B2\\. I was very confused by this so I called the office, and this is what I was told.\n\nThe unit we had applied for and been approved for was actually a renovated unit and we did not apply for a renovated unit. I told the lady that this did not seem right of them to just change the unit on us like this. She told me that we could have the original unit if we agreed to pay the higher price, which is out of our budget. She said that it was IT's fault that it had been listed wrong and that it was now fied.\n\nAfter I hung up with her I went to their website to check and sure enough the unit \\#A1 was still listed for the same price we had applied for and been approved for but now with a different availability date. \n\nI have done some looking and it seems to me that since we paid what I was told when paying the fee was the the deposit that they can not switch the unit on us. \nI have been trying to get ahold of the office now for 2 days with no answer. Plus watching their website and the unit \\#A1 is still listed for the same price now with another different availability date. They know we are moving from out of state and I do not remember the unit \\#B2 being listed as available when we did our application. \n\nSo I guess my questions are: \n1\\. What should I do? \n\n2. Can they do this, switch the unit like that?\n3. Should I try to push for the original unit \\#A1? I'm worried if I do this they will treat us horribly during our lease.\n4. Should I try to get my money back?\n5. If I decided to go with the new unit they assigned should I be worried about them trying to pull off shady stuff?\n\nI really don't know what to do but they don't seem to be trustworthy. But I need somewhere to live in two weeks.\n\n**UPDATE**: I spoke to the woman in the office finally yesterday(9/12\\) she told me that her manager would call me later but I was not contacted. \n\nInstead she called me back later and said they will just give me the original unit and renovate the other instead. \n\nHowever when I checked last night and again just now my lease papers still say the second unit and the original unit is still listed as available for the same price I applied for it at. \n\nAlso I do have proof that according to their payment system I agreed to pay the Holding/Starting Security Deposit not the Admin Fee.

You could ask for a return of the other fees as well, but you are less likely to be successful. They would probably have trouble enforcing a security deposit against you if you didn't have a lease with them, and would probably have trouble demanding you sign a lease when they changed the unit.\n\nYou should probably get it all back, because you applied for it, but it probably isn't worth litigating over.\n\nI would also encourage you to turn to social media sites if they have one, or to sites like Yelp, if they do not.

To arrive at any other outcome, they both must agree to a new contract. One could argue that no new contract was agreed to for two separate reasons:\n\nFirstly, the request to \"approve by signing next to the copyright statement\" is not very specific, understandable contract language that unambiguously is intended to transfer the copyright to the collager. Whether the specific language the collager used to make the new proposal is indeed a contract is debatable. A contract requires \"mutual assent\", which is tested legally by how a \"reasonable person\" would interpret the contract \\- it's far from guaranteed that most reasonable people would interpret the correspondence as a mutual decision intended to transfer copyright.\n\nSecondly, a contract requires *consideration* \\- one cannot enter into a contract where one side gets unilateral benefit and the other side gets nothing whatsoever. Even if the language used would constitute terms specific enough for a contract, there is certainly no consideration involved \\- the collager is proposing that they get the copyright to the collective work, while the artist gets nothing. Because there is no consideration for the artist, it is not a valid contract.\n\nFor these two reasons (especially the second one), the artist has a strong case that they have not entered into any other contract or contract amendment other than what they originally agreed to, which states that the artist owns the copyrights to both the original and collective works.

Child pornography is strictly illegal to view, possess, or distribute.\n2.

Voyeuristic recordings are illegal to make or distribute, but the law does not specifically criminalize viewing them unless the viewer knows they were obtained illegally and participates in their distribution.\n\nThe key point is that a viewer cannot always reasonably know the origin or legality of online pornographic content.

To legally accept donations as a charity, the organization must first comply with federal law by establishing itself as a non-profit charitable organization, typically under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This federal registration allows the charity to accept donations from any state.

The most robust of these is California's [Leonard Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Law), which essentially requires private schools to adhere to the First Amendment.

Some other states offer limited protections, but Texas is not mentioned as one of them.

The most recent famous example that I know of would be how the Nazi party used the [Enabling Act, 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933) and [Reichstag Fire Decree, 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree) to amend the constitution by essentially neutering all the safeguards, and used force to ensure that they could stay in power. [Julius Caesar's reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_reforms_of_Julius_Caesar) follow in a similar vein.\n\nFor someone to successfully force change like this, you generally need a political system that is unstable and has no strong (or at least effective) checks and balances. Additionally, you need the support of the military because otherwise they will generally support the existing structure.\n\nOther less extreme examples I can think of where a system has changed to another system would be former colonies adopting new constitutions (e.g. [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland) and [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan_of_1956)), or where there has been significant change in the country's model (e.g. [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Constitution_of_1993)).

Similarly, without a constitution, there may not be a requirement for a supermajority to change fundamental laws (option D). \n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects the real-world constraints that would likely prevent a majority party from canceling elections indefinitely. Even without formal constitutional barriers, a government attempting such a move would face significant resistance from:\n\n1. Public opinion: Citizens would likely protest against the loss of their democratic rights.\n2. International pressure: Other countries and international organizations would condemn such actions and potentially impose sanctions.\n3.

In light of Google v. Oracle, it *seems* like that claim is no longer valid. Is my interpretation correct, or am I missing something? Obviously, anyone can sue anyone for anything, but in light of the SCOTUS decision it seems that if the author of a GPL library were to bring suit against another for using the API *without the library*, it would probably be easy to get a summary dismissal with that case as the basis.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not settled law: neither the copyright question, nor the fair use question.\n\nIn [*Google LLC v.

We shall ask instead whether Google\u2019s use of part of that API was a \u201cfair use.\u201d Unlike the Federal Circuit, we conclude that it was.\n\nSo, it is an open question whether an API is protected by copyright, but the precedent from the Federal Circuit will be persuasive authority. The Federal Circuit held that the API is protected by copyright and the Supreme Court did not upset that conclusion.\n\nSecond, the factors that led the court to conclude the reproduction of part of the Java API was fair use could turn out another way in another fact scenario. Some of the reasoning seems to generalize, but some seems specific to the Java development ecosystem. Briefly, the court recognized:\n\n* API authorship is a creative process, but is \"functional in nature\"\n* The reproduction was intended to assist interoperability; it was commercial; there was no evidence of bad faith\n* The amount of code taken was a small amount of the entire Java work, an amount consistent with its goals\n* The market harms to Oracle were dubious\n\nMy prediction is that there will continue to be significant case\\-by\\-case uncertainty as to the applicability of the fair\\-use defence in this context.\n\n---\n\nHowever, *Google v.

Instead, they assumed for the sake of argument that the API could be copyrighted, but focused on whether Google's use constituted fair use. The court found that in this specific case, it did. The decision was based on several factors unique to this situation and does not necessarily generalize to all API usage.

For fraud to occur, the perpetrator must have intended to deprive you of your money at the time they asked for it and we have no evidence of such an intent.\n\nLegally, it appears that you have an agreement (possibly a contract) that you would lend the person $200 (if you are in England, why this isn't pounds rather than dollars I can't imagine) and they would repay you the next day. What you have is a delinquent debt that is proving difficult to collect. Not paying your debts is not a crime, so it is of no interest to the police.\n\nAll you can really do is keep chasing the person down and asking for your money.

The situation described is best characterized as a delinquent debt rather than fraud, as there's no clear evidence of intent to deceive at the time of the transaction. It's a civil matter, not a criminal one, so involving the police is not appropriate. While there may be a verbal contract, the small amount ($200) makes legal action through small claims court impractical due to associated costs. The most appropriate course of action is to continue attempting to collect the debt through non-legal means, such as contacting the borrower and requesting repayment.

The first thing to do is get an elementary understanding of the law, perhaps by studying the questions and answers on Law SE. Since wills are not contracts, you would learn that contract law is not an important issue (and eventually you could learn how it does become relevant). The biggest impediment to self\\-drafted contracts and wills is the author's lack of basic understanding of law. Let's say that a reading list for basics of law is a complex separate question.\n\nSecond thing is to understand the importance of jurisdiction: it depends on what country and state you are in. There are specific requirements in each jurisdiction. I will use Washington state for my analysis.

In fact, you should not focus just on wills, you should focus on [probate](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=11), because somebody has to be able to actually do what the will says, so you should consider if you're set your successor up to fail.\nThe third thing to do is get a book relevant for the state \u2013 though here are probably many online sources (here's [one starter](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-write-will.html), which will eventually direct you to [this](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-will-wont-do-29767.html) that includes the advice to not try to write your spouse out of the estate in a community property state).

After checking with the university, they gave us the green light for my friend to work on our hobby game project as the project for that assessment.\n\nThis was fine when it was just my friend, but we now have several other uni students who are now also keen to do work for us on the project (for the same purpose). This obviously brings up concern over intellectual property. If they are providing us with artwork, code and other assets for the project, we would want to potentially use them within the project now and in the future. If we can't, then this whole endeavor provides zero benefit to us.\n\nSo the intention is to have them sign a contract that covers the matters of intellectual property and confidentiality of information (etc.) before they could do any work on the project. However, from what I understand, we need some form of 'valuable consideration', or the contract will not be legally binding. Given that these individuals are doing this work voluntarily and for the purpose of assessment, that seems to complicate things a lot, since there will be no monetary remuneration involved.\n\nAs I understand it, 'valuable consideration' doesn't have to be monetary.

In this scenario, the opportunity for students to complete their course assessment by working on a real-world project is likely to be considered valuable consideration. This aligns with the concept that consideration can be anything of value to the parties involved, including opportunities or experiences that benefit their academic or professional development. Options B and C are not applicable in this situation as the question states there is no monetary remuneration or promise of employment. While option D might be a nice gesture, it's not likely to be considered substantial enough to constitute valuable consideration in a legal context."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85694/ive-left-the-united-states-what-happens-if-i-dont-pay-rent", "docs_id": 85694, "title": "I&#39;ve left the United States, what happens if I don&#39;t pay rent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: * I'm not a US citizen.\n* I have a rental contract for a shared student accommodation (en suite room).\n* Due to unforeseen personal circumstances, I had to leave the US.\n\nOf course, I understand that I am legally obliged to honor the contract.

Then the aggrieved party will have to collect, but the court in Washington (to invent a jurisdiction) can't enforce an order against a person in Norway (to invent another jurisdiction). So the aggrieved party would need to take enforcement of the judgment to the Norwegian courts. In the actual case of Norway, this is fairly simple, you just call an attorney in Norway to do the paperwork. It might be harder if the other jurisdiction is Belarus.\n\nIf you return to the US, even if there is a money judgment against you for the rent owed, you will not be arrested for that debt. Depending on the state (about half of the states), you might be arrested for failing to comply with a court order to pay the debt. The difference lies in refusing to comply with a court order, versus simply having a debt.\n\n[The State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/waivers.html) conveniently lists the reasons for denying a visa. Owing money or having an uncollected judgment against you is not one of the possible reasons, in fact even having been ordered by a court to pay, ignoring the order, and the court issuing an arrest warrant does not make you inadmissible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A non-US citizen student rents accommodation in the US but has to leave unexpectedly due to personal circumstances.

The landlord can indeed obtain a default judgment in a US court if the student doesn't appear to defend themselves. However, enforcing this judgment in the student's home country can be challenging and depends on the specific jurisdiction and its legal cooperation with the US.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the student can still be held legally responsible, even if they're in another country.

The ban could be enforced through multiple strategies, not just by analyzing transmitted data. These could include:\n\n1.

That said, it does not only apply to companies based in an EU country. According to Article 3, you will be affected if you are a data controller or data processor and any of the following apply:\n> \n> \n> * you are established in the EU (or somewhere else subject to EU law), or\n> * you offer goods or services to individuals in the EU, or\n> * you **monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU.**\n\nWhat does the last point here, \"monitor behaviour of individuals in the EU\", mean?\n\nLet's say, for basic functionality of a website, some rudimentary use of cookies is required to make the UI function as expected. Would that amount to \"monitoring behaviour\", because some UI state information might be saved in cookies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The text from Article 3 of [the regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) is:\n\n> 2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.\n\nArticle 3 is about the scope of the regulation. This particular question is clarified by [Recital 24](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-24/) (emphasis added).\n\n> 1 The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. 2 In order to determine whether a processing activity can be **considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects**, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\n\nThe point of all this is that if you are collecting data about someone who is currently in the EU then the GDPR applies to you, regardless of where you are. The \"currently in the EU\" bit is significant: the GDPR doesn't apply if you collect data about the activities of an EU citizen who happens to be currently in the US, but it does apply to a US citizen who is visiting the EU. The term \"behaviour\" is used to distinguish data about what someone is currently doing from static data such as date and place of birth (which is presumably much more tied to nationality than current location).\n\nBased on this recital, it seems unlikely that some functional cookies constitute \"monitoring\".

The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data of individuals who are physically present in the EU at the time of data collection, regardless of their citizenship. The use of session cookies for basic functionality is unlikely to constitute \"monitoring of behavior\" as defined by the GDPR, especially if they have short expiry times. However, the company should still comply with GDPR for users in the EU as other aspects of data processing might fall under GDPR jurisdiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while functional cookies may not constitute monitoring, other aspects of data processing could still fall under GDPR.\nOption B is too broad, as GDPR doesn't apply to all users globally.\nOption C is incorrect because GDPR is based on the physical presence in the EU, not citizenship."}}
