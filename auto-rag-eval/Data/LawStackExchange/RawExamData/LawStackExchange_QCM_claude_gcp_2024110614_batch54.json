Although this was a year or two ago a question has lingered: at what point in a ceremony, taking place in England and Wales, does the marriage become official?\n\nI'm not concerned with wedding scenes for TV and film because there are precursor steps leading up to the ceremony that would prevent an 'accidental' marriage. I'm also like to know if there are any differences between marriage and civil partnerships.\n\nAll the results my searches have returned are related to what conditions make a marriage legal rather than the point it becomes legal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The celebrant was (hopefully) joking. They (should) know that you can\u2019t get married **accidentally**. Marriage requires genuine consent of both parties which participation in a **rehearsal** denies is there.\n\nTechnically, the parties are married when all the legal formalities are complete. Practically, they are married when they believe they are. \n\nLegally, they are married when the court considering the question in the case decides they are \\- a court would only be doing this if there was some issue that hinged on it and it would look at all the evidence.

The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, \"Technically, the parties are married when all the legal formalities are complete.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because merely exchanging vows and rings, especially in an impromptu setting, does not constitute a legal marriage without proper documentation and formalities.\n\nOption B is a common misconception based on dramatic portrayals of weddings, but the celebrant's pronouncement alone doesn't make the marriage legal without the required formalities.\n\nOption D is a distractor based on the statement \"Practically, they are married when they believe they are.\" However, this belief doesn't create a legally binding marriage without meeting legal requirements.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the legal requirements for marriage, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the distinction between ceremonial acts and legal formalities.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The commercial nature of the channel (monetization through ads) is a critical factor in fair use determination. As stated in the documentation, \"If done for commercial purposes, this is almost surely the deciding factor over others in USA fair use.\"\n\n2. The educational intent, while relevant, does not override the commercial aspect. The documentation explicitly states, \"you can't justify infringing copyright in the material used for teaching when you're getting paid for that teaching.\"\n\n3. The length of the snippet (20 seconds) is not determinative. The documentation notes that \"Copyright infringement suits have been successful when only seconds of the original work were copied.\"\n\n4. The lack of vocals is irrelevant, as the documentation points out that playing the melody on guitar still constitutes infringement: \"The content usage is clear: the video uses the song's melody, and therefore is infringing on copyright.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overemphasizes the educational aspect and short duration, ignoring the commercial nature of the channel.

The insurer would then have the opportunity\nto claim profits on a timely schedule, while the insured could claim the collateral provided by the insurer, if the requirements both parties agreed upon were to be met.\nThe insurance contracts themselves would be initialized, maintained and eventually resolved through a series of transparent open sourced smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially little programs, that run on the blockchain. The can\nbe reviewed by anyone interested.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is it legally necessary to formally record such a relation between two (or more) private persons? With the crypto space currently being so very unregulated, are there even laws applicable to this matter?\n2. How difficult would it be for users of such a service to declare the income generated through anything related to the platform? Would this be regarded\nas a form of self\\-employment, would they have to register a company or any of the likes?\n3. Would the platform itself, being the service provider, have to be registered in any way? The main aim of the platform would of course be income generation.\n\n**Legal accountability:**\n\n1. Would we need to explicitly declare a disclaimer to prevent being sued if a user considers the rejection of their claim unjust?\nSince this is a peer\\-to\\-peer system, the platform itself will mostly be uninvolved in the decision process. Instead this will be the duty of an independant third party comprised of individual users.\n2. Could the platform be held accountable in case of lost user funds? Only if the platform were at fault? (as in, did the platform's source code cause the issue?)\n3. Can a strictly blockchain based platform even be sued? Only if it is legally registered?\n4. Is there an exact legal counterpart as to the role the platform would assume in this system? It provides the framework upon wich the insurance policies are designed, contracts are established\nand payouts are issued. It does not directly take part in insurance business.\n\nFeel free to let me know, if any further clarification is needed.\n\n**Edit:**\nSince jurisdictional specification was suggested, let's assume it to be Switzerland and the U.S.A.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Although crypto space may be little regulated, insurance is in most jurisdictions highly regulated. Any such arrangement would need to comply with current laws on insurance, until and unless modified laws to cover this sort of thing are passed, and then it would need to comply with those.\n2. Tax authorities generally allow one to declare \"other business income\" or \"other investment income\" without forming a legal entity. I cannot say how such income would be classified in any given jurisdiction.\n3. Whether the platform, or some legal entity associated with the platform, would need to be registered will depend on the current laws and regulations governing insurance, and on the way in which teh contracts are structured.\n4. A disclaimer cannot prevent one from being sued. The contracts would need to carefully and explicitly state who is liable for what.\n5. Programs cannot be held accountable for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. If negligence in the creation or operation of a program causes a loss, the operator may well be liable.\n6. Programs cannot be sued for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. It may well be essential to constitute the \"platform\" as a legal entity of some sort. Otherwise its operator will be liable for its actions.\n7. I cannot be sure. I once encountered a somewhat similar system in which insurance was provided by individuals exchanging contracts, so that in a sense each member insured all the others. There was a company that supervised and provided legal and administrative services to the group of individuals, and collected fees for this. That sounds a bit similar to the suggested platform, but I don't know exactly how that company was organized. The system was called \"NJ CURE\".

The correct answer, C, is the most critical challenge because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that \"insurance is in most jurisdictions highly regulated\" and that \"Any such arrangement would need to comply with current laws on insurance.\" This applies even in the relatively unregulated crypto space.\n\n2. Smart contracts are the core of the platform's functionality, as stated: \"The insurance contracts themselves would be initialized, maintained and eventually resolved through a series of transparent open sourced smart contracts.\"\n\n3. The platform operates in two different jurisdictions (Switzerland and USA), which adds complexity to regulatory compliance.\n\n4. Other options, while relevant, are less critical:\n   A) Tax classification is important but secondary to regulatory compliance.\n   B) Establishing a legal entity is necessary but doesn't address the core functionality of the platform.\n   D) A disclaimer, as mentioned, \"cannot prevent one from being sued\" and doesn't solve the fundamental regulatory challenges.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the intersection of blockchain technology, peer-to-peer systems, and highly regulated insurance markets across multiple jurisdictions.

There's a famous case that illustrates this: A\\&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001\\).\n\nA number of record companies successfully sued *Napster* for infringing their various intellectual property rights.\n\nEssentially, the finding came down to the fact that:\n\n* Napster's program (of the same name) allows for the exchange of copyrighted material, ***and*** *Napster* had actual knowledge that specific infringing material was available using its system, and that it did not remote the material (by blocking access to the system or otherwise).\n* Napster did not police the index of files that they maintained, and so were liable for vicarious infringement.\n\nThe longer answer to your question is *it depends*. Based on the Napster precedent, it seems it would depend (at least) on whether: \n\n* the program may have legitimate uses\n* you are aware that it can be used for illegal purpose\n* you have a means of monitoring the activity\n* you have a means of restricting use of the program\n* you financially benefit from the activities of the users\n\nMany developers will include some warning about using the software only for legal purposes.

Napster, Inc. case and their application to a similar but distinct scenario. The correct answer is C because it most closely parallels the situation that led to Napster's liability. By maintaining an index of files without reviewing their contents, the developer is potentially facilitating illegal activities without taking steps to prevent them, similar to how Napster did not police their file index.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, a user agreement alone is unlikely to protect the developer if the software is clearly being used for illegal purposes. Option B would actually be a responsible approach that could help the developer avoid liability, as it shows active monitoring and restriction of illegal use. Option D could potentially increase the developer's liability by knowingly enhancing illegal capabilities, but it's not as directly parallel to the Napster case as option C.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal principles to a new scenario, integrate multiple concepts (dual-use technology, developer responsibility, and legal precedent), and critically analyze the implications of different developer actions in light of the Napster case."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72408/gdpr-compliance-password-protected-documents-in-autorecovery", "docs_id": 72408, "title": "GDPR Compliance - Password Protected Documents in AutoRecovery", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm working with personnel data in my job, including lots of details which I know to be sensitive and most certainly covered by GDPR.\n\nIn order to maintain compliance with the regulations while preserving the ability of our team to work on the same spreadsheets, we have hidden sheets and locked the Excel workbook every time it has been saved.

If not, what are the main problems with viewing them this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. There is a clear distinction between:\n\n* evidence (or testimony), which consists of statements of fact given by witnesses on oath (subject to prosecution for perjury), governed by the rules of evidence, and which the jury is required to consider but not accept (in the sense that a verdict which is not supported by the evidence can be set aside on appeal),\n* submissions, which consist of argument by the lawyers for the parties, which the jury is not required to consider or accept, and\n* directions, which consist of statements of law given by the judge, which the jury is required to accept.\n\nThe jury is required by its oath to follow the law as stated by the judge, even if it is wrong. The remedy for erroneous trial directions (an appeal) is different to the remedy for erroneous evidence (a perjury prosecution in the case of deliberate lies; nothing in the case of innocent errors).\n\nBecause the jury has the power, but not the right, to nullify a charge by disobeying the judge\u2019s directions, there is a sense in which the jury is free to reject the judge\u2019s directions just as it is free to reject evidence. However, this is completely inconsistent with the theory that defines the roles of judge and jury.

The relevant passage is summarised in Lord Devlin's *[Trial by Jury](https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf)* (1956\\), at p 87:\n\n> **Jury\u2019s Power of Acquittal**\n> \n> \n> There may well be cases in which the killing is not in doubt and the formal direction not to return a verdict of manslaughter is therefore tantamount to a direction to return a verdict of Guilty.

As Lord Chief Justice Mansfield put it in 1784: \u201cIt is the duty of the judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in *their power* to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.\u201d Mr. Justice Willes said: \u201cI admit the jury have the *power* of finding a verdict against the law and so they have of finding a verdict against evidence, but I deny they have the *right* to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Justice of Australia held to similar effect in *Gammage v The Queen* (1969\\) [122 CLR 444](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/68.html?context=1;query=gammage;mask_path=), writing:\n\n> \\[The jury] have no right, in my opinion, to return a verdict of manslaughter where they are satisfied of murder. But, as I have said, persistence by them in returning another verdict must ultimately result in the acceptance of that verdict. In that sense, but in no other sense, it is both within their power and, if you will, their privilege to return a wrong verdict.\n\nTo answer Obie 2\\.0's question, the jury has the *power* to ignore the judge's directions, because \u2013 at least at the time Lord Devlin was writing in 1956 \u2013 a verdict of acquittal could not be nullified. However, the jury does not have the *right* to do so because the law requires it to follow the directions.\n\nAs Ed999 observes, the law governing jury trials does vary between jurisdictions. In particular, some jurisdictions (which lack the United States' constitutional [double jeopardy clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause)) now allow for a jury acquittal to be set aside on appeal. However, the fundamental distinction between a witness\u2019s evidence and a judge\u2019s directions was established in England centuries ago, and remains applicable throughout the common law world.\n\nIt is worth specifically mentioning the United States because [jury nullification remains a controversial topic in that jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification_in_the_United_States). However, the basic principle that the jury is legally required to follow the judge\u2019s directions was established in *[Sparf v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparf_v._United_States)*, [156 U.S. 51](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/156/51/case.html) (1895\\), and described by Ginsburg J (albeit in a dissenting judgment) as \u2018conclusive\u2019 in *[Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Motor_Co._v._Oberg)*, [512 U.S. 415](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/415/case.html), 447 (1994\\). In *Sparf*, the opinion of the court was:\n\n> We must hold firmly to the doctrine that in the courts of the United States it is the duty of juries in criminal cases to take the law from the court and apply that law to the facts as they find them to be from the evidence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a high-quality multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A defense attorney is advising a client who believes they have been wrongfully convicted due to the judge's jury instructions.

Which of the following best explains why this approach is legally flawed?\n\nA) Jury instructions are considered submissions, similar to arguments made by lawyers, which the jury is not required to consider.\n\nB) Judges are immune from perjury charges, unlike expert witnesses, making their instructions fundamentally different from testimony.\n\nC) Jury instructions are binding legal directives that jurors are sworn to follow, not subject to evaluation like evidence or testimony.\n\nD) The power of jury nullification allows jurors to legally disregard any part of the trial proceedings, including judge's instructions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the fundamental distinction between jury instructions and witness testimony in the legal system. The correct answer, C, highlights the key point that jury instructions are not a form of evidence or testimony, but rather binding legal directives that jurors are required to follow by their oath.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mischaracterizes jury instructions as submissions, which they are not. Jury instructions are more authoritative than lawyer submissions.\n\nOption B, while touching on a difference between judges and witnesses, does not address the core issue of the nature and role of jury instructions.\n\nOption D is a common misconception.

The transfer was caused by a sophisticated cyber attack on MegaCorp's financial systems. Most creditors were unaware they would receive these funds, which do represent valid debts. However, it's later discovered that one creditor, CredX, had inside knowledge of the planned attack. How would the \"discharge-for-value\" defense likely apply in this complex scenario?\n\nA) All creditors can keep the funds, as the transfers discharge valid debts and most were unaware of the mistake\nB) Only CredX must return the funds, while other creditors can keep them under the discharge-for-value defense\nC) All creditors must return the funds, as the original transfer was fraudulent, invalidating the defense\nD) The court would likely require a partial return of funds from all creditors, based on a pro-rata calculation of harm\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the discharge-for-value defense in a complex, real-world scenario involving cybercrime. The correct answer is C because the fraudulent nature of the initial transfer likely invalidates the discharge-for-value defense for all recipients, even those unaware of the fraud. \n\nThe key factors to consider are:\n\n1. The transfer was initiated by a criminal act (cyber attack), not a mistake by the sender as in the Citibank case.\n2. One creditor (CredX) had knowledge of the fraud, which introduces an element of conspiracy.\n3. The discharge-for-value defense typically applies to mistakes, not fraudulent transfers.\n\nWhile it might seem fair to allow innocent creditors to keep the funds (option A), or to only penalize the knowing participant (option B), courts would likely view the entire transaction as tainted by fraud. This would invalidate the defense for all parties, as the transfer wasn't a valid but incorrect act by the sender.\n\nOption D presents a seemingly equitable solution but doesn't align with how courts typically apply the discharge-for-value defense.

The key principle, as stated in the documentation, is that \"you can't escape existing liability by changing the form of your business.\" \n\nSarah remains personally liable because the sale of the app and the potential cause of the data loss occurred while she was operating as a sole proprietor, before the LLC was formed.

However, over recent months, Medium has become increasingly focused on their own partnerships and internal publications, to the point where it's hard to argue that there is not an ethical conflict of interest. My question is whether there's a legal conflict of interest.\n\n---\n\n**General Idea**\n\nTo put it into general terms, consider three parties, A, B, and C. Party A offers party B and C the opportunity to profit from an operation, where parties B and C are in competition with one another for a finite amount of revenue in a given month (the total available from subscription fees in this case). Further suppose that the operation relies on party C for success (it seems easy to argue that Medium would have trouble surviving if only their own content was on the platform), and that party A provides biased support to party B. Finally, B and C are paid by A, from the revenue generated by the operation, rather than B and C obtaining the revenue directly from the operation's customers.\n\nIn such a scenario, there seems to be both an ethical issue and potentially legal issue. However, I am not familiar with any specific civil statutes that may come into play. Does it appear that the above scenario might violate any specific statute? The one potential reason why Medium might be saved from a valid lawsuit is that an author does not have to pay for the service. However, they are providing support, in their aggregate, through the massive volume of writing that they provide to the platform, without very much chance of being able to actually generate revenue. Precedent from cases involving pyramid schemes may apply here.\n\n---\n\nMichael Seifert raised an interesting question: \"How would this be different from Publishing House A promoting a more profitable Author B instead of a less profitable Author C?\"\n\nThe difference is that the publishing house does not rely on C's work for sales. To continue this analogy, consider a situation where the publishing house put in a request for chapters for an anthology, where the majority of the chapters came from C, and a few came from B. Further suppose that the publishing house paid its authors based on how many sales the respective authors generated, but almost exclusively promoted author B's website that sold the anthology. Even though readers likely would not purchase the anthology, without the chapters provided by C, because of A's disproportionate support of B, C would receive very little of the revenue stream.\n\n---\n\nBlueDogRanch made a point that Medium's terms of services \"says nothing about being fair, or ethical.\" Agreed. Its terms of services say nothing, and therefore it does not say that they reserve the right to unfair, unequal, or unethical, biases. If the terms of service stated that Medium reserves the right to unequal promotion of work regardless of whether it reduces the potential revenue by other authors, then Medium would have a greater chance of winning in court, and greater justification for their actions. However, without such statements, it becomes less certain that one should assume that a content facilitator that provides revenue streams as part of a ***partner program*** would engage in actions that disproportionately shift revenue streams towards their own content. \n\n---\n\nA final point. It seems that in California, an individual must pass the \"ABC\" test, at least when it comes to wage orders. Specifically, Medium's authors do not pass B: *the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business*.

That is where \"legal conflicts of interest\" are worked out. But I'd assume that Medium's lawyers have covered the bases in terms of adhering to state and federal laws that govern their business, their business model of paying authors and changing their business model; and ensure that they have a strong terms of service document for the site, and that document is legally binding for Medium's users.\n\nNow, a disgruntled author could file against Medium, alleging fraud, uncompetitive practices, unfairness, conflicts of interest or anything else and attempt to recover damages for what they allege is a skewed payoff to authors or Medium's self\\-serving policies. That said, authors and Medium are bound by the [Medium Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f). The TOS says nothing about being fair, or ethical, and it clearly states that \n\n> By using Medium, you agree to these Terms.

Wouldn't the suspect be protected by double jeopardy? (the story is set in a jurisdiction where double jeopardy exists)\n\nIs the trial officially over as soon as the judge utters the final decision?\n\nConsider the following cases:\n\n1. The suspect carelessly and accidentally admits the crime in the courtroom right after being cleared, like in the example above (\"thanks, I won't do it again\") Can the decision be altered ten seconds after it's been made? If so, is such a careless utterance enough evidence to do so?\n2.

I did murder your wife, but the trial is over so you can't do anything anymore!\"\n3. Same as 2, but it happens weeks or months after the trial, the suspect boasts in front of witnesses how he did it and got away with it. (and to not make it *only* hearsay, let's assume that the boasting contained actual information which could have been used as a strong evidence)\n\nWould the suspect be protected by double jeopardy? If not, what would be the procedure of doing a retrial or a new trial?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, a person is generally protected from being tried for the same offense twice, but they are not necessarily absolutely \"protected\". If a jury convicts a person but the judge enters a directed verdict of not guilty, the prosecution can appeal that action ([Wilson v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/332/), 420 U.S. 332\\). The reason is that the acquittal could be disposed of on appeal without subjecting the person to a second trial. In contrast, in [Fong Foo v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/369/141/), 369 U.S. 141 the trial judge ordered the jury to enter a verdict of acquittal. The appeals court rejected the judges basis for ordering an acquittal: but Fong Foo was \"protected\" because there could not be a second trial (double jeopardy), and it does not follow that the jury would have convicted but for the judge's order.\n\nThe question reduces to the limited circumstances under which the prosecution can appeal a verdict. For instance, the prosecution can appeal a tre\\-trial motion to dismiss, and since there was no trial, there is no second jeopardy. Within a single jurisdiction, the only circumstance allowing a second trial involves bribery of a judge (Aleman v. [Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/138/302/473725/), 138 F.3d 302\\), where the basis for allowing a second trial is that defendant was not in jeopardy with the first trial.\n\nNew evidence does not override a defendant's protection against a second trial, whether it is new DNA evidence or a confession.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Double jeopardy protection begins as soon as the verdict is entered, which in this case is an acquittal.\n2. The documentation explicitly states that \"New evidence does not override a defendant's protection against a second trial, whether it is new DNA evidence or a confession.\"\n3.

Gonzales* holds that the police do not have a duty to enforce the law that may be enforced by a private party in a civil action. Police instead have broad discretion regarding whether they will or will not take action to enforce a law.\n\nBut, when a police officer does take action affirmatively, this case does not apply. Instead, the question then, is whether the affirmative use of force by the officer was justified by the applicable substantive criminal law.\n\n> If Chauvin had not touched Floyd at all, would Chauvin be protected by\n> *Castle Rock v. Gonzales*?\n> \n> \n> Meaning no attempt at arrest, no confrontation, nothing. Just let\n> Floyd leave with his cigarettes.\n\nYes.

Law enforcement supervisors routinely punish police officers for inaction construing that as being a \"coward\" but are much less likely to punish a police officer for being unlawfully overzealous without strong pressure from civilians in the relevant government agency or local government.\n\nEmpirically, sitting in their car all day is not how police act.

Gonzales decision to a hypothetical scenario. The correct answer is B because Castle Rock established that police have broad discretion in enforcing laws and cannot be held liable for failing to enforce a particular law. The proposed ordinance directly conflicts with this principle by attempting to mandate specific police action and create liability for non-enforcement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the ordinance may seem to promote public safety, it contradicts the legal precedent set by Castle Rock.

The station as a business and the DJ as an individual would have some legal exposure to \"out\" or reveal affairs on the air, so if the show is not a total act, all callers will have signed or agreed to verbal releases which state that all participants are recorded and the outcomes may be unpredictable, the station and the DJ are not liable, etc. One or two party consent for recording and broadcasting will be respected; if they weren't, the station would be sued out of existence.\n\nThe idea that they ask for consent on the air and act like that is required is simply more of the act. 99% of the listeners have no legal training, and the magic word \"consent\" makes the show sound more real and lawful. As above, there *could* be releases agreed to on the phone before the call is switch to broadcast, i.e. *\"do you agree to let us broadcast you and are you aware of this and any ramifications?\"* and that would be recorded by the station for their legal protection.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation strongly suggests that such radio shows are often staged with actors, citing a former DJ's testimony.\n2. The on-air consent request is described as part of the act, designed to make the show sound more real and lawful to listeners without legal training.\n3.

The requirement under that '34 Act is to disclose all material information about the company that a reasonable investor would be influenced by in making an investment decision. There are regulations and there is case law governing what does and does not have to be disclosed, but there is still a great deal of discretion in deciding what to include.\n\nBut if your company fails to disclose information under the '34 Act and an investor sues the company for failing to disclose it, and a judge and jury handling the case determine in the court process that the information had to be disclosed under this vague standard and that someone was harmed economically as a result of the non\\-disclosure, then the company (and often people affiliated with the company) have liability to the people who the court finds were harmed by the non\\-disclosure for securities fraud and that liability cannot be discharged in bankruptcy in most cases (and is also eligible for special treatment in the debt collection process to enforce the judgment).\n\n**Application**\n\n> If I run a publicly traded company that's releasing hardware and that\n> hardware is compromised and customer data is harvested, do I have to\n> publicize that leak's existence?\n\nYou do if it is of a magnitude covered by state law, or if the existence of the leak would be material to an investor in the company's securities (either stock or bonds).\n\n> What if the people that found that data are presumed to be trustworthy\n> and are willing to destroy the data upon payment?\n\nThis depends on the language of an individual state disclosure law at the state level.

Instead, you would have to persuade the court that the damages you endured due to landlord's failure is comparable to his losses for your omission regarding payment of gas.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tenant signed a lease agreement in May with special provisions for the landlord to clear out a back room by August and remove a mounted bed frame. The landlord partially fulfilled these requests but left some furniture and the bed frame. An amendment was added for the tenant to pay for gas starting September, but no bills were sent. If the tenant decides not to renew the lease in September, which of the following best describes the potential legal implications?\n\nA) The tenant can withhold all gas payments due to the landlord's failure to fully clear the room\nB) The landlord cannot pursue gas payments after the lease ends due to failure to send bills promptly\nC) The tenant may be liable for gas payments up to six years after moving out, despite the landlord's partial breach\nD) The tenant's obligation to pay for gas is nullified by the landlord's failure to remove the bed frame\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of contract law and landlord-tenant relationships. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The tenant accepted the amendment regarding gas payments, creating a contractual obligation.\n2. The landlord's partial breach (not fully clearing the room) does not automatically nullify the tenant's responsibilities, especially since it didn't render the unit unsafe or uninhabitable.\n3. Massachusetts has a six-year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims, which would apply to unpaid utility bills unless specific landlord-tenant legislation states otherwise.\n4. The landlord's failure to send bills promptly does not eliminate the tenant's responsibility to pay for agreed-upon expenses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because withholding payments due to the landlord's partial breach would likely be seen as disproportionate. Option B is wrong because prompt billing is not typically a legal requirement that would void the obligation. Option D is incorrect because the failure to remove the bed frame, while a breach, doesn't automatically nullify other contractual obligations.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Extradition is typically granted for specific charges, and countries usually only extradite for acts that are crimes in both jurisdictions (principle of dual criminality).\n\n2. In this case, Country B would likely agree to extradition for the drug manufacturing charge, as it's a crime in both countries.\n\n3.

Rather it defines what is protected by copyright, and specifies some cases in whch a work is not protected. (For nexample, [17 USC 105](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105) provides tht works of the US Federal Government are not protected.) Anything not included in the protection of copyright is in the public domain. This has been confirmed by many cour cases and legal writings. Law generally follows the rule \"Anything not forbidden is allowed.\"\n\n#### Audio as Derivitive Work\n\nAn audio recording of a person reading a text aloud would be a derivative work of that text, and would normally have its own copyright, if created lawfully. (If the recording was of a text protected by copyright, made without permission and outside of fair use, it was not made lawfully and the infringer has no copyright in the recording at all.) But US courts have held that a work created by a mechanical or automatic process, including many computer programs, is not an \"original work of authorship\" and thus is not protected by copyright at all, and is thus in the Public Domain. The case of the \"Monkey Selfie\" is on point. ([\"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, \u00a7 313\\.2\" (PDF)](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf). United States Copyright Office. 22 December 2014\\. p. 22\\. \"To qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being.... Works that do not satisfy this requirement are not copyrightable. The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.\"\n\nMoreover, if the audio were protected by copyright, it would presumably be owned by the person who ran the program, and [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) specifically grants the copyright owner permission to distribute copies.\n\n### Sources\n\n* The [Wikipedia article \"Public Domain\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) reads in relevant part (citations omitted):\n\n> The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply.

According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property. However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The book is in the public domain, meaning copyright protection has expired and anyone can use it freely.\n2. Section 5.e.2 of Google's API terms appears to prohibit selling or distributing content, but the clause \"Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law\" is crucial.

How about services like YouTube(they have income from ads from posted videos)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're talking about sites *like Youtube*, so I'll focus on that.\n\nThat quote, which you bolded, was over\\-simplified. The actual law is\n\n> **17 USC 512 (c) Information Residing on Systems or Networks At Direction of Users.**\n> \n> \n> **(1\\) In general.** A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider\n> \n> \n> **(A)**  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(I)** does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(ii)** in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(iii)** upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;  \n> \n> **(B)** does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and  \n> \n> (C says and complies with a DMCA takedown notice).\n\nWhat you're talking about is membership fees (e.g. [Youtube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium))... or general advertisements that would be placed on **any** video without awareness of it being infringing.\n\nThat does not violate Safe Harbor *per se*. At least not on a legitimate site which is dominated by legitimate content and makes an honest, credible effort to keep it that way.\n\nThe important clause in (B) is \"In a case...\" Under (B), they lack the *ability* to control each activity (upload or view).\n\nYoutube's inability is due to receiving 500 hours (30,000 minutes) of uploaded video *every minute*, obviously requiring 30,000\\+\\+ staff seats working 24x7 to curate. That would amount to about 200,000 staff \\- all of Google is around 50,000 right now.\n\nEven if a small site were able to moderate all content, they might still have a Safe Harbor defense if they could credibly say that they did not know the material was infringing. If someone created a \"Juan Brown\" username and uploaded blancolirio's videos from YouTube, they could say \"we did not know that was not the real person\". *But if the video started with an HBO splash screen and tones, then heck no.*\n\nBut non\\-moderation is not an airtight defense. When sites are neglectful toward removal, they can soon develop a reputation as a haven for such infringing content \\- which the sites tend to embrace, since it brings many customers! This was the undoing of several music sharing sites in the 00's, since this awareness of their reputation, plus a lack of diligent removal, failed them on all three arms of 1(A) above.\n\n---\n\nRemember that a competently run website that relies on user submissions is well aware of the DMCA and its case law, and has tailored its rules and enforcement to make it easy to defend a copyright claim. For instance, in the case of music, Youtube uses some human intervention but largely automated means to either\n\n* take it down and give the uploader a copyright \"strike\" leading to a ban (which alienates their biggest contributors, especially when a popular Youtuber like blancolirio winds up with a distant car stereo in background noise, remember the detection is by \"bot\" and no human ever sanity\\-checks it).\n* de\\-monetize the suspect video (uploader gets nothing, but, neither does YouTube).\n* monetize it, but give the revenue stream to the rights holder due to an agreement with them.\n\nThe last one is Youtube's preference with regards to music. As this was vastly easier, more practical and better for the community all\\-around, allowing whole classes of content to be created that would be *prima\\-facie* illegal otherwise.

The correct answer is D because it directly violates the Safe Harbor requirements outlined in 17 USC 512(c).\n\nOption A (subscription fees) and B (general advertisements) do not necessarily disqualify a platform from Safe Harbor protection. The law specifies that the financial benefit must be \"directly attributable to the infringing activity,\" which is not the case for general revenue streams applied equally to all content.\n\nOption C actually supports Safe Harbor protection, as quick response to takedown notices is a requirement for maintaining the safe harbor.\n\nOption D, however, violates multiple aspects of the Safe Harbor provision:\n1. It implies \"actual knowledge\" of infringing activity (violating 512(c)(1)(A)(i))\n2. It shows awareness of circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent (violating 512(c)(1)(A)(ii))\n3.

You have no obligation to continue using an email account that causes problems for you. Simply abandoning the account is not the wisest choice, since there is some chance that someone may gain access to the account and they do bad things with it. You are not liable for things that others do with your email, but it may be a nuisance to establish that it was someone else who used your account to do bad things. It is possible that, under the terms of service associated with that account, you are not allowed to \"share\" the account.\n\nYour comments contrarily suggests that you want to change the email associated with that electric service account, despite the fact that the company refuses to do it for you, which is also a standard refusal. If so, the alternative question seems to be, can you legally log into that account (assuming that you know the password to the electric account), and change the email address to something else. This would almost certainly be a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, because you are not authorized to access that account \u2013 it's not your account, despite your email address being associated with it. But because it's not your account, you are not responsible for anything arising from his use of your email, and any negative consequences of not keeping the email address up to date fall on him, not you.\n\nA third possibility is that you are actually at least partially responsible for the account, which seems to have been created years ago when you were living together.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. French law, being national legislation, takes precedence over the contractual nature of CC licenses. This eliminates option A and D.\n\n2. The \"droit de retrait\" is a moral right recognized in French intellectual property law, allowing authors to withdraw their work under certain conditions. This supports the artist's ability to exercise this right, ruling out option A.\n\n3. However, invoking the \"droit de retrait\" doesn't completely void the CC license (eliminating option B). The documentation mentions that CC licenses are generally irrevocable, but also acknowledges that they cannot necessarily revoke all of an author's rights, particularly moral rights.\n\n4.

Obviously, tax audits are done by tax collection officials.\n\nIn the United States, financial accounting standards for non\\-profits are primarily set by a private organization controlled by the accounting profession called the [Not\\-for\\-Profit Advisory Committee](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/BridgePage&cid=1351027226246) which provides advise that is usually followed to the accounting profession controlled private [Financial Accounting Standards Board](http://www.fasb.org/home) that defines \"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\" (GAAP) in the United States for the for profit and non\\-profit sectors. This is the main body that sets industry accounting standards particular to non\\-profits and for fund accounting.\n\nThe private sector financial standards set by organizations like the FASC and NAC which are controlled by the accounting profession, are then adopted by reference by public or private organizations that want to specify accounting rules without having to devise them from scratch themselves.\n\nThese financial accounting standards are subject to specific tax law rules set by the IRS (under the Internal Revenue Code, [ERISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act), and related regulations and regulatory guidance) and state tax collection agencies, and by other industry specific regulations.\n\nIn cases where non\\-profits issue publicly held debt, the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or other applicable state and federal securities regulators, and the governing body of any exchange upon which the bonds issued by the non\\-profit are traded can also impose accounting standards. \n\nState probate statute also set some of the accounting standards for non\\-profits such as the rules for distinguishing between principal and interest.\n\nPublic or private donors to non\\-profits usually make grants that condition receipt of grant funds on a right to audit the non\\-profit, and investors in bonds issued by a non\\-profit generally have either a contractual or statutory right to obtain audited financial statements from the non\\-profit as well. These audits would usually be performance by Certified Public Accountants in private practice (and regulated under state administered licensing schemes) who are hired on an audit by audit basis.\n\nIn addition to tax collection authorities, and private people who have audit rights because they have invested in bonds from the entity or have given grants to the entity, **state attorneys\\-general** will generally have broad supervisory authority over non\\-profits including the same kinds of rights with respect to a non\\-profit that a beneficiary of a private trust would have (although sometimes a different official in state government is given this authority). \n\nState attorneys\\-general are given this authority so that there is someone with jurisdiction to oversee the affairs of, and prosecute misconduct in, charitable organizations with no well defined individuals or entities that are permanent beneficiaries of the charities.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A non-profit organization is preparing for an upcoming audit. Which of the following scenarios most accurately represents the complex oversight structure for non-profit financial accounting and auditing in the United States?\n\nA) The IRS is solely responsible for setting accounting standards and conducting all audits of non-profit organizations.\n\nB) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) sets binding legal requirements, which are then enforced through audits conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nC) State attorneys-general have exclusive authority to oversee non-profits and conduct audits, with no involvement from private sector entities.\n\nD) Multiple entities, including private standard-setting bodies, government agencies, and private auditors, play interconnected roles in establishing standards and conducting audits.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The oversight structure for non-profit financial accounting and auditing in the United States is complex and involves multiple entities. The correct answer reflects this complexity:\n\n1. Private organizations like the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its Not-for-Profit Advisory Committee set the primary financial accounting standards (GAAP) for non-profits.\n\n2. These privately set standards are then often adopted by reference by various public and private organizations.\n\n3. Government agencies like the IRS and state tax collection agencies impose additional specific rules related to tax accounting.\n\n4. The Securities and Exchange Commission may impose standards for non-profits that issue publicly held debt.\n\n5. State attorneys-general have broad supervisory authority over non-profits, similar to beneficiaries of a private trust.\n\n6. Private donors and bond investors often have contractual rights to audit non-profits, typically using Certified Public Accountants in private practice.\n\nThis multi-layered system involves private standard-setting, government oversight, and private sector auditing, making option D the most accurate representation.

In medieval times, all educated people in the British isles, not just judges wore robes and these were customs descended from the Gaelic people who originally ruled Britain and Ireland. This custom differed from that of the Romans who wore togas.\n\nThe Gaelic elite wore robes with color signifying rank, black being the lowest rank, that of a docent, the lowest level of a professor. Later, when the Saxons invaded they eventually adopted some of the customs of the Gaels. The culmination of this was the founding of what is now known as Oxford University by [King Alfred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great), the greatest of the Saxon kings. This tradition was preserved and developed at Oxford which affected the dress of all academics, including lawyers and justices.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)\n\n**Thomas More in his regalia typical of an Oxford Don, c. 1500**\n\nThese patterns of dress also were influenced somewhat by Italian clerical styles.

Option D is correct because it accurately captures the multiple cultural influences described in the text. The documentation mentions that the robes have Gaelic origins (with color indicating rank), were adopted and developed by Saxons (particularly through Oxford University), and were also influenced by Italian clerical styles. Importantly, the robes evolved from academic dress rather than being solely a legal tradition.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text explicitly states that this custom differed from Roman togas.

That means that you hold the copyright to the text, and only you can authorize a derivative work (such as a synthesized recording). Therefore, you hold the copyright to the recordings as well. The crucial consideration governing that right is that you \"created\" the work, meaning that there is a [modicum of creativity](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/9413/4501). However, if you did not create the text and your only function is to host an automatic process where users can create a synthesized recording, then whoever created the text has the right to the text and derivative works (i.e. the synthesized output). Automated processes like (unassisted) OCR or wav\\-to\\-mp3 conversion would not count as being \"original\", nor would automatic text\\-to\\-speech, so you don't gain copyright just from making an automatic work\\-creating tool available.\n\nOn the assumption that the conversion involves a component of Chrome, you can use the service per the [terms of service](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/privacy/eula_text.html), though you cannot \"reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services\". This might limit the extent to which you could make this conversion available to others, depending on how, exactly, you could do such a thing (does it duplicate the service?). As they say, Google owns all legal right to the *Services*, but Google obtains no right from you for any content created through their service.\n\nThere is no restriction in the TOS against using the service for commercial purposes.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Users own the copyright to their original text input, as stated in the documentation: \"you hold the copyright to the text, and only you can authorize a derivative work.\"\n\n2. The synthesized audio recordings are considered derivative works of the original text, and thus the copyright belongs to the creator of the original text (the user), not the developer or Google.\n\n3.

The correct answer, C, is the most legally sound and strategically effective approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Intellectual Property Ownership: As mentioned in the documentation, the company likely owns the IP of the software, not the individual developer. Shutting down the company or transferring IP (options A and D) could be legally problematic and potentially constitute fraud or breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n2. Control vs. Ownership: The developer and the cooperative partner together hold a controlling interest (2/3) in the company. This allows them to make key decisions about company management without needing to dissolve the entity.\n\n3. Legal Continuity: Maintaining the existing company preserves legal continuity, existing contracts, and avoids potential complications with transferring assets or IP.\n\n4. Strategic Pressure: By restructuring compensation to favor active directors through fees rather than dividends, the conflicting partner's financial incentives are altered. This creates pressure for them to either become more actively involved or to accept a buyout offer, addressing the conflict indirectly.\n\n5.

And there are also signs and symptoms to conclude whether such abuses happen or not. So why they aren't illegal?\n\nOr perhaps it's more about evidence rather than law? To quote one person:\n\n> There is no finite definition of mental/emotional abuse. No protocols or reference to state what's harsh, excessive, just bad parenting... and there are no legal definitions. Its not like physical abuse where you have concrete signatures.

The correct answer (B) reflects the nuanced role of the judiciary in law reform as described in the documentation. \n\nWhile courts cannot directly change or create new laws (eliminating option A), they can \"develop, clarify, interpret, extend or limit\" existing laws through their rulings. These interpretations, especially from the Supreme Court, create binding precedents that lower courts must follow, effectively reshaping how the law is applied in practice.

[This rather long document](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf) analyzes the notion of \"declaration of war\". The primary significance of a \"declaration of war\" lies in international law, see the [Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907). Articles 1 and 2 say:\n\n> The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves\n>  must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form\n>  either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with\n>  conditional declaration of war\n\nand\n\n> The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers\n>  without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after\n>  the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by\n>  telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of\n>  notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware\n>  of the existence of a state of war\n\nSo if the US were to declare war on Canada, we would need to officially notify the government of Canada of this fact, which we could do because there is a country Canada whose government we can inform. This is not possible with \"terrorism\", which is not a nation. There were official declarations for the War of 1812, against Mexico, Spain, and WW I, WW II (11 declarations). Since \"the South\" was not (from the perspective of \"the North\") a separate country, the United States did not declare war on itself to conduct the Civil War. In fact, since the congressional action authorizing military action against the Algerine Cruisers (the [2nd Barbary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War)) in 1815, the actions authorized by Congress have not used the word \"war\" (except in mentioning a specific law, the War Powers Act), except in the aforementioned declared wars.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The father's guilty plea to illegal entry typically waives his right to further judicial hearings, as stated in the documentation: \"The guilty plea would consent to deportation without further hearing.\"\n\n2. The expedited removal process is likely for the father due to his conviction, which aligns with the information that no further hearings are needed after the guilty plea.\n\n3. However, the presence of the child complicates the situation. Recent policies and court rulings have led to family separations or differential processing for parents and children.\n\n4.

Option B is less likely because the father's guilty plea should expedite his process.

They left the country when the child was a few months old without applying for U.S. citizenship. Now, as an adult living abroad, this person wants to obtain U.S. citizenship and a passport. Given this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the complex legal and procedural situation?\n\nA) The individual is automatically a U.S. citizen and can easily obtain a passport by presenting their birth certificate at any U.S. embassy.\n\nB) The person must first apply for U.S. citizenship through naturalization before being eligible for a passport.\n\nC) The individual is likely a U.S. citizen by birth but may face challenges in proving citizenship and obtaining a passport due to lack of documentation.\n\nD) The situation requires a court challenge to determine citizenship status before any passport application can be considered.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Under the principle of jus soli, individuals born in the U.S. generally acquire citizenship at birth, regardless of their parents' status (with some exceptions for diplomats).\n\n2. However, the lack of documentation beyond a birth certificate complicates the process. The person doesn't have a social security number or other proof of continuous U.S. citizenship.\n\n3. While the individual is likely a U.S. citizen by birth, proving this status and obtaining a passport may be challenging. They will need to provide additional evidence or sworn statements.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because while the person may be a citizen, the process isn't as simple as just presenting a birth certificate.\n\n5. Option B is incorrect because if born in the U.S., the person is likely already a citizen and doesn't need naturalization.\n\n6.

Would it be different if they were going through their own territory, or a third country's, with permission? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a hard question, but a good question. The following relates to the issue from the perspective of the USA.\n\nYou ask \"...if the US wants to invade France, **can** they officially declare war by...\", You have to make clear what you mean by \"can\". If you mean whether or not the US has the physical ability to do this, then of course they do. If you mean whether they are allowed, then this is another question. When you ask whether something is allowed, then you have to make reference to a moral code or a law that determines what is and what isn't allowed (legal). Normally each country will have laws that govern what is and what isn't legal for it's citizens to do. That hard part is how this applies to nations. There are two sides to the question. (1\\) What are the leaders allowed to do under their own laws, (the domestic laws) (2\\) what are countries as entities allowed to do? (the international laws) It sounds a bit like you are asking about the second thing. Here treaties govern what is and what isn't \"legal\". However, usually when someone breaks a law, other entities have the power to enforce that law and decide (judge) whether the person has broken the law. The question is: who decides whether a country has broken a treaty or an international law? And if a law is broken, what exactly can be done about it? This is hard to answer. \n\nConsider for example the conflict in Ukraine. Here many will argue that Russia has piratically invaded Ukraine. There should be war between the nations. But Russia denies this and other world powers have done little beyond imposing sanctions. This illustrates how hard it is to deal with this question.\n\nOne question that comes up is what the purpose of international treaties are if a country can just violate them without much consequence. Pointing out two points about this. (1\\) If, for example, a president wants to convince his/her own congress that the country *should* engage in war, then it makes a stronger point if you can show how the country you want to engage has violated international trities. (2\\) After you have won a war, you might want to prosecute the leaders of the loosing power. Here you will stand stronger if you can make references to some international law that existed before the conflict started. This second point is illustrated in the [Nuremberg principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles). Here it was exactly stated that \"*Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment.*\"\n\n[According to the US constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States) \"Congress shall have power to ... declare War\". That means that historically Congress has the power to decide where to wage war. The [War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) says, for example, that \"[The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities ...](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1542)\".\n\nNote that this doesn't mean that the US has do formally declare war before going to war. Example: [The Iraq War was authorized by Congress, but there never was a formal declaration of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Military_engagements_authorized_by_Congress). \n\nIt is interesting that you ask about the timing for when the declaration should be given. The Japanese wanted to [deliver their declaration of war just before](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/world-war-ii/resources/japan-declares-war-1941) the attack on Pearl Harbor. But because of issues with decrypting the message from Japan to the Japanese Embassy, the [declaration wasn't delivered until after the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_declaration_of_war_on_the_United_States_and_the_British_Empire). \n\nRemember also in all of this that the winning party to a conflict, usually decides what was and wasn't legal!\n\nOne good reference for more on all of this is the report by the Congressional Research Service called \"*[Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf)*\".

Parents also have some level of control over their children spending their own money (not the topic of discussion here).\n\nMy question is: given that once minor children receive a special gift it is theirs and the parents cannot take it, can parents legally *prevent* their minor children from receiving gifts in the first place?\n\nLet's say Grandma wants to give $10,000 to Junior. Could the parents say \u201cNo, Mom. Either give the money to us and we will administer it, or Junior can\u2019t accept the gift at all.\u201d? This is not taking what Junior owns, it's preventing him from owning it in the first place.\n\nIf such prevention can be legally done beforehand, then consider further if the gift has already been accomplished. Perhaps Grandma has *already* placed one hundred crisp 100\\-dollar bills into Junior's hands (or, say she deposits money into his custodial bank account before the parents learn of it). He runs to Mom and displays the cash/balance slip saying, \"look what Grandma gave me!\" Has the gift been irrevocably given at that point, or can the parents require it to be returned or set conditions on the gift at that point, given this is happening the moment they learn of the gift and immediately after the giving?\n\nIf they cannot prevent the ownership against the child's wishes at this point, what if the parents convince the child to give the money back or give the money to them (perhaps operating under a mistaken belief about what is legal, knowingly or unknowingly communicating falsehoods about the situation to their child)? Could the child or the gift\\-giver later claim that the parents stole the money because the child didn't understand his rights at the time? It seems like if the law considers a child competent to receive and own gifted property, the child is competent to also give away such property, and if a child could legally refuse Grandma's gift in the first place (even if foolishly) then he can also give away Grandma's gift after its receipt (even if foolishly).\n\nFocusing more closely on the quoted cases in the original question, one part may be relevant: in [HOBLYN vs. JOHNSON, 2002](https://law.justia.com/cases/wyoming/supreme-court/2002/434232.html) as recorded at law.justia.co (emphasis mine):\n\n> \"As a general rule any property acquired by the child in any way except by its own labor or services belongs to the child, and not to the parent.\" \\[46 C. C. 1314]. . . . It furthermore goes without saying that a parent cannot deprive a child of its property except pursuant to law (31 C. J. 1011\\), and the fact that in this instance the father had the property in question assessed as his property could not affect the title of the children. In Banks v. Conant, 14 Allen (Mass.) 497, it was said: \"In consideration of the duty which the law imposes on a father to furnish adequate support to his child during infancy, the services of the child during that period are due to the father, and, if they are rendered to a third person, the right of the father to recover the value thereof is clear and indisputable. But this is the extent of the father's right. He has no title to the property of the child, **nor is the capacity or right of the latter to take property or receive money by grant, gift or otherwise, except as a compensation for services, in any degree qualified or limited during minority.** Whatever therefore an infant acquires which does not come to him as a compensation for services rendered, belongs absolutely to him, and his father cannot interpose any claim to it, either as against the child, or as against third persons who claim title or possession from or under the infant.\"\n\nRephrasing this more directly, \"the right of the child to receive property by gift is not limited or qualified in any degree during minority.\"\n\nThis would seem to *suggest* that parents may not interfere with gift giving to their children, however it is not clear. Does \"the right to take property or receive money is not limited\" assert that children must be allowed to receive *any* gift at all? Or is this only recognizing that, once given (a process that the parents might legally prevent, but did not), the parents cannot then take the gift after its receipt?\n\nImagine the parents believe all dancing is wrong, and a friend of the child gives him a book on how to breakdance.

Second, the roadblock must be *designed to serve the police officers' efforts closely related to a particular problem regarding vehicles and their mobility.* \n\nA roadblock to test for drunk drivers: valid due to the extent of the problem of drunk drivers. \n\nA roadblock to search cars for illegal drugs: invalid because its only purpose is to detect evidence of a regular crime (in other words, it has nothing to do with driving).\n\n**Addendum to address fixed checkpoints based on comment:**\n\nI came back to this and wanted to expand on the fixed checkpoints, which are checkpoints run by the border patrol inside of the US border. Crossing the checkpoint, a vehicles slow down and officials peer inside. Vehicles may or may not be asked to stop. \n\nBorder officials may operate such checkpoints in order to look inside of crossing vehicles and they may do so [*without a reasonable suspicion*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/543/) that the car includes illegal aliens. They also do not have to be approved in advance, so there is [no prior evidence\\-gathering needed](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html) to put one up. Further, officials can point a car to a secondary pull\\-off location for limited inquiry, also without a reasonable suspicion. It does not require the higher standard because the nature of the secondary pull\\-off search is not as intrusive as that of a roving stop (where the official is part of a roving patrol and may stop vehicles *but does require a reasonable suspicion.*). This decision was justified because of the fact that the nature of smuggling makes finding a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard impractical while not being a great intrusion on Fourth Amendment rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A city police department implements a \"lockdown\" of a 10-block radius following reports of an armed suspect in the area. A local journalist attempts to enter the zone to report on the situation but is turned away by officers. The journalist files a lawsuit claiming violation of First Amendment rights. How might a court likely rule on this case?\n\nA) The lockdown is unconstitutional as it violates freedom of the press and assembly without due process\nB) The lockdown is constitutional due to the immediate public safety concern, overriding First Amendment considerations\nC) The court would require the police to prove the lockdown was the least restrictive means to achieve their objective\nD) The lockdown would be deemed constitutional only if limited to a smaller, more specific area\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced approach courts often take in balancing constitutional rights with public safety concerns. \n\nWhile the lockdown presents a clear First Amendment issue (freedom of press and assembly), courts typically don't make absolute rulings in such cases (eliminating options A and B). Instead, they often apply strict scrutiny to government actions that infringe on fundamental rights. This requires the government to prove that the action is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.\n\nOption D is plausible but oversimplified. The size of the area alone wouldn't determine constitutionality; the court would consider multiple factors.\n\nThe correct answer acknowledges the court's likely approach: requiring the police to justify the lockdown's scope and methods, ensuring it's not overly broad and that less restrictive alternatives were considered. This balances the legitimate public safety concerns with the need to protect constitutional rights, reflecting the complex analysis courts undertake in such cases."}, "84": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21327/is-it-illegal-to-wear-a-mask-while-on-a-public-sidewalk-in-florida", "docs_id": 21327, "title": "Is it illegal to wear a mask while on a public sidewalk in Florida?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to [Chapter 876 Section 12](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/876.12);\n\n> **Wearing mask, hood, or other device on public way.**\u2014No person or\n>  persons over 16 years of age shall, while wearing any mask, hood, or\n>  device whereby any portion of the face is so hidden, concealed, or\n>  covered as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter upon, or be or\n>  appear upon any lane, walk, alley, street, road, highway, or other\n>  public way in this state.\n\nAccording to [Chapter 876 Section 115](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/876.155) which I believe is how Section 12 applies;\n\n> **Applicability; ss. 876\\.12\\-876\\.15\\.**\u2014The provisions of ss. 876\\.12\\-876\\.15 apply only if the person was wearing the mask, hood, or other device: \n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2003With the intent to deprive any person or class of persons of the\n>  equal protection of the laws or of equal privileges and immunities\n>  under the laws or for the purpose of preventing the constituted\n>  authorities of this state or any subdivision thereof from, or\n>  hindering them in, giving or securing to all persons within this state\n>  the equal protection of the laws; \n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2003With the intent, by force or threat of force, to injure,\n>  intimidate, or interfere with any person because of the person\u2019s\n>  exercise of any right secured by federal, state, or local law or to\n>  intimidate such person or any other person or any class of persons\n>  from exercising any right secured by federal, state, or local law; \n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2003With the intent to intimidate, threaten, abuse, or harass any\n>  other person; or \n> \n> \n> (4\\)\u2003While she or he was engaged in conduct that could reasonably lead\n>  to the institution of a civil or criminal proceeding against her or\n>  him, with the intent of avoiding identification in such a proceeding.\n\nSo if a person is standing silently on a sidewalk, wearing a mask, with a cellphone, recording Police.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Florida Statute 784.03 defines battery as either touching/striking against someone's will OR intentionally causing bodily harm.\n\n2. Consent is not explicitly mentioned as a defense in the statute for causing bodily harm.\n\n3. Florida courts have not clearly defined \"bodily harm,\" but have provided more guidance on \"great bodily harm.\"\n\n4. Based on case law, \"great bodily harm\" is distinguished from \"slight, trivial, minor, or moderate harm\" and does not include mere bruises.\n\n5. The injury described (significant swelling and a small cut) likely falls short of \"great bodily harm\" based on precedents, but could still be considered \"bodily harm.\"\n\nGiven these factors, the correct answer is C. Even though the fighter consented to the match, consent does not appear to be a defense against the \"intentionally causes bodily harm\" clause of the battery statute. The injury, while not severe enough to qualify as \"great bodily harm,\" still likely meets the threshold for \"bodily harm.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because consent doesn't negate the \"bodily harm\" clause. Option B is incorrect because the injury described doesn't meet the threshold for \"great bodily harm\" based on precedents. Option D is incorrect because permanent disfigurement is not required for a battery charge under this statute.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuances in legal definitions and precedents."}, "86": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30179/copyright-law-and-terms-and-services", "docs_id": 30179, "title": "Copyright Law and Terms and Services", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Terms and Conditions for websites often include provisions pertaining to Copyright Law.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Terms and Conditions, as a contract, cannot override or alter copyright law itself.

Bobbi has been given due notice to leave, indicating a proper procedure was followed.\n3. Immediate arrest (option A) would likely be an overreaction and could violate rights to due process.\n4. Giving 24 hours notice (option B) is impractical and could compromise building security.\n5. Taking no action (option D) would set a dangerous precedent and ignore the authority's responsibility to secure the premises.\n\nOption C represents the most balanced approach. Administrative measures (such as security escorting Bobbi out) respect both the individual's rights and the need to secure the building. Following up with potential civil action (rather than immediate criminal charges) allows for a proportionate legal response if necessary.\n\nThis approach requires applying legal principles to a real-world scenario, balancing multiple considerations (public access, security, individual rights), and understanding the gradation of responses available to authorities.

Which of the following scenarios best describes the legal implications of using this image commercially?\n\nA) The entrepreneur can safely use the image for commercial purposes because the Creative Commons license grants this right, regardless of Nintendo's intellectual property claims.\n\nB) The entrepreneur is at risk of legal action from Nintendo, but can claim \"innocent infringement\" to minimize potential damages if sued.\n\nC) The graphic designer is solely liable for any intellectual property infringement, protecting the entrepreneur from legal consequences.\n\nD) The Creative Commons license supersedes any trademark or copyright claims Nintendo may have, making commercial use legally safe.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The Creative Commons license doesn't guarantee the original creator had the right to license the image. As stated in the documentation, \"whoever put that image out there under CC 3.0 BY is in violation and can be sued.\"\n\n2. Nintendo, as the likely owner of the Pokeball intellectual property, retains the right to pursue legal action against unauthorized use, regardless of any Creative Commons license applied by a third party.\n\n3. The entrepreneur using the image commercially would be at risk of legal action from Nintendo. However, as mentioned in the documentation, their penalty \"would almost certainly be less since your violation was 'innocent', that is, you had no way of knowing that the 'Pokeball' imagery was somebody's protected intellectual property.\"\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because the Creative Commons license doesn't override Nintendo's IP rights. Option C is wrong because both the designer and the entrepreneur could potentially face legal consequences.

The materials were discovered while a potential buyer was touring his house. \n\nAlthough I vehemently condemn the KKK, doesn't this officer have the right to display whatever he wants in his home so long as it doesn't actively and deliberately call for violence? Aren't these articles protected under the first amendment? I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \n\nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point. Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech.](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28831/37) The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question \\-\\- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off\\-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government *is* involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In [*Pickering v. Board of Education*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/563/), the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. *Pickering* imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see [*Pappas v. Giuliani*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1355900.html), where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off\\-duty time.\n\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job *requires* maintaining good relations with the community. In *Pappas*, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A police officer in a diverse urban community is discovered to have a collection of historical KKK memorabilia displayed in his private home. The city government is considering terminating his employment. Which of the following factors would be LEAST relevant in determining the legality of the officer's termination under the Pickering balancing test?\n\nA) The potential impact on public trust and community relations if the officer's collection becomes widely known\nB) Whether the officer has exhibited any biased behavior in his official duties\nC) The officer's intent in collecting and displaying the memorabilia\nD) The officer's performance ratings and disciplinary record prior to this discovery\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Pickering balancing test, as established in Pickering v. Board of Education, requires weighing the employee's First Amendment rights against the government's interest in efficient operation. In this scenario, the officer's intent in collecting the memorabilia (option C) would be the least relevant factor in determining the legality of termination.\n\nOption A is highly relevant, as courts have given particular leeway to police departments in cases where speech could undermine public trust and confidence, even if the speech occurs privately (as seen in Pappas v. Giuliani).\n\nOption B is crucial because it directly relates to the officer's ability to perform his duties without bias, which is a key consideration in the government's interest in efficient operation.\n\nOption D is relevant as it provides context for the officer's overall job performance and could influence the balancing of interests.\n\nThe officer's intent (option C), while potentially interesting, is less relevant to the legal question at hand. The Pickering test focuses on the impact of the speech/expression on government operations and public perception, not the motivations behind it. Courts have upheld terminations even in cases where the officer's intent was not explicitly racist (e.g., in Pappas, where the officer claimed his mailings were a \"hobby\").\n\nThis question requires analysis of the Pickering test, integration of multiple legal concepts, and application to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "97": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58474/can-i-use-the-governments-seals-and-logos-without-its-permission", "docs_id": 58474, "title": "Can I use the government&#39;s seals and logos without its permission?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it permissible to use a governmental seal for editorial purposes in a magazine?\n\nFor example, in a news story about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, could I use ATF's logo to accompany the story?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n====\n\nThe First Amendment permits you to use the seal of a government agency to illustrate a story about that government agency. The government can no more prohibit you from displaying its seals for expressive purposes than it can prohibit you from displaying its flag.\n\nThe questions raised about possible trademark violations and implied endorsement are red herrings. [Section 2(b) of the Lanham Act](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-15-commerce-and-trade/chapter-22-trademarks/subchapter-i-the-principal-register/section-1052-trademarks-registrable-on-principal-register-concurrent-registration) prohibits registering a trademark that \"consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of any State or municipality,\" so the government therefore may not trademark its seals. [*In re City of Houston*, 731 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-city-of-hous) (\"As the nature of the mark is not disputed in this appeal \u2014 Houston admits that its city seal is an insignia under \u00a7 2(b) of the Lanham Act \u2014 the Board properly affirmed the examining attorney's refusal to register Houston's city seal.\")\n\nEven if the seal were a protected trademark, the context of its use \\-\\- in an editorial setting rather than for commercial purposes \\-\\- is protected by the First Amendment. For instance, in [*Renna v. Cty. of Union, N.J.*, 88 F. Supp. 3d 310, 323 (D.N.J. 2014\\)](https://casetext.com/case/renna-v-cnty-of-union-6), a county tried to stop a television host from using its seal in advertisements for a show about community affairs. The court noted first that the seal was not protected by trademark law, and that even if it was, the county's efforts to limit the host's expression would run afoul of the First Amendment:\n\n> Consider that the First Amendment prohibits a State from criminalizing the desecration of the United States flag as a form of political protest. ... Should a county, by means of an artful extension of trademark law, be permitted to quash political expression that uses its Seal? I think such an extension would be both unwarranted and Constitutionally risky.\n\nThe same is true of implied endorsements. The First Amendment does not permit the government to limit your expression because it thinks people might mistake it for government speech.\n\nFor instance, [*Rothamel v. Fluvanna Cty.*, 810 F. Supp. 2d 771 (W.D. Va. 2011\\)](https://casetext.com/case/rothamel-v-fluvanna-county), a county government adopted a law \"prohibiting the display of the Fluvanna County seal unless expressly authorized by the Fluvanna County Board of Supervisors.\" The law was prompted by concerns about a blogger who had been using the county's seal in stories about county government, and there were reports that some people thought the seal indicated that the stories were official county publications. When a blogger challenged the law, the federal court entered a permanent injunction against enforcing it:\n\n> The County takes the position that the showing of the seal by private citizens is not a form of expression at all; rather, the seal is government property, like a government vehicle or other form of personal property. ... While the County is correct that Rothamel does not have the right to take possession of a physical seal owned by the County, the County cannot control all privately\\-owned images or representations of the seal simply by declaring an interest in managing its own property.

I've actually  [answered this exact question](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56796/3209) from a pure US point of view, but your EU reference does throw a wrench into that analysis. Briefly summarizing my answer, *Kirtsaeng* does indeed shield the importer from liability under US law.\n\nHowever, here the book is being imported into Poland and so the transaction may not necessarily be legitimate under Polish/EU copyright law. You are correct in assuming that EU first sale doctrine is not as generous as the US counterpart. Per *[Infosoc (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32001L0029&from=EN)* Article 4(2\\), first sale doctrine is only triggered in the EU on first sale within its territory, unlike the US where the doctrine is triggered on first global sale. Therefore, under Article 4(1\\), the distribution rights of importing a book into Poland from outside the EU remains with the copyright holder.\n\nEdit: Though the transaction might itself be illegal from Amazon's perspective, being a commercial violation of distribution rights, even if you're considered the importer, there's a chance you are yourself not in violation of copyright law. EU law allows countries to implement personal use exceptions (Article 5(2\\)(a), Article 5(4\\)). From what I recall, most of continental Europe does indeed implement some form of personal use exception, though details vary by country. I've run out of time for now, but I'll probably later research Polish specific law here (though I don't know the language, so no idea how far I'll get).\n\nNow the reason I said there was some guesswork, is that there are details you wouldn't necessarily be aware of that would make this legal, and Amazon as a large enterprise would generally take into account legal considerations. Just because the book says unauthorized for distribution outside India, doesn't mean the publisher / copyright holder didn't later make separate contractual relations with Amazon to allow it.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons case, which allows for international exhaustion of rights, applies to US law but not EU law. Therefore, while the US-based retailer might be protected under US law, this doesn't extend to the EU.\n\n2. Under EU law, specifically the Infosoc (Copyright) Directive Article 4(2), first sale doctrine is only triggered on first sale within EU territory. The book was first sold in India, so EU first sale doctrine doesn't apply.\n\n3. According to Article 4(1) of the Directive, the distribution rights for importing the book into Poland from outside the EU remain with the copyright holder, making the transaction likely illegal from the retailer's perspective.\n\n4. However, EU law allows countries to implement personal use exceptions (Articles 5(2)(a) and 5(4)). Many continental European countries, including Poland, have some form of personal use exception, which could protect the customer from liability.\n\n5. There's uncertainty because we don't know if the publisher made separate contractual arrangements with the retailer or if a national copyright collective licensed the rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because EU law doesn't recognize international exhaustion of rights in this case.
