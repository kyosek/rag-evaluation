            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently I moved to PA after graduating from WV. I, my car, and my car's lease (from a credit union) are from Texas. When I leased, my dad got on it with me so I could go through his credit union. He's still in Texas.\n\nI know I need to update my residency and they'll take my driver's license and give me a PA one. I want to go fishing soon so that's a done deal. Do I have to change the registration of my car? My title? The lease? Like I said, co\\-lessee is still in Texas and so is the credit union. I don't want to go through any more hassle than I need to and I don't want to make this a big headache for my old man. Trying to make hide or hair of all the legalese between PA's website and Texas's doesn't make much sense to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally a car must be registered in the state where it is normally or usually garaged or parked, its \"home base\". If the car stays in Texas it should be registered in Texas, but if the car is with you in PA it should be registered in PA.\n\nOne reason for this is that insurance coverage is based on the address where the car is normally kept. If the rates are lower at the place in Texas where your father lives, having it registered there could constitute insurance fraud. I once knew a person who registered his car at a family member's home in a different part of the same state where traffic was lower and insurance rates were less. When this came out he had to pay the difference in insurance rates plus a fine.\n\nMost states require that you register a car within a limited time after moving into the state with it. According to [this official page](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/New-Resident-Relocation-Information/New%20Residents/Pages/Motor-Vehicle-Information-for-New-Residents.aspx):\n\n> All new residents are required to make application for Pennsylvania title and registration of their vehicle(s) within 20 days of establishing residency in Pennsylvania.\n\n...\n\n> Pennsylvania title procedures require that the out\\-of\\-state title be surrendered to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles when applying for a Pennsylvania title. The current lienholder of an out\\-of\\-state title may require that the vehicle owner refinance the balance of the outstanding lien through another lending institution and pay the out\\-of\\-state lienholder in full. A Pennsylvania Certificate of Title will only be issued when the out\\-of\\-state title is submitted with the completed Form MV\\-1, \"Application for Certificate of Title.\"\n\n...\n\n> If you are titling and registering a leased vehicle, the leasing company will also be required to complete Form MV\\-1L.\n\nThus you must notify the credit union and the relevant insurance company of the new address of the car. Since one co\\-lessee is a member of the CU, they probably will not require a refinance, but that is up to the CU and its policies.\n\nThere should not be a great deal of paperwork involved. I have moved with a car from one state to another, and it was just a matter of submitting the registration form for the new state.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A student moves from Texas to Pennsylvania for graduate school, bringing their leased car. The car's lease is through a Texas credit union, with the student's father as a co-lessee still residing in Texas. What actions must the student take regarding the vehicle within 20 days of establishing residency in Pennsylvania?\n\nA) Only change their driver's license to a Pennsylvania one, keeping the car registered in Texas\nB) Change their driver's license and car insurance to Pennsylvania, but maintain Texas registration\nC) Change their driver's license to Pennsylvania and notify the credit union, but no other actions are necessary\nD) Apply for Pennsylvania title and registration, surrender the Texas title, and notify the credit union and insurance company of the new address\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to Pennsylvania law, new residents must apply for Pennsylvania title and registration within 20 days of establishing residency. This process requires surrendering the out-of-state (Texas) title to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The student must also notify the credit union holding the lease and the insurance company of the vehicle's new address in Pennsylvania. While changing the driver's license is necessary, it's not sufficient on its own. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they don't fulfill all the legal requirements for bringing an out-of-state vehicle to Pennsylvania as a new resident."

Can an individual buy up a parcel of land, declare it to be a municipality, make arbitrary laws, and use armed police to enforce those laws? Clearly not, but why not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A common phrase regarding US cities is, \"cities are creatures of the state.\" All of their authority comes from the authority granted states, and states can limit the authority of cities, counties and their other political subdivisions. In the US cities cannot have additional authority beyond the authority the containing state has, as opposed to, for example, cities granted Royal Charter in the United Kingdom, which may have equal or greater authority than their containing counties.\n\nMost states have constitutional and legal descriptions of what powers cities and towns can exercise. Recently many cities have begun passing laws to ban things like plastic grocery bags or hydraulic fracturing, and states have then passed laws to remove that authority from cities. \n\nStates also set requirements for creating new towns. In Texas, any town smaller than 5,000 population is a general law town. General law towns have very little authority to create laws, but they can have a police force to enforce state laws. A city in Texas with population larger than 5,000 people can enact a charter by popular vote and become a home rule city. Home rule cities in Texas can enact some laws with criminal punishments (only citations and class C misdemeanors) and have greater taxing authority, but really can only pick from a menu of options created by the state.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between municipalities and state governments regarding legislative authority?\n\nA) Municipalities have inherent authority to create laws independent of state oversight, similar to cities with Royal Charters in the United Kingdom.\n\nB) Municipalities can exercise any powers not explicitly forbidden by the state, allowing them broad autonomy in lawmaking.\n\nC) Municipalities derive all their authority from the state and cannot exercise powers beyond what the state grants them.\n\nD) Municipalities have equal authority to the state in creating laws, but must defer to federal regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key concept here is that U.S. municipalities are \"creatures of the state.\" This means that all their authority, including the power to make laws, comes directly from the state government. Municipalities cannot exercise powers beyond what the state allows them to have. States can and do limit the authority of cities, counties, and other political subdivisions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because U.S. municipalities do not have inherent authority independent of state oversight, unlike some cities with Royal Charters in the UK.\n\nOption B is false because municipalities cannot exercise any powers not explicitly forbidden; rather, they can only exercise powers explicitly granted by the state.\n\nOption D is incorrect because municipalities do not have equal authority to the state; their authority is subordinate to and derived from the state.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the hierarchical relationship between state and municipal governments in the U.S. legal system."

But it could also be that for copyright purposes these constitute derivative works, but game publishers are happy to have the publicity and so they don't request Youtube remove the videos.\n\nI have noticed that gameplay videos *sometimes* miss the game's original sound. One video's description explained that the sound had to be removed since it (naturally) contained music from the game.\n\nIs it possible that video of gameplay constitutes [fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\") but audio, at least in some situations, does not?\n\nAre these questions subject to license terms of the video game software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, a gameplay video would be either a partial copy or a derivative work, and in either case an infringement if created without permission. Such a video might be covered under fair use in US copyright law, particularly if made for the purpose of commentary on a game or instruction in how to play or design a game. \n\nIn general, a fair use defense is more likely to succeed if only the minimum amount of the work required for the purpose is used, and sound tracks might not be required for such a purpose. Thus a maker of such a video might choose to omit the sound to improve the fair\\-use case. \n\nMoreover, when the sound track contains licensed popular music it would be subject to a separate copyright, and many music publishers are notoriously litigious, so prudence would advise omitting the sound. \n\nAll that said, fair\\-use is a case\\-by\\-case determination, and if the makers of such videos have not been sued, they (and we) can only guess how a case would turn out. As to why game makers refrain from having such videos taken down (if they in fact do refrain) one can only speculate.

The video uses footage from the game but excludes the original game audio.

While gameplay videos can potentially infringe copyright as they may be considered partial copies or derivative works, they might be protected under fair use, especially if they include commentary or instruction. Excluding the audio (which may contain separately copyrighted music) can strengthen the fair use argument, as it demonstrates using only the minimum amount necessary for the purpose. However, fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, and there's no guarantee. Answer A is incorrect because educational purpose alone doesn't automatically guarantee fair use protection. B is overly pessimistic, ignoring the possibility of fair use. D is incorrect because gameplay videos are not universally exempted from copyright law."

If possessing stolen property is illegal then possessing this data is also likely illegal.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background\n----------\n\nThis question is answered easily for jury trials: something is put in evidence (\"adduced\") when the jury hears / sees it *and* there is no direction from the judge to disregard it. This is because the jury is only supposed to hear evidence in the courtroom during the trial, and so to decide facts based only on what they hear/see in there.\n\nIn [bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_trial) (or \"judge\\-alone\") trials there is no jury; the trier of fact is the judge. Although more commonly used in civil cases, these trials often occur in criminal cases too \u2014 where the defendant wants it / consents to it. Judges, by nature of their job, see all the evidence, admissible or not, at various stages before the trial. The trial rarely gives them any new information about the alleged facts themselves \u2014 they're mostly occupied with testing whether the information is to be believed by seeing the witnesses say it and respond to cross\\-examination.\n\nThe procedure differences between jury and bench trials go beyond who the trier of fact is. Say, in New Zealand, in [judge\\-alone trials](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/DLM3360171.html), counsel are not allowed to make submissions as to how the facts are to be interpreted and as to what inferences are to be drawn \u2014 unless the judge out of the blue gives them the opportunity to. In [jury trials](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM3360145), there is a requirement to file formal statements from the witnesses, and so on.\n\nScenario\n--------\n\nSomeone is charged with a crime which is comprised of 2 elements. That is, the charge is proved only if *both* the elements are proved.\n\nBefore the trial, a witness (**W**) for the prosecution (**P**) signs a formal document in which they say 2 statements (assertions) of fact: S1 and S2\\. *If* adduced at trial and accepted by the trier of fact, S1 proves the 1st element of the charge, S2 proves the 2nd.\n\nThe document is filed with the court and becomes what makes the case progress to the trial at all: a judge (**J**) sees the document, pays explicit attention to S1 and S2 and, based on them, rules that there *is* a [case to answer](https://www.defence-barrister.co.uk/submission-of-no-case-to-answer/).\n\nAt the trial, W gives oral evidence (there is no consent to written evidence\\-in\\-chief as s [83(1\\)(b)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0069/latest/DLM393914.html) could allow). **P asks them questions to the effect that S1 is voiced but fails to ask them questions to elicit a proper voiced version of S2** (say, for some reason, it slips out of P's attention that W haven't yet properly voiced S2 \u2014 P closes their case fallaciously assuming W have already voiced S2\\).\n\nOn cross\\-examination, the defence (**D**) asks W about the document (but not, Heaven forbid, specifically about S2 in it). W confirms that the document only contains their true and correct statements and was indeed signed by them.\n\nThat said, W neither explicitly confirms nor denies S2 at the trial because no one asks them about it: P forgets to ask, D avoids to ask, and J does not bother to ask (even though they have [the power](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0069/latest/DLM393931.html) to ask where they think justice requires so). S2 gets confirmed only indirectly \u2014 by virtue of W confirming that the document was indeed authorized by them.\n\nAt the end, J (the same one who previously saw S2 in the document which W has now been cross\\-examined about), rules that:\n\n* Sub\\-scenario A: the charge is proved as S2 was before the court in the formal document by W now confirmed by them as true as correct. The defendant is convicted; or\n* Sub\\-scenario B: the charge is not proved because W did not voice anything about S2\\. The defendant is acquitted.\n\nQuestion\n--------\n\n**Should the *written* S2 have been deemed adduced / put in evidence at the trial?**\n\nI can see it both ways but I can't find a solid citation in favour of either approach.\n\nFor a \"No\" answer, one could say:\n\n> Even if the written S2 was to be deemed admissible (which itself is a\n> question), it was not to be deemed *adduced* by default. This is because\n> the judge in a bench trial is to play like they're a real jury to the\n> fullest extent possible. This includes \"forgetting\" anything about the\n> case that they did not hear/see during the trial \u2014 even if that has\n> been filed with the court before them and would have been admissible\n> if explicitly brought before them during the trial.\n\nFor a \"Yes\" answer, one could say:\n\n> The written S2 was admissible: it was not hearsay because the person\n> who had made it *was* a witness on the stand and they were\n> cross\\-examined about the document containing it. It was to be deemed adduced because is had been on the court file before the same\n> judge who was now the trier of fact \u2014 previously noted by them as one of the\n> pillars on which the case made it to the trial. The defence had all\n> the ability to cross\\-examine the witness explicitly about S2\\. It therefore could not be\n> deemed missing before the trier of fact.\n\nAny answer please cite authoritative sources. Mere paraphrasing of any of the two example answers above won't be useful.\n\n*Any* common law jurisdiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a criminal trial, any document that is admitted in evidence should be explicitly identified by the judge as an **exhibit**. In the given scenario, the witness statement did not become an exhibit, so S2 is not in evidence and D should be acquitted.\n\nIn modern litigation in common law jurisdictions, the usual practice is for evidence in chief to be given orally in criminal cases, and in writing in civil cases. Often there are statutory provisions authorising this, but the common law itself may be enough. Fundamentally, a witness statement is hearsay (evidence of a previous representation), and the parties can waive the hearsay rule in civil, but not criminal, cases.\n\nEven in a civil case, judges should confirm when documents have been admitted in evidence (as opposed to merely filed in court for some pre\\-trial purpose) by assigning exhibit numbers. Alternatively, for witness statements which consist of a written narrative in admissible form, the procedure described by Dale M should make it clear that the evidence has been admitted as though the witness had read it out orally. Because the rules of evidence are not applied as strictly in civil cases, there are sometimes cases where it is genuinely unclear whether a document on the court file was admitted in evidence.\n\nWhile the scenario posed in the question involves a mistake by the prosecutor, in criminal cases it is common for witnesses to fail to give oral evidence in accordance with their written statements. This may be described as the witness not **coming up to proof**, and it might allow for the witness statement to be admitted in evidence and assigned an exhibit number, as a [prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements) (an exception to the hearsay rule). Again, the judge should be explicit about this decision and give reasons for it.",

        "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal bench trial, a witness statement containing crucial evidence (Statement S2) was filed with the court pre-trial but not explicitly introduced as an exhibit or read aloud during the trial. The witness confirmed signing the statement but was not directly questioned about S2. The judge, who had previously reviewed S2, must decide whether to consider it as evidence. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for the judge?\n\nA) Consider S2 as evidence since it was in the pre-trial file and the witness confirmed signing the statement\nB) Disregard S2 entirely as it was not formally introduced as an exhibit or read aloud during the trial\nC) Reopen the case to allow the prosecution to properly introduce S2 as evidence\nD) Consider S2 as evidence but give it less weight than if it had been formally introduced at trial\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In criminal trials, even bench trials, judges should treat evidence formally and explicitly. Documents must be properly admitted as exhibits to be considered evidence. Even though the judge had seen S2 pre-trial and the witness confirmed signing the statement, S2 was not formally introduced as an exhibit or read aloud during the trial. Therefore, the proper course is to disregard it entirely, treating it as if it were not in evidence. This maintains the integrity of the trial process and ensures that only properly admitted evidence is considered, even in a bench trial where the judge is both trier of fact and law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it disregards the formal requirements for admitting evidence in criminal trials. Option C, while well-intentioned, would be improper as it unfairly assists the prosecution after they've rested their case. Option D attempts a compromise but still improperly considers evidence not formally admitted."

Instead, the notion is to not enter into deals that are unduly favorable to the party dealing with the non\\-profit, and to not provide excessive perks and compensation to individuals workin with the non\\-profit that are more favorable than the prevailing non\\-profit management market.\n\nNon\\-profits routinely can and do have directors and officers of for\\-profit companies that support them on their boards of directors. When acting in that capacity, the directors and officers owe a duty of loyalty to the non\\-profit, and can't put the interests of other businesses with which they are involved above the interests of the non\\-profit.\n\nThe regulations are more specific, and there are some additional requirements that are imposed, in the case of a 501(c)(3\\) that is a \"[private foundation](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations)\" (which is defined, more or less, as receiving most of its donations from a small number of big donors who aren't non\\-profits themselves). For example, a private foundation is required to spend a certain amount determined by a formula each year for charitable purposes, rather than reinvesting all investment returns and donations for future use. As [the IRS explains](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/private-foundations):\n\n> \\[T]here are several restrictions and requirements on private\n> foundations, including:\n> \n> \n> 1. restrictions on self\\-dealing between private foundations and their substantial contributors and other disqualified persons;\n> 2. requirements that the foundation annually distribute income for charitable purposes;\n> 3. limits on their holdings in private businesses;\n> 4. provisions that investments must not jeopardize the carrying out of exempt purposes; and\n> 5. provisions to assure that expenditures further exempt purposes.\n\nThe IRS provides a detailed description of what constitutes a self\\-dealing transaction at [this link](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations-self-dealing-irc-4941d1b). Loans of money between the non\\-profit and related parties are particularly perilous.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The arrangement is automatically prohibited due to the board member's conflict of interest.\n\nB) The arrangement is permissible as long as the board member recuses themselves from voting on the matter.\n\nC) The arrangement is allowed if it provides fair market value for goods or services and does not result in private inurement.\n\nD) The arrangement is acceptable if the profits are reinvested into the non-profit's charitable activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key principle for 501(c)(3) organizations is that they must not operate for the benefit of private interests, and no part of their earnings may inure to the benefit of any private individual. However, transactions with related parties are not automatically prohibited. They are allowed if they provide fair market value for goods or services and do not result in private inurement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because related-party transactions are not automatically prohibited. \n\nAnswer B is insufficient; while recusal is important, it doesn't address the core issue of fair market value and private inurement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because reinvesting profits doesn't justify an arrangement that may provide unfair benefit to a private party.\n\nThe correct approach (C) ensures that the arrangement is at fair market value and doesn't result in private benefit, which aligns with the IRS guidelines for 501(c)(3) organizations."

There is a *compensation* that forms part of the contract between the offeror and you. The offeror's preference to call it a \"gift\" does not change the legal fact that his offer and your acceptance to complete Nightwave Season 2 constitutes the *formation of a contract*. From that standpoint, you are entitled to keep the items he mailed to you as long as you honor your part in that contract.\n\nYou are right by conjecturing that a party is not allowed to unilaterally alter a contract. Any modification has to be agreed upon by all parties to that contract. However, a consent or agreement may be inferred from the parties' *subsequent conduct*. Hence the best way to pre\\-empt or supersede any such inference consists of letting that party know that you disapprove of the belated alteration(s).\n\nThe absence of a written agreement can only complicate matters, though, since it appears that neither party has an objective, directly credible way to prove the terms of the original contract. Perhaps such terms can be deduced from the subsequent emails that he has been sending you, but that is impossible to ascertain without knowing the wording of the subsequent communications between you two.\n\nLastly, enforceability of your contract is less clear if completing Nightwave Season 2 through someone else's performance amounts to an unlawful act. Not being knowledgeable of the terms and conditions of that game (?), I am unable to state with certainty whether the offeror could lawfully recover from you the items he mailed.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Alice must return both items to Bob since she didn't fulfill all conditions.\nB) Alice can keep both items as they were gifts, regardless of the conditions.\nC) Alice can keep the items if she can prove she completed the original agreed-upon task.\nD) Alice must complete the new job-finding task to keep the items legally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this scenario, the exchange constitutes a contract, not a gift. Alice is entitled to keep the items if she can prove she fulfilled the original agreement. The key points are:\n\n1.

Are they still \"Protected\" for a certain period of time? Generally, what happens?\n\nThe question is in context of a company that developed an old PC video game from 2004, which then dissolved itself back in 2015\\.\n\nI'm currently trying to figure out if the rights to use said \"Game Assets\" would be legal now, and if not, who to actually reach out to in the case of a company no longer existing or operating at all.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When a company stops existing for whatever reason, then its assets (physical, financial, intellectual or otherwise) don't stop existing. When the company dissolves voluntarily, those assets usually go to the owner(s) of the company. When the company got bought up and integrated into another company, the buying company will usually own them. When the company went bankrupt and got liquidated, then they will often get sold off to the highest bidder. \n\nAnd then there is the question of who actually owns the IP rights to a specific game asset. Often there is not just one legal person which worked on a game. In addition to the developer, there might also have been a separate publisher who might or might not own IP rights. There might have been investors in the background who financed the project and now own some copyrights. Sometimes there was more than one publisher. And sub\\-contractors might have been involved in the development who only licensed their assets but retained copyright.\n\nSo unfortunately it is often not really clear what happened to IP assets of a defunct company. People who *might* have the rights will often not care much about them until something happens which gives new commercial value to those assets. So even if you are unable to determine who owns the assets to a game, as soon as you start using them, someone might show up with a plausible claim to the IP rights and demand money from you. Such lawsuits can get really messy and really expensive.\n\nFor a good example for just how much of a goose chase you might be in for when you want to legally obtain the rights to a game from a defunct company, check out [the story of the re\\-release of No One Lives Forever](https://kotaku.com/the-sad-story-behind-a-dead-pc-game-that-cant-come-back-1688358811). tl;dr: multiple game companies said \"*Maybe* we have the rights to the game according to some contract buried in some file cabinet, but we don't care enough to find out. But if you try to release it, we *will* find out and if we do we will sue you!\"",

You want to use some assets from this game in a new project. What is the most accurate statement about the legal status of these game assets?\n\nA) The assets are now in the public domain and free to use by anyone.\nB) The assets are still protected but only for a limited time period after the company's dissolution.\nC) The assets may still be protected, and identifying the current rights holder could be complex and uncertain.\nD) The assets automatically became property of the government when the company dissolved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a company dissolves, its intellectual property (IP) assets don't automatically become public domain. These assets are typically transferred to the company's owners, sold to other entities, or distributed to creditors in case of bankruptcy. The situation can be further complicated by the involvement of multiple parties in game development, such as publishers, investors, and subcontractors, who may have retained some rights. \n\nAs the documentation explains, it's often unclear what happened to IP assets of defunct companies. Even if the original rights holders can't be easily identified, using these assets without permission could lead to legal challenges from parties with plausible claims to the IP. The example of \"No One Lives Forever\" illustrates how complex and uncertain the ownership of game assets from defunct companies can be.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they assume the protection status has changed or expired, which is not necessarily true.

If you want people to not use it, all you have to do is *not* license it and rely on [basic copyright](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/q/541/4501). You can post source code on a web page, just as you can post an essay on a blog, and that is conventionally interpreted as granting permission to look. A license is needed to actively copy. The basic idea of a license is to state what actions you allow, so for instance if you allow people to download and read offline, and nothing else, they you would say that. If you want to allow people to compile (when applicable), say that. And so on. If the point is to disclaim liability for damage, you should read up on [warranty disclaimers](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1410/do-warranty-disclaimers-in-software-licenses-carry-any-legal-weight). The [CC license scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) is popular because it allows you to fiddle with distinctions.

Now suppose that the parties to that contract (a buyer and a vendor or manufacturer) have agents in a non\\-EU country (say in Asia).

The question of which court a lawsuit should be filed in is often one of convenience when the lawsuit is filed; it is not that unusual for this to be a different jurisdiction than the natural jurisdiction when the contract was made. For instance, [here](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ok-court-of-civil-appeals/1441159.html) is a case in which two US soldiers got into a car crash while stationed in Germany, and one sued the other in Oklahoma court when they returned home. The plaintiff also sued the defendant's insurance, which was allowed under German laws but not Oklahoma laws. However, the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined that the contract was intended to be governed by German law (since it was sold in Germany), and so it made sense to apply the provisions of German law to the contract.\n\nThere are exceptions. Courts can decline to enforce terms that are contrary to local public policy; for instance, no US court will enforce a contract that amounts to indentured servitude. For a more common example, employment contracts can have non\\-compete clauses. In California, those contracts are considered to be against public policy, and are unenforceable regardless of what law the contract was made under. But those are the exceptions; in general, US courts are perfectly willing to hear a case and apply foreign law if it makes sense to apply the foreign law and to hear the case in the US.\n\nThis actually comes up a fair bit in the US: each of the 50 states and the federal government have their own laws, and it's not unusual for multiple jurisdictions to be reasonable places for a lawsuit. If a contract is signed between two parties in Maryland, but one party is a resident of Pennsylvania, a lawsuit over it could potentially be filed in federal court.

The product is defective, violating EU consumer protection laws. The consumer and the company both have offices in Thailand, where consumer protection laws are less stringent. The consumer wants to file a lawsuit. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The case must be heard in an EU court, as EU law applies to the contract.\nB) The case can only be adjudicated in Thailand, as both parties have offices there.\nC) The case can be heard in a Thai court, which can apply EU consumer protection laws.\nD) The case cannot be heard anywhere, as there is a conflict of laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the principles outlined in the documentation, courts in one jurisdiction are often willing to hear cases and apply the laws of another jurisdiction if it makes sense to do so. In this case, while the contract falls under EU consumer protection laws, the presence of both parties in Thailand makes it a convenient forum for the lawsuit. A Thai court could reasonably hear the case and apply EU consumer protection laws, as these laws governed the formation of the contract. This is similar to the example given where US courts apply foreign laws in appropriate cases. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while EU law applies, the case doesn't necessarily have to be heard in an EU court. Option B is wrong because the applicable law is EU law, not Thai law, even if the case is heard in Thailand. Option D is incorrect because courts have established methods for dealing with conflicts of laws, and this situation doesn't prevent the case from being heard."

I have seen one (don't remember where) where it was a manuscript that the museum said they wanted to share online but is \"unreleased\" and so copyright protected in some way. In that case, and other cases like it, I am wondering if you are allowed to transcribe the picture of the manuscript into say electronic text form, or what the rules are generally around that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question contains an incorrect assumption \\-\\- the assumption that this manuscript or any ancient manuscript is protected by copyright. As can be seen in [this well known chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) under US law an unpublished document, such as a manuscript, is protected for only 70 years after the death of the author, or 120 years after the work was created if the death date is not known, or the identity of the author is not know, or the work is of corporate authorship. A work written by a person who lived from circa 950 to circa 1010 is in the public domain under US law, with no room for doubt. The exact term of copyright protection may vary somewhat under the laws of other countries, *but in none of them is a document written by a person who died over 1,000 years ago protected by copyright.* This work is in the public domain, and no one owns any copyright in it. (A manuscript whose author died after 1948, or that was created after 1898 might well be protected by copyright.)\n\n\\[The statement in italics above is apparently incorrect. It seems that under UK law such a work may be under copyright if it is unpublished. IMO this is a bizarre result but such seems to be the law.]\n\nThe current owners of the physical manuscript can control who has access to it, and on what terms. Thy could use an NDA or other contract to prevent such people from publishing or distributing the text. But if they allow general access to it, they have published it, and anyone may legally republish it as they see fit. \n\nAny person allowed access under a restrictive contract to which s/he has agreed may do whatever that contract permits, and not what it does not.\n\nA modern derivative work, such as an annotated edition, or a translation, would have its own copyright, but this would not protect the original text. \n\nIf the original question means that there is an unpublished manuscript recent enough to be under copyright, then its author or the author's heir or the person or entity to whom the copyright was sold or given or left owns the copyright. In that case, no one may make a copy of the manuscript, including a transcription, or of any part of it, unless with permission from the copyright holder, or in such limited ways as is permitted by fair dealing (in the UK and much of Europe) or fair use (in the US). The question does not give enough detail to judge if the partial copy suggested would qualify \\-\\- this always depends heavily on the specific facts of the case.\n\nIt seems that under UK law some unpublished works are protected which would be in the public domain if they were published. I am not sure how they can be share without being legally \"published\" and so lose protection.",

While most would assume very old works are in the public domain, UK law has a peculiar provision for unpublished works.\n\nA is incorrect because, contrary to common assumption, age alone does not automatically place a work in the public domain under UK law if it remains unpublished.\n\nB is incorrect because the 70-year rule typically applies to published works or works of known authors who died relatively recently. For works this old, different rules apply.\n\nC is correct. UK copyright law has an unusual provision that can extend copyright protection indefinitely for unpublished works, even those created centuries ago. This is often referred to as \"perpetual copyright\" for unpublished works.\n\nD is incorrect because the date of discovery is not a determining factor in copyright status under UK law. The key factors are publication status and the date of the author's death.\n\nThis question highlights the complexity and sometimes counterintuitive nature of copyright law, especially when dealing with very old, unpublished works in different jurisdictions."

Is her Turkish name change document just as valid as an American issued one would be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Each state, each local government, and each government agency can make their own rules on this question (if it was another U.S. state, a provision called the \"full faith and credit clause\" requires all other states to honor it).\n\nUsually, the Turkish name change document will be honored by any U.S, state or local government agency or institution if (1\\) the name change document or a copy of it, is certified or notarized, (2\\) there is an [apostille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention) from the appropriate Turkish national government official stating that the certification or notarization is valid, and (3\\) there is a translation of the document into English that accompanies the original document or certified copy of the document that is supported by a sworn certification from a foreign language translator that the translator is qualified to translate the document and that the translation of the document is true and correct.\n\nSometimes, an agency or institution will also reserve the right to not honor a document if the relevant civil servant has a reasonable belief based upon some relevant fact, that the document is a fake.\n\nBut, some agencies or institutions could have more relaxed, or more cumbersome, requirements by adopting regulations that say so.\n\nFor example, many states have laws that allow you to do a name change for purposes of a driver's license from a pre\\-marital name without any other proof other than simply by declaring under oath that you got married on a particular day and changed your name, since that situation is rarely suspicious and covers the vast majority of cases.\n\nAn alternative option would be to bring a name change petition to a U.S. court and to have it declare the the Turkish name change is valid, usually with essentially the same kind of evidence, but sometimes with the court allowing you to explain why you can't comply with some formality, because, for example, your country is at war and isn't issuing apostilles or your country doesn't have the concept of notarizing or certifying this particular kind of document, or because you would face persecution in that country if you had to go back to it in order to get that paperwork.\n\nOnce this was done, all U.S. government, state, and local agencies and institutions would have to obey that court order, and if there are lots of agencies or institutions that have different or onerous requirements, this may be easier to do.\n\nThere are also some states that recognize the concept of a common law name change. In these states, any name (and sometimes all names) that you voluntarily go by, or answer to, are legally your name, even if you don't have any paperwork to back it up.",

She then moves to the United States and wants to apply for a driver's license in a state that requires a birth certificate and name change document. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the acceptance of her Turkish name change document in the US?\n\nA) The Turkish name change document will automatically be accepted by all US government agencies without any additional requirements.\n\nB) Alice must obtain a US court order to validate her Turkish name change before any US agency will accept it.\n\nC) The Turkish name change document will likely be accepted if it is certified, has an apostille, and is accompanied by a sworn English translation.\n\nD) Alice must go through a new name change process in the US as foreign name change documents are never recognized.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate answer is C. While policies can vary by state and agency, generally, a foreign name change document like Alice's Turkish marriage certificate will be accepted if it meets certain criteria. These typically include:\n1. The document is certified or notarized\n2. It has an apostille from the appropriate Turkish national government official\n3. It is accompanied by a sworn English translation\n\nThis answer reflects the common practice described in the documentation, which allows for the recognition of foreign documents while ensuring their authenticity. Options A and D are too extreme, as foreign documents are neither automatically accepted nor universally rejected. Option B, while sometimes a possible alternative, is not typically required as the first step and would be more cumbersome than simply providing the properly authenticated foreign document."

Ideally, in order for players to remain immersed, the email would appear to be actual communication from a real FBI agent. Since players have to provide an email address beforehand, and they do so in the context of the ARG, they should be aware that these emails are not actual FBI communication, but there's a real risk that players either sign up other people who are unaware or that players sign up and forget about it before receiving anything.\n\nMy question is two\\-fold: is it legal to impersonate a government agent if most reasonable parties don't actually believe me to be a government agent? And if not, what precautions should I take to ensure no one thinks the emails are legit, hopefully without hurting immersion?\n\n(I'm based in the United States, but the game could be played by any English speaker, so I tagged the question with [international](/questions/tagged/international \"show questions tagged 'international'\") \\- let me know if I should change that)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [18 USC \u00a7912](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/912) provides that:\n\n> Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\nI do not think that in the context of a movie, play or game the person portraying an FBI agent or other LEO is \"acting as such\", and surely this does not involved obtaining \"any money, paper, document, or thing of value\".\n\nThe Wikipedia article on [Police\\_impersonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_impersonation) says:\n\n> Dressing up as a police officer in costume (e.g. for Halloween), or pretending to be a police officer for the entertainment purposes or a harmless prank toward an acquaintance is generally not considered a crime, provided that those involved recognize the imposter is not a real police officer, and the imposter is not trying to deceive those involved into thinking they are. Nevertheless, replica police uniforms sold in the UK must not be identical to the uniforms currently used by the police, and traders have been jailed in the past for selling on genuine uniforms.\n\nMany films and TV shows have portrayed FBI agents, in some cases actual agents by their real names. This goes back as far as the 1935 moviw *G\\-Men* starring James Cagney. Many examples are listed in the Wikipedia article [Federal Bureau of Investigation portrayal in media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_portrayal_in_media), and many of them used realistic badges and depictions. They were not treated as criminal impersonations, even when the FBI or its officials strongly disapproved of particular movies.\n\nThe somewhat similar US federal law 10 USC 772 prohibits wearing military uniform by persons who are not authorized, but paragraph (f) provides that it is permitted:\n\n> While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion\\-picture production may wear the uniform of that armed force if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force.\n\nA Vietnam\\-War\\-era court case held the restriction \"if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force\" to be an unconstitutional restriction of speech, and held that unauthorized wearing of a uniform was only punishable if there was charged a proved an \"intent to deceive\". I would expect a similar limitation of 18 USC \u00a7912\\. \n\nThat said, if the email was such that a reasonable person might well be deceived into believing that it really came for an actual FBI agent or other government employee, there might be a problem. The suggestions on that point in the answer by user hszmv seem reasonable to me. An imaginary \"Confederal Department of Interrogation\" say, keeps things firmly in an alternate reality.",

This approach maintains immersion for players while avoiding any risk of actual deception.\n\nOption A is the most problematic, as it could easily lead to genuine confusion and potentially violate 18 USC \u00a7912. \n\nOption C, while including a disclaimer, still risks confusion and could be seen as an attempt to impersonate a real agency. \n\nOption D, while less likely to deceive than A or C due to the fictional elements, still involves claiming to be from a real agency (FBI) and could potentially violate the law.\n\nThe key is to avoid any reasonable possibility of deception regarding real government agencies, which option B accomplishes most effectively."

The exact legal wording of the \"User Content License\" is not included in either ToS document, as far as I can determine.\n\nThis seems to mean that Alice has granted a license to Bob to use and modify content that Alice has created. Nothing in that license seems to allow her to terminate the license, nor to demand that Bob delete or cease to use the content.\n\nAlice probably could separately negotiate a contract with Bob, under which Bob agrees to delete his copies of any content created by Alice, in return for whatever consideration they agree to. Alice could not force Bob to agree to such a contract, however.\n\nIf Alice is subject to US law, she (or her heirs) can invoke [17 USC 203](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203) to terminate any license grants. However, this may only be done during a five\\-year period starting 35 years after the grant was made, which is not highly practical for the case at hand.\n\nAside from the termination provisions of 17 USC 203, there does not seem to be any legal way for Alice to force Bob to stop using the content she created and licensed. This is not the same as the \"First Sale Doctrine\" (FSD) for physical copies, as under the FSD the owner of the copy has an absolute right to resell, lend, or rent the copy to whoever he likes, and Bob does not.

They cannot permanently take away or dispose of the item, but they can restrict access temporarily. Option C best reflects this balance between the child's ownership and the parent's disciplinary authority."

Under UK law, which of the following best describes the criminal offense Alice has likely committed?\n\nA) Trespassing\nB) Theft of services\nC) Obtaining services dishonestly\nD) Breach of peace\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nC) Obtaining services dishonestly is the correct answer. This offense is defined in Section 11 of the Fraud Act 2006 in the UK. It applies when someone obtains services for themselves or another by dishonest means, without paying or intending to pay the full amount. This accurately describes Alice's actions of sneaking into the concert without a ticket.\n\nA) Trespassing is incorrect because while Alice did enter the venue without permission, the specific offense here goes beyond mere trespassing due to the service (concert) being obtained dishonestly.\n\nB) Theft of services is not the precise legal term used in UK law for this situation. While conceptually similar, the correct legal term is \"obtaining services dishonestly.\"\n\nD) Breach of peace is incorrect as it typically refers to causing public disturbance or alarm, which doesn't fit Alice's actions of quietly sneaking into a venue.\n\nThe offense of obtaining services dishonestly is an either-way offense, meaning it can be tried in either magistrates' court or crown court. It carries a maximum penalty of 12 months' imprisonment if tried summarily (in magistrates' court) or up to 5 years if tried on indictment (in crown court), and/or a fine in both cases."

In theory Google could then refuse to hire me, but implement my idea I presented to them and profit off of it without crediting me if they chose to.\n\nNow I'm not really concerned about this, even assuming Google deemed my idea worth implementing I don't see Google trying to steal it (It's not worth the bad press that would result). Furthermore this particular idea is essentially only viable if implemented by Google, meaning even if the idea was stolen I wouldn't really be at a lost since I can't do anything with the idea without Google.\n\nHowever, I am curious what the legal status would be if I was concerned about my idea being stolen. Would someone in the theoretical position of having someone implement a product they pitched (without getting a contract signed ahead of time) have any recourse to try to get recognition for their idea? Would there be any steps, short of forcing an interviewer to sign a contract before pitching your idea, someone in such a situation theoretically could take prior to presenting their idea to help ensure they got recognition for it?\n\nI imagine the answer is no, but maybe I'm wrong :)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you're concerned about the potential for the idea to be stolen, you can propose a contract which forbids them to attempt to capitalize on your idea. Obviously, there's a bit of a disparity in bargaining power in a job interview situation, though, so this may not be the most practical idea.\n\nBut even if you can't head the problem off preemptively, there actually does seem to be a possibility of a legal remedy. While copyright law obviously doesn't protect ideas, a wronged plaintiff could theoretically collect through an action for conversion, which requires a showing of \"ownership or right to possession of property, wrongful disposition of the property right and damages.\" \n*G.S. Rasmussen \\& Assocs., Inc. v. Kalitta Flying Serv., Inc.*, 958 F.2d 896, 906 (9th Cir. 1992\\) \n\nCalifornia courts and the Ninth Circuit have interpreted \"property\" very broadly for purposes of conversion claims, to include intangible property including:\n\n* shares of a corporation (*Payne v. Elliot*, 54 Cal. 339, 1880 WL 1907\n(1880\\));\n* information from a customer list ([*Palm Springs\\-La Quinta Dev. Co. v. Kieberk Corp.*, 46 Cal.

But it may be that an interviewee who took some more concrete steps toward developing the idea could increase the likelihood of protecting the idea. And it may be that just fixing the idea by writing up a proposal to show a prospective employer could be enough to bring the case within the scope of copyright or unfair business practice protection, depending on what the idea actually is.\n\nFor some more reading on the protection available to business ideas in California, you can also check out [this article](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bDHYmu__YiAJ:https://www.law360.com/articles/68606/idea-theft-claims-in-california&num=1&hl=en&gl=us&strip=0&vwsrc=0).",

My question is, if they are totally innocent and the court acquits the accused of the main charge, should the added on charge of resisting be dropped automatically since they should have never been arrested in the first place and thus never been put in the situation where they could get a resisting charge? \n\nFor example, imagine someone gets arrested for some crime and in the process, is so shaken up and has such a distrust for officers in that area he/she is being arrest at, that the person actually does resist but mainly for their safety like to see what is going on. However, since they are totally innocent of the main crime, why then should the resisting \"stick\"? A valid defense would be \"I should have never been arrested in the first place, therefore the resisting charge should also be dropped\". If I was a judge, I would say that is a valid point. If police go around arresting people with no proof and then slap on an extra resisting charge, to me, if the main charge is acquitted, then the secondary charge of resisting should automatically be acquitted as well without going to the jury.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nIf the police want to arrest you your legal obligation is to submit and, if the arrest was a violation of your rights, pursue a legal remedy afterwards. You do not have a right to resist an arrest even if that arrest is without legal basis.\n\n\"Resisting arrest\" is a specific crime with a specific definition. For example, in [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\") it is in [s546c](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s546c.html) of the *Crimes Act 1900* and it says:\n\n> Any person who resists or hinders or incites any person to assault, resist or hinder a police officer in the execution of his or her duty shall be liable on conviction before the Local Court to imprisonment for 12 months or to a fine of 10 penalty units, or both.\n\nIf you are charged with resisting arrest the state needs to prove each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. If they can't do that the charge will be dismissed.\n\nIf they can prove it then you may have a defence to resisting arrest if:\n\n* you did not know that the person was a police officer or\n* you did not know that you were being arrested\n* if the police officer was not acting lawfully. However, a police officer will be acting lawfully even if the arrest is subsequently found to be unlawful provided they are acting in good faith and without malice. Suspecting you of committing a crime even if you didn\u2019t makes it lawful to arrest you.",

During the arrest, John panics and struggles against the officers, leading to an additional charge of resisting arrest. At trial, John is found not guilty of burglary due to lack of evidence. What is the most likely outcome for the resisting arrest charge?\n\nA) The resisting arrest charge will be automatically dropped because John was innocent of the original crime.\nB) John can successfully argue that the resisting arrest charge should be dismissed because he should never have been arrested in the first place.\nC) The resisting arrest charge will likely still stand, regardless of John's innocence of the burglary charge.\nD) The judge will dismiss the resisting arrest charge without sending it to the jury, based on John's acquittal of the burglary charge.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the provided information, the legality of an arrest is not determined by whether the person is ultimately found guilty of the original crime. Even if a person is innocent, they are legally obligated to submit to an arrest and pursue legal remedies afterwards if the arrest was unjustified. The crime of resisting arrest is separate from the original charge and depends on the person's actions during the arrest, not the outcome of the original charge. As long as the police officers were acting in good faith and without malice, the arrest would be considered lawful even if later found to be mistaken. Therefore, John could still be convicted of resisting arrest despite being acquitted of burglary."

He's a general nuisance, causes property damage, poisoning pets, etc. He has arrests for these things, and was told to leave the area (restraining order) for a period of time. All of this causes one of the neighbors to list his property in despair so that he can get away from the nuisance, as it's a detriment to his quality of life.\n\nThis came up in discussion my wife and I were having, as we both know someone experiencing this exact issue. We weren't sure if the person who bought the house from the fed\\-up seller would be entitled to some remedy if the seller didn't disclose the problems with the immediate neighbor.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Nova Scotia does not have mandatory disclosure laws as exist in many US states, where you may be explicitly required to reveal neighbor problems (California: [item 11 on the forms](https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Transaction-Center/PDF/Standard-Forms/2020-June-Final/TDS-VERSION-1-REDLINE-(1).pdf?la=en&hash=D42DDF11D099FB7A7ED0A9D5F74950C4781C44F8)). Instead a Nova Scotia seller / buyer must rely on what is explicitly included or excluded under case law. This problem would likely fall in the realm of latent defects, not a patent defect that is readily discoverable by an ordinary inspection. In that circumstance, the vendor would have a duty to disclose dangerous defects, ones that render the property useless for a buyer's purpose (as understood by the seller), or else stop\\-work orders and the like that fundamentally affect the value of the property.\n\nThere is [a form](https://www.uslegalforms.com/jsfiller-desk13/?requestHash=001ac5f9cccdcb3811d25db2c2a5ff1f847268c23625c24d6a9b981f6a65327b&ref=https://www.uslegalforms.com&projectId=738768503&loader=tips&et=as#5cae6fcf04d701957f8b19e303827e13) that the Nova Scotia real estate commission uses for sellers to disclose defects, but this is optional and only represents their considered legal opinion as to the likely non\\-disclosures that could land them in court (some of the underlying cases are Lambert v.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the seller's legal obligation regarding disclosure of this information?\n\nA) The seller must disclose this information as it falls under mandatory disclosure laws in Nova Scotia.\n\nB) The seller is not required to disclose this information as it does not relate to the physical condition of the property being sold.\n\nC) The seller must disclose this information only if specifically asked by the potential buyer.\n\nD) The seller should consider disclosing this information as it could potentially be seen as a latent defect that affects the buyer's quality of life.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Nova Scotia does not have mandatory disclosure laws, so A is incorrect. While B is technically true as the neighbor issue doesn't relate to the physical condition of the property, it oversimplifies the situation. C is not accurate because the duty to disclose certain defects exists regardless of whether the buyer asks. D is the best answer because under Nova Scotia's \"caveat emptor\" regime with exceptions, this situation could potentially be considered a latent defect that significantly affects the property's value or the buyer's quality of life. While not explicitly required, disclosing this information could protect the seller from potential legal issues if the buyer later claims the omission was a material non-disclosure."

Which of the following scenarios is MOST likely to result in a not-guilty verdict?\n\nA) The victim shouted angrily at the defendant before the altercation occurred.\nB) The defendant mistakenly believed the victim was reaching for a weapon, though no weapon was present.\nC) The victim had previously threatened the defendant, but made no threatening actions during the incident in question.\nD) The defendant perceived an imminent threat when the victim suddenly reached into their jacket pocket, which reasonably appeared to be an attempt to retrieve a weapon.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most likely scenario to result in a not-guilty verdict based on self-defense. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The defendant perceived an imminent threat, which is crucial for a self-defense claim.\n2. The victim's action of suddenly reaching into their jacket pocket could reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to retrieve a weapon.\n3. The defendant's perception was based on the victim's actual behavior at the time of the incident, not on past threats or general angry behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely shouting angrily does not typically justify self-defense.\n\nOption B is less likely to succeed because the defendant's belief was mistaken and not based on any actual action by the victim that would reasonably appear threatening.\n\nOption C is incorrect because past threats alone, without any threatening actions during the incident itself, generally do not justify self-defense.\n\nOption D best fits the criteria mentioned in the original answer, where \"the victim gave the accused reasonable grounds to believe that the victim was about to use force against the accused,\" potentially justifying the accused's actions as self-defense."

I would like to have a name with a cultural reference, that is character names from older literature or folk tales. Now, there is the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_wood, which steals all names and trademark them as their own invention. So then, it may happen that *Gretel* becomes an illegal name like the English version *Schneewittchen*.\n\nHowever, I then see that *Voldemort*, owned by the Harry Potter franchise, is used by LinkedIn on opensource software, which seems strange in this context.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1.

[An answer on Avvo by Kurt Van Thomme](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-i-trademark-a-similar-name-in-a-different-indu-69533.html#answer_91311) captures the important question when using an existing trade name in a new industry:\n\n> The question in these kinds of circumstances is often whether the goods or services offered by the two companies are sufficiently related such that a consumer would be likely to think a company providing the first product or service would be reasonably likely to provide the second product or service also.\n\nKurt's answer includes an example where the name \"Pioneer\" is used by a seed company and an electronics company. The two products are unlikely to be provided by the same company, so there is low risk of consumer confusion.\n\nIn my layman opinion, it seems unlikely that J.K Rowling or Warner Brothers would use the trade name *Voldemort* to market a software development tool (as it seems unlikely they'd market a software development tool *at all*, unlike a complete video game, which would be a more likely product), so you could legally use the name insofar as it is not likely to cause customer confusion. Note that you still might attract negative legal attention if the trademark holder is particularly litigious, so when I say \"you could legally use the name\" I mean that you could probably win a lawsuit (at whatever legal fee costs) if one were filed against you.\n\n***However***, [some marks are regarded as \"famous\" or \"well\\-known\"](http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/FamousWellKnownMarksFactSheet.aspx) in some jurisdictions. In that case, the mark is afforded much broader protection, and your ability to use it in a different industry is greatly diminished:\n\n> Famous marks are those that enjoy a high degree of consumer recognition in a particular jurisdiction or in a specific field of commerce or industry. However, few trademarks enjoy the status of \u201cfame.\u201d Examples of marks held to be famous in certain jurisdictions are COCA\\-COLA, KODAK, WIMBLEDON and VIAGRA.\n\nFor example, you could not start a business selling automobiles under the brand name \"Coca\\-Cola\" even though it is tremendously unlikely that the Coca\\-Cola Company would branch out into selling cars. The mark's status as \"famous\" would still allow the Cola\\-Cola Company to succeed in stopping you from using that mark in commerce, even in a vastly different industry. If the trademark holder of the name *Voldemort* succeeded in persuading a court that the mark met the jurisdiction's standard for a famous mark, then you could not use the name even for your software development tool.\n\nNote also that because trademark is intended to reduce confusion over the source of a good or service, trademark holders can lose their trademark by failing to defend it from confusing uses. Therefore, some trademark holders aggressively pursue even borderline cases to ensure they don't endanger their trademark.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and potential risks of using this name?\n\nA) The developer can freely use the name \"Rapunzel\" without any legal concerns, as fairy tale characters are in the public domain.\n\nB) The developer cannot use the name \"Rapunzel\" under any circumstances, as it's likely trademarked by a major entertainment company.\n\nC) The developer can likely use the name \"Rapunzel\" for a data storage application, but might face legal challenges if the name is considered a \"famous\" mark in their jurisdiction.\n\nD) The developer can only use the name \"Rapunzel\" if they're not based in the United States, as U.S. trademark laws don't apply internationally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While fairy tale characters like Rapunzel are generally in the public domain, modern interpretations or uses of these characters can be trademarked. Using the name for a data storage application is likely permissible because it's in a different industry from entertainment, where \"Rapunzel\" is typically associated. There's a low risk of consumer confusion between a data storage app and an entertainment product.\n\nHowever, if \"Rapunzel\" is considered a \"famous\" or \"well-known\" mark in the developer's jurisdiction (similar to how \"Coca-Cola\" or \"Kodak\" are treated), it could be afforded broader protection across different industries. In this case, the developer might face legal challenges even though their product is unrelated to entertainment.\n\nThe developer could likely use the name, but should be aware of potential risks and be prepared for possible legal scrutiny, especially if the trademark holder is particularly protective of their intellectual property."

This includes traditional offenses such as Murder, Robbery, and Assault. Some sources define the concept as encompassing acts that would be wrong even if *there was no specific law against it*. *Malum Prohibitum* offenses, on the other hand, are not inherently wicked acts \\- they are just against the law for whatever reason (often public order, safety, or health). Common examples of such offenses are DUI, carrying a concealed firearm without a permit, evading an immigration checkpoint, and possessing a controlled substance.\n\nWikipedia [cites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malum_prohibitum):\n\n> Criminal offenses can be broken down into two general categories malum in se and malum prohibitum. The distinction between malum in se and malum prohibitum offenses is best characterized as follows: a malum in se offense is \"naturally evil as adjudged by the sense of a civilized community,\" whereas a malum prohibitum offense is wrong only because a statute makes it so. State v. Horton, 139 N.C. 588, 51 S.E. 945, 946 (1905\\).\n\nAlso see [Book 4, Chapter 1](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch1.asp) of Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, in which he states (my emphasis)\n\n> AS to the power of human punifhment, or the right of the temporal legiflator to inflict difcretionary penalties for crimes and mifdemefnors. It is clear, that the right of punifhing crimes agianft the law of nature, as murder and the like, is in a ftate of mere nature vefted in every individual. For it muft be vefted in fomebody ; otherwife the laws of nature would be vain and fruitlefs, if none were empowered to put them in execution : and if that power is vefted in any one, it muft alfo be vefted in all mankind ; fince all are by nature equal. Whereof the firft murderer Cain was fo fenfible, that we find him expreffing his apprehenfions, that whoever fhould find him would flay him. In a ftate of fociety this right is transferred from individuals to the fovereign power ; whereby men are prevented from being judges in their own caufes, which is one of the evils that civil government was intended to remedy. **Whatever power therefore individuals had of punifhing offences aginft the law of nature, that is now vefted in the magiftrate alone ; who bears the fword of juftice by the confent of the whole community. And to this precedent natural power of individuals muft be referred that right, which fome have argued to belong to every ftate, (though, in fact, never exercifed by any) of punifhing not only their own fubjects, but alfo foreign embaffadors, even with death itfelf ; in cafe they have offended, not indeed againft the municipal laws of the country, but againft the divine laws of nature, and become liable thereby to forfeit their lives for their guilt.**\n> \n> \n> **AS to offences merely againft the laws of fociety, which are only mala prohibita, and not mala in fe ; the temporal magiftrate is alfo empowered to infict coercive penalties for fuch tranfgreffions : and this by the confent of individuals ; who, in forming focieties, did either tacitly or expreffly inveft the fovereign power with a right making laws, and of enforcing obedience to them** when made, by exercifing, upon their nonobfervance, feverities adequate to the evil. The lawfulnefs therefore of punifhing fuch criminals is founded upon this principle, that the law by which they fuffer was by their own confent ; it is part to the original contract into which they entered, when firft they engaged in fociety ; it was calculated for, and has long contributed to. their own fecurtiy.\n\nIs obtaining an abortion contrary to local law a malum in se or a malum prohibitum offense? I can think of arguments in favor of either:\n\n* Illegal abortions are *Malum In Se*\n\n\t+ Abortion is often considered by opponents as a form of Murder, which is a traditional *malum in se* offense.\n\t+ Arguments against abortion are often couched in moralistic terms, rather than arguments based on public good. That is, activists typically claim that banning abortion is a moral or religious duty rather than claiming that banning it would improve people's health, build the economy, reduce pollution, or make elections fairer for minority candidates.\n* Illegal abortions are *Malum Prohibitum*\n\n\t+ Laws on when, if, and how an abortion may be lawfully performed vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A law based on a timeless moral \"truth\" would be expected to be harmonious nearly everywhere.\n\nRestated, is Abortion inherently a Malum in Se act, with statutes in various places changing the rule to allow it in certain scenarios, or is abortion inherently permitted according to the Common Law view of morality, with modern anti\\-abortion laws being strictly statutory in nature?\n\nAs Nate Eldredge mentioned, I am aware that some people may approach this from the perspective of their own religious or moral views. What I'm interested in is whether this has been analyzed from a purely *legal* perspective or whether a court has ruled on it. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This distinction was once important in English law, and other common\\-law systems derived from it, because common\\-law courts felt free to punish a *Malum in Se* even when there was no relevant statute, while a *Malum Prohibitum* would be punished only if it violated a specific statute. \n\nBut today in the US, and to a large degree in the UK and other common\\-law countries, nearly all law has a statutory basis (although subject to interpretation by courts). Thus the distinction between *Malum in Se* and *Malum Prohibitum* no longer makes a significant difference, and is pretty much purely academic, except in a historical context.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to current legal interpretations, which of the following statements most accurately describes the Second Amendment's protection of firearms commerce?\n\nA) The Second Amendment universally protects the right to manufacture and sell firearms across all U.S. circuit courts.\n\nB) The Second Amendment does not protect firearms commerce at all, as ruled unanimously by federal courts.\n\nC) The protection of firearms commerce under the Second Amendment varies depending on the circuit court's interpretation.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has definitively ruled that the Second Amendment protects all aspects of firearms commerce.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legal interpretation of the Second Amendment's protection of firearms commerce varies across different circuit courts. Some courts, like the Fourth Circuit in US v. Chafin, have ruled that the right to bear arms does not necessarily extend to a right to sell firearms. The Ninth Circuit in Montana Shooting Sports Association v. Holder similarly indicated that firearm manufacturers and dealers are subject to regulation. \n\nHowever, other courts have interpreted the Second Amendment more broadly. The Northern Illinois district court, in cases like Illinois Association of Firearms Retailers v. City of Chicago, has ruled that the right to keep and bear arms must include the right to acquire firearms, thus protecting certain aspects of firearms commerce.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the protection is not universal across all circuits. Answer B is false because some courts have indeed interpreted the Second Amendment as protecting aspects of firearms commerce. Answer D is incorrect because the Supreme Court has not yet made a definitive ruling on this specific issue. The question of firearms commerce protection under the Second Amendment remains a matter of circuit split, pending a potential future Supreme Court decision."

Such aliens can be removed without a hearing, unless they apply for asylum. Most other arriving aliens are entitled to ordinary removal proceedings.\n\nWhat I am not sure about is the case of an arriving alien who presents an Advance Parole document. Most such aliens will be paroled into the United States without issue; however, parole is granted at the discretion of CBP, so it is possible that the inspector may want to refuse entry. As an Advance Parole document arguably is not a valid entry document for either an immigrant or a nonimmigrant, I wonder whether CBP can place such an alien in expedited removal proceedings, denying them the ability to have their case heard before an immigration judge.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe that people with Advance Parole who are not paroled are subject to expedited removal. Like you said, they are inadmissible for trying to enter as immigrants (anyone not in nonimmigrant status is defined as an immigrant) without an immigrant visa. The definition of \"arriving alien\" in [8 CFR 1\\.2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1.2) and [8 CFR 1001\\.1(q)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1001.1#q), for expedited removal purposes, excludes people paroled before 1997, and people paroled after 1997 pursuant to an AP granted before they left, but neither of these exclusions cover people with AP who were not paroled, so the person in your case should still be an \"arriving alien\":\n\n> An arriving alien remains an arriving alien even if paroled pursuant\n> to section 212(d)(5\\) of the Act, and even after any such parole is\n> terminated or revoked. However, an arriving alien who was paroled into\n> the United States before April 1, 1997, or who was paroled into the\n> United States on or after April 1, 1997, pursuant to a grant of\n> advance parole which the alien applied for and obtained in the United\n> States prior to the alien's departure from and return to the United\n> States, will not be treated, solely by reason of that grant of parole,\n> as an arriving alien under section 235(b)(1\\)(A)(i) of the Act.\n\nInterestingly, this definition of \"arriving alien\" was [amended in 2006](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2006/05/12/06-4429/eligibility-of-arriving-aliens-in-removal-proceedings-to-apply-for-adjustment-of-status-and). Prior to 2006, the definition, last [amended in 1998](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1998/04/20/98-10354/amendment-of-the-regulatory-definition-of-arriving-alien), was worded slightly differently:\n\n> An arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to section\n> 212(d)(5\\) of the Act, except that an alien who was paroled before\n> April 1, 1997, or an alien who was granted advance parole which the\n> alien applied for and obtained in the United States prior to the\n> alien\u2019s departure from and return to the United States, shall not be\n> considered an arriving alien for purposes of section 235(b)(1\\)(A)(i)\n> of the Act.\n\nOn first reading, this seemed to say that someone who had an AP, that was granted before they left, would not be considered an \"arriving alien\" for expedited removal purposes (and thus not be subject to expedited removal), without regards to whether they were paroled. This would mean that the 2006 change substantively changed the situation for people with AP who were not paroled. However, the 2006 change said that the change to this sentence was just a \"technical correction\", to clarify the intended meaning of the 1998 change. On re\\-reading the 1998 sentence, I could maybe see a way it can be interpreted like the 2006 sentence, if the latter part of the sentence was all in the context of \"even if paroled ... except\", so it may all be referring to the case when the person was paroled; though I am not convinced. In any case, the 2006 text is in effect now, so it's hard to argue that they are not \"arriving aliens\".",

The Advance Parole document is not considered a valid entry document for either immigrant or nonimmigrant purposes. Therefore, such an individual can be placed in expedited removal proceedings under INA 235(b)(1)(A)(i) for lacking valid entry documents. The 2006 amendment to the definition of \"arriving alien\" clarified that only those who were actually paroled into the US pursuant to an Advance Parole granted before departure are excluded from being treated as arriving aliens for expedited removal purposes. Since this individual was denied parole, they remain subject to expedited removal."

The test takes over ten minutes.\n\nThere are two confusions I have. The first one is that, as I've learned on Wikipedia the whole point of the test is to establish probable cause for which to arrest someone. As you could see from the video this takes so much time, and the instructions aren't very clear for someone performing this for the first time. Would a breathalyser test not also establish probable cause?\n\nAlso, as I've seen on Wikipedia there is controversy over the use of such tests, and rightly so, as there have been studies that have shown how accurate or useful they are:\n\n> \"After viewing the 21 videos of sober individuals taking the\n>  standardized field tests, the police officers believed that forty\\-six\n>  percent of the individuals had 'too much to drink'\".\n\nAnd there are other studies of the same sort.\n\nFinally, I'm of the opinion that many who have never touched alcohol would fail this test for reasons such as that some tasks are quite demanding, the mental stress and intimidation felt by the subject, and also that the instructions aren't all that clear. For example one requires you close your eyes, look up, count to 30, and then stop the task while the police officer times you. I don't believe all people would count thirty seconds consistently, I certainly wouldn't be accurate in this. Nor would I likely be able to place one foot in front of another so stringently, or maybe stand on one foot under pressure. \n\nMany of the people commenting on the video have expressed exactly what I feel, that even 100% sober I would fail this test.\n\nSo my question are:\n\n1\\) What's the point of spending so much time going through this procedure if the main point of it is to establish probable cause, which can also be established with a 5 second breath test, which is also preliminary test to establish probable cause.\n\n2\\) Isn't it unreasonable to expect normal people to pass these tests? Walking a straight line and counting the steps while remembering which foot to start from seems overwhelming to me, as does counting 30 seconds, and many of the other tests.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Florida law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0316/Sections/0316.1932.html) says that consent is statutorily deemed to have been given to \"submit to an approved chemical test or physical test including, but not limited to, an infrared light test of his or her breath for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his or her blood\". However, it is also required that \n\n> the person is lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed\n>  while the person was driving or was in actual physical control of a\n>  motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\n\n(that is, the person has to *be* arrested). Moreover,\n\n> The chemical or physical breath test must be incidental to a lawful\n>  arrest and administered at the request of a law enforcement officer\n>  who has reasonable cause to believe such person was driving or was in\n>  actual physical control of the motor vehicle within this state while\n>  under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe breathalyzer test cannot be used in a fishing expedition: you need probable cause to legally administer it, and it is not voluntary.\n\nField sobriety tests can be administered when an officer has a reasonable suspicion of intoxication and thus have pulled you over (a \"terry stop\"), but the test is optional, that is, you can refuse to take that test. The results of the FST may provide the probable cause required for an arrest and a breathalyzer test. [Mathis v. Coates](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15143252318265728138&q=Mathis%20v.%20Coats,%2024%20So.%203d%201284&hl=en&as_sdt=40006), 24 So.3d 1284 points out that \"Many factors contribute to a finding of probable cause for a DUI arrest\" (and they discuss some). The test (and failing it) can create the required probable cause for arrest and subsequent breathalyzer test. As for why people consent to the FST in the first place, it is similar to people being talked into \"consenting\" to vehicle searches after being persuaded by the police to allow the search.",

Option A is incorrect because reasonable suspicion is not sufficient; an arrest is required. Option B is wrong because failing a field sobriety test is not necessarily required if there's other probable cause for arrest. Option C is incorrect because, while there is implied consent, it's not applicable at any time without other conditions being met. Option D is correct because Florida law stipulates that a breathalyzer test can only be administered after a lawful arrest and when the officer has reasonable cause to believe the person was driving under the influence.

Section 504 spelled the beginning of the end of \"separate but equal\" for people with disabilities.\n\nWho is protected under 504? \"Any person who (1\\) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2\\) has a record of such an impairment or (3\\) is regarded as having such an impairment.

Public universities in the USA typically contain a mix of public and restricted spaces. While some areas like outdoor campus grounds, libraries, and certain lecture halls may be open to the public, other areas have restricted access. The question highlights that people can often enter campuses, sit in on lectures, and use libraries, suggesting some public accessibility. However, the answer also emphasizes that not all state-owned property is considered public space, citing examples like national guard installations and state workers' offices. This indicates that public universities can and do have areas with limited access or expectations of privacy, such as research laboratories, administrative offices, or dormitories. The university has the authority to set policies determining which spaces are open to the public and which have restricted access, balancing the institution's public nature with the need for security, privacy, and effective operations."

As far as I know, it is a requirement in every state that you declare that state your primary residence in order to receive a driver's license. As a practical matter, this makes it more difficult to register to vote in more than one place, and makes it easier to determine the best place to call you for jury duty, among other things. As part of that declaration, the state issuing the license is requiring that you surrender your other license because it prevents you from trying to use it to defraud the other state by claiming you are still a resident there. As was pointed out in comments, the states don't necessarily communicate to each other that a license was surrendered, but in order to get another copy you would have to certify that you are primarily a resident of the other state again, which would be perjury.\n\nThis doesn't really have to do with the Full Faith and Credit clause, since the states aren't refusing to accept the records of the other state. To the contrary, the few times I've changed my license I can use my old state's license to prove my ability to drive \\- the new state puts their faith in my proper testing by the old state, rather than forcing me to retake a test (in fairness, they also accept out of country licenses of their own volition, having to redo tests for everyone moving to the state would be a huge drain on resources for little gain). For what it's worth, while it seems like states usually ask that drivers change to the state's license within x days of moving to the state, I've never actually seen a penalty attached to failure to do that, and for the purpose of certifying your ability to drive valid out\\-of\\-state licenses are always accepted, even if there were a penalty for failing to change them after you move to the state.",

New Hampshire's law requiring the surrender of out-of-state licenses does not violate the Full Faith and Credit clause because its primary purpose is to prevent individuals from holding multiple valid driver's licenses, which could lead to fraud or misrepresentation of residency. This requirement is common across states and is related to establishing primary residency, rather than questioning the validity of other states' licenses.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because New Hampshire, like other states, generally does recognize the validity of other states' licenses and often allows new residents to transfer their driving privileges without retaking tests.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the Full Faith and Credit clause does apply to various state documents and records, including driver's licenses. The issue here is not about recognizing the validity of the license, but about preventing dual residency claims.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the primary purpose of the law is not to generate revenue, but to ensure accurate residency records and prevent potential fraud."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Inspired by [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/3966/10): Suppose I'm paranoid (perhaps justifiably) that law enforcement personnel might conduct a warranted raid of my property. So I setup booby\\-traps that are designed to either:\n\nA. Destroy any evidence I think they might look for, or, more extremely,\n\nB. Destroy the property *and anyone on it* in the event that it is raided.\n\nWe know from [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/3392/10) and [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/968/10) that I owe trespassers some duty of care. Being an (otherwise) law\\-abiding citizen, I post explicit warnings within the perimeter of my property, which I have secured against trespass by anybody but a very determined attacker. I.e., the only way the police could see the warnings is if they have entered for a raid, at which point the warnings state, \"If you go any further into this property you will trigger devices that will destroy the property and kill all persons therein.\"\n\nSure enough, the police get a no\\-knock search warrant, breach the outer perimeter, and stop at the warnings. At this point can I be compelled by a court to grant safe access for law enforcement to carry out the search warrant?\n\nAnd if, despite the clear warning, the police decide to press on with their search and an officer is injured or killed, can I be held criminally or civilly liable for that casualty?\n\n---\n\nNotes \\& clarifications from comments:\n\n* I'm revealing my *mens rea* in this question, but objectively I have merely secured the property and warned determined trespassers. The police can lawfully search, but do I have a *duty to make my premises safe to search*? Am I *ex ante* liable for their injuries, given the suitable warning? Or can they say, \"If you don't make it safe to search, you're liable for our injuries?\" At which point haven't they compelled me to incriminate myself, meaning that I can disarm the traps but all the premises' contents are then \"poisoned\" evidence?\n* Practically speaking it's not hard to rig thermite to destroy evidence without endangering anyone not in close proximity. But then, destruction of evidence is a crime, *and* I'd rather not destroy my valuable stash of whatever. Or, again, maybe I don't have anything to hide but on principle I *really* don't want police in my house. So part of the motivation here is to determine: can one construct a scenario that would flat\\-out deter the search?\n* One analogy that might illuminate this is to consider a hazmat factory: It is secured, it has warnings, and if police barge in and start tossing things without adequate protection they could be injured or killed. So in real life \u2013 even just approaching suspected meth labs \u2013 the police bring in hazmat specialists. They don't say, \"Please render your lab safe for us to search,\" and I don't *think* they say, \"We got hurt raiding your lab, so that's on you.\" In this hypothetical there is no specialist they can call because the exact threat is unknown, and designed to be unknowable in advance. In fact, *I could just be bluffing and not have any boobytraps*.\n* Another reference point that occurs to me: when police are confronted with non\\-trivial explosive devices, whenever possible it seems they prefer to just clear a safety perimeter and destroy the device than to try to approach and disarm it.\n* One last point of reference I came across: There is one such example in existence in the U.S.: [Fugitive John Joe Gray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joe_Gray) has kept police from entering his property to arrest him for 16 years, simply because no sheriff has considered it worth the risk.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, you cannot booby trap your property, period. It is both illegal and tortious. But, as you noted, there are already questions/answers that deal with this issue.\n\nSure enough, if the police get a no\\-knock search warrant, that in and of itself is the Court order allowing entry by any means necessary. When the officers, there by right of law, breach the outer perimeter and stop at the warnings, **they will not be seeking any *other* court orders** to have you *allow* them \"safe entry\". Their warrant gives them all the right they need, as probable cause of crime and violent intent or intent to destroy evidence was already presented to a judge. If, in real life, you actually put up signage or state explicitly that they're being forewarned that you intend to harm, trap, maim, or otherwise make it unsafe to enter; or that doing so will result in an attempt to destroy evidence, that is something they have already assumed (hence the seeking and granting of the no\\-knock vs. a regular search warrant). However, the signs in and of themselves are not protected speech, but rather overt threats, and that would put you in a very precarious position indeed. \n\nIf the police get a \"no knock\" warrant (the most invasive, difficult to get warrants, whereby there is a grave risk of destruction of evidence or injury to persons), the police will ensure they have safe passage \u2013 they've come prepared for dangerous entry long before your signs, but once they see them, you could rest assured they will take them as they are intended: as a ***direct threat to their safety***, and they will deploy a SWAT or other heavily armed entry team (who is usually there anyway for these dangerous entries). You could expect things like smoke/out canister and teargas, flash bangs, and heavily armed and well armored officers attempting to force you from your dwelling. Presumably, if you need to disarm traps to escape the situation, they can enter. Assuming you're home when they invade with chemical weapons, whether you come out or not, they will force you to disarm whatever booby trapping you may have in place that may destroy evidence, likely walking you in as their human shield in the event you're lying about any dangerous ones. That is probably your best case scenario. They may just decide to throw you through the perimeter once they get their hands on you, just to see what happens!\n\nIf you don't exit and are home or if you are lucky enough to be out, the bomb squad, ATF, and SWAT will converge on your property in less than typical means. Because from your warning they can assume some incendiary or explosive device exists, bringing it into the jurisdiction of other agencies. If they cannot disarm the trap, they would send a robot in first to set it off, or cut through your roof, or knock down a wall \u2013 whatever it takes to get in without using a typical means of ingress/egress, so as not to chance your trap. Regardless, you can rest assured that they will get in, and you will pay for the trap you set for law enforcement. Further, to whatever charges you'd have been faced with from evidence flowing from the original warrant will now be added additional charges like attempted murder of a peace officer; if you have any roommates or known associates: conspiracy to do those things; attempted destruction of evidence, criminal interference with a police investigation ... all at a minimum. If anyone is *actually* harmed, your signage offers you no shield from criminal or tort liability, and you will be lucky to live through the experience once they get their hands on you. Police tend to not like being the targets of intentional maiming, dismemberment or death. \n\nYou have to understand that, according to this hypothetical, you are intentionally trying to harm law enforcement, or destroy evidence of your dangerous criminal activity. These are not invaders, or intruders according to the law; they are the people whose job it is to enforce the laws, collect the evidence (if you weren't getting arrested pursuant to the fruits of the warrant, you certainly would be at that point). The signs themselves would make excellent exhibits in the coming case of *State v. you*.\n\nBTW: The only reason they have left John Joe Gray alone is that he knows the Henderson County Sheriff Ronny Brownlow, who has been told that the ATF, FBI, and State SWAT, would all be happy to enter and get or kill Mr. Gray if need be. Since the Sheriff never filed any federal charges, and has determined that he doesn't want to breach (and it's in his jurisdiction to determine this), the Sheriff, aware that Gray's entire family is holed up in the \"compound\", decided it's not worth going in. It's as well known as it is anomalous. When the police want in, and have the right to get in, they will get in. That Sheriff just decided it's not worthwhile.",

If I can get both companies to forego any kind of \"you can't work for anyone else\" clause in our employment contract, can I work both jobs with telling either company about the other?\n2. If I'm on salary (not hourly), i.e. I'm presumably being paid for my output, not my time, is it illegal to effectively share the same time slot (9am\\-5pm) between the two jobs?\n3. Assuming all of this goes well, is this illegal from the government's perspective?

If they find out, they may fire you. Whether or not this rises to the level of fraud whereby they could sue you depends on what false thing you said to get the job offer. You might get a good idea by reading the employment contract to see what makes you think this is a \"9\\-to\\-5\" job, and exactly what you are supposed to do. For example if both contracts say that you will work exclusively on the assignments by company A / B between 9 and 5 EST, M\\-F, and you agree to this, then you have materially misrepresented what you will do, which is fraud. But if the contract simply says that you will get the job done and will \"make yourself available\" for some of those hours, then it's not obviously fraud. Still, they can fire you if they don't like what you're doing. An alternative is that you could ask if they would allow you to burn the candle at both ends, which avoids any issue of fraud. If you're that good, you can offer one or both of them a week of trial dual\\-employment for a reduced rate, to persuade them.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal and ethical implications of this decision?\n\nA) As long as John can complete the work for both companies, there are no legal or ethical concerns with this arrangement.\n\nB) John must inform both companies about his dual employment to avoid potential fraud charges, even if there's no explicit clause prohibiting outside work.\n\nC) If John's contracts don't specifically prohibit outside work and don't require exclusive 9-5 availability, he may be able to work both jobs, but risks termination if discovered.\n\nD) The IRS will flag John's dual employment as suspicious and may initiate a criminal investigation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the information provided. While the IRS generally doesn't care about multiple employments, the main concern is with the employers. If John's contracts don't explicitly prohibit outside work or require exclusive 9-5 availability, he may technically be able to work both jobs. However, this approach carries significant risks:\n\n1. If discovered, both employers would likely terminate John's employment.\n2. Depending on the exact wording of the contracts and any representations John made during the hiring process, there could be potential for fraud allegations.\n3. Even without explicit prohibitions, many employers expect full-time dedication during working hours.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are potential legal and ethical concerns, even if John can complete the work. Option B overstates the legal requirement - while disclosure might be ethically preferable, it's not always legally required if the contracts don't demand it. Option D is incorrect because the IRS typically doesn't investigate dual employment as criminal activity, as long as all income is properly reported."

For example, from Germany to the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, GDPR does allow transfers of data to outside the EU, but under conditions. The GDPR does not require that data remain in the EU/EEA. However, it does require that transfers into non\\-EEA countries (international transfers) comply with the rules in GDPR Chapter 5, starting with Art 44\\.\n\nThere are a couple of legal bases for transfers:\n\n* Art 45: the target country has an adequate level of data protection, as recognized by an EU adequacy decision. Examples of such countries are Japan, Canada (partial), Switzerland, Israel, and Uruguay. The procedure for adding the United Kingdom is under way (as of Jan 2020\\).\n* Art 46\u201347: the sender and recipient of the personal data implement appropriate safeguards, e.g. implemented through enforceable contract mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).\n* Art 49: for occasional transfers, there are some fallbacks such as explicit consent of the data subject\n\nThe EU and US did have the Privacy Shield treaty. US companies could self\\-certify under the Privacy Shield mechanism, and were then covered by an adequacy decision. However, this mechanism was deemed invalid in the Schrems II ruling. Furthermore, US companies might not be legally able to comply with the SCCs and BCRs they have signed, due to US mass surveillance laws. This leads to the following situation:\n\n* Following the Schrems II ruling and subsequent guidance by regulators (e.g. [EDPB Recommendations 01/2020](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/public-consultations-art-704/2020/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en)), personal data cannot be transferred into the US unless substantial additional safeguards are implemented, such as only transferring the data in pseudonymized or end\\-to\\-end\\-encrypted form. SCCs alone are not sufficient.\n* In practice, nearly everyone in the industry is following the legal fiction that updated SCC terms are sufficient to authorize the international transfers. This is technically correct since SCCs were not invalidated through the Schrems II ruling, but not a tenable position given the aforementioned guidance.",

Additional safeguards are required.\n\nOption C is clearly non-compliant as it lacks any of the required legal bases or safeguards for international data transfers under GDPR.\n\nOption D is the most compliant scenario. It uses SCCs as a legal basis, which is still valid, but also implements additional safeguards (pseudonymization and technical measures to prevent re-identification) as recommended by regulators following the Schrems II decision.

I'm wondering about things like, could clearly harmless behavior (say, lifting a pack of gum with your left hand on a Tuesday) be criminalized without the law being unconstitutional, or how much discretion does the legislature have to determine whether it wants to consider behavior harmful.\n\nAs an example, in German law the Grundgesetz starts with an enumeration of fundamental rights that get divided into liberty rights and equality rights by legal theorists depending on what the individual right protects. [Art. 2 GG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0026) acts as a generic right to liberty in case any of the specific liberty rights (such as freedom of [assembly](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0054), of the [press](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0037), of [religion](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0033)) don't cover something. A law criminalizing wearing blue lipstick for example would be a clear violation of Art. 2 GG, so the legislature is limited in that sense.\n\n**Question:** What constitutional limits exist for US lawmakers to criminalize behavior?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of specific limitation on what can be made criminal in US law, derived from constitutional protection.\n\nSpecific Rights\n---------------\n\nExpressions of free speech, for example, cannot be made criminal, although there can be laws which regulate or impact speech to a degree. Similarly, the establishment clause of the First Amendment prohibits a law requiring people to attend a particular church, and he free Exercise clause prohibits any criminal penalties for any religious practice or lack of practice.\n\nMost of the other provisions of the Bill of right would impose similar limitations. The legislature cannot criminalize what people have a constitutional right to do.\n\nThre are also specific limitations not in the bill of rights, such as the prohibition of *Ex Post Facto* laws, the right to trial by jury, and the constitutional limitation of Treason laws.\n\n### Rational Basis\n\nBeyond that the Due Process clause of the 5th and the parallel clause of the 14th impose limits on criminal law generally. Criminal laws must have (at least) a *rational basis*. The legislature cannot just prohibit picking up papers because they felt like it, they must have articulated a problem and a plausible reason why a given law would address it. If they don't the law may be overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nIf a law is challenged as being unconstitutional, it will currently either be subject to rational basis analysis, or to one of the stricter levels. However a law which cannot pass rational basis analysis will not survive intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny either. Laws which appear to invade one of the enumerated rights, or a right that the Court has deemed \"fundamental\" are normally tested under either strict or intermediate scrutiny.\n\nAccording to the the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_basis_review):\n\n> Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law is \"rationally related\" to a \"legitimate\" government interest, whether real or hypothetical. The higher levels of scrutiny are intermediate scrutiny and strict scrutiny.\n\n...\n\n> laws implicating unenumerated rights that the Supreme Court has not recognized as fundamental receive rational basis review.\n\n...\n\n> In modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both federal law and state law (via the Fourteenth Amendment). This test also applies to both legislative and executive action whether those actions be of a substantive or procedural nature.\n> \n> \n> The rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end.\n\n...\n\n> A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical *non sequitur*.\n\n(See Killian, Johnny H., George A. Costello, \\& Kenneth R. Thomas, co\\-eds., *The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002*, by Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress (Senate Document No. 108\\-17, 108th Congress, 2d Session) and specifically *Romer v. Evans*, 517 U.S. 620 (1996\\) at 635\\)\n\nRational Basis analysis became accepted after the demise of \"[substantive Due Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process)\", mostly in a civil, rather than criminal context. A version of it was suggested in [*Lochner v. New York* 198 U.S. 45 (1905\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York), in the dissent by Justice Holmes. It was adopted as governing in \\[\\*Nebbia v. New York \\*\n\nIn *United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno* 413 U.S. 528 (1973\\) The Court overturned, on a rational basis scrutiny, a law excluding households consisting of unrelated people from the Federal Food Stamp program, writing:\n\n> \\[A] bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nSpecific cases\n* In *Eisenstadt v. Baird* 405 U.S. 438 (1972\\) a law that criminalized the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons was overturned on a rational basis review. Similar cases are now generally treated with intermediate scrutiny.\n* In *James v. Strange* 407 U.S. 128 (1972\\). a Kansas law reclaiming payments for public defenders was overturens on rational basis review as \u201can impermissible burden on the right to counsel established in *Gideon v. Wainwright*.\"\n* In *Bowers v. Hardwick* 478 U.S. 186 (1986\\), rational basis analysis was employed to sustain a statute criminalizing homosexual activity. However, this was later overturned..\n\n### Vagueness\n\nAlso under Due Process, vague laws are prohibited. If a reasonable person cannot tell from the law what is or is not illegal, the law can be overturned for vagueness.\n\n### Procedural protections\n\nThen there are procedural limits, also largely derived from the Due Process clause(s). A law cannot automatically convict people without a genuine hearing, in which a person can present a defense to an independent, impartial judge or jury. A law cannot impose duties which are flatly impossible to perform. A law cannot impose punishments which are considered unreasonable for the seriousness of the crime (as evaluated by judges).\n\n### Other Limits\n\nThere are other limits as well, it would take a book to list them all in detail. But those are some of the more frequently applied ones.",

This lawsuit alleges the following:\n\n> \u2022 Non\\-legislative actors\u2019 purported amendments to States\u2019 duly enacted\n> election laws, in violation of the Electors Clause\u2019s vesting State\n> legislatures with plenary authority regarding the appointment of\n> presidential electors.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 Intrastate differences in the treatment of voters, with more\n> favorable allotted to voters \u2013 whether lawful or unlawful \u2013 in areas\n> administered by local government under Democrat control and with\n> populations with higher ratios of Democrat voters than other areas of\n> Defendant States.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 The appearance of voting irregularities in the Defendant States that\n> would be consistent with the unconstitutional relaxation of\n> ballot\\-integrity protections in those States' election laws\n\nIssue\n=====\n\nWhile the Supreme Court does have original jurisdiction over suits [between two or more states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2), this suit seems to state that the way other states allegedly failed to follow their own state law in turn led to these states not following federal law. [There](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas) [do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut) [exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_v._United_States) [cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson) where the Supreme Court invalidates certain state laws, but I do [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._New_Mexico_and_Colorado) [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._New_Mexico) [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_v._Georgia_(2018)) successful case where a state invalidates another state's law on the basis of the other state's law violating the U.S. constitution. Rather the cases I cited with two or more states seem to be with contractual disputes as opposed to one state saying that another state's law is wrong. This leads me to question...\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nCan one state appeal a suit to the supreme court about the validity of a different states' state law in relation to the federal constitution?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The direct answer is \"no\" and the indirect answer is \"yes\", that is, your way of putting the matter diverges significantly from how the Bill of Complain puts the matter. The claim is that the defendant states violated the Electors Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause. Texas claims that there is an injury in fact, citing various SCOTUS rulings e.g. [Wesberry v. Sanders](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/1/) which says that\n\n> No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a\n> voice in the election of those who make the laws under which,\n> as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most\n> basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined\n\nSee the argument in the brief for more legal rhetoric. There can be no question that one state can sue another; equally clearly, the plaintiff must show actual harm and not just annoyance. [New Jersey v. New York](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/283/336) is a case involving a question of equity, not the federal constitution, but there is no legal principle to the effect that one state cannot sue over a constitutional harm rather than an equitable harm. See the brief p. 65 ff. The court does not require that there be exact precedential analogs (otherwise, Roe v. Wade would have turned out differently), what's required is simply that there be reasonable logical steps: SCOTUS gets to decide what is reasonable (or it can decline to decide).",

Pennsylvania case?\n\nA) A state can only sue another state over contractual disputes, not constitutional matters.\n\nB) Texas has no legal basis to sue other states regarding their election laws, as states have complete autonomy in this area.\n\nC) The Supreme Court must hear any case where one state sues another, regardless of the nature of the complaint.\n\nD) A state can sue another state over alleged constitutional violations if it can demonstrate actual harm, though the Supreme Court has discretion in whether to hear the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the nuanced legal situation described in the passage. While it's unusual for one state to sue another over constitutional matters related to state laws, it is possible if the plaintiff state can demonstrate actual harm resulting from the alleged constitutional violations. The passage indicates that there is no legal principle preventing such a suit, and that the Supreme Court has the authority to decide whether the logical steps presented are reasonable. However, the Court also has the discretion to decline to hear the case. Options A and B are incorrect as they oversimplify the legal situation and ignore the possibility of constitutional challenges between states. Option C is incorrect because it overstates the Supreme Court's obligation to hear cases, as the Court has discretion in choosing which cases to take."

These scenarios involve small, closed groups watching the movie in a private setting.\n\nC, however, would likely be considered a public performance. By inviting members of the public to join via social media, the event loses its private nature. Public performances require additional licensing, even if the DVD was legitimately purchased and the venue is small and privately owned. The key factor is not the size of the audience or the nature of the venue, but whether the general public has been invited or has access to the performance.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the distinction between public and private performances in copyright law, as well as the concept that public performances require additional licensing regardless of the legitimacy of the original media purchase."

If you sue them, the question is whether accusing a person of sexually abusing a 2 year old would lower the person in the eyes of others, and the answer is \"Yes, you don't even have to prove that there was actual harm\" (this is know as *per se* defamation): it is both accusation of a crime and accusation of reprehensible moral conduct. Making the statement in public is all it takes \u2013 \"public\" means \"someone other than the object of the accusation\". The only defense is proving that the statement is true.

In this scenario, the false accusation of sexual abuse against a child is considered defamation per se. This means that the statement is so inherently harmful that the plaintiff doesn't need to prove actual damages to their reputation. The accusation involves both a crime (sexual abuse) and reprehensible moral conduct, which automatically qualifies it as defamation per se.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Derek Chauvin's current trial seems to be one of the most followed and most emotionally significant trials. Feelings and opinions are strong on both sides. Many consider it an open\\-and\\-shut case (some celebrities even state that he should be convicted without a trial), yet on deeper examination it's not all that easy for the prosecution. It's the prosecution which has to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and several of the defense's arguments (for example, Floyd repeatedly saying he can't breathe even while he was still in the car) might become a tough nut to crack. This means the trial can still have surprises, and strong emotions could be stirred up in certain groups if the results fall far from their expectations. For example, many people strongly believe that if Chauvin is found not guilty, or if his sentence is not harsh enough, then significant riots will ensue.\n\nI presented the above example as a context to my question: by deciding on a verdict, a jury should concentrate on what really happened, and not on what feelings they think might be evoked by the public upon hearing their decision. Yet jurors are all human, and might consciously or unconsciously still take such things into account. Consider the hypothetical case the jury thinks that guilt cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt, but they declare guilty anyway, for fearing a potential riot. They might rationalize that by sentencing a person they believe to be innocent, they save potentially hundreds or thousands from grievous harm.\n\nHow is such a dilemma handled by the courts?\n\nPlease note that this question is not about your opinion about what the verdict should be in the mentioned example. It's about the possibility when the judge or jury sincerely believe a defendant to be innocent but declare guilty (or sincerely believe a defendant to be guilty but declare innocent) solely because they personally believe that the correct verdict would lead to a violent riot where many innocents could die. Are such possibilities handled in any way, are there countermeasures against it, is there precedent for a case which was later overturned due to allegations of the verdict having been made for the above mentioned reasons?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The title question is overly\\-ambitious: it is not guaranteed, and nobody thinks that it is. The law does what is practical to achieve the desired result. Actual failure one way or the other is mostly irrelevant until a clear pattern to the failure is found, then there might be a legal resolution, but it might also require a political resolution.\n\nOne consideration is whether it is possible for a defendant to receive a fair trial in a certain jurisdiction. Generally, you are tried in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred, sometimes (rarely) the venue can be changed to a more neutral location. This consideration is significant in high\\-profile cases. For example, the trials of Lee Boyd Malvo and John Allen Muhammad took place relatively far away from the scene of the crime. The trial judge must weigh the arguments for an inconvenient trial location, and in this trial the judge refused a [petition for a change of venue](https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/MotionforChange08282020.pdf). The judge stated that \"As far as change of venue, I do not think that that would give the defendant any kind of a fair trial beyond what we are doing here today. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any place in the state of Minnesota that has not been subjected to extreme amounts of publicity on this case\"\n\nA second layer of protection is that prospective jurors may be excused. If a juror declares in advance (during voir dire or elsewhere) that the defendant is guilty, they will be excused for cause. The defense (or prosecution) also has some number of [peremptory challenges](https://casetext.com/rule/minnesota-court-rules/minnesota-rules-of-criminal-procedure/rule-26-trial/rule-2602-jury-selection) \u2013 in this case, the defense has 5 and the prosecution has 3\\. In this category, a seated juror can be excused for cause (this happened), when a juror admits that some news e.g. about the city's settlement had prejudiced the juror. Also related to juror selection is that juror must swear to follow the law in reaching a decision.\n\nThe third layer of protection is limiting testimony, for instance if the prosecution were to ask a witness something like \"Won't there be major riots if Chauvin isn't convicted?\", the defense would presumably object and prevent such testimony from getting uttered in the first place, or getting officially stricken if it somehow gets out.\n\nThe fourth layer of protection is that jurors are meticulously instructed as to the logic of decision\\-making. If you can find a copy, there are [here](https://mn.gov/law-library/how-do-i-find/jury-instructions.jsp) (MN does not make the instructions freely publicly available). [Here](https://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/calcrim-2021.pdf) are the California instructions.\n\nAdditionally, a judge might attempt to limit what can be said by the media, or might sequester the jury so that they cannot hear any such publicity during the trial (but that's impossible for pre\\-trial publicity).\n\nAnother layer is that a mistrial can be declared. However, what goes on in the jury room is in a black box that the legal system cannot generally touch. If a juror was paid off, that could be touched by the legal system, but there is nothing that can be done if it turns out that a juror has a bias in favor of the prosecution, despite the premise of neutrality.\n\nFinally, if the facts are so clear, a judge might overturn a conviction on the grounds that a reasonable jury could not reach that conclusion, based on the facts and the law.\n\nBy \"final\" I ignore the possibility of an appeal.",

In fact, the passage mentions that judges might limit media exposure or sequester the jury to prevent this.\nC is incorrect as the text explicitly states that jurors who declare the defendant guilty in advance will be excused for cause.\nD is incorrect because the passage mentions that providing detailed instructions on decision-making logic is one of the layers of protection against bias.\n\nThe question tests understanding of various methods used to ensure fair trials, requiring careful reading and synthesis of information from different parts of the passage."

Is there any statue criminalizing the violation of executive privilege?\n\nOn a related note, if the damage is done \\- something really crucial to the executive branch is revealed \\- can there be any remedy to that or is the genie out of the bottle? For example, could the information be used in a suit against the USA or will the presiding judge throw out evidence obtained through the violation of executive privilege?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A privilege is a right to prevent evidence from being used in a proceeding (even if it has been disclosed publicly by someone who does not \"own\" the privilege, e.g. the President in whose administration the communication that is privileged occurred, in the case of \"Executive Privilege\"), even when it is subpoenaed. It is enforced by a motion or request in a proceeding to prevent the evidence from being considered.\n\nSo, if information protected by Executive Privilege is leaked without the permission of the President, it still can't be used in court against the United States or the President.\n\nVoluntary disclosure by someone who \"owns\" the privilege (e.g. in a tweet or public speech or legal document filed with a court or Congress) waives a privilege, as does voluntarily placing a privileged matter at issue on the part of the person owning the privilege. For example, if you assert a defense of reliance on the advice of counsel, you voluntarily waive the right to assert attorney\\-client privilege with regard to what you were told by your attorney.\n\nThe existence and scope of a privilege is normally determined by the tribunal before which the proceeding is taking place, subject to any appeals available from the tribunal (if any).\n\nThere is no law criminalizing the disclosure of privileged information (including information subject to the common law executive privilege) *per se*.\n\nA privilege is separate and distinct from a duty to refrain from disclosing information, although the two often overlap.\n\nFor example, there is both (1\\) an attorney\\-client privilege that prevents confidential communications between an attorney and client about legal matters from being disclosed in a proceeding without the client's permission (in federal court this arises via court rule, in Colorado where I mostly practice, it is a matter of statute), and (2\\) a duty of an attorney to keep client information confidential except in special circumstances that arises from Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.6\\.\n\nThere are matters that a lawyer has a duty to keep confidential in the absence of a valid subpoena, even if the information is not protected by the attorney\\-client privilege and/or has been publicly disclosed by someone other than the client. A lawyer could lose his license for violating Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.6 (every state uses the same numbering system for such violations), and could be sued for violating the privacy rights of a client in a way that causes harm to the client, but it is not usually a crime to disclose such information (unless it is a trade secret or a national security secret).\n\nThe law governing what punishments an individual faces for disclosing information revealed in secret by the President to an individual is separate and distinct from the scope of the Executive Privilege and is governed by different laws. Often it is governed by case by case non\\-disclosure agreements entered into contractually by the person who is privy to the secrets (which usually have non\\-criminal remedies like lawsuits for money damages and injunctive relief). The consequences also depend on the nature of the material disclosed (national security matters and trade secrets are governed by different laws than other secrets) and the person to whom it is disclosed (a disclosure to a Taliban leader with whom the U.S. has an authorization for use of military force against is espionage, which is different than a disclosure to a member of Congress which is merely a \"leak\").\n\nTypically, punishments for violating a duty of confidentiality are imposed in a collateral case to one in which someone proposed to use information protected by a privilege.",

While the official might face other consequences, criminal prosecution for violating executive privilege itself is not typically an option.\n\nB is correct.

To the owner of the manuscript or to its author (me)? \nIs the owner in fact breaking copywright law by distributing my work without my permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first question is whether the transcription actually enjoys any copyright protection. \n The transcription itself is a copy of a work in the public domain. In general, the only elements of the transcription that would be subject to protection are those that arise from your creative activity. For example, if you translated the transcription, the translation would be subject to copyright protection. Consider what the product of someone else's transcription would look like: would it be possible to distinguish it from yours?\n\nI don't know whether such a test would actually be useful in court, however; it's more of a thought experiment. In fact, I should note that I do not have any specific knowledge of Canadian copyright law, and in particular I am unfamiliar with how Canada treats copyright protection in new works derived from public domain materials.\n\nBased on a fairly cursory reading of [Authorship and ownership in copyright law in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_and_ownership_in_copyright_law_in_Canada) on Wikipedia, and assuming that you were not working as an employee, you own any copyright in the work you produced. This would certainly be true of the other items you gave to the manuscript owner: \"the result of the historical research, copy of a public lecture based on the ms., and breakdown of the content.\" As noted above, the extent to which it is true of the transcription itself is not clear, but it is probably a small extent.\n\nIf you did the work as an employee, then the copyright in the work is owned by your employer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary. However, \"employee\" does not include freelancers, so the owner of the manuscript does not own the copyright in your work simply because he or she paid you.\n\nI would also note that I don't see any way for the manuscript owner to prevent you from \"publish\\[ing] the text of the transcription with an introduction, explanatory notes, etc.\" \n\nI hope someone who is more familiar with Canadian copyright law will answer, but to get a reliable answer you should ask a lawyer with a practice in Canadian intellectual property law.",

The extent of copyright protection for transcriptions of public domain works is not entirely clear and may depend on the specific circumstances and creative elements involved.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they oversimplify the situation. Option D overstates the researcher's rights, particularly regarding the transcription itself."

It can be a URL, or a demonstration of where you should click, etc.\n\nThe site don't have to be open to everyone. But they had no informations about their user's real identity. Everything they could get is at most an \"I agree\" checkbox during registration.\n\nI'm not asking about whether they can remove the user posting or using the link, but is it possible to legally request removing the link itself (in other sites)?\n\nMy first guess is no. I think it is not directly related to copyright as the user didn't post the content, and your terms of service cannot affect other sites. But then I feel there are some quite similar things seemed possible, and someone must be already trying to do this. So is it? If yes, what are those terms called (a part of the copyright license or terms of service, or something else)?\n\n@apsillers pointed out this may have something to do with the contract law. I think indeed this can be done between companies, or companies and employees. But (1\\) is it still effective if the site just let users to agree to the terms online? (2\\) If a user did it anyway, I think you can only remove the user in *your* site, or in theory you can let the user pay. But you still cannot remove things in other sites, because those sites didn't agree to the contract. Is that right?\n\nI'm thinking about a license like this:\n\n* You can use the ideas in whatever way you want (they are not patented; or maybe they are, but the fact your site is describing them cannot be patented).\n* You cannot copy the articles directly (there is copyright).\n* You cannot refer to the explanations in this site in formal documents of a company, or prove this site has promoted this idea. Or a weaker term: you have to pay to do that.\n* You can rewrite the whole things, or don't leave explanations, or whatever.\n\nThis is indeed a bad idea which I thought it must be disallowed at first. But it seemed to be weaker than what a company can have with their employees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nYou are correct in that this is not related to Copyright. Copyright is meant to protect *expressions of an idea*.\n\nAn URL is simply an address, like a street address. Can you legally stop people referring to your home address? No. Can you legally stop people from passing by and looking at your house on the street? Also no.\n\nA famous case related to hyperlink is [Ticketmaster v Tickets.com (2000\\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster_Corp._v._Tickets.com,_Inc.). Tickets.com used information Ticketmaster's website and deep\\-linked to there. The ruling established that:\n\n1. use of *information* is not infringing\n2. hyperlinking cannot be copyright infringement because no *copying* is involved.\n3. deep linking is not unfair competition\n\nIf you feel that it is necessary to avoid people linking to specific pages of your site, you may consider accomplishing this technically.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nIt does not matter whether your site is meant to be public or not. For example, an knowledge base meant to be shared internally in an organization, but accessible on the internet since staff are geographically distributed.\n\nAgain, you may think of it like a street address. A private corporate building meant for employees only. An address, like *Room C, 16/F, Example Corporate Complex, 4321 Lucky Avenue* can be shared like any other address. You cannot demand people to never refer to your office address. You can, however, setup a security post at the entrance and only allow certain guests to visit you.\n\nIn the case of a website, you may state in your terms that one cannot *share access information to any external parties*. This will include the sharing of any authentication data (e.g. password) which can be used to access content.",

Copyright protects expressions of ideas, not addresses or locations of information.\n\nC is correct. The company can use terms of service to restrict access to the site and prevent sharing of authentication information (like passwords) with external parties. However, they cannot legally prevent the sharing of links themselves.\n\nD is incorrect based on the Ticketmaster v Tickets.com case, which established that deep linking is not unfair competition.\n\nThe key concept here is that while a company can control access to their site through technical means and terms of service, they cannot legally prevent the sharing of links (URLs) to their site, as these are essentially addresses and not copyrightable content."

Is evidence looked at 100% of the time in a dismissed case? If not, how could I determine if a case related to the 2020 election had its evidence looked at before it was dismissed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A case can be \"dismissed\" at (most) any time (however, the further along in the process a case is, the less likely a judge will allow a case to be dismissed without very good reason).\n\nA case can be dismissed with or without \"prejudice\", which in this legal context means essentially \"finality\". A case dismissed with prejudice cannot be brought again, while a case dismissed without prejudice can be refiled. (Compare the criminal law concept of \"double jeopardy\", though as phoog correctly notes, \"double jeopardy\" only applies in criminal trials, while prejudice can be applied in both civil and criminal courts).\n\nMany cases are dismissed without looking at the evidence (or even having the evidence admitted to the record); this is called \"summary judgement\" or \"judgement as a matter of law\". There are generally three cases when this happens:\n\nFirst, if the prosecution or plaintiff (i.e. the party bringing accusations) has \"failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\", i.e. asked for something the court cannot grant.\n\nSecond, is if the defendant can show, that even if everything alledged by the plaintiff is true, that the necessarily elements of the crime or offense have not been proven.\n\nThird, is if there are no facts in dispute, and only a disagreement on interpreting the law.",

According to the information provided, one of the common reasons for dismissing a case without looking at evidence is when the plaintiff has \"failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\" This means the court cannot provide the remedy requested, even if all allegations were true.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes judicial bias without evidence. Judges have professional and ethical obligations to be impartial.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the question states that no evidence was examined in this dismissal, and previous trials are not mentioned.\n\nOption D is incorrect because dismissal with or without prejudice relates to whether the case can be refiled, not whether evidence is considered.

Religious organizations tend to have some immunities in the US, so I'm wondering what, if anything, carries. Tax stuff, maybe? I think there's a ?myth? about that states that searching a church is illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US does give deference to organizations that claim to be \"religious\", for example the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308), which \"Prohibits any agency, department, or official of the United States or any State (the government) from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except that the government may burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person: (1\\) furthers a compelling governmental interest; and (2\\) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\" Or the [Burwell v Hobby Lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.) case based on that law \"allowing privately held for\\-profit corporations to be exempt from a regulation its owners religiously object to, if there is a less restrictive means of furthering the law's interest\", or Scientology being allowed to [not follow minimum wage](https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2018/08/19/104721-per-year-if-sea-org-members-were-paid-according-to-minimum-wage-requirements-in-los-angeles/), or how Title VII of the Civil Rights Act states \"[This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964)\".\n\nThe greater the nexus between the conduct and the religious nature of the organization, the more deference is given. For instance, roles classified as \"ministry\", such as a priest, will be given more leeway than a more secular role such as a construction worker who happens to be building a church. BTW, as far 501(c)(3\\) is concerned, there is deference in that classification, as religious organizations do not have the same burden of establishing charitable purpose that secular organizations do.\n\nAlso, having your nonprofit be a church would mean that [Immortals](https://highlander.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal) wouldn't be able to fight on the grounds.",

The information provided shows that religious organizations do receive special considerations and exemptions in various areas, especially those closely tied to their religious nature. This is evidenced by laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, court decisions like Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, and exemptions from certain labor laws and civil rights provisions.\n\nHowever, these protections are not absolute (ruling out option A). They are more extensive than those given to standard 501(c)(3) organizations (ruling out option B), and go beyond just tax considerations (ruling out option D). The key is understanding that while religious organizations do receive special treatment in many areas, this treatment is not unlimited and often depends on how closely the issue at hand relates to the organization's religious mission."

Would this technically be fraud?\n\nAccording to the criteria from ohwilleke at [What is the differences between lying and fraud?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26586/what-is-the-differences-between-lying-and-fraud) (from a cursory glance),\n\n1.

Things we may consider less much of substance, like one\u2019s time, is growing to be recognized as loss, but in this hypo, there would be undeniably pecuniary damages, and it only depends on you to assert that that loss is material to you.\n\nIn California at least, since this would most realistically be a small claims court matter, if you were to assert that *you* consider it a \u201cminor issue\u201d, you wouldn\u2019t negate the standing on fraud, but potentially created grounds for dismissal/denial in accord with a maxim of jurisprudence:\n\n> Civ.

However, it's important to note that while it could technically be considered fraud in both civil and criminal contexts, there are significant differences:\n\n1. In a civil case, the burden of proof is lower (\"preponderance of evidence\"), and the victim could potentially pursue the matter in small claims court.\n\n2. For criminal fraud, the burden of proof is higher (\"beyond reasonable doubt\"), and prosecution is less likely for minor incidents.\n\n3.
