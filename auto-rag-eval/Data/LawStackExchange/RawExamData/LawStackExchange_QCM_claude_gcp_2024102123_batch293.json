            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background context\n------------------\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced plans to ban the social media app TikTok. The administration claims this is for national security reasons, alleging that TikTok is an agent of the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok denies these claims and has provided statistics about American ownership and employment. As a result, TikTok is currently for sale in the financial markets, with potential buyers including Microsoft and other tech giants.\n\nQuestion about this\n-------------------\n\n* What specific legal mechanisms will the Trump administration use to enforce the TikTok ban?\n* What conditions must be met for the executive branch of the government to use these mechanisms to ban TikTok, and can these mechanisms be used arbitrarily by the President or future Presidents? Do the same laws apply to domestic companies?\n* Is it possible that these mechanisms could be used in the future to select winners and losers in the tech industry at the President's personal discretion?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The authority for the ban is laid out [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/54850/4501): all that is required is putting the company on the Commerce Department's entity list. More specifically, under [50 USC 1701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701) there must be an\n\n> unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or\n> substantial part outside the United States, to the national security,\n> foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President\n> declares a national emergency with respect to such threat\n\nIf that condition is satisfied (and it has been: [we have the emergency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-information-communications-technology-services-supply-chain/)), then [50 USC 1702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1702) grants POTUS broad economic powers, including prohibiting transactions in foreign exchange, or any kind of transaction involving any right regarding any property. Under that order, one implementational step for putting a company on the list\nis an executive review involving the\n\n> Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the Secretary\n> of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the\n> Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United\n> States Trade Representative, the Director of National Intelligence,\n> the Administrator of General Services, the Chairman of the Federal\n> Communications Commission, and, as appropriate, the heads of other\n> executive departments and agencies\n\nThere must be a determination that\n\n> the transaction involves information and communications technology or\n> services designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons\n> owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction\n> of a foreign adversary\n\nand that the transaction \"is a threat\". This last requirement is the tallest hurdle that a Twitter\\-ban would face, namely establishing that Twitter is controlled by a *foreign* adversary.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Trump administration's proposed ban on TikTok relies on specific legal mechanisms. Which of the following statements accurately describes the requirements and potential implications of these mechanisms?\n\nA) The ban can only be enforced if TikTok is proven to be directly controlled by the Chinese government, and the mechanism cannot be applied to domestic companies.\n\nB) The President has unlimited discretion to ban any tech company, domestic or foreign, without needing to declare a national emergency or consult with other government officials.\n\nC) The ban requires a declaration of national emergency regarding a foreign threat, consultation with multiple government departments, and could potentially be used against any company determined to be controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nD) The legal mechanism for the ban is solely based on antitrust laws and requires proof that TikTok is monopolizing the social media market in the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the legal mechanisms and requirements described in the provided information. The ban relies on the declaration of a national emergency regarding a foreign threat (which has been done), requires consultation with multiple government departments (as listed in the executive review process), and could potentially be used against any company determined to be controlled by a foreign adversary. This mechanism is not limited to just TikTok but could be applied to other companies if they meet the criteria. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they either misstate the requirements or oversimplify the process."

Initially, I had pulled the document up on my tablet, signed it on the screen with a stylus, and had sent it back, but they insist that this is an electronic signature and that they need a real one. \n\nIs there any legal backing as to why they need a convuluted physical signature when they are not recieving the physical document? Does a signature on a touchscreen constitute an electronic signature? The touchscreen version is still my signature, and looks like my physical signature. It is my understanding that an electronic signature is a symbol of some sort from the computer, like when you type your name in a styalized way.\n\nThis is in the United States and is a FERPA disclosure form.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The relevant regulation, [34 CFR 99\\.30](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33#se34.1.99_130), say that you \"**shall** provide a signed and dated written consent\", and\n\n> \u201cSigned and dated written consent\u201d under this part **may** include a\n>  record and signature in electronic form that\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of\n>  the electronic consent; and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Indicates such person's approval of the information contained in\n>  the electronic consent.\n\nBy using permissive \"may\" rather than \"shall\", the entity is allowed to reject electronic signatures. Because the regulation adds (1\\) and (2\\) but only for electronic signatures, I would assume that there is a somewhat higher standard to be met in the case of electronic signatures (and I assume that the entity makes similar assumptions). Since the regulation gives no further information on what is necessary to satisfy conditions (1\\) and (2\\), accepting an e\\-signature carries some increased risk. The [appendix analyzing comments](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/042104a.pdf) for this regulatory change does point to issues regarding authentication, which could well feed institutional concerns over unpredictable liability.",

The FERPA regulation (34 CFR 99.30) uses permissive language (\"may\") when discussing electronic signatures, which allows institutions the discretion to accept or reject them. The regulation states that electronic signatures \"may\" be accepted if they meet certain criteria, but it does not mandate their acceptance. This gives institutions the flexibility to determine their own policies regarding electronic signatures on FERPA consent forms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the visual resemblance to a physical signature is not the determining factor for acceptability of electronic signatures under FERPA.\n\nOption B is overly restrictive and not supported by the regulation. While some institutions may require this process, it is not mandated by FERPA.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the regulation does not specify that electronic signatures must be computer-generated symbols. In fact, it allows for various forms of electronic signatures as long as they meet the identification and authentication requirements."

Or is one basically not allowed to take such trips if they are a US citizen eligible for Jury Duty?\n\nIn the US you are not required to seek permission to travel, or prove your past whereabouts to the government if you happen to miss some civic duty. They generally call up way more people than they need for this sort of reason.\n\nThe length of time you are gone or where you choose to travel is irrelevant. In my experience you are given about a month heads up. If you didn't receive the notice until you returned from out of town, and they send a follow up, simply inform them of the fact that you were gone and didn't receive the notice until you returned.\n\nJury duty is an obligation to some extent, but it is also a right and a privilege. It isn't a criminal offence you are liable for if you didn't get the notice. If it were that important to verify your availability ahead of time the notification would be sent registered mail with a signature required.",

According to the provided information, U.S. citizens are not required to seek permission for travel or prove their whereabouts if they miss civic duties like jury duty. If John receives a follow-up notice, he should simply inform the court that he was away and didn't receive the original notices until his return.

There is more to that determination than how the company labels you, but that is a starting point. Based on the minimal autonomy that you imply that you have, you would probably be found to be an employee. Then there are [limits on the number of hours](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK32) that you can work in a week or day, which they are complying with. The employer is required to [record the hours that you worked](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK28), and it is a [crime to keep false records](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK256). It is also required that an employer pay for the time you work. Therefore the employer cannot legally refuse to pay you for your labor, and they cannot legally falsify records.\n\nThe employer can limit your pay to 15 hours per week, if you work just 15 hours per week. They can also set ridiculous performance standards, whereby at the end of the week you will not have done what they wanted you to do. Their only recourse is to [dismiss you](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK127). In response, you can [file a complaint](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK200), but note that the concept of \"wrongful dismissal\" under the act is about entitlement to termination or severance pay. The arbitrator may find that the employer contravened the act, and can order them to rescind the termination. Or, before you get fired, you can complain and the arbitrator could order the employer to either modify their work requirements or else to pay you for the time worked.\n\nThe difficult point (for you) in this case is that the act does not address employer performance expectations, and employers are generally allowed to set their own performance standards. If you have a written employment contract, there might be provisions regarding termination which could help you. Without a written contact, there is no statutory provision that prevents an employer for terminating you, but they may have to give you notice and pay for doing so, as long as you are not terminated for \"just cause\". [Hoang v. Mann](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2014/2014onsc3762/2014onsc3762.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAPMjAxNCBPTlNDIDM3NjIgAAAAAAE&resultIndex=1), 2014 ONSC 3762 is an Ontario case where an employee was terminated for just case based on insubordination, job performance, inability to get along with co\\-workers and so on. On the front of job performance, the courts have found that an employer must clearly communicate standards to employees, and give employees an opportunity to meet those standards. But they do not generally decide e.g. how many units per hour an assembly\\-line worker can reasonably be expected to complete.",

Option A is incorrect because delaying payment for work performed is generally not legal. Option B is incorrect because while employers can set performance standards, they cannot require unpaid work.

And to my surprise, it is extremely popular.\n\nIs it legal for those running CS:GO Jackpot to do this? Do they need a gambling license?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Arguments that they are digital game items with no \"real world value\" is a very bad argument to be tried to use here. That same argument could easily be used for BitCoin, gold, or silver, and yet, those are all considered to have value. If you tried to make a casino that ONLY took one (or a combination of those) as payment, they'd still under the jurisdiction of the local gaming laws. I'll add the site is a raffle site and almost every state in the USA considers raffles \"gambling\". There are very specific requirements which can allow them to be operated but that site definitely doesn't follow any of them.\n\nIt doesn't matter who assigns the cash value to it, just that enough people assign cash value. That is all that matters and given how many users sites like OPSkins.com have (over one million users), I'd definitely have to say that these game items have enough people that consider them to have value.\n\nAlso, just because you use something that doesn't have value to an outside observer, doesn't mean it's not illegal. They could be using blades of grass for all that matters, it would still be under the jurisdiction of gaming laws if there is a major cash exchange for blades of grass. In reality is just means they're using a fiat currency and that makes sites like OPSkins.com money launderers.\n\nThe only reason the question wasn't raised earlier was because the only gambling site prior to CSGOJackpot.com was CSGOLounge.com which is located in eastern Europe. On top of that, it has no house cut and therefore it allows betting there to be classified as \"a game of skill\" since you can obtain an edge and consistently win. Though that doesn't mean it wouldn't still need a gaming license given Navada's recent decision to ban paid fantasy sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings from operating in Navada.\n\nHowever, with the rise of many other gambling sites, expect the government to come in and start saying something, especially given that about half of the game's population is under 18\\.\n\nEDIT: One last point I'll make is that to say the game company doesn't set any prices is also an invalid argument because Valve sets the prices for keys, stickers, and sticker capsules (which it sells all three directly to customers). These are all fixed prices in USD. While there are sales for the sticker stuff here and there, keys are always a fixed price of $2\\.49 USD. This never changes and therefore Valve pegs the \"value\" of a key to be at most $2\\.49 USD. Because they don't let you sell it back to them, you can sell them second hand at a lower rate but the basic rate is still based on the $2\\.49 initial sale price.\n\nAlso, given the current laws on digital properties, the Steam Community Market Terms of Service, as well as the IRS's rulings (which you can confirm with an IRS agent), it all comes down to the secondary transfers of items being viewed as being taxable. If it's taxable, the economic value is there and gaming laws will apply.",

The passage argues that virtual items, such as CS:GO skins, often have recognized economic value, even if it's not officially set by the game company. This is evidenced by the existence of third-party marketplaces where these items are bought and sold for real money. The argument that these items have no real-world value is dismissed as invalid, as the same logic could apply to cryptocurrencies or precious metals, which are subject to gambling laws.\n\nThe passage also notes that most states consider raffles (which these sites essentially are) as gambling, regardless of the currency used. The fact that items can be taxed and have a market value means they likely fall under the jurisdiction of gaming laws. Therefore, these sites would likely require gambling licenses and be subject to relevant regulations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly argues against this point. Option B is also incorrect; while sites without a house cut might be classified differently (as games of skill), they may still need gaming licenses. Option D is incorrect because the game company's permission doesn't determine the legality of gambling operations."

Do Organizations that receive public funds really have to follow the Constitution in the same way that an arm of the government does?\n\nAnd If the answers is \"Some do, and some Don't\", then how do I tell the difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Constitution (broadly) does three things:\n\n1. It defines how the government should operate\n2. It places certain powers in the hands of certain individuals (branches of government, federal government vs states, etc.)\n3. It restricts the actions and powers of government (originally the federal government, and thought the 14th amendment, the states, and through them, municipal governments).\n\nThe main thing is that there is a distinction between a governmental organization (which is effectively a portion of the government) and an organization that is funded in whole or in part by the government (The difference being if the government controls the organization or appoints (some of) it's leads, such as the FBI or Federal Reserve). Generally, the latter is not bound by the Constitution; however, it may be bound by laws or grant stipulations.\n\nElaborating on your three questions:\n\n1. Free Speech: Constitutionally, no one but the government is restricted from moderating someone else's speech. There may, however, be legal repercussions, but not constitutional issues.\n2. Discrimination on protected characteristics: This is not forbidden by the Constitution, at least not in the way it is is meant colloquially. The Constitution only prohibits discrimination in access to voting, and then only for race, color, sex, and prior servitude. *However*, such discrimination is *illegal*, due to *laws*, such as the Civil Rights Act.\n3. A non\\-governmental organization that receives funds from the government *constitutionally* is no different than one that does not. Legally, there may be differences.",

The Constitution primarily restricts government actions, not private organizations. However, organizations receiving government funding may be subject to specific laws or conditions attached to the funding.

It has delegated extensive authority to account holders to moderate comments posted to their accounts, including the ability to delete comments for any reason or none. This effectively allows the account holder to make rules, within the very broad limits of the Twitter TOS. \n\nA poster holds the copyright on any post that s/he has created. No one may copy it without permission, just as for any other copyrighted work. (Posting grants limited permission to copy, under the site's TOS, as I understand it.) Similarly, no one may create a derivative work, such as an edited version, without the author's permission. \n\nBut a poster has no right to post, nor to have posts remain displayed. The account holder, or twitter itself, may delete posts at any time, and may also block a poster, for any reason or none. The poster can post about this on his or her own twitter account, or elsewhere, but may not insist on being displayed on someone else's account.\n\nNote also that the copyright could only be enforced by suing the alleged infringer. Since most Twitter posts have no commercial value, economic damages would be hard to prove, and such suits are rare and do not usually go anywhere.

This is typically outlined in Twitter's Terms of Service.\n\nOption A is incorrect because deleting tweets is not copyright infringement.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have learnt recently that Scotland is a civil law jurisdiction (when it comes to private law at least), but one that doesn't have a civil code.\n\nI have also been taught that the main difference between common law and civil law is that common law uses a primarily bottom\\-up approach in which one starts from the facts of a case and works their way up to precedents, whereas civil law uses a primarily top\\-down approach in which one starts from the law and works their way down to the various situations that can arise.\n\nWith this in mind, I find it difficult to understand how civil law can be applied without a civil code. How does it work in practice?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both civil law and common law have civil codes, so that isn't the difference. It is common in civil law jurisdictions for these to be called civil codes and consolidated into the great big book of law. In common law jurisdictions, the civil code is scattered through legislation, regulation, administrative and case law and often not consolidated although, each piece of legislation typically deals with only one (or a related number) of topics.\n\nAdversarial vs Inquisitorial\n----------------------------\n\nIn a common law jurisdiction, the role of the judge/jury is to decide the dispute that the parties have brought to the court based *solely* on the arguments and evidence that they make. A judge who seeks their own evidence or decides the case based on a law the parties have not argued is making a mistake. The judge is free to say to the parties \"But what about xyz law?\" and let them make an argument about that but they would be denying the parties natural justice if they decided the case on xyz law if that law was not argued.\n\nIn civil law jurisdiction, the role of the judge/jury is to find out the truth. They have inquisitorial power and decide the case based on all the evidence, the law that was argued and their own knowledge of the law.\n\nPrecedence\n----------\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, the cases decided by the courts are just as much the law of the land as the acts passed by parliament. When a court hands down a decision on a certain fact pattern, then all courts lower in the hierarchy **must** make the same decision when presented by a similar fact pattern. These are binding precedents.\n\nIn addition, decisions of same level or lower courts (where not actually the ones being appealed) as well as decisions in \"parallel\" jurisdictions are persuasive precedents. A parallel jurisdiction is anything where the law is close enough that it makes sense to use it: Australian courts will tend to look first to other Australian states, then to England \\& Wales, Canada, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries then the United States of America and then to civil law jurisdictions. There is nothing nativist in this, it is just that these are the jurisdictions where the laws are \"closest\" to one another: partly because the courts have historically done this (which tends to lock the common law together), partly because there has been governmental will in creating harmonized laws in Australia (i.e. enacted in each state and territory but essentially the same law \\- often word for word) and partly because parliaments, when drafting legislation, nick ideas from other parliaments.\n\nIf the Supreme Court of Western Australia has made a decision on a similar fact pattern under a similar law, a District Court judge in New South Wales had better have some damn good reasons for deciding this case differently but they wouldn't automatically be wrong if they did. However, if the precedent had been set in the Supreme Court of New South Wales than the District Court judge would be wrong to decide differently.\n\nNaturally, a *lot* of argument in common law courts is about why the facts of this case are sufficiently similar/distinct that the precedent should/shouldn't apply. Also, common law judgments emphasize the reasoning that led the judge from the evidence to the conclusion and include detailed analysis of the case each party presented \\- this is because they need to be understandable to a wide audience.\n\nCourt hierarchy can be quite complex, this is the one for NSW, Australia:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXdxa.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXdxa.jpg)\n\nIn a civil law jurisdiction, courts are not bound by the rules of precedence \\- each judgement is a first principles analysis of the facts and the law. This is not to say that civil law judges do not use other judgments in their analysis but they are not *required* to do so.\n\nBroadly speaking, the common law approach promotes consistency, the civil law approach promotes individualized justice.",

They aim to find the truth and can decide cases based on all available evidence, argued laws, and their own knowledge of the law. This contrasts with common law jurisdictions, where judges are more confined to the arguments and evidence presented by the parties. Option A is incorrect as it describes the common law approach to precedent. Option C is also incorrect as it describes the common law approach where judges are limited to parties' arguments. Option D is incorrect because while civil law jurisdictions often have civil codes, not all do (as mentioned for Scotland), and judges are not limited to only consulting a code."

This is stated in Article 5, \u00a74 of Vatican copyright law. In contrast, Italian copyright law (Article 29) grants a shorter protection period of 20 years from first publication for works belonging to the State, provinces, communes, academies, public cultural organizations, or non-profit private legal entities. \n\nThe question tests understanding of the differences between Vatican and Italian copyright duration for similar types of entities, highlighting the longer protection period in Vatican law. Options B and C are incorrect as they reverse the durations or misstate the starting point. Option D is incorrect as it falsely claims both laws have the same duration."

According to the news article, he tweeted it at 1:42am EDT on the day after Election Day. However, it wasn't until 3:00am EDT that Trump secured 270 Electoral College votes (at least according to the media, since the Electoral College does not meet until later).\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, when exactly is a person considered to be \"President\\-elect\" regarding the laws to threaten the President?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US legal code regarding threatening a president is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 871 \\- Threats against President and successors to the Presidency](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/871). The first clause defines how threatening the president is illegal. The second clause starts off by defining \"President\\-elect\":\n\n> The terms \u201cPresident\\-elect\u201d and \u201cVice President\\-elect\u201d as used in this section shall mean such persons as are the apparent successful candidates for the offices of President and Vice President, respectively, as ascertained from the results of the general elections held to determine the electors of President and Vice President in accordance with title 3, United States Code, sections 1 and 2\\.\n\nSo the key here is that they are the \"the apparent successful candidates \\[\u2026] as ascertained from the results of the general elections.\" It doesn't define this phrase though, especially the word \"apparent\". \n\nIt appears that the prosecutors in the case mentioned in the question are arguing that Donald Trump became the apparent President\\-elect when, after Election Day, voting results began coming in and he was projected to win 270 electoral votes. Given the amount of stock that most Americans seem to put into the media's coverage of who wins the election (and the fact that the person in question seems to have assumed he would be president), that's unlikely to be contested.",

The only thing that matters is what a \"reasonable person\" looking at the videos would have thought. Context might make a difference; if the videos were made by an identifiable company then a reasonable person might assume the producers would have at least obtained consent and complied with their local laws about safety. OTOH if they look like they were filmed on someone's phone and downloaded from some sketchy file\\-sharing site then a jury is likely to see this as suggesting to the \"reasonable person\" that the acts shown were real and non\\-consensual.\n\n**Edit** in response to comment:\n\nThe law in question says '*An image is \u201cpornographic\u201d if it is of such a nature that it must reasonably be assumed to have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal*'. So it can still be porn even if it wasn't filmed consensually. If \"pornography\" could only refer to consensual images then the prosecution would need to obtain evidence of the consent or otherwise of the participants. This might be impossible if a participant is dead or cannot be identified. Also the definition above matches both the dictionary definition and most people's idea of what makes something \"porn\"; the point of porn is sexual arousal.",

A decent percentage of his disposable income is due to Bob's illegal activities, but he has some disposable income coming from his legal activities. Both sources of income are placed into a bank, and bob then makes payments using a credit/debit card.\n\nI'm wondering where the line is drawn for stating that someone has received illegal goods, as there is no longer a way to tell what money was legally earned and what was illegally earned. I'm wondering both in cases in which one is aware of bobs illegal activities and in cases where the receiver of the money does not know it's illegal, but could still be compelled to refund it if it were illegally obtained.\n\nA few examples of the ambiguous situations I can think of:\n\nI assume if Bob buys a single drink at a local bar this would not be ruled as spending illegal money and the bar would not be committing an offense even if the owner of the bar was aware that Bob had an illegal income source, as Bob could easily purchase a drink with his legal income.\n\nLikewise I assume if bob goes out to buy a Yacht that he could never afford with his legal income it would be considered to be purchased with illegal profits.\n\nHowever, what about a more ambiguous case. If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods? \n\nWhat if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income? Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the offense of receiving stolen goods, \"tracing\" does not usually apply. It must be the actual good stolen and not proceeds of illegal activity.\n\nTracing could come up in an effort to impose a \"constructive trust\" (usually by a private party) or \"civil forfeiture\" (usually by law enforcement) on the proceeds of embezzlement or fraud, for example. Tracing in this circumstance is governed by broad considerations of equity law and are highly fact specific. The methods are fairly ad hoc and mostly come down to rules of reason. \n\nFor example, a court might find that anything clearly purchased with clean assets that were not comingled with dirty assets are not subject to forfeiture or a constructive trust, but that the entire amount of comingled assets might be subject to forfeiture or a constructive trust up to the total amount less the amount of clean assets which were comingled. \n\nThis issue came up in the U.S. Supreme Court of *[Luis v. United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-419_nmip.pdf)* in 2014 over whether clean funds of someone subject to fraud liability could be frozen to protect the solvency of someone who may have already squandered the dirty funds when the defendant wants to use the clean funds for an expensive legal defense of the case (SCOTUS said that assets purely traceable to clean sources can't be tied up so as to prevent them from being used in a legal defense of the case.)\n\nTracing generally does not extend to a bona fide purchaser for value (i.e. someone with no knowledge of wrongdoing is paid fair market value for something or pays fair market value for an asset) of something from the person engaged in misconduct because there was no economic benefit from the transaction to either party's net worth.\n\n> What if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough\n>  that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but\n>  the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob\n>  couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary\n>  income?

His solvency at the time of the gift rather than tracing from legal or illegal income respectively, would be the relevant legal issue. Of course, if the amounts of the gifts were small, it might not be economic to sue for their return.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Bob has both legal and illegal sources of income, which he combines in his bank account. He then makes various purchases and gifts using this mixed funds. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of Bob's financial activities?\n\nA) If Bob buys a yacht that he couldn't afford with just his legal income, it would automatically be considered purchased with illegal profits and subject to forfeiture.\n\nB) Any gift Bob gives, regardless of its value, would be considered a fraudulent transfer if Bob would be insolvent without his illegal income.\n\nC) If Bob makes multiple small gifts to different people, each recipient could successfully argue that their specific gift came from Bob's legal income, protecting them from any legal consequences.\n\nD) The legal status of Bob's purchases and gifts would depend on factors such as the comingling of funds, Bob's solvency, and whether recipients were bona fide purchasers for value, rather than simply tracing the source of each dollar spent.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the given information. The legal implications of Bob's financial activities are complex and don't follow simple rules of tracing each dollar to its source. Instead, courts would consider various factors:\n\n1. Comingling of funds: When legal and illegal funds are mixed, it becomes difficult to distinguish their sources, and courts might apply equitable principles to determine what portion of the assets are subject to forfeiture or constructive trusts.\n\n2. Solvency: For gifts, the key issue would be whether Bob was solvent at the time of giving the gift, rather than whether the specific dollars came from legal or illegal sources.\n\n3. Bona fide purchasers: Those who receive fair market value in transactions with Bob, without knowledge of his illegal activities, would generally be protected.\n\n4. Fraudulent transfers: Gifts made while Bob is insolvent (considering only his legal assets) could potentially be clawed back as fraudulent transfers, regardless of the specific source of funds used.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a yacht purchase might raise suspicions, it's not automatically subject to forfeiture without considering other factors. Option B overstates the case for fraudulent transfers, as not all gifts would necessarily be considered fraudulent. Option C is incorrect because recipients couldn't simply claim their gift came from legal income if Bob's overall financial situation suggests insolvency or fraudulent transfers."

The so\\-called \"letter from the grave\" evidence proved key to conviction. Wisconsin's Supreme Court this year ordered a new trial for the man and ruled the letter should not have been admitted as evidence.\n> \n> \n> Schroeder sentenced the defendant to life in prison without a chance of parole. Before announcing his sentence, Schroeder told the defendant: \"Your crime is so enormous, so monstrous, so unspeakably cruel that it overcomes all other considerations.\"\n\nI have tracked the case to its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Julie_Jensen) but from a quick read of the [latest decision](https://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=254948) in this saga, it's not clear why the Wisconsin Supreme Court has decided the evidence was inadmissible... other than them saying\n\n> The State asserted, as it does on appeal,\n> that United States Supreme Court cases decided in 2011, 2012, and 2015 modified the definition\n> of what constitutes a \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement and that under the revised definition, Julie\u2019s letter\n> and other statements do not qualify. The circuit court agreed and ruled that the letter and\n> statements are nontestimonial and could be admitted at trial. The State subsequently filed a\n> motion to reinstate the original jury verdict without a retrial, and the circuit court did just that,\n> reinstating the original conviction as well as Jensen\u2019s life sentence, explaining that there was no\n> need for a new trial because the evidence would be \u201cmaterially the same as the first trial.\u201d\n> Jensen appeals.\n\nSomewhat strangely for a legal decision, the exact SOCTUS cases don't seem explicitly cited. The decision mentions the [Confrontation Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confrontation_Clause); upon looking at the Wikipedia article on the latter... two 2011 cases are mentioned (one of them rather confusingly summarized, IMHO):\n\n> \\[In] Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647 (2011\\), the Court ruled that admitting a lab chemist's analysis into evidence, without having him testify, violated the Confrontation Clause. In Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. 344 (2011\\), the Court ruled that the \"primary purpose\" of a shooting victim's statement as to who shot him, and the police's reason for questioning him, each had to be objectively determined. If the \"primary purpose\" was for dealing with an \"ongoing emergency\", then any such statement was not testimonial and so the Confrontation Clause would not require the person making that statement to testify in order for that statement to be admitted into evidence.\n\nSo what were the 2012 and 2015 cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general problem with a \"letter from the grave\" is that it violates a defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause. The major decisions interpreting the Confrontation Clause from the years in question are:\n\n* [*Michigan v. Bryant*, 562 U.S. 344 (2011\\)](https://casetext.com/case/michigan-v-bryant-2) (holding that the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the introduction of hearsay statements whose primary purpose was to address an ongoing emergency)\n* [*Williams v. Illinois*, 567 U.S. 50 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-illinois-51) (holding that the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit expert testimony as to hearsay statements assumed to be true for purposes of informing her opinion)\n* [*Ohio v. Clark*, 576 U.S. 237, (2015\\)](https://casetext.com/case/ohio-v-clark) (holding that the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the introduction of hearsay statements that \"were not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence\")",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Confrontation Clause and \"letter from the grave\" evidence, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's evolving interpretation between 2011 and 2015?\n\nA) The Court established that all written statements by deceased victims are automatically admissible as evidence.\n\nB) The Court ruled that the primary purpose of a statement must be to create evidence for it to be considered testimonial and thus subject to the Confrontation Clause.\n\nC) The Court determined that expert testimony based on hearsay is always prohibited under the Confrontation Clause.\n\nD) The Court held that statements whose primary purpose was to address an ongoing emergency or were not made to create evidence may be admissible without violating the Confrontation Clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the Supreme Court's decisions in Michigan v. Bryant (2011), Williams v. Illinois (2012), and Ohio v. Clark (2015). These cases collectively established that statements whose primary purpose was to address an ongoing emergency (Bryant) or were not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence (Clark) may be admissible without violating the Confrontation Clause. Additionally, Williams v. Illinois allowed for certain types of expert testimony based on hearsay under specific circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court did not establish automatic admissibility for all written statements by deceased victims. \n\nOption B is the opposite of what the Court actually ruled; statements are considered testimonial (and thus subject to the Confrontation Clause) if their primary purpose is to create evidence for later use at trial.\n\nOption C is overly broad and incorrect. While the Confrontation Clause does place limits on the use of hearsay in expert testimony, it does not prohibit all such testimony, as demonstrated by the Williams v. Illinois decision."

As explained in the documentation, inaccurate labels or conflicting terms in an agreement are unlikely to undermine its enforceability if the intent and legal implications can still be ascertained. In this case, despite the confusing wording about \"subtenant\" and \"sublease,\" the actual arrangement (direct payment from tenant to landlord) would take precedence. The tenant would be considered a tenant in fact, regardless of the improper labeling. Courts would likely interpret the agreement based on the actual relationship between the parties rather than the inconsistent terminology used. The agreement remains enforceable, and the tenant's rights would be protected as those of a regular tenant, not a subtenant."

I have never heard of such a law. In the past, I have waived late fees for my customers and I have had late fees waived for me. Do special laws exist just for the rental business?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, there may be a statute in Chicago that makes this the law but at common law this is not true.\n\nA party to a contract has discretion to act or not act on a condition or breach of a condition by the other party. They can do this once or a dozen times without *necessarily* waiving their future entitlements. An exception is where they choose not to act *all* of the time; in such a case unless there is evidence to the contract a court will usually find that the condition has been permanently waived.\n\nNotwithstanding, exercising such discretion would have no impact on other contracts *unless* the exercise of discretion was done in an unlawfully discriminatory way (e.g. always waiving the fee for African Americans but never for other races).\n\nUnder common law, this would be a liquidated damages clause i.e. a payment for their costs in dealing with your breach. Such clauses must be a genuine pre\\-estimate of the actual costs incurred; if they are not then this is a penalty clause and unlawful \\- you may want to ask then to justify how the fee is a reflection of their costs in your being 1 day late.\n\nI can't speak for Illinois but in Australia, the making of the statement would be misleading and deceptive conduct, a strict liability offence (i.e. it doesn't matter if they were *trying* to mislead or not) with significant ($1 million\\+) fines.",

Parties to a contract have discretion to act or not act on breaches without necessarily waiving future entitlements. The landlord can choose to waive the fee for one tenant without being obligated to do so for all. However, if the landlord consistently waives fees for all tenants, it could potentially lead to a court finding that the condition has been permanently waived.

Wait for the 2030 census and January 3rd 2033\\.\n====================================================================\n\nRepresentatives are only recalculated after each census. [The last census and recalculation was 2020\\.](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment/about.html) So no ordinary recalculation will happen till 2030\\. It's unclear if there could be an extra census, which then might lead to redistricting \\- the only rules (in the constitution) I can find are, that a census has to happen every 10 years. Current laws are, that it happens every 10 years.\n\nIt's up to politics to introduce laws to allow an extra census, but to make it that obvious that it is needed, there needs to be an exodus/death toll of the scale of the black death in Europe (one in 4 dies/moves) or a total depopulation of an area like New York City. Which has 8 million inhabitants, something like 10 districts, and is [*growing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_New_York_City).\n\nBack [in 1918 H1N1](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html) killed between 2% and 10% of those that got it and in total about 675,000 (of 103\\.2 million) in the US, mainly in cities that did lag in their reaction to the fall/winter wave in 1918\\. As three (not fully) random examples: [Philadelphia lost 16000](https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/flu) for something around 941 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (the town had about 1\\.7 million inhabitants at the time), [LA had a death toll of only 494 per 100,000](https://www.influenzaarchive.org/cities/city-losangeles.html#), [all of Nebraska lost between 2800 and 7500 people](https://history.nebraska.gov/blog/1918-flu-pandemic-nebraska) on a population of 1\\.3 million \\- for \\- for between 200 and 580 deaths per 100,000\\. Yet despite this very disparate impact it barely impacted the [1920 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1820_United_States_census).\n\n[Not even the hurricane Katrina, which pretty much wiped out New Orleans, did not result in an extra census and restructuring](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/59403/10334) \\- so it is *very unlikely* to happen.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a [formula for assigning representatives.](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R41357.htm) [We use the same setup since the 1940 census.](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment/about/historical-perspective.html)\n\nLegal basis?\n------------\n\n[2 USC \u00a72b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/2b) dictates each state gets at least one:\n\n> Each State shall be entitled, in the Seventy\\-eighth and in each Congress thereafter until the taking effect of a reapportionment under a subsequent statute or section 2a of this title, to the number of Representatives shown in the statement transmitted to the Congress on January 8, 1941, based upon the method known as the method of equal proportions, no State to receive less than one Member.\n\n[2 USC \u00a72c](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/2c) dictates how many representative districts exist and how many representatives it will have:\n\n> **In each State entitled** in the Ninety\\-first Congress \\[1969] or in any subsequent Congress thereafter **to more than one Representative** under an apportionment made pursuant to the provisions of section 2a(a) of this title, **there shall be** established by law **a number of districts equal to the number of Representatives to which such State is so entitled**, and *Representatives shall be elected only from districts so established*, **no district to elect more than one Representative** (except that a State which is entitled to more than one Representative and which has in all previous elections elected its Representatives at Large may elect its Representatives at Large to the Ninety\\-first Congress).\n\n[The Redistricting is State\\-Law \\- and there are roughly 5 types how it's done.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_redistricting_cycle#Legislative_redistricting_methods)\n\nSo, one representative per district. One district per representative. District borders are to be redrawn based on the decennial census as demanded in [Art. 1 \u00a72](https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#a1_sec2) \\- where it is called Enumeration:\n\n> The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; \\[provisional numbers]\n\nWhen will redistricting take effect?\n------------------------------------\n\nRedistricting lags one term behind, and it will **not** fire or remove a representative from office, whose district is scheduled to vanish \\- or elect new people. That's because redistricting on the state level can only happen after the reapportionment of the seats has been handed out by the clerk of the House of representatives. Reapportionment has a deadline of 25th January the year after the census. That's *after* the house term starts. Since at that moment the districts are still in existence, the term of the current holder first needs to run out before the new districts take effect. So the district ceases to exist the same day they leave office on January 3rd.\n\nA good example would be New York:\n\nThe 45th district was redistricted from the 43rd District and elected first for in 1944, and was redistricted back into the 43rd District after the 1950 census. It was last voted for in 1950, well before the results of the census were handed out and redistricting happened. So the district ceased to be the same day Daniel A. Reed left the office on January 3rd of 1953\\.\n\nThe [28th Congressional District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_28th_congressional_district) was established in 1823 and eliminated on January 3rd 2013 as a result of the 2010 census. The last election for its seat was \\- obviously \\- in 2010\\.\n\nAs a result, any changes to the district map stemming from the 2020 census will take effect only on January 3rd 2023, and a massive depopulation showing in the 2030 census will have an effect only in the elections for the house that begins its term on January 3rd 2033\\.",

If s/he were to use the same amount of marijuana today, it would not be illegal.\n\nCan the prior conviction/criminal record be reversed, expunged, or at least suppressed in at least some states of the United States because it is no longer a\ncrime? If so, what is the mechanism?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is [SB 5605 in Washington](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5605.SL.pdf?q=20200829183524), effective July 28, 2019, which allows a person to vacate a misdemeanor conviction for marijuana possession. The process allows a person to withdraw a guilty plea, or has the court vacate a conviction after a not guilty plea, and then the court dismisses the charges. That doesn't create a right for compensation for then penalty imposed, but it does remove any legal disabilities arising from the conviction. It depends on whether that state has such a law: such laws exist in a number of states, and apparently in California it does not even require application.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of marijuana legalization and its impact on prior convictions, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the process of addressing past marijuana possession convictions in Washington state as of 2019?\n\nA) The court automatically expunges all prior marijuana possession convictions without any action required by the convicted individual.\n\nB) Individuals must petition the court to have their marijuana possession conviction vacated, which results in the withdrawal of a guilty plea or vacation of the conviction after a not guilty plea, followed by dismissal of charges.\n\nC) Past marijuana possession convictions are automatically sealed but remain on the individual's record, with no further action possible.\n\nD) The state provides monetary compensation to individuals previously convicted of marijuana possession, in addition to vacating their convictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Washington's SB 5605, enacted in 2019, individuals with prior marijuana possession convictions can petition the court to have their convictions vacated. This process allows for the withdrawal of a guilty plea or the vacation of a conviction after a not guilty plea, followed by the dismissal of charges. This action removes legal disabilities arising from the conviction but does not create a right to compensation for penalties previously imposed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the process is not automatic and requires action from the convicted individual. Option C is incorrect as the convictions are not simply sealed but can be fully vacated. Option D is incorrect because the law does not provide for monetary compensation for past convictions."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My local gym shut its doors on March 16th due to a government decree requiring all non essential services to be closed until further notice. Today (March 18th) I was surprised to find out that the gym charged me for monthly membership, even though the company is unable to render its contractual services. \n\nAm I eligible for a refund? Normally I'd file a chargeback immediately, but I'm not sure if this being a health emergency gives the gym the right to charge for membership while keeping its doors closed. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under current state law, the state of emergency does not clearly change anything. The health club contract law is [here](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.142&full=true#19.142.050): the crucial thing is, you have to read the contract. The law did not anticipate a governmentally\\-mandated shutdown, but does address the question of cancellations in RCW 19\\.142\\.040(7\\). The two most\\-relevant conditions are:\n\n> (c) If a contract extends for more than one year, the buyer may cancel\n>  the contract for any reason upon thirty days' written notice to the\n>  health studio;\n> \n> \n> (d) If the health studio facilities are *permanently* closed and\n>  comparable facilities owned and operated by the seller are not made\n>  available within a ten\\-mile radius of the closed facility;\n\nBut, I assume neither is actually applicable (membership is not longer than a year, the closure is not permanent). (8\\) also requires \"Clauses explaining the buyer's right to a refund and relief from future payment obligations after cancellation of the contract\" (that is, they have to say what your rights are).\n\nThere is nothing illegal about a contract clause that says something like \"If the facility is temporarily shut down due to circumstances beyond our control, we will extend your membership (obligation) by the duration of the shut\\-down\". As a general matter of contract law, one party cannot unilaterally modify the term of a contract, unless there is a clause that permits them to do so. State law *requires* that the contract have a stated duration. So one argument that you could make is that without an escape clause in the contract, they are in government\\-mandated breech of contract. (But it is highly likely that there is some such clause in the contract). The crucial legal question is, what gives you the right to cancel the contract? *If* you have such a right, then the law also states the pro\\-rata refund requirements.",

The documentation emphasizes that the legality of charging members during a shutdown largely depends on the specific terms outlined in the individual membership contract. The state law does not explicitly address government-mandated shutdowns, and the ability to cancel or receive refunds is primarily governed by the contract terms. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the gym is not automatically in breach of contract; it depends on the contract's provisions. \n\nOption B is false as the state law does not explicitly prohibit charging during government-mandated closures. \n\nOption C is overly broad and not supported by the given information; cancellation rights are typically specified in the contract and may not apply to all temporary closures.\n\nOption D accurately reflects that the contract terms are crucial in determining the legality of charges and members' rights during a shutdown."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Wikipedia:\n\n> It originates from the Roman legal concept that obvious calculation errors in a court decision are not harmful to the decision itself and can be corrected at any time. Figuratively it also describes the concept that a judge does not \"add up\" the number of arguments but instead bases his or her decision on the strength of those arguments.\n\nWiktionary:\n\n> The principle that a judge should base their decision on the strength of the arguments rather than their quantity.\n\nBriefly googling I'm unable to find any more definitive sources/references, which are what I'm looking for.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The form *calculat* is late Latin, and so we may not find this exact phrasing in our earliest Roman sources. The general principle regarding correction of numerical errors is in the Digest of Justinian (530\\-533\\), which deals in 49\\.8 with decisions which can be rescinded without an appeal. The authority cited is Aemilius Macer, a jurist of the third century, whose work *De Appellationibus* (\"On Appeals\") is quoted as [saying](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/justinian/digest49.shtml):\n\n> si calculi error in sententia esse dicatur, appellare necesse non est: veluti si iudex ita pronuntiaverit: \"cum constet titium seio ex illa specie quinquaginta, item ex illa specie viginti quinque debere, idcirco lucium titium seio centum condemno\": nam quoniam error computationis est, nec appellare necesse est et citra provocationem corrigitur. sed et si huius quaestionis iudex sententiam centum confirmaverit, si quidem ideo, quod quinquaginta et viginti quinque fieri centum putaverit, adhuc idem error computationis est nec appellare necesse est: si vero ideo, quoniam et alias species viginti quinque fuisse dixerit, appellationi locus est.\n\nTranslation [from Samuel P. Scott, 1932](https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D49_Scott.htm#VIII):\n\n> If an error in the calculation is alleged to exist in the decision, it is not necessary to appeal, for instance, if the judge decides as follows: \"As it is proved that Titius owes Seius fifty sesterces for such\\-and\\-such an article, and also twenty\\-five for another; therefore I hold that Lucius Titius shall pay Seius a hundred sesterces;\" because, as the mistake is one of computation, it is not necessary to appeal, and it can be corrected without doing so. If, however, the judge of this question should render a decision for a hundred sesterces, for the reason that he thought that fifty and twenty\\-five made a hundred, still, the same mistake is one of computation, and it is not necessary to appeal. But when the judge decides that there is another sum of twenty\\-five sesterces due, there will be ground for appeal.\n\nAnother maxim for this situation is *error calculi non nocet*, an error in calculation does no harm. In the Corpus Iuris Civilis, 2\\.5, a similar formulation is attributed to a ruling from the co\\-Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, so the same rough time as Macer: *errorem calculi ... veritati non adferre praeiudicum*, an error in calculation does not prejudice the truth. The \"*non nocet*\" phrase can be found in much later sources, such as the 14th century [commentary](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IRk2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA129-IA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) by [Baldus de Ubaldis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldus_de_Ubaldis) on Justinian. I think that this is a more precise and common term than *iudex non calculat* for that idea.\n\nThe cited law is that a judge can correct their own calculational error, to make the outcome accord with the just outcome they had intended. The form *iudex non calculat* matches this idea for saying that the arithmetical working is not primary, but rather something that is deduced from the decision. This is also a feature of modern law systems, wherein obvious mistakes in court orders can be corrected by the court itself, on application.\n\nFor the secondary meaning, assessing the strength of arguments rather than their quantity, this is so commonplace that it's hard to identify any particular source. It's certainly an idea we find in Cicero's rhetoric. His *Orator*, for example, [has](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9776/pg9776-images.html):\n\n> The stress of an argument does not always, and in every cause, depend upon similar topics. He will, therefore, exercise his judgment; and not only discover what may be said, but thoroughly examine the force of it. ... An Orator, therefore, should carefully examine each, that he may be able to select with propriety. Otherwise, how can he enlarge upon those which are most pertinent, and dwell upon such as more particularly affect his cause?\n\nCicero is suggesting that we should choose and hone our strongest arguments, not just reel off everything we can think of. Inclusion of weak or irrelevant material may make the overall case weaker, as well as trying the patience of the listener. I've heard similar sentiments from contemporary judges, so it's clearly something we've been struggling with for a couple of thousand years and counting.\n\nThe phrase \"*iudex non calculat*\" does not appear to have much current live use: perhaps mainly jurists disclaiming any interest in figures, using the phrase slightly ironically.",

The digest cites Aemilius Macer's work \"De Appellationibus,\" which discusses how calculation errors in judgments can be corrected without requiring an appeal. This aligns most closely with option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, although Cicero did discuss the importance of argument quality over quantity, this specific phrase is not attributed to him.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while Baldus de Ubaldis did comment on related principles, he did not coin this specific phrase.\n\nOption D is incorrect as the principle has clear historical roots in Roman law, not a modern origin.\n\nThe question tests understanding of legal history, the origins of legal principles, and the ability to distinguish between related but distinct concepts in legal philosophy."

But there are exceptions, and they vary depending on the jurisdiction: country, state/province, and even city or county in many places. \n\nYou mention a claim that the property should not be leased \"because the owner needs it\". In some jurisdictions, there is a special exception if the owner personally, or a member of the owner's immediate family, intended to live in the property.

There may also be local tenant assistance organizations, run by the government or by non\\-profit groups, who will know local law and can assist in such cases.

The fact he did not know them is actually quite deplorable. To your questions specifically: \n\n> Should Mr. Petersen, as a Juris Doctor, know of those things in his sleep?\n\nThis is the wrong question. The question is: should an individual who has accepted a nomination to serve as a federal judge on the U.S. District Court know of those things in his/her sleep? The answer is unequivocally yes. One could almost argue \\- one would likely be scoffed at, but one could \\- that an appointment to a higher court, the U.S. Circuit, could get away not knowing those things 'in his/her sleep,' because appeals courts would not deal with, e.g., abstention doctrines or whether to admit expert scientific testimony, *as often* as a trial court does. \n\nSimply put, lawyers should at least have heard of those things (he looked/sounded absolutely dumbfounded at the words that were being said to him), litigators should know them, and federal trial court judges absolutely need to know those things to do the job. \n\n> Is his excuse valid when he says that he has no background in the\n>  field(s) (he mentioned litigation once) the terms are corresponding\n>  to?\n\nIf he was just some lawyer talking to some guy at a bar, sure, totally valid.

Therefore, having twins would not violate the one-child policy, as it counts as one birth despite resulting in two children. Options A and B are incorrect as they imply punishment for a natural occurrence, which was not the case. Option D is also incorrect because no additional exemptions were typically granted for having twins; the policy already accommodated this situation."

That\u2019s the law.\n\nIn many cases, the law is not enforced.\n\nLaw is a reflection of culture and, where the culture and the law is misaligned, the law is often ignored or otherwise perverted. Unfortunately, Indian culture remains highly mysogonistic and many crimes with female victims including murder and rape are simply not enforced.\n\nJust like many laws in many countries that require genders, races, etc. to be treated equally are not enforced.\n\nThe law in India is sound. The culture needs to change. Having laws that reflect the culture a country *wants* rather than the culture they *have* impart of shifting the culture but it is insufficient on its own.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the situation regarding dowry deaths in India?\n\nA) The legal system in India does not have laws against dowry deaths, which is why they are prevalent.\n\nB) Dowry deaths continue to occur in India primarily due to a lack of severe punishments like the death penalty for perpetrators.\n\nC) Indian law prohibits dowry deaths, but cultural factors and poor enforcement contribute to the ongoing prevalence of such crimes.\n\nD) The Indian government officially sanctions dowry deaths as part of traditional cultural practices.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the complex situation described in the documentation. The passage states that murder is illegal in India, and murderers cannot inherit from their victims, indicating that laws against dowry deaths do exist. However, it also mentions that these laws are often not enforced due to cultural misalignment, specifically citing India's misogynistic culture as a factor in the lack of enforcement for crimes against women.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage clearly states that laws against murder (which would include dowry deaths) do exist in India.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the issue is not presented as a lack of severe punishments, but rather as a problem of cultural attitudes and lack of enforcement of existing laws.\n\nOption D is entirely false and contradicts the information provided. The Indian government does not sanction dowry deaths; they are illegal according to the passage.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to comprehend the nuanced relationship between law, culture, and enforcement as presented in the text, rather than jumping to simplistic conclusions about the cause of dowry deaths in India."

What d'you think \"others can make use of the ideas without infringing the patent\" means?\n\nKeeping all this in mind:\n\n1. To what extent do patent holders or applicants have a **legal** duty to share their knowledge and discoveries with others, or with the public at large?\n2. What laws or legal regulations impose such a duty?\n3. How can others benefit by such disclosures by the patent holder, during the term of the patent, without infringing the patent?\n4. How can others benefit by such disclosures by the patent holder after the patent expires?\n\nI am hoping for answers that cite law, case law, or other reliable sources.\n\nI am particularly interested in US patent law, but am also interested in the law for any and all other jurisdictions, and answers based on the law of any jurisdiction are welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The constitutional basis for all US patents is Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, of the US Constitution, which grants Congress the power:\n\n> To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\n\nSee [\"Intellectual Property Clause\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intellectual_property_clause) from Cornell's WEX Legal Information Institute.\n\nUS Patent law requires an applicant to include with a patent application \"disclosures\". As the page [\"Patent Disclosure: Everything You Need to Know\"](https://www.upcounsel.com/patent-disclosure) from *UpCounsel* states:\n\n> \\[A] patent disclosure is a public claim of data about an invention. In general, it is any part of the patenting process in which data regarding an invention is disclosed. **A good disclosure tells someone else how to create the product.** \\[*Emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the right to offer exclusive rights to people for their inventions for set periods of time. This is **only if and when the inventor agrees to adequately disclose the invention in writing.** \\[*Emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> A formal patent disclosure ... stipulates a set of claims regarding the invention, as well as other data that reveals the unique nature of the product. It should be expressed in writing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as part of the patent application.\n> \n> \n> **What Is Included in a Patent Disclosure?**\n> \n> \n> * **The Specification**. A primary disclosure or \"specification\" is a main document in a patent application. It describes the ways in which the invention is innovative compared to similar inventions and explains the scope of monopoly the applicant believes he or she has to the invention. The specification describes the item and the way to make and to use it, in clear and exact terms. Someone in the field must be able to reasonably create it with these instructions. Further, the specification notes the patent application filing date on which inventor can the rely. It also offers evidence that the invention belongs to the person in question.\n> * **The Enablement**. This explains how to create the object and how someone in the field can do so. The instructions cannot be vague or unclear, but must be exact and detailed. When the patent expires, the enablement should still be usable. This section should include any figures or drawings, with explanations. Again, you will want to show how your invention is special. So, you might want to include many details and different variations of the invention. Later, many of these variations may be deleted from the document as unnecessary. This section may be numerous pages long.\n> * **Best Mode Requirement**. The path revealed must be the best way of creating the item within the author's awareness at the time of filing. Therefore, it may include specific or unique techniques. *There should be no concealment*. A poor\\-quality disclosure can risk the appearance of concealment. \\[*Italics added*]\n> * **Claims**. This area tells the reader the exclusive rights the patent offers to the inventor....\n\nThe official page [\"Duty of Disclosure, Candor, and Good Faith\"](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2001.html) from the USPTO cites 37 CFR 1\\.56 on the duty to disclose information material to patentability. This regulation provides, in the relevant part:\n\n> **A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest.** The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to patentability. Each individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability as defined in this section. The duty to disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim ...\n\nThese disclosures include the state of prior art, as kown to the applicant and the applicant's associates.\n\nThe page [\"BEST MODE: Noncompliance with the Duty of Disclosure is Not an Option\"](https://www.iptechblog.com/2021/06/best-mode-noncompliance-with-the-duty-of-disclosure-is-not-an-option/) states:\n\n> When you apply for a patent in the United States, you have a legal duty to disclose prior art that could be used to reject your application \u2014 in essence, information that may be used against you by the examiner of your application. While persons accused of a crime have a right to remain silent, so as to avoid self\\-incrimination, inventors applying for a patent have no such right. To the contrary, an inventor\u2019s failure to comply with the duty of disclosure risks any resulting patent being unenforceable.\n\nThe page [\"THE PATENT BARGAIN AND THE CURSE OF RETROACTIVITY\"](http://www.toikkalawgroup.com/blog/the-patent-bargain-and-the-curse-of-retroactivity) states:\n\n> One of the requirements for the USPTO to issue a patent is that the applicant\u2019s claimed invention be fully disclosed in the application and published in the patent. This is sometimes referred to as the \u201cpatent bargain.\u201d This is at the opposite end of the spectrum from trade secrets law, under which a company can sue for \u00a9 misappropriation of a trade secret but only if it takes reasonable measures to maintain confidentiality of the trade secret. ...\n> \n> \n> Under patent law an inventor must fully disclose his or her invention before enforceable patent rights come into being. This disclosure requirement is sometimes termed the \u201cpatent bargain,\u201d under which **an inventor gains the right to exclude others from practicing a patented invention in exchange for disclosing the invention so that it may be known by the public** and indeed practiced after the patent term has expired. ... \\[*Emphasis added*]\n\nIn general a patent application is not just a description of a specific industrial process. It includes the research by which that process was discovered or developed. That research can benefit others in the same field, and so \"promote the progress of science and the useful arts\" in helping others to do further research and make further discoveries, which can often be done without infringing the patent itself.\n\nOf course, once patent protection expires, anyone may use the patent, and the final patent documents are supposed to include sufficient information that \"one skilled in the art\" will be able to build the invention or use the process that had been patented. This is in contrast to the situation which would exist had the inventor retained the discovery as a trade secret. In that case no one would have been able to use the patented discovery until some other person independently discovered and disclosed it.",

US patent law requires applicants to provide a full disclosure of their invention as part of the patent application process. This disclosure must include sufficient detail for someone skilled in the field to recreate the invention, as well as the best mode known to the inventor for practicing the invention. This requirement is often referred to as the \"patent bargain,\" where inventors receive exclusive rights for a limited time in exchange for publicly disclosing their inventions. This disclosure is meant to promote progress in science and useful arts, as stated in the US Constitution, by allowing others to build upon the knowledge even during the patent term, and to freely use the invention once the patent expires."

At the end of last year I had enough of waiting for him to respond to all the issues we have in the property, and I've sent him a letter of claim. After that he came to inspect the property (with his father posing as a building expert) and he was very arrogant, threatened me with eviction and skyrocketing rent if he does any repairs. He talked down to me and in general his visit was extremely unpleasant.\n\nI recorded it all on my iPhone voice recorder and made a transcript of this conversation, but I didn't tell him that I'm recording it as I know that the only way to show his true colours is to do it without his knowledge (example: he phoned my solicitor after she contacted him to tell him, that we will commence legal proceedings against him and said to her, that he is an innocent victim here, that I was very happy with everything until 6 months ago and he didn't know about any problems in the property, which is a lie as I have tons of evidence to prove otherwise).\n\nSo my question is: can I ask for admission of this recording in a court, as I believe it is highly relevant and probative?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, you can ask permission from the court.

The tenant wants to use this recording as evidence in court. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility of this secret recording?\n\nA) The recording is automatically admissible in court since it was made for personal use.\nB) The recording cannot be used as evidence because it was obtained without the landlord's consent.\nC) The recording can be submitted as evidence, but only if the court grants permission and it is shared with other parties beforehand.\nD) The recording can only be used if the tenant informs the landlord about it during the court proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a private recording can be submitted as evidence in court, but certain conditions must be met. The court must give permission for the recording to be used, and an application for this permission should be made on form C2. Additionally, the recording should be made available to other parties before any hearing to consider its admissibility. This process ensures that all parties are aware of the evidence and have a chance to review it before it's presented in court.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while recording for personal use is not illegal, it doesn't automatically make the recording admissible in court.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because secret recordings are not prohibited, and lack of consent doesn't automatically disqualify the recording from being used as evidence.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because informing the landlord during the court proceedings would be too late. The proper procedure is to seek court permission and share the recording with other parties before the hearing."

As explained in the LawStackExchange answer, the document itself is not the contract, but rather evidence of the agreement between the parties. The intent of both parties (the company and Employee X) to enter into this agreement is clear, despite the clerical error in the document.

The fact that Employee X signed the document and the company sent it to them establishes their mutual intent to be bound by the terms, regardless of the mistaken name used in the text.

There is an extensive FAQ on the [Treasury website](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/countering-americas-adversaries-through-sanctions-act-related-sanctions), and the [first question they answer](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/539) explains that\n\n> Section 223(a) of CAATSA does not require the imposition of sanctions.\n> While sanctions may be imposed on potential targets in any sector of\n> the economy of the Russian Federation in the future, maintaining unity\n> with partners on sanctions implemented with respect to the Russian\n> Federation is important to the U.S. government. The point of the\n> sectoral sanctions is to impose costs on the Russian Federation for\n> its aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIn other words, may, not must.\n\n\u00a7216 says\n\n> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, before taking any action\n> described in paragraph (2\\), the President shall submit to the\n> appropriate congressional committees and leadership a report that\n> describes the proposed action and the reasons for that action\n\nwhich precludes a unilateral / universal declaration of sanctions against all entities who import arms from Russia.

But there is also a congressional approval requirement (Part 1 of the act which contains \u00a7216 is entitled \"Congressional Review Of Sanctions Imposed With Respect To The Russian Federation\").\n\nThere are mandatory sections of the law, for example the act modified the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 (22\nU.S.C. 8924\\)\n\n> by striking \u2018\u2018may impose\u2019\u2019 and inserting \u2018\u2018shall impose, unless the\n> President determines that it is not in the national interest of the\n> United States to do so\u2019\u2019\n\nbut that section only applies to foreign financial institutions.\n\nThis does not mean that Congress couldn't pass a different law with the effect you describe, just that CAATSA is not that law.",

The law provides flexibility and requires case-by-case consideration.\n\nOption B is correct. According to Section 216 of CAATSA, the President must submit a report to Congress describing any proposed sanction action and the reasons for it. This implies a case-by-case approach with discretion, but requires justification and reporting to Congress.\n\nOption C is not accurate. While there is a congressional review process, CAATSA does not require Congress to approve every individual sanction before implementation.\n\nOption D is incorrect. This provision applies specifically to foreign financial institutions under a modification to the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014, not to all entities importing Russian arms.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the balance CAATSA strikes between presidential discretion and congressional oversight in imposing sanctions related to Russian arms exports."

Notifying the bank helps secure the account, while involving the police treats the unauthorized access as a potential crime, which is appropriate given the circumstances.\nD) This is incorrect because unauthorized access to a personal bank account, even by an ex-partner, can be illegal, especially if it was done without consent and after being asked to stop.\n\nThe question tests understanding of appropriate responses to unauthorized bank account access and the legal implications of such actions."

If say spotify provides me with a file containing music, and I use youtube or bittorrent to distribute it am I not considered publisher or speaker of the result, therefore am not liable for copyright infringement? It would also seem that I avoid the obligations that are put on the providers of these systems, as the obligations section only specifies provider not user, unlike this section.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. There are certain provisions of section 230 that carve out what liability these companies have for third party (i.e. User) speech on their web pages in 230(e). 230(e)(2\\) says that nothing in Section 230 may be construed to limit or expand laws reguarding intellectual property. These services are still on the hook if users post trademark or copyright infringing material to the site.\n\nOther such matters similarly not permitted include obscenities laws, exploitation of children laws, state laws, communications privacy laws, and sex trafficing laws.\n\nAs a special note that section 230 was created to allow for emerging internet technologies and buisness to not have to worry about third party speech on their platform from holding them liable as a publisher. Thus, if I was to sue youtube for defamation of character based on a video you uploaded, calling me a Sith Lord, I could not sue Youtube (who has lots of money) but would rather have to sue you (who I presume does not have lots of money... at least not youtube/Google levels of money). Thus youtube cannot be civilily liable. It can still be criminally liable and liable for copyright infringement.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding YouTube's potential liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act?\n\nA) YouTube is completely protected from liability under Section 230(c)(1) as it is not considered the publisher or speaker of the infringing content.\n\nB) YouTube may be held liable for copyright infringement, as Section 230(e)(2) explicitly states that intellectual property laws are not limited by Section 230's protections.\n\nC) YouTube can only be held criminally liable, but not civilly liable, for copyright infringement under Section 230.\n\nD) YouTube is protected from copyright infringement claims as long as it removes the content upon receiving the claim, regardless of Section 230's provisions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Decency Act explicitly states that nothing in Section 230 should be construed to limit or expand intellectual property laws. This means that while Section 230 provides broad protections for interactive computer services regarding user-generated content, these protections do not extend to copyright infringement. YouTube, as a service provider, may still be held liable for copyright infringement if they do not comply with copyright laws and takedown procedures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Section 230(c)(1) does provide protection for service providers regarding user-generated content, it does not override intellectual property laws.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Section 230 does not distinguish between criminal and civil liability for copyright infringement. Both types of liability remain possible.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while removing content upon receiving a claim may be part of proper copyright compliance procedures, it is not automatically sufficient to guarantee protection under Section 230, which explicitly does not limit intellectual property laws."

The EU fine was based on Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position. In this case, Google was found to have unfairly favored its own shopping comparison service in search results, giving it an advantage over competitors. This practice was deemed discriminatory and an abuse of Google's dominant position in the search engine market.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Google did include competitors' services, but ranked them lower than its own. Option B is unrelated to the antitrust case in question. Option D is also incorrect, as the issue was not about charging fees, but about the ranking of search results."

However, for purposes of contract law, labels mean very little and are not decisive in a controversy. See [*Howard Trucking Co., Inc. v. Stassi*, 474 So.2d 955 (1985\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19851429474so2d95511303):\n\n> It is well\\-established that we are not bound by the label placed on a\n>  written agreement or the subjective intent of the contracting parties,\n>  but must look to the substance of the transaction in determining\n>  rights and obligations. \\[...] Words will have import and can be\n>  binding only when they describe relationships which actually exist,\n>  but not when they are merely labels which are used to alter or\n>  disguise actual relationships.\n\nSimilarly, [*Steiner v.

The individual's primary responsibilities involve contacting potential customers and closing sales deals. If a legal dispute arises regarding the nature of this relationship, how would a court likely interpret this agreement?\n\nA) The court would strictly adhere to the \"Consulting Agreement\" label, regardless of the actual duties performed.\nB) The court would automatically reclassify the agreement as a \"Sales Representative Agreement\" based on the described duties.\nC) The court would examine the substance of the relationship and actual duties performed, rather than relying solely on the agreement's label.\nD) The court would require the company to draft a new agreement with a more accurate title before proceeding with any legal interpretation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As highlighted in the cases cited (Howard Trucking Co., Inc. v. Stassi and Steiner v. Thexton), courts look beyond the labels used in agreements and focus on the substance of the relationship and the actual duties performed. In this scenario, despite being labeled a \"Consulting Agreement,\" the individual's primary responsibilities involve sales activities. A court would likely examine these actual duties and the nature of the relationship rather than relying solely on the agreement's title. This approach ensures that the true nature of the relationship is considered, regardless of how it's labeled in the contract."

By listing TechInnovate LLC as the party to the agreement and having Sarah sign explicitly on behalf of the company, it clearly establishes that the company, not Sarah personally, is bound by the agreement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signing with her personal name, even with her title included, could be interpreted as Sarah personally agreeing to the non-compete.\n\nOption B is close but lacks the explicit statement that Sarah is signing on behalf of the company, which could lead to ambiguity.\n\nOption C is not only ethically questionable but could be seen as acting in bad faith, which the documentation specifically warns against.\n\nOption D properly follows the guidance that \"If the business entity is the party to the agreement, and listed on the signature page, the authorized person who applies ink or e-sig to the document does not agree to anything by doing so,\" while also clearly indicating that Sarah is signing in her capacity as a representative of the company."

Answers on [this American post](https://www.quora.com/If-two-people-created-the-same-content-independently-without-any-previous-or-shared-knowledge-who-would-own-the-copyright) suggest both authors would have copyright, but in Canada the [Copyright Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/FullText.html) clearly says:\n\n> the sole right to produce or reproduce\n\nReproducing something requires you to copy it, but producing doesn't. The way I read this statement is that copyright is only granted to **person\\_a**, because **person\\_b** is violating the sole right to \"produce\" portion of this statement.\n\n(I'm aware that the likelihood of this happening is slim when dealing\nwith works substantial enough in size to actually qualify for a\ndefensible copyright.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Like the situation in the US, Canadian copyright law distinguish ideas, which are not protected, from expression, which is protected. See [Deeks v. Wells](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1931/1931canlii157/1931canlii157.html), OR 818\\. Person B is not allowed to copy (including copy and modify, copy modify and reproduce) a work produced by person A, so in the lawsuit, A must establish that B did copy. One form of evidence would be a video of B caught red\\-handed actually copying, but that is not the only way (indeed, it hardly if ever happens). Exact identity could easily establish copying and would be applicable to illegal downloading and other forms of IP piracy. In a case like Deeks, the question is whether two works are similar enough that it constitutes proof of copying.\n\nIn literary texts, the probability of coincidental exact identity in two paragraph of 300 words is effectively zero. Changing two or three words doesn't change that, but changing enough words does (e.g. the simultaneous existence of about 10% of words in any two texts of English is virtually guaranteed). The law doesn't have a fixed formula for distinguishing between coincidence and copy, and in Deeks there is much discussion of the expert testimony surrounding the question of copying. An example of a factor relevant to the coincidence / copy question is that certain writing styles are more templatic (see for example legal pleadings) and therefore a higher degree of similarity will arise because the authors have adopted the same abstract style.\n\nAssuming you mean \"exactly the same text\", and that the text is at least a paragraph of two sentences, it is unreasonable to hold that the two texts are coincidentally the same. However, tweet\\-identity is fairly likely, not only because of the shortness of a tweet, but also because authors draw on recurring literary memes. If it is *possible* that B copied from A (the work could have been available to B) and expert analysis of the texts does not make a coincidence analysis reasonable, A would prevail in an infringement case \u2013 even if in fact B *had* written his work independently. B has no way to prove that theirs was an independent creation.",

If two people independently create identical works, both can claim copyright. However, in a legal dispute, the burden of proof would fall on the second creator to prove independent creation. This is because:\n\n1. The law doesn't have a fixed formula for distinguishing between coincidence and copying.\n2. For substantial literary works, the probability of exact duplication is extremely low.\n3. The first creator would need to establish that copying occurred, which can be done through various forms of evidence, including similarity analysis.\n4.

Now they will send someone to serve you, and at that point you are responsible for the ticket in question.\n\nI was walking down the street, and saw a officer giving out tickets and leaving them on the windshield of the cars. I was wondering if someone were to not receive the ticket because it was placed there (e.g., really bad rain storm, or some punk kid removed it) and was unaware of a ticket being issued since they were not 'served' the ticket, how are they liable, or does it fall under the same guidance as the cameras?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Arizona Revised Statute 28\\-1591](http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/28/01591.htm&Title=28&DocType=ARS) has a specific exemption for service of a parking or standing violation:\n\n> B. This article does not require that either the initial notification or a subsequent summons and complaint for a parking or standing violation be issued or served as required by this article.\n\nThis section carves out an exemption for parking infractions in that they don't need to be personally served.\n\nIf there is no response to the complaint left on the car, the statute further states:\n\n> If it is necessary to issue a summons and complaint because there is not a satisfactory response to the initial notice of a parking or standing violation, the summons and complaint may be sent by regular mail to the address provided to the department by the individual made responsible for the alleged violation by the applicable statute or ordinance. Service of the summons and complaint is complete on mailing.\n\nWhen service is complete the court of jurisdiction has personal jurisdiction over the defendant and can enter a default judgment.\n\nYou are correct in the rest of your statement regarding moving violations reported by camera systems \\- the violator must be personally served. If personal service is not achieved then the complaint is dismissed with no record.\n\n[This article has a good explanation](http://krazlaw.com/2011/03/personal-jurisdiction-in-photo-radar-cases/) of the process for service for moving violations. The article references precedence established in [Tonner v. Paradise Valley Magistrate's Court](http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/00/68.asp).\n\nArizona requires personal service in order to create personal jurisdiction for the court. Alternatively, the defendant can waive the personal service.\n\nIn Arizona, if one takes an action recorded on a traffic camera that causes a complaint to be issued that person will receive in the mail a form that is a waiver of service. Signing such a form and returning it tells the court that you waive personal service.\n\nRefusal to sign and return the form does not remove the requirement the state has of personal service. If the state wishes to pursue the case they will need to provide personal service. If the state does successfully conclude personal service then the defendant will be liable for the initial fine as well as the cost of service.\n\nFrom the article and the case:\n\n> Without completed service, the court does not obtain jurisdiction. \u201cThe incomplete service left the trial court without jurisdiction, i.e., without authority to enter the judgment.\u201d Id., Supplemental Opinion, 187 Ariz. 487, 488, 930 P.2d 1001, 1002\\.\n\nIgnoring a personally served citation, i.e., a ticket, allows the court to enter a default judgement. In the case of a citation that was not personally served and where personal service was not waived means the court never had jurisdiction in order to render a default judgment.\n\nThere is a time limit within which personal service must be completed for a complaint. I've found sources that claim both 120 days and 180 days from when the court was made aware of the complaint. Some sources also claim that the court must be notified and processes started within 10 days of the date of the infraction. If service is not completed within that time frame then the complaint is dropped and no record is retained.\n\nSo, yes, parking tickets do not have to be personally served according to statute and, yes, a person in Arizona has to be personally served with a moving violation citation. Failure to achieve proper service results in dismissal of the complaint.",

They can be left on the windshield, and if there's no response, a summons can be sent by regular mail. This is considered complete service.\n\nHowever, for moving violations captured by cameras, personal service is required for the court to have jurisdiction. The violator must be personally served with the citation, or they can choose to waive this requirement by signing and returning a waiver of service form. If personal service is not achieved and not waived, the court lacks jurisdiction and the complaint must be dismissed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because parking tickets don't require personal service. \nOption B is incorrect because moving violations by camera do require personal service or waiver.\nOption D reverses the requirements, making it incorrect.\nOnly option C correctly describes the service requirements for both types of violations in Arizona."

The key point from the documentation is that \"Special conditions that have been set by the state are always available to be re-legislated.\" This means that even if the legislation appears to target Disney specifically, it's within the state's power to modify previously granted special conditions. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because bills of attainder can potentially apply to corporations as well as individuals. \n\nAnswer B, while technically true, doesn't fully capture the reason why these actions aren't bills of attainder. The absence of declaring guilt without trial is part of it, but the broader principle is that legislatures can create laws targeting specific entities as long as they don't amount to punishment without trial.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Disney does have First Amendment rights, these rights don't provide blanket protection against all targeted legislation. The state can still pass laws that affect Disney as long as they don't violate constitutional protections.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes that the state's ability to modify special conditions through legislation is a normal part of the legislative process, not a bill of attainder."

Since it\u2019s not on the Suspects \u201cpersons\u201d and is located in the Suspects vehicle, the Smart Phone doesn\u2019t go with him to jail to be checked in as property. Instead, an Inventory Log is completed by the arresting officer of the Vehicles contents. When the Officer discovers the Phone in vehicle during the Inventory Log search; the phone is removed, unlocked, data is copied, and the phone is cloned by Officers at the sub\\-station where vehicle was taken for the Inventory Log to be completed, prior to being towed to impound. Once the Warrantless search and seizure of the Smart Phone is completed, the Phone is placed back in the Vehicle which is them towed to Impound.\n\n4\\.\nSuspect is charged, arrested and taken to jail for Possession of an Illegal Firearm. \n\n5\\.\nTexas Revised Statutory Code defines this as a State Jail Felony.\n\n**Question:**\n\nHas a search and seizure of the Suspects \u201dpersonal papers and effects\u201d (as expand upon by the US Supreme Court to include Smart Phone and its Digital contents) illegally taken place?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unless corrected, where ever there is doubt as to what happened, I will presume innocence on the part of the suspect, unless that detail was not disclosed and meant to be included.\n\n1. Suspect is pulled over for speeding. He has no outstanding warrant for his arrest in any crime and is not currently serving time for a crime. This is legal.\n2. The suspect's cell phone is in plain view of the officer when he approaches the suspect. As there is no evidence of contraband otherwise, the officer has no need to look at the cellphone.\n3. The police officer performs a warrentless search of the car without the suspect's approval. He has no probable cause to do this. The suspect has not given permission to do this. From here on out, the officer is no performing an illegal search and seizure of evidence against the suspect.\n4. The officer finds the illegal fire arm under the suspects seat, which is not in plane view. The nature of why the fire arm is illegal is not applicable at this point. Possession of this evidence is probable cause to arrest the suspect.\n5. The officer continues the search of the car and siezes it and its contents for evidence processing.\n6. The phone is now evidence and is unlocked against the suspect's will and cataloged for any further evidence of possible crimes.\n\nThe case relies on the information in parts 3 and 4 being true. If this is not the case, the an illegal search was performed. First, there was nothing in plain view that would lead the officer to suspect that there was any contraband or criminal evidence within the car (the gun was fully concealed from view of the officer as he was giving the ticket to the suspect). If he did not receive affirmative permission from the suspect, the gun would thus be a product of an illegal search, and thus would be removed from evidence in pre\\-trial motions.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: But I'm asking about the phone, not the gun. Not only is the gun gone, but any evidence that was discovered by the gun is now a product of an illegal search and seizure. The phone is what's called \"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\" and is just as dirty evidence against the suspect as the gun was. As is any evidence of a crime found on the phone. So yes, the digital contents search is illegal, but not because of the ruling on it being digital contents but because the reason for it's seizure was because the illegal search took place to get the suspect arrested and find probable cause to seize the phone.\n\nNow, this all assumes that the suspect didn't meet a few criteria... if he was a paroled convict of another crime OR on probation for another crime, the officer may have probable cause to perform the search, even if the weapon wasn't in plain view.\n\nAdditionally, for argument's sake, lets say that the suspect was speeding because he had just shot someone with the illegal gun and the police were aware of his connection to the crime in some way, because the last text to the deceased was from this guy and it asked the deceased to meet at the spot the body was found. This means that the cops would at the least be looking for him for questioning, if not already filing a warrant for the contents of his cellphone and possible search of his property for evidence. The cops could argue that they were already looking to for this guy in connection to the crime and they were looking for the phone and evidence on the phone would provide probable cause to search his property and would have found the gun that way. Because they were already looking for these specific items on this specific person, they could established discovery of them would have happened during the course of due process of the law and then the items would be back in play.\n\nGiven your story, it's likely that all evidence of the gun charge would be tossed out as valid to your case, and without evidence of a crime, the suspect will go free. The gun will not be returned as he cannot lawfully posses it, but his phone would be returned and all date the police took from it would be destroyed.\n\nIf you would like to change the circumstances of the situation, give me a heads up.",

The scenario describes a warrantless search of the vehicle without probable cause or consent, which led to the discovery of the illegal firearm. This initial search was illegal, making the subsequent arrest and seizure of the smart phone \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" Even though the phone was later found during an inventory search, its seizure and the examination of its contents stem from an initially illegal search. Therefore, any evidence obtained from the phone would likely be inadmissible in court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the inventory search occurred after an illegal initial search, making it tainted.\nOption C is incorrect because merely being in plain view does not justify a warrantless search of the phone's contents.\nOption D is incorrect because an arrest for a felony does not automatically grant the right to search electronic devices without a warrant or exigent circumstances."

Finally, I purchase all shares at this price, opening a company bank account and depositing $25,000 into it.\n2. I file forms to create Superlative Widgets Inc. as a new legal entity, with myself as its incorporator. I then create a company bank account and deposit $1000 in this account. Next, operating as the company's board of directors or other custodian, I approve the company to issue 100,000 shares. Since I am the incorporator of the company, I become its sole shareholder, owning all shares, as an immediate implication of issuing the shares.\n\nOddly, neither of the above seems entirely sensible. In the first case, it appears that I must fund the corporation with at least $25,000 or pay income taxes on the difference if I buy the shares at a lower price \u2013 this conclusion seems absurd given that the company is newborn and contains no actual content. In the second case, there is no attempt to compute fair market value at all, which seems like it may be at odds with tax law (see [this](https://medium.com/rough-draft-ventures/a-rough-draft-of-the-legal-basics-part-3-issuing-equity-to-the-founders-important-tax-and-ab93ce623517) article for example).

Should i speak with the CVS store with an attorney or something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Helping someone leave the scene of a crime\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn Lousiana, there's a statute about aiding someone in committing a felony: [Accessories after the fact](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78384). It dictates:\n\n> An accessory after the fact is any person who, after the commission of a felony, shall harbor, conceal, or aid the offender, knowing or having reasonable ground to believe that he has committed the felony, **and** with the intent that he may avoid or escape from arrest, trial, conviction, or punishment.\n\nThe first part is purely fact\\-based, and the second is the required state of mind. You need both for a conviction. The required intent makes it not a crime if for example a bank robber presses a gun against the taxi driver's head and forces them to get them to the airport.\n\n[Theft is a felony in Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78605), as it can be punished by hard labor, which is meeting the [definition of a felony in Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78337). That is, if one does cross certain bars of value or repeat offenses.\n\nSo, for simplicity let's say our felon positively robbed a bank and stole 25001 USD. Now he stops a taxi and tells the driver to get somewhere...\n\nWhere is the line between the taxi driver helpfully offering to drive the robber to safety and the robber forcing them at which point the driver no longer has the required state of mind? **That** is up to the trier of fact to decide.\n\nNow, it can be really important what is done by the taxi driver after the act of assisting. Such behavior can prove the intent or lack thereof. Let's stay with the example of the taxi driver and the bank robber:\n\n* The taxi driver, once dropping off the robber and being in a somewhat safe distance calls the police to tell them truthfully \"Your robber was at \\[that location] when I dropped him off 2 minutes ago! He was threatening me with a gun!\" \\- He clearly doesn't have the intent of having the robber avoid justice, he actually shows that he wants the robber caught. The driver even is a valuable witness!\n* The taxi driver instead calls the cops and tells them he's at an entirely different place from where he dropped him off. This might be a genuine mistake, though unlikely. More likely it is the intent to have the robber get away, the intent might be proven to a trier of facts.\n* The taxi driver vanishes into the night, and never reports anything. This is quite tricky and might or might not be seen as trying to get the robber to evade justice, but that depends on the circumstances quite a lot more.\n\nSo, to reiterate: the question for the prosecution is not just \"did the person help the felony\" but also \"did they have the intent to protect the felon?\" If they believe they can satisfy both prongs, then they might press charges. If they have trouble with the intent, then they might want them as a witness against the felon, not as an accessory to the crime.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Louisiana, under what circumstances could a person who gives a ride to someone who has just committed theft be considered an accessory after the fact?\n\nA) If they knowingly gave the thief a ride, regardless of their intent or subsequent actions.\nB) If they gave the thief a ride, even if they were unaware of the theft.\nC) If they knowingly gave the thief a ride AND intended to help them avoid arrest or punishment.\nD) If they gave the thief a ride and later refused to cooperate with the police.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Louisiana law, to be considered an accessory after the fact, two conditions must be met:\n\n1. The person must knowingly aid the offender after a felony has been committed.\n2. The person must have the intent to help the offender avoid arrest, trial, conviction, or punishment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only considers knowledge, not intent. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't require knowledge of the crime. Option D is incorrect because refusing to cooperate with police later doesn't necessarily prove intent to help the offender escape justice at the time of giving the ride.\n\nOption C is correct because it includes both key elements: knowledge of the crime and intent to help the offender avoid consequences. This aligns with the Louisiana statute on accessories after the fact.\n\nThe question also highlights the importance of subsequent actions, such as cooperating with law enforcement, which can demonstrate a lack of intent to help the offender escape justice."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> In the film *Holes*\\*, in the early 1900s, a man named Stanley Yelnats was robbed of a chest full of treasure. The bandit later buried the treasure on the property of a man named Trout Walker in Texas. Years later, in the late 90s or early 00s, Stanley Yelnats' great\\-grandson (also named Stanley Yelnats) found the treasure.\n\n> In the scene where the treasure is found, the owner of the property (Trout Walker's grand\\-daughter) insists that the chest belongs to her because it was found on her property. But the chest has Stanley Yelnats'name on it, so Stanley's lawyer takes it and it goes to Stanley's family.\n\nI have two questions, assuming real\\-life Texas inheritance and property law:\n\n1. Who is the rightful owner of the chest of treasure?\n2. Regardless of who the ultimate rightful owner is, did Stanley's lawyer have the right to take something off of the Walker's property just because it had Stanley's name on it?\n\n\\* *I think this is all same in the book as well, but I haven't read it, so I'm not sure*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In all likelihood, the property would have gone to Stanley. Keep in mind that Warden Walker and her family owned the remains of the town of Green Lake, which had become a ghost town in the 20 years between Kissin' Kate's crimes and her death. The books likely take place in the year of the release. In all likelihood, the state owned the lake proper, and thus the lake bed, even if Trout bought all the buildings as the town population dwindled. In all likelihood, the loot was abandoned property on public land (the dried lakebed). As such, it was Hector and Zeroni opperating on their own, who discovered the treasure and thus would be able to claim it as their property. As we do not see the deed to the land, this is an assumption. However, the lack of any fencing around a juvenile detention facility probably hints that they were operating on land that the camp could not legally fence off and used the threat of dehydration to deter escape.\n\nIf it was on the property, there might be a legal dispute as it was stolen property in the first place and the estate of Stanley Yelnats would be able to make a claim against Warden Walker that they need to return the goods that were not theirs. This is complicated by the fact that Warden Walker and her employees are knowingly violating the law by using Juvenile Offenders as unpaid labor, despite the fact that they are private state contractors and advertise themselves as a counseling service and are engaging in computer crimes to cover up two offenders running off into the desert as well as fraud. This results in the state seizing control of the facility to properly dispose of those in it's custody and the property itself. This means that even if Warden Walker rightly owned the land, the state felt it like it was in everyone's interest to back the Yelnats' claim to the contents of the chest (In all likelihood, they could have included it as a settlement to prevent a lawsuit as the state would be a party to any case (at the least, they failed to properly inspect the facility and it's operations) and the Yelnats and Zeroni's are the victims who were impacted the most. It could also have been used to incentivize or thank them for testimony against the Walker operation.).\n\nIt could also be the case that the book ended prior to the treasurer's ownership being rightfully decided by the law. The Yelnats were independently wealthy thanks to Yelnats III's discovery of a cure for foot oder (Sploosh), which was so successful that they were able to advertise it with a Superbowl commercial with a celebrity endorsement from a Major League Baseball player no less. While the baseball player likely was doing it at a significant discount because his testimony lead to Yelnats IV's wrongful conviction and abuse at Camp Green Lake, the price for a 30 second spot in Super Bowl XXXIII (1999\\) was $1\\.6 million dollars and was likely payed for from (Sploosh's) own income as an advertising expense is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that Holes is not a story about the law (this comes as early as Stanley IV's trial, where he is not given an lawyer and his family cannot afford one, along with some testimony that would not have been allowed being allowed to be heard.). The point of the treasure being found was symbolic of the family curse being lifted, a result of Stanley carrying Zero up the mount where they found water, and allowing him to drink while he sang the fabled song (The terms that Stanley's No good pig stealing Great\\-Great\\-Grandfather failed to oblige to Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni's Great\\-Great\\-Grandmother that brought the curse upon the family.). As a major theme of the book is the choices of the past affecting the present, the treasure is a symbolic victory. Stanley IV is rewarded for fulfilling his ancestor's promise out of the goodness of his own heart and no idea that he was doing this. When Zero reveal his real name as Zeroni, Stanley has no idea of the relation to the gypsy woman who cursed his family (if I recall the book spells it out for the reader. I remember in my first read, I forgot Madam Zeroni's name by the time we learn it's Zero's name.). As such, the legality of do they own it because it was stolen and their name was on it wasn't considered. Green Lake is also recieves the first rain it has in 100 years after the treasure is found and Zero is taken with Stanley's lawyers out of Green Lake (it's implied that Sam, Kissin' Kate's lover, whose death at the hands of the towns folk brought about the cursed drought, had also been broken.).",

The chest had Stanley Yelnats' name on it, indicating it belonged to his ancestor. This creates a direct line of inheritance to Stanley Yelnats IV. \n\nOption A is incorrect because adverse possession typically requires open and notorious possession, which doesn't apply to a buried chest. \n\nOption B (finder's keepers) could potentially apply, but it's trumped by the stronger inheritance claim. \n\nOption D is plausible, given the ambiguity about land ownership, but it's less strong than the direct inheritance claim.\n\nThe question tests understanding of various property law concepts and the ability to apply them to a complex fictional scenario."

The power to make executive orders stems from Section 1 \"The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhen the Supreme Court considers the legality of an executive order (which only happens when someone brings a case that the court agrees to hear) they use [Justice Jackson's Test](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/jacksontest.html) from Youngstown Sheet \\& Tube Co. v Sawyer (1952\\).\n\nThe first amendment specifically forbids congress from making laws about these matters.

The information provided suggests that while the First Amendment explicitly restricts Congress from making laws about religious freedoms, the Supreme Court would likely apply Justice Jackson's Test when evaluating a presidential executive order on this matter. Since the First Amendment represents the express will of Congress to not regulate religious freedoms, any presidential action doing so would fall under the third and weakest category of presidential power in Jackson's Test. As the Constitution does not explicitly grant the President this power, the Court would likely rule such an executive order unconstitutional.

The term \"interstate commerce\" merely refers to the movement of property from one U.S. state into another; and it is sufficient if the property has recently moved interstate as a result of a transaction or a series of related transactions that have not been fully completed or consummated at the time of the person's acts as alleged.\n\nAll US states also have laws regarding receipt of stolen property; however, there usually is no minimum dollar amount in many jurisdictions, and, of course, the requirement in Federal law regarding interstate commerce does not apply. Also, in many states (Ohio, for example), the burden to prove criminal intent is not as stringent or is nonexistent. This means that one can be charged with the crime \\- usually a minor degree of felony \\- even if the person did not know the item in question was stolen. In the Ohio case of State v. Awad, the goods did not need to actually be stolen, just represented as such.\n\nReceiving stolen property and possession of stolen property are treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the property was stolen. If the person knew that the property was stolen at the time he received it, the crime is receiving stolen property. If the person did not know the property was stolen at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of stolen property.\n\nThe state must prove that the defendant received or possessed the property for a dishonest purpose. If, for example, the person acquired possession for the purpose of returning the property to its lawful owner, no crime has been committed.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was reading a Pittsburgh Post Gazette article entitled [\"Time Change\"](http://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2016/11/07/WorkZone-Federal-change-to-make-4-million-more-employees-eligible-for-overtime/stories/201611060068) in the \"Businesses and Jobs\" section of the newspaper from Sunday November 6, 2016\\.\n\nThe article states that a federal law has been modified called the \"Fair Labor Standards Act\" by the U.S. Department of Labor that requires non\\-profits organizations to:\n\n1. More than double the salary threshold at which employees are exempt from overtime protections.\n\t1. Under the existing rule from 2004, employers must pay overtime to\n\tfull\\-time employees who earn $23,660 or less annually if they work\n\tmore than 40 hours a week.\n2. Any non\\-profit with annual gross revenues over $500,000 is subject to the rules and the DOL plans to raise the overtime threshold every three years beginning in 2020\\.\n3. Under the revised regulation, the salary level under which employees qualify for overtime pay will jump to $47,476 a year.\n\nSo which citations of that law have been modified, added or removed to specify this in [legal citation](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/15324/9716)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that this refers to regulatory changes that were published in the [*Federal Register* of May 23, 2016, pages 32391\\-32552](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-05-23/pdf/2016-11754.pdf), revising 29 CFR Part 541 (i.e. the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Part 541\\). Most of the publication discusses the rationale and effects of the rule change. The actual changes to the text of the regulations begin on page 32549\\.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the regulatory changes published in the Federal Register on May 23, 2016, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the modifications to the Fair Labor Standards Act regarding overtime pay for non-exempt employees?\n\nA) The salary threshold for overtime exemption was increased from $23,660 to $47,476 annually, affecting only for-profit organizations with annual gross revenues over $1 million.\n\nB) Non-profit organizations with annual gross revenues over $500,000 are required to pay overtime to full-time employees earning $47,476 or less annually if they work more than 35 hours a week.\n\nC) The salary threshold for overtime exemption was raised to $47,476 annually, with plans to adjust it every five years starting in 2021, applicable to all organizations regardless of their annual gross revenue.\n\nD) Non-profit organizations with annual gross revenues over $500,000 are subject to the new rules, which raise the overtime exemption threshold to $47,476 annually for full-time employees working more than 40 hours a week, with plans to adjust the threshold every three years beginning in 2020.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate representation of the regulatory changes. It correctly states that non-profit organizations with annual gross revenues over $500,000 are subject to the new rules. The salary threshold for overtime exemption was indeed raised from $23,660 to $47,476 annually. The rule applies to full-time employees working more than 40 hours a week, not 35 as stated in option B. Finally, it accurately mentions the plan to adjust the threshold every three years starting in 2020, not every five years from 2021 as suggested in option C. Option A is incorrect as it only mentions for-profit organizations and has an incorrect revenue threshold."

My gut feeling is the examiner would have a cow if they saw the (R) on the mark before it was registered.\n\nFor some reason, it seems futile to legally review a mark that doesn't contain the (R), and then let the registrant add their own (R) once it's approve.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You cannot use the \u00ae symbol on an [unregistered](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/trademark-faqs#type-browse-faqs_1963) trademark\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsing it on an unregistered trademark is both a Federal offence and grounds for the trademark application to be rejected.

Using the \u00ae symbol on an unregistered trademark is a federal offense and can lead to rejection of the trademark application.\n\nB) Correct. It's common and generally permissible to use the \u2122 symbol (or \u2120 for services) to indicate a common law trademark or an application in progress, subject to state laws.\n\nC) Incorrect. Using the \u00ae symbol anywhere before registration is complete is not allowed and can lead to legal issues.\n\nD) Incorrect. The \u00ae symbol should not be used at all until the trademark is officially registered. Alternating between symbols does not make its use permissible."

It may appear under Help\\-About and a click to view EULA. The EULA specifically addresses redistribution of parts of the software and number of installations you can make with a single license. They do not say what uses you make make of the software, except that \"You may not rent, lease, lend or provide commercial hosting services with the Software\". There is no express prohibition against commercial or non\\-commercial political use of the product: anything not prohibited is allowed. The fact that they say nothing about the content that you create with Word means, they have declined to have a say in the matter. (I am not sure about the wording of the \"Educational\" versions of Office: those are somewhat negotiated between the institution and MS).",

There is no mention of restrictions on the content created using Word, which implies that users are free to create and sell content without paying royalties to Microsoft, as long as they comply with the other terms of the license."
