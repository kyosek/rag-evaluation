I know that there is some debate about the constitutionality of a wealth tax, but for the purpose of this question, I would either assume that the wealth tax is constitutional or that the states were enacting this law to test its constitutionality.\n\n[*U.S. News \\& World Report* states](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/states-with-the-most-billionaires) that 40% of billionaires in the United States live in either New York or California, where Silicon Valley and Wall Street bind many of the extremely rich to the businesses that made them so wealthy.\n\nObviously, the biggest problem for a state like California trying to extract revenue from its uber\\-wealthy populace would be that they would simply move their residence and use any other possible legal loophole to avoid having to pay.\n\nAt the same time, many of these billionaires built their wealth out of business empires that are firmly established in those states, like Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook. The process of moving a business of that size and cultural significance would be immeasurably expensive because those firms rely on an elite talent pool that is very locale\\-centric for their recruiting, and they have employees that could choose to leave the company rather than relocate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Validity of State Wealth Taxes\n==================================\n\nYes. States can impose wealth taxes, although this doesn't clarify the validity of a federal wealth tax. States have broader taxing power than the federal government in terms of kinds of taxes that they may constitutionally impose.\n\nA state may impose any tax (1\\) that does not unduly discriminate against a federally protected constitutional civil liberty (like freedom of the press), (2\\) that does not purport to tax the federal government (arguably any other sovereign) without its consent, (3\\) that does not unduly discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4\\) that has some rational basis.\n\nApart from these specific limitations and (5\\) any found in state law or the state's constitution, (6\\) a state's taxing power is plenary as to conduct or activity or property that has a sufficient connection to the state to provide it with jurisdiction. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case repealed some clear rules of the road regarding what states do not have the jurisdiction to tax, effectively increasing state tax jurisdiction considerably, for example, to impose sales taxes on Internet retailers.\n\n> the biggest problem for a state like California trying to extract\n> revenue from its uber\\-wealthy populace would be that they would simply\n> move their residence and use any other possible legal loophole to\n> avoid having to pay.\n\nThis is true. The primary question regarding the validity of a state wealth tax would not be whether a state could impose a wealth tax, but what assets could a state make subject to its state wealth tax. This might be easy to answer in the case of real property, but hard in the case of intangible property or property held via entities. Federal statutes may, however, establish which states have jurisdiction to tax which assets with a state wealth tax as part of the power to regulate interstate commerce, or by ratifying a compact reached between multiple states which have state wealth taxes.\n\nStill the facts that many countries in the European Union impose or have historically imposed wealth taxes that generate significant tax revenue, despite the easy ability to the affluent to relocated to other countries in the E.U. that is closely analogous to that of U.S. states seeking to do the same thing, suggest that this is not an insurmountable task, even if there might be some leakage of untaxed wealth at the margins.\n\nThe Validity of Federal Wealth Taxes\n====================================\n\nIn contrast, Congress may only impose taxes expressly authorized by some provision of the U.S. Constitution as amended. The applicable case law on the issue of the constitutionality of a federal wealth tax is not entirely settled.\n\nThe gift, estate and generation skipping transfer tax system has been held to be constitutional, but since this is a tax imposed on transfers of wealth, it is arguably a tax in lieu of an income tax treated separately for ease of administration (since gifts and inheritances are within the core definition of income in the Internal Revenue Code at Section 63, but then specifically exempted from income taxation in lieu of donative transfer taxes like the gift and estate tax, in a separate statutory Section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code.).\n\nFederal property taxes in areas not in exclusively federal jurisdiction (e.g. Virginia rather than the U.S. Virgin Islands) were briefly in force in the 1700s, but were repealed before they could be subject to a constitutional challenge.\n\nIncome taxes, even at 90% marginal tax rates, have been upheld as valid.\n\nThe analysis and doctrines involved are rather involved for a short answer in this forum, and I am fairly certain that there is published legal scholarship arguing both sides of this question of first impression.\n\nIn a nutshell, a federal tax must either be an income tax; tax imposed on states rather than individuals on a per capita basis; or an excise tax or duty or tariff. The first two types of taxes are comparatively well defined. The third is the subject of thin, mushy and somewhat inconsistent or indeterminate case law.\n\nOne could argue, for example, that a wealth tax is really a form of income tax on imputed income from assets that could generate additional value to the owner even if the value that arises from this ownership is not monetized or realized. This argument would be particularly strong if wealth taxes paid with respect to an asset were allowed as a tax credit against taxes imposed on income generated by that same asset, in a manner similar to the foreign tax credit today.\n\nA wealth tax clearly isn't a per capita tax on a state government. No such tax has ever been imposed for any meaningful amount of time and has never been a more than nominal source of federal revenues if it has ever generated any federal revenues.\n\nThere is also a credible argument that a wealth tax is a constitutionally valid excise tax or duty or tariff, focusing on the excise tax component, which is quite ill defined, because the courts have tended to side with the government on issues of the scope of the federal power to tax except in the clearest and most blatant cases of violations of the federal power to tax.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the constitutionality and implementation of wealth taxes in the United States?\n\nA) Federal wealth taxes are clearly constitutional, while state wealth taxes face significant legal challenges.\n\nB) Both federal and state wealth taxes are equally constitutional and face similar implementation challenges.\n\nC) State wealth taxes are constitutionally permissible with some limitations, while the constitutionality of federal wealth taxes is less certain.\n\nD) Neither federal nor state wealth taxes are constitutional due to clear prohibitions in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that states have broader taxing power and can impose wealth taxes, subject to certain limitations such as not discriminating against interstate commerce. However, the constitutionality of federal wealth taxes is less certain and subject to debate. The federal government's taxing authority is more limited, requiring taxes to fall into specific categories outlined in the Constitution. While state wealth taxes face practical challenges like taxpayer relocation, they are generally considered constitutionally permissible. The federal wealth tax question remains unsettled, with arguments for its validity under income tax or excise tax interpretations, but no clear legal precedent."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34363/interpretation-of-the-document-speaks-for-itself-in-answer-to-a-complaint", "docs_id": 34363, "title": "Interpretation of &quot;the document speaks for itself&quot; in answer to a complaint?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've got a question about the complaint/answer process in the context of Maryland regarding a Trust.

Is an animal related statute rather than people. So is a public official required to have a warrant to enter posted private property for an animal neglect call when the property and animals are visible from the road or not? Additionally and specifically Barry county Missouri has no animal control laws or leash laws and it is not illegal to cage dogs for example. The 578 statute has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary which was overruled but that was serious abuse case.\n\nThe definition \"Adequate care\" is vague as well. So warrant needed or not? and if so, what legal action can be taken for trespass, rights violations under color of law etc. if any?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that a warrant is required to enter private property (absent constitutional case law exceptions to the warrant requirement such as exigent circumstances and consent), and that a warrant is available only when there is probable cause that a crime has been committed.\n\nWhether the neglect or abuse of an animal constitutes a crime within the meaning of this 4th Amendment requirement could potentially be seen as a gray area, since historically, in the absence of statutory authority in early common law, an owner of an animal had absolute authority to deal with his or her property (the animal) as the owner of the animal saw fit.\n\nThe purpose of the statute is to clarify that this conduct by an animal owner constitutes a crime for 4th Amendment search and seizure purposes by making a state law determination that it is a crime, which states can do, even though they can't change the constitutional requirement under the 4th Amendment.\n\nAlso, just because a state can authorize law enforcement to get a warrant for any search authorized by the U.S. Constitution, that doesn't mean it has to allow law enforcement to do so in every case where it is constitutional for the state to do so.\n\nThe duty to get a warrant for law enforcement to enter onto private property at all arises not only from other state statutes, but also from the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (as incorporated to apply against state and local governments though the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution).\n\nBut, the constitutional requirement has case law exceptions, so it isn't required in all circumstances. In particular, exigent circumstances, and the consent to entry exceptions, which are allowed by constitutional criminal procedure case law, could apply to the requirement to get a warrant in the first place.\n\nBut, law enforcement needs to have the authority to search at all with a warrant under state law, for an exception to the warrant requirement to be relevant. This statute appears to carry out that purpose by authorizing searches for this particular purpose. For what it is worth, it is not the best drafted possible statute to achieve this objective, and it could have been written to be more clear, but it still gets the job done.\n\nSo, in answer to the top\\-line question, no, I wouldn't read this statute as requiring a warrant in every possible circumstance in order to go onto private property to check on an animal, although a warrant would be required in every case where an exception to the warrant requirement under 4th Amendment case law does not apply.\n\n> Section 578\\. Is an animal related statute rather than people.\n\nThe people involved are the property owners. The property owner's rights in their real property are potentially infringed if there is a warrantless entry.\n\nThe human beings owning the animals are potentially violating a law which the State of Missouri wants law enforcement officers to be able to enforce (the relevant laws are [the state animal cruelty and agricultural laws expressly referenced in the statute](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneChapterRng.aspx?tb1=578.005%20to%20578.023), so, it is irrelevant that \"Barry County Missouri has no animal control laws or leash laws\").\n\nAmong other things these statutes make it a crime if a person \"Has custody or ownership of an animal and fails to provide adequate care\\[.]\" As the question claims that: \"The definition \"Adequate care\" is vague as well.\" But the question also notes that: \"The 578 statute has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary which was overruled but that was serious abuse case.\"\n\nThe state has a right to decide what is and is not illegal. It is not prohibited from banning treatment of animals that is not serious abuse. The state has every right to make it a crime to fail to provide adequate care for an animal, even if that failure to provide adequate car does not constitute severe abuse.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that a lawful search requires only probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and a good faith belief that an exception to the warrant requirement is present.\n\nIf the law enforcement officer has a good faith belief that the animal will die or seriously suffer or be hidden by the owner in the time that the law enforcement officer reasonably thinks that it will take to get a warrant, the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applies.\n\nThe fact that the lawful search later reveals that a crime was no committed does not mean that the search was improper. A mere belief that an animal was abused or neglected and that exigent circumstance were present with a reasonable factual basis (e.g. a tip from a neighbor who seems credible and claims to have personal knowledge of the facts) will usually suffice to establish probable cause.\n\n> So warrant needed or not? and if so, what legal action can be taken\n> for trespass, rights violations under color of law etc. if any?\n\nIf there is a search without a warrant or probable cause was not present, and an exception to the warrant requirement does not apply, and the property owner believes that their 4th Amendment rights were intentionally violated by law enforcement in the warrantless search in violation of clearly established law to the contrary, a civil lawsuit against the law enforcement officer under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 can be brought in state or federal court.\n\nThe employer of the law enforcement officer can be sued as well, under the same statute, if the warrantless search in violation of the clearly established constitutional right was made pursuant to an express policy of the law enforcement officer's employer. But the fact that the law enforcement officer violated someone's rights does not automatically make the law enforcement officer's employer civilly liable for the wrong.\n\nIn most U.S. states, law enforcement officers are protected by state law governmental immunity from common law trespass lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their official duties, but I haven't checked specifically to see if that is the case in Missouri.\n\nA claim of a 4th Amendment violation can also be a ground for suppressing evidence obtained with an unlawful search when defending a prosecution under some ordinance or statute that relies upon that evidence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Missouri, a law enforcement officer receives a tip about potential animal neglect on private property.

The supervisor has explicitly given you permission, so it's not possible for you to trespass. You are correct that someone with the proper authority could revoke this permission at any time, at which point you would have to leave or be guilty of trespassing. The only way this situation could constitute trespassing is if they revoke your permission and you ignore them.

While it may seem unfair to the student, businesses are generally allowed to set such terms in their contracts as long as they are not unconscionable or in violation of specific laws. The given cancellation policy (requiring notice about 10 days in advance) is not likely to be considered unreasonable or unconscionable by a court. The contract explicitly states the policy, so there's no assumption needed on the part of the customer. Additionally, being a student does not automatically qualify as an inability to understand the contract terms under Michigan law.

And, the accuser's telephone data, together with the accuser's testimony, is admissible evidence which is sufficient to bring charges.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nTo bring charges, all that the prosecutor must show to proceed to trial and to comply with the professional ethics standards that apply to lawyers is to show \"probable cause\" which is a much lower standard than the proof beyond a reasonable doubt that is necessary to obtain a conviction.\n\nThe testimony of the accuser alone is almost always going to be sufficient to charge someone with a crime that would involve a \"conversation\" of some kind, and to convict someone of that crime.\n\nThe evidence from the phone would usually be admissible and would corroborate the accusers testimony, which might increase the likelihood that a jury would find that the evidence taken as a whole constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt, even though the phone alone, without the accuser's testimony, probably wouldn't suffice to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt unless the content of the conversation was sufficient to identify the defendant (e.g. because it mentioned things that only the defendant could have known).\n\nIt is not at all uncommon to use an accuser's phone as evidence in a criminal prosecution where that kind of communication has something to do with the crime that the defendant is charged with (of course, most crimes are far less articulate like physically trespassing, punching somebody, shoplifting, burglary, etc.). The side of the conservation that allegedly involved the defendant would normally not be subject to the hearsay rule, for example, because it would be the alleged statement of a party\\-opponent.\n\nIf the accuser was involved in the conversation, the testimony of the accuser is also sufficient in most cases to authenticate evidence from a phone that sets forth the conversation because the testimony of the accuser corroborates the evidence from the phone.\n\nBasically, all the accuser has to do is testify credibly that the phone was not tampered with and that the data on the phone is not fake to the best of the accuser's knowledge and that the accuser believed that the conservation was related to the crime.\n\nThe evidence should be at least admissible for the purpose of showing that a conversation took place with someone at the times indicated at the IP addresses indicated (assuming that the jury believes that accuser's testimony that it is authentic) even if it doesn't, by itself, prove that the defendant was the other person involved in the conversation. The existence of the conservation and nature of the conservation is one of the things that the prosecution needs to prove in your hypothetical case, and if proves that, even if this evidence doesn't by itself prove the defendant's identity, it is still relevant to proving part of the case, which reduces the amount of the case that has to be established with other kinds of evidence.\n\nThe fact that the conversation alleged by the accuser actually happened and is corroborated by digital evidence makes it more likely that the accuser is telling the truth and that the defendant is guilty, even if this single piece of evidence by itself doesn't prove the entire case.\n\nThe defense can certainly urge the jury consider the fact that the phone evidence isn't very rigorously linked to the defendant as they make the argument that there isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, but the jury, considering the totality of the evidence in which the phone evidence and the testimony of the accuser corroborate each other, find that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard has been met.\n\n**There Will Almost Always Be Some Other Evidence**\n\nAlso, usually, in any prosecution based in part upon a \"conservation\" by telephone or text message, there will be other evidence from context, timing, the defendant's motive, etc. that provides further circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime that may also be considered, even if it doesn't \"feel\" like other evidence in the sense that it is testimony from someone else or additional physical evidence.\n\nIn many cases, even though a defendant has a right to remain silent and not present any witnesses and not have that held against him, a defendant that fails to present some kind of evidence to overcome latent circumstantial evidence that tends to point to his guilt is usually going to be found guilty by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nFor example, the fact that the defendant was in a place where he could have used the IP address in question, rather than having an alibi is probably not, by itself, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but is circumstantial evidence that can remove one source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if he does have an alibi or subpoenas records to show that the IP address in question was available at the location where he was six months earlier, the case against him becomes much weaker.)\n\nThe fact that the defendant lived at the same location six months earlier is relevant and corroborates the testimony, even if one doesn't definitively establish that the ISP address was the same six months earlier. This removes some doubt that the other evidence might have left hanging.\n\nThe fact that the conversation is something that the defendant could have said, while probably not proof beyond a reasonable doubt by itself, is circumstantial evidence that can remove a source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if the conversation is, for example, in Farsi, and the defendant doesn't know how to speak Farsi and doesn't even have access to a Farsi dictionary or translation program, in contrast, proof of a case against him beyond a reasonable doubt may be impossible.)\n\nSimilarly, if the defendant can't offer any plausible narrative in which someone else could plausibly have been using the IP address at the times in question and could have said the things that were said in the conversation, that too, while probably not proof beyond a reasonable doubt by itself, is circumstantial evidence that can remove a source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if there was someone else who could have done it instead of the defendant, this weakens the prosecution's case.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal case involving electronic evidence, the prosecutor has a conversation from an anonymous app on the accuser's device and an IP address used by the account 6 months after the alleged crime.

According to the information provided, the evidence from the accuser's phone, combined with the accuser's testimony, is both admissible and sufficient to bring charges. The prosecutor only needs to show \"probable cause\" to bring charges, which is a lower standard than proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for conviction. The accuser's testimony alone is often sufficient to charge someone with a crime involving a conversation. The phone evidence corroborates the accuser's testimony, making it admissible when authenticated by the accuser. While this evidence alone might not prove the defendant's identity beyond a reasonable doubt, it is relevant to proving part of the case and reduces the amount of evidence needed from other sources. The IP address, even if from 6 months later, provides additional circumstantial evidence.

If a tenant violates these obligations, the landlord may recover any actual damages that result from the violation. The $750 citation is considered actual damage caused by the tenant's actions. Therefore, the landlord can charge the full amount to the tenant, deducting it from the security deposit and pursuing the remainder as damages. While the security deposit was only $600, the landlord is not limited to this amount if the actual damages exceed it.

Jurisdictions generally have laws designed to resolve / prevent \"conflict of interest\". There is a [big section of Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.52&full=true) that regulates ethics in public service. Therefore, the Chief of the Washington State Patrol cannot award a contract for new vehicles to himself, because \"No state officer or state employee may have an interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in a business or transaction or professional activity, or incur an obligation of any nature, that is in conflict with the proper discharge of the state officer's or state employee's official duties\". The Attorney General could not unload his real estate holdings in area X, knowing that his office was initiating a legal proceeding that would make such land worthless (using confidential knowledge), but once fact is made public, he can act on that knowledge.\n\nYour specific hypotheticals do not involve SEC regulations or public officials. You may sell all of your diamonds if you think the bottom will fall out on the diamond market, indeed people do this all the time (and are often wrong about the future). People often buy land because they have a reason to believe that it will become valuable (e.g. they heard a rumor about a business expanding into the area); many people invested in micro\\-computer companies because they got the idea (even from people who has specific technical knowledge) that microcomputers would become very popular.

Most trials turn on the facts, not precedent\\-setting points of law \\- usually, there is no dispute about the law at all.\n\nEven then, most appeal decisions don't set a precedent either and sink into obscurity until at some point in the far future when a lawyer doing research on a particularly tricky case has an \"ah\\-ha\" moment and says \"Look at what Justice Bozo said in paragraph 365 of this 56 page judgement about a tangentially related issue between different people at a different time in a different place \\- I need to spin this as dicta.\" Meanwhile, the lawyer on the opposite side has a different precedent from a different case that contradicts this one \\- one of them must be wrong.\n\nSo a trial judge faced with this paradox has to resolve it; they don't get to say \"this is too hard\". Basically they have 2 methods of doing so:\n\n1. The decide that one (or both) are obiter and make the decision based on the precedent that remains.\n2. They decide that both are ratio and write a judgement that they know **has** to be appealed because they have to follow both precedents and they can't. At least in Australia, this is becoming more and more common. The judge basically says \"I have two conflicting binding precedents, I pick this one for \\[reasons]. Now go off to the Court of Appeals to see if I got it right. I look forward to finding out.\"\n\nOf course, the winner isn't going to appeal and it may not be in the loser's commercial interest to do so.

At the time of writing, judges are focused on resolving the case at hand rather than categorizing their statements for future use. Future judges and lawyers determine what constitutes binding precedent based on how the reasoning applies to new cases. Additionally, many cases don't set new precedents at all, making such categorization unnecessary.

A business, on the other hand, would be subject to national law, and possibly national law of more than one nation.\n\nThe case you cite is somewhat exceptional since a case under US law has to be decided by reference to the \"international law definition\" of aiding and abetting liability for human rights violations.

Option B is also incorrect, as the provided case shows there are circumstances where international law principles can be applied. Option D is a distractor with no basis in the given information.\n\nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the information provided. The Alien Tort Claims Act allows US courts to have jurisdiction over civil actions by aliens for torts committed in violation of \"the law of nations.\" This means that if a corporation is alleged to have violated international law (referred to as \"the law of nations\" in this context), they could potentially be sued under this act in US courts.

If you were to bill for 1\\.5x your normal rate for hours over 40/week, relying on the writing, and it came to court, you might win, based on the general rule that matters explicitly covered in the written agreement are treated as final, and evidence of contradictory oral agreements are often not accepted to contradict the contract document.

Mulvihill* 57 N.J. 151 (1970\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1970/57-n-j-151-0.html) The Supreme Court of New Jersey held: \n\n> If, in effectuating the arrest or the temporary detention, the officer employs excessive and unnecessary force, the citizen may respond or counter with the use of reasonable force to protect himself, and if in so doing the officer is injured no criminal offense has been committed.\n\nHowever, the *Mulvihill* court cautioned:\n\n> State v. Koonce, 89 N.J. Super. 169 (App. Div. 1965\\) held that \"a private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows or has good reason to believe is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances obtaining.\" (89 N.J. Super. at 184\\.) The opinion put to rest the notion that the common law rule existing in some jurisdictions, which permits a citizen to resist, even with reasonable force, an unlawful arrest by a police officer, was applicable in New Jersey. ... Accordingly, in our State when an officer makes an arrest, legal or illegal, it is the duty of the citizen to submit and, in the event the seizure is illegal, to seek recourse in the courts for the invasion of his right of freedom.\n\nThe *Mulvihill* court explained the difference in the two csase by saying:\n\n> Despite his duty to submit quietly without physical resistance to an arrest made by an officer acting in the course of his duty, even though the arrest is illegal, his right to freedom from unreasonable seizure and confinement can be protected, restored and vindicated through legal processes. However, the rule permitting reasonable resistance to excessive force of the officer, whether the arrest is lawful or unlawful, is designed to protect a person's bodily integrity and health and so permits resort to self\\-defense. Simply stated, the law recognizes that liberty can be restored through legal processes but life or limb cannot be repaired in a courtroom. And so it holds that the reason for outlawing resistance to an unlawful arrest and requiring disputes over its legality to be resolved in the courts has no controlling application on the right to resist an officer's excessive force. *People v. Curtis*, 70 Cal. 2d 347, 74 Cal. Rptr. at 719\\.\n\nThe *Mulvihill* court further warned that:\n\n> \\[A citizen] cannot use greater force in protecting himself against the officer's unlawful force than reasonably appears to be necessary. If he employs such greater force, then he becomes the aggressor and forfeits the right to claim self\\-defense ... Furthermore, if he knows that if he desists from his physically defensive measures and submits to arrest the officer's unlawfully excessive force would cease, the arrestee must desist or lose his privilege of self\\-defense.\n\nThe court said that the duty to desist and submit if that would stop the excessive force is analogous to the duty to retreat rather than use force in self defense when this is feasible.\n\nThe Nolo Press page [\"Resisting Arrest When Police Use Excessive Force\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/resisting-arrest-when-police-use-excessive-force.html) says:\n\n> It\u2019s rare that someone being placed under arrest has the right to forcefully resist. But in most states, if the arresting officer uses excessive force that could cause \u201cgreat bodily harm,\u201d the arrestee has the right to defend him or herself. That\u2019s because most states hold that an officer\u2019s use of excessive force amounts to assault or battery, which a victim has a right to defend against.\n\n...\n\n> An officer\u2019s use of force is \u201cexcessive\u201d if it is likely to result in unjustifiable great bodily harm (serious injury). Most states consider whether a \u201creasonable person\u201d under the circumstances would have believed that the officer\u2019s use of force was likely to cause great physical harm (including death). If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014if a reasonable person would have felt it necessary to resist in self\\-defense, and if that person used a reasonable degree of force when resisting, then the resistance is typically justified. But this is a very high standard to meet, such that courts hardly ever find that an arrestee\u2019s forceful resistance was defensible.\n\n[This article from policeone.com](https://www.policeone.com/legal/articles/372596006-Civilian-self-defense-vs-police-excessive-force-Its-not-that-simple/) citing California law, says that forceful resistance to an arrest is almost never justified. It does agree that resistance to excessive force can be used;\n\n> Section 693 requires that even if the officer were committing a public offense (crime), only that \"self\\-defense\" force that is sufficient to prevent the offense may be used. In other words, the subject may only use force to simply stop the assault/battery under color of authority and never any more than that.\n\nand says that:\n\n> It is a rare circumstance when this assault/battery under color of authority actually occurs and an officer is charged, not because of some great law enforcement driven conspiracy but because it rarely happens.\n\nIn short, *Plummer* is still valid, but limited to the fact pattern when the person being arrested is actually being subjected to excessive force likely to cause great bodily harm, or death, and only justifies sufficient force to prevent such harm. The lawfulness of the arrest does not matter, it the the danger caused by the excess force that justifies possible resistance. As a practical matter, if resistance is likely to escalate rather than prevent harm, it is highly unwise. \n\nWhen *Plummer* is cited, often with *Bad Elk*, to justify resistance to an **unlawful** arrest **because** of its unlawfulness, that is no longer valid law and has not been for decades.\n\nNote that is a person who is not a law enforcement officer (LEO) but who is pretending to be one, tries to make an \"arrest\" this would not be an arrest at all, but an assault or an attempted abduction, and the victim would be justified in using reasonable force in self\\-defense, although not excessive force. This is not the *Plummer* rule, but the normal law of self\\-defense. However any arrestee should be careful. Claiming that the arresters are impersonators when they are in fact plainclothes LEOs will not go well. If a reasonable person should have known that they were LEOs, there is no right to resist unless excessive force is used.\n\nNote further that if non\\-LEOs attempt to make a \"citizen's arrest\", not impersonating officers, the right to self\\-defence only applies if excessive force is used, or there is a reasonable fear of excessive force likely to cause great bodily harm or death. Basically the *Plummer* rule still applies.\n\nAlso, all of this is a matter of state law, and while *Plummer* should be good law in most if not all states, the exact rule may vary by state. In 2012 a few US states retained the common\\-law rule that any unlawful arrest justified resistance, according to the Nolo page linked above. That may have changed, or may change when a case arises.

They cannot be definitively measured in percentages or additions or subtractions; the question is whether you've transformed the picture into something new.\n\nFor an example, you may want to read [*Cariou v. Prince*, 714 F.3d 694 (2d Cir. 2013\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1628843.html), which involved a an artist \"taking photographs and other images that others have produced and incorporating them into paintings and collages that he then presents, in a different context, as his own.\" In some cases, there were very large changes, and in others, the changes were relatively minimal. \n\nThe court said that some of the uses were definitely fair use, but it said others were too close to call and sent it back to a lower court to do more analysis.\n\nFor your purposes, though, the key takeaway is that transformative use goes further than making a \"modification\" and turns the original work into something new with a message meaningfully different than that of the original.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An amateur photographer, Alex, takes a picture of a crowded beach.

It seems to me that there are two possible explanations; either the old ruling was a mistake and the new ruling should have been the answer all along, or both rulings were correct and what was Constitutional changed when the later ruling was made.\n\nI understand that these are, in practice, the same, but it is philosophically important. Can the Supreme Court be wrong, or are their rulings infallible, a bit like the Pope making Ex Cathedra statements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Supreme Court is infallible only in that their rulings are unchallengable, at least through any judicial process. Dissents often explain how the dissenter thinks a decision is not only wrong, but horribly misguided. Law review articles and other publications often criticize Court decisions, and sometimes influence later results.\n\nIt is far from unheard of for a dissent to later be followed in an opinion overruling the previous decision. [John Marshal Harlan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan) was known as the \"Great Dissenter\", but many of his dissents were later adopted as governing law, including his famous dissent in [*Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U.S. 537 (1896\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson), the case that created the \"separate but equal\" doctrine overturned more than 50 years later in [*Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka*, 347 U.S. 483 (1954\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education).\n\n(The Justice is known as \"John Marshal Harlan I\" because his grandson, also named \"John Marshal Harlan\", was a Justice during the mid 20th century. The grandson is known as \"John Marshal Harlan II' or just as \"Harlan II\". Harlan II was significantly more conservative than his grandfather.)\n\nSupreme court decisions may be overruled because there has been a change in the constitution. An example is [*Barron v. Baltimore*, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_v._Baltimore) which was undone by the ratification of the 14th amendment. This reason is rare, but particularly important.\n\nDecisions interpreting statutes can be altered or reversed if Congress or a state legislature changes the statute. Indeed sometimes a Court decision explicitly invites a legislative change. Not infrequently, however, such invitations are ignored by Congress.\n\nSupreme court decisions may be overturned when a later majority decides that the previous decision was simply wrong. A special case was [*Dred Scott v. Sandford*, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford). That decision held that blacks could never be citizens of the US, and was effectively overruled by the outcome of the US Civil War, and formally by the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution.\n\nA more usual example is the case of [*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*, 319 U.S. 624 (1943\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette) the case that held that a state could not make the flag salute and Pledge of Allegiance mandatory for school children. This overruled [*Minersville School District v. Gobitis*, 310 U.S. 586 (1940\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minersville_School_District_v._Gobitis), decided only three years before. In this case the opinion included what was in effect a point\\-by\\-point refutation of the *Gobitis* opinion, although it was not described as such. This angered Justice Frankfurter (author of the *Gobitis* opinion), who issued a dissenting opinion from the *Barnette* decision. Many prominent lawyers and legal scholars had challenged the *Gobitis* decision, and *Gobitis* had led to increased persecution of members of the **Jehovah's Witnesses**, the group whose members refused to say the pledge, considering that it was a form of idolatry. These facts influenced the rapid reversal of the *Gobitis* decision.\n\nOften an earlier decision is not directly overruled, but is ***distinguished***. That is, the earlier opinion is said to still hold for its particular facts, but a new and different ruling applies to the different circumstances of a later case. When a number of yet later decisions follow the later case, the original can become effectively overruled, as there are no longer any circumstances in which it will be applied.\n\nCourt opinions will often go into considerable detail on the legal reasoning which supports a decision that overrules a previous case. They do not commonly discuss the philosophy of the reasons for change.\n\nSome legal scholars and some Justices have used the [Living Constitution theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution) to support change on the ground that what was constitutional many years or decades ago is no longer permissible as the constitution \"evolves and adapts to new circumstances even if the document is not formally amended\". Others, particularly \"textualists\" and \"originalists\" strongly disapprove of this theory.\n\nThis theory was expressed by Justice Holmes in the case of [*Missouri v. Holland* 252 U.S. 416 (1920\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_v._Holland) with the words:\n\n> With regard to that we may add that when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago. The treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only question is whether it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment. We must consider what this country has become in deciding what that amendment has reserved.\n\nIn the Death Penalty cases the citation of \"evolving standards of decency\" from [*Trop v. Dulles*, 356 U.S. 86 (1958\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trop_v._Dulles) in [*Furman v. Georgia*, 408 U.S. 238 (1972\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia) was a version of Living Constitution theory. But it was not followed in later cases on he subject.\n\nUS Supreme Court rulings are not strictly binding on future Supreme Court majorities if they truly believe the previous decision was wrong for whatever reason. This has happened many times. Some Justices believe fairly strongly in *stare decisis*, the principle that settled rules of law should not be changed, but even so they will vote to overturn a precedent when it seems clearly and seriously wrong. Prior cases are overturned with significant frequency.\n\nJustices routinely do their own research, and decide cases on grounds not urged by the lawyers who argue the case. Moreover, for significant cases, there are almost always *amicus curiae* (friend of the court) briefs from major organizations. These are very likely to point out precedents or lines of reasoning that the parties have missed. The chance of a modern SC case being wrongly decided because of poor advocacy (as a comment suggests) seems slight to me. Poor judging, yes, that does happen. The *Barnette* decision. was an example. There have also been changes of judicial philosophy. The death of \"substantive due process\" and \"freedom of contract\" in the 1930s is an example of that.\n\nBut when consequences or legal theories are raised that were not previously considered, that can also be a reason to reverse a prior Supreme Court decision.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the philosophical and practical implications of the Supreme Court overturning its own previous rulings?\n\nA) The Supreme Court is infallible, and any changes in rulings reflect a change in the Constitution itself.\n\nB) Previous rulings were always incorrect, and new rulings rectify past mistakes without exception.\n\nC) The Supreme Court's decisions are final but not infallible, and can be overturned due to various factors including evolving interpretations, societal changes, or recognition of past errors.\n\nD) Supreme Court rulings can only be overturned if there is a formal constitutional amendment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the complex nature of Supreme Court decisions and the reasons they may be overturned.

Under [UCC 3\\-402](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-402), a representative can sign for a party. There are some conditions though. One is that the signature should show unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the person identified in the instrument. If the signature is not clear that the signature is made in a representative capacity, the representative is liable. The only thing that a digital signature adds is the possibility that it is impossible to unambiguously show this because of the software.

For a signature to be binding on Bob in this scenario:\n\n1. Joe must sign as a representative for Bob, not just sign Bob's name as if he were Bob.\n2. The signature must unambiguously show that it's made on behalf of Bob.\n3. The DocuSign system must allow for such representative signing.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the signature could be binding on Bob. Answer A is incorrect because verbal authorization alone doesn't guarantee binding without proper representation. B is incorrect because the law does allow for representative signatures under certain conditions.

Why would, say, the local DMV bother paying for software licenses from whatever enterprise software it requires? Heck, is there anything stopping them from using Eminent Domain to forcibly take copies of proprietary software from a company for their own organizational use, posting it for free download from one of their websites, and then paying them nothing because a \"fair market value\" for free software is nothing?\n\nThe court specifically addressed the Fourteenth Amendment and why they felt they did not apply in this case, as well as why the Copyright Clause did not apply.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, as I understand the [decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-877_dc8f.pdf), it's a little more subtle than that.\n\nBy default, states have sovereign immunity and can't be sued without their consent. Congress can remove (\"abrogate\") this immunity by law in some circumstances. They tried to do so for copyright infringement cases with the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990\\. However, in the present case of *Allen v. Cooper*, the Supreme Court held that this part of the CRCA is unconstitutional. \n\nThe idea is that under the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress can abrogate state immunity when it's necessary to ensure people's right to due process, but only in a \"congruent and proportional\" way. Now if a state unintentionally or negligently infringes someone's copyright, that does not violate the person's right to due process, but an intentional infringement might. At the time the CRCA was passed, when Congress went looking for instances where states infringed on copyrights, they found several cases of unintentional or negligent infringement, and just a couple where they may have infringed intentionally. SCOTUS argued that to respond to this by *completely* abrogating state immunity in *all* copyright cases was disproportionate, and therefore unconstitutional.\n\nBut the Court suggests in the opinion that Congress could pass a different law to abrogate immunity in copyright cases, if it were narrower. For instance, a law that only stripped immunity in cases of intentional infringement would likely be constitutional, especially if there were evidence that intentional infringement was happening enough to be a significant problem.\n\nSo I think the answer is that as of right now, a state could deliberately infringe someone's copyright (e.g. by pirating software) and be immune from suit. However, Congress has the power to \"fix\" this, and most likely will, especially if there seems to be egregious abuse.\n\n(By the way, the decision contains an impressive quantity of pirate jokes. I guess since it's not only about copyright infringement (aka \"piracy\"), but actually alleges infringement of a video about a sunken pirate ship, the justices just couldn't resist.)\n\n---\n\nYour \"eminent domain\" idea is separate from this. Seizing copies of the software wouldn't give the state the right to use them, as the software itself would still be copyrighted. The state would have to seize the copyright, and I don't know whether that is possible \\- it's not necessarily property in that sense. But if they did so, then they wouldn't be infringing the copyright at all (since the state itself would now own the copyright) and this case would be irrelevant. \n\nOn the other hand, when a state uses eminent domain to seize property, they must as you say pay fair market value for it, and that means the market value *before* they seized it. So the value of the copyright in such a case wouldn't be \"nothing\" \\- it would be more like the amount a competitor would have had to pay the software maker to buy all the rights to that product. Likewise, if the state seizes your lovely house and bulldozes it to build a toxic waste dump, they owe you what someone would have paid for the house, not the value of a dump that nobody wants.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court's ruling in Allen v.

So my questions are\n\n1. Am I right in thinking that a developer has a fiduciary duty to the user?\n2. If so, what does this mean for a lot of software development organisations with business models that depend on software that does not entirely respect the interests of its users. For instance, would the developer of an ad\\-blocker who takes money from advertisers for allowing their adverts to bypass his block be considered in breach of this duty?\n\nThe rest of this post will explain my reasoning that this fiduciary relationship exists. Suppose that Alice writes some software and sells it to Bob to use. I happen to live in the UK, but from what I have read the same legal framework exists in many countries.\n\nThe Wex legal dicationary [says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty):\n\n> Fiduciary duty is imposed whenever confidence is reposed on one side\n>  in a contractual relationship, so as to allow that side to exert\n>  influence and dominance over the other.\n\nBob is clearly reposing confidence in Alice here. Alice could have included hidden functionality in the program which would work to Bob's detriment. Bob has no practical way of finding out if Alice has done so. In effect Alice has been given control of a part of Bob's computer. In addition to the physical resources, Alice also has indirect access to information stored on the computer that Bob may wish to keep confidential. Alice has \"influence and dominance\" over those parts of the computer that her program can access.\n\nThe Free Dictionary [says](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fiduciary+duty):\n\n> Courts have neither defined the particular circumstances of fiduciary\n>  relationships nor set any limitations on circumstances from which such\n>  an alliance may arise. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> A fiduciary relationship extends to every possible case in which one\n>  side places confidence in the other and such confidence is accepted;\n>  this causes dependence by the one individual and influence by the\n>  other.\n\nI've seen lists of fiduciary relationships, but it is plain that all of these are illustrative rather than complete. It may be that a court has never found that a software developer has a fiduciary duty (Google hasn't turned up any), but there doesn't seem to be an obstacle to such a finding.\n\nLooking at the second paragraph, it is clear that Bob has placed confidence in Alice. It is not necessarily clear that Alice has accepted such a relationship with Bob in particular, but it seems to me that\n\n1. By offering her program for sale, Alice has accepted a duty to her customers, and\n2. That this duty is a fiduciary one by the nature of the trust placed in her by her customers.\n\nWhen Alice wrote the program she was unaware that Bob in particular was going to run it, so it would not be possible for Alice to know exactly what the interests of Bob are under all circumstances. However she will still have a clear understanding of the general interests of her users as a class, and she has a duty to act in those interests rather than her own.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You could certainly run the argument: it is unlikely to succeed.\n\nFiduciary duties are either specifically legislated (e.g. company directors) or involve a relationship of *confidence* (the obligation to keep secrets) as well as trust (e.g. lawyer, doctor). \n\nEngineers (including software engineers) do not have this and AFAIK a fiduciary duty between an engineer and their client has never been found, even where the work is a one\\-on\\-one commission. For example, an engineer designing a bridge has the duties imposed by their contract to their client and a general common law duty e.g. the bridge won't fall down. \n\nWhere the engineering is for a mass market commercial product finding a fiduciary duty seems a vanishingly small possibility.

In Australia this law is national, from my limited understanding incorporation of companies in the US is a state matter. This legislation will dictate what companies can and can't do.\n\nTypically, such laws require a company to have a constitution which is essentially a contract between all the shareholders with each other and with the company. The law will say what must, may and must not be addressed in the constitution. It is here that such things as issuing new shares and options and transferring existing shares will be addressed.\n\nYou say \"It has not issued any shares or stock options yet.\" This cannot be true; in order for there to *be* a company there *must be* at least one shareholder.\n\nSpecifics\n---------\n\nIssuing stock options or shares *may* be a power granted by the constitution to the CEO but is *usually* reserved to the board or *more rarely* to the members (shareholders). So Alison must determine if she, in fact, has the power to bind the company to such an agreement with Carol or if she needs board (or membership) authorisation.\n\nAs an aside, if Alison *does not* have the power and signs the agreement anyway, then Carol would probably have the legal right to force the Company to honour it; this is because third\\-parties are entitled to the presumption that an officer of the company does have the power.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and best practices for handling this data?\n\nA) Storing country data is always illegal under GDPR and should never be attempted.\n\nB) Converting IP addresses to country data and storing only the country information is generally considered pseudonymisation and is usually acceptable under GDPR, but care must be taken with small populations.\n\nC) Storing any geographical data about users, including country information, requires explicit written consent from each individual user.\n\nD) Using a third-party geolocation service to convert IP addresses to countries is the recommended method for compliance with privacy laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Converting IP addresses to country data and storing only the country information is generally considered a form of pseudonymisation under GDPR. This approach typically anonymizes personal information (the IP address) to a degree that makes it less likely to identify individuals. However, caution is needed when dealing with small populations, as country data combined with other information could potentially identify individuals in countries with very small populations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because storing country data isn't always illegal under GDPR. With proper handling and justification, it can be permissible.\n\nOption C is overly strict. While consent is one basis for processing data under GDPR, it's not always required for storing country information if there's a legitimate interest and appropriate safeguards are in place.\n\nOption D is not recommended. The documentation actually suggests using an offline database to convert IP addresses to countries locally, avoiding the potential privacy issues of sending IP addresses to third-party services."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/354/in-california-what-happens-if-one-spouse-names-a-third-party-as-their-sole-life", "docs_id": 354, "title": "In California, what happens if one spouse names a third party as their sole life insurance beneficiary?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Under California's community property law, each spouse can only control half of the couple's community property in his or her will.

It would be hard to prove that *none* of the premiums were paid by joint funds and would be far easier to just have the spouse waive their rights to the insurance policy if they planned to pay for it with separated funds.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John and Mary are married and live in California, a community property state. John has a life insurance policy worth $500,000, which he purchased during their marriage. Without Mary's knowledge, John changed the beneficiary of the policy to his sister, Jane. John passes away unexpectedly. What is the most likely outcome regarding the distribution of the life insurance proceeds?\n\nA) Jane will receive the full $500,000 as the named beneficiary.\nB) Mary will receive the full $500,000 as John's spouse.\nC) Mary will receive $250,000 and Jane will receive $250,000.\nD) The distribution will depend on whether John paid the premiums from separate or community property.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In California, a community property state, life insurance policies purchased during marriage are generally considered community property. Even if one spouse names someone other than their spouse as the beneficiary, the surviving spouse is typically entitled to half of the proceeds unless they have explicitly waived their rights. In this case, since John changed the beneficiary without Mary's knowledge or consent, Mary would likely be entitled to her community property share (50%) of the insurance proceeds, which is $250,000. The remaining $250,000 would go to the named beneficiary, Jane. The source of premium payments (separate or community property) is not typically considered in determining the distribution of proceeds in community property states, unless there's clear evidence and legal documentation separating the funds."}}
