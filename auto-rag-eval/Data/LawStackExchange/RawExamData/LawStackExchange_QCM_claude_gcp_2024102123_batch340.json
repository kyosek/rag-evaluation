In addition to that, there is a law that further implements this principle, the [general equal opportunity law (Dutch)](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algemene_wet_gelijke_behandeling) which requires equal opportunities in regards to offering work, housing, goods, and services. I assume that most European countries have similar clauses and my question is not limited to the Netherlands, it just happens to be that I know the Dutch law a little bit.\n\nWhy is it that companies can refuse someone business in equal cases? I.e. accept one customer but not another.\n\nOne example is a bank, where I am refused an account without any given reason but seemingly because their snitches have no information on me (a GDPR request turned up \"we have no data on you\"). Another example would be a cheap rental place requires the tenant to earn 5 times the rent (nobody that earns 5x that rent wants to live there), so they refuse me despite my offering to pay the full rental period ahead (one year). There is no nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to do business with me, since from a business perspective my case is equal or even more favorable than others'.\n\nI am probably misunderstanding this principle and applying it incorrectly, since I am not a lawyer. Nevertheless, when comments on sites like reddit tell me that \"of course they can always just refuse your custom\" and I ask \"why? The law says \\[as above]\" nobody seems to have an answer. I'm curious what the reason is and would be happy with an answer for any country in the European Union that has a similar principle of equality.\n\nThe only reason I can think of is that the law doesn't say \"you have to give a reason when refusing business\", and therefore I cannot prove that the reason was discriminatory. Or even if it wasn't, they won't give it for the case that I find some legal reason why it isn't a valid reason. Still, in equal situations it seems to me that I should expect equal treatment.\n\nI've seen [this other question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/999/when-is-it-okay-as-a-retail-store-owner-to-refuse-service-to-a-customer) but that is about the USA (with a completely different set of values and laws).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Why is a business allowed to refuse a customer?\n\nBecause also *freedom of contract* is a right.

Note that the GDPR does not outlaw algorithmic decision\\-making.\n\nSince legislation in the EU (as in the US) portrays an approach of market economy, both bank and landlord are entitled to made decisions on the basis of their inner policies for risk management.

The main legal question is whether you are operating a website. A website operator has to comply with various laws that require them to remove content. For example, if you operate a website that allows users to distribute content that they upload, they can distribute copyright\\-protected content, and you can be held liable for copyright infringement. DMCA in the US provides a way for you to not get sued, but you have to be able to remove putatively infringing content, so you could get sued if you can't remove illegal content. This may also include legal troubles over e.g. defamatory content where a plaintiff gets a court order to remove the content \u2013 you can't plead \"I can't it down\" if the court orders you to do so.\n\n[Napster was sued](https://web.archive.org/web/20030706044926/http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/napster/napster-md030601ord.pdf) for copyright infringement and racketeering for facilitating law\\-breaking by others (\"secondary infringement\"), and in [MGM v.

Grokster and the general obligations of website operators, the developer can indeed be held liable for illegal content on their platform, even if they cannot remove it themselves. The inability to remove content does not shield the operator from legal responsibility. Courts can order content removal, and failure to comply due to technical limitations is not a valid defense. Additionally, copyright laws like the DMCA require operators to have the ability to remove infringing content to avoid liability. Therefore, creating a platform explicitly designed to prevent content removal could be seen as facilitating illegal activities, making the developer potentially liable for the resulting infringements by users."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3642/what-are-the-limits-on-police-qualified-immunity", "docs_id": 3642, "title": "What are the limits on police &quot;qualified immunity&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When the police seize property in the course of their official duties, they have \"qualified immunity.\" How is that immunity qualified? I.e., what are the minimal conditions under which they could be stripped of that immunity and subject to *criminal* charges like Theft?\n\nTo take the most extreme example I can think of: A police officer encounters you during the investigation of a crime. You happen to be moving that day, so all of your belongings are in \"plain view\" between the yard, open house, and open moving truck. The cop decides he *really* doesn't like you and so, even though there is no nexus between you or your property and the crime he is investigating he decides to seize all of your property as \"evidence.\" Because it's in \"plain view\" he doesn't need a warrant. He properly logs your property into evidence, and then lets you know you won't see it until the case has been adjudicated. (What case, and when will that be? He won't tell you because it's an open investigation, but he notes that these things can drag on for *years*. I.e., he articulates an *intent* to deprive you of your property for so long a period as to satisfy the requirements of Theft.)\n\nIs this cop immune to any criminal charge for this action?\n\nWhat if you, as the victim, can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not follow proper procedures.

You may *personally* be sure that your claims are not in fact libelous (because you know they are true), but the relevant concern here is whether you can prove that your claims are not libelous in a court of law.\n\nIf your employer sues you for libel, you have the advantage that your have already organized a substantial defense. You could use the same evidence from your nonpayment case as you do in the libel case against you, which makes it substantially easier to handle the libel suit. If it held up in court during the nonpayment case, it may do well in the libel suit as well. Of course, if you do not win your nonpayment suit, then that does *not* speak well about the ability of your evidence to hold up in court.\n\nEven if you do win, however, take care that the scope of your claims does not exceed what you can actually prove: if you have 10 verifiable witness statements from people defrauded by your manager, but you claim in your ad that he defrauded hundreds of people, then obviously your available evidence does not go very far in defending against the libel charge. Those ten witnesses may be enough for you to win your nonpayment case, but not necessarily enough to defend you against libel, depending on your exact statements.\n\nAs another answer already notes, stealing is quite different from nonpayment: the former implies bad\\-faith intent to permanently deprive you of something, while nonpayment could simply be the result of a poorly run business or unexpected financial setback. If you only have evidence of a history of nonpayment with no evidence about motivation, an accusation of stealing might be difficult to prove.\n\nMy guess as a non\\-lawyer is that a safe statement to make might be, \"I have successfully sued Comapny X \\[or whoever the defendant was] for nonpayment, and included as evidence 10 other accounts of people who suffered a similar fate.\" Such a statement is an easily verifiable matter of public record."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A former employee successfully sued their previous employer for non-payment and wants to publicize this information.

One theory is \"general jurisdiction\" and the other is \"specific jurisdiction.\"\n\n*General Jurisdiction*\n\nWhen a court has \"general jurisdiction\" over a person, it can hear claims against that person arising anywhere in the world based upon any legal theory upon which relief may be granted by a court. Essentially what you seem to be really asking is whether funding through the U.S. Development Finance Corporation gives U.S. courts general jurisdiction over the foreign company.\n\nThe answer to this is \"no.\"\n\nThe only courts that have general jurisdiction over a company are the courts of the jurisdiction under whose laws it is established (e.g. Delaware for a company formed under Delaware law), and courts of a jurisdiction where a company has a headquarters significant enough for the company to be considered \"at home\" there (most companies would have only one headquarters, but some companies might have two or three of them that are equally core to its top level operations).\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court adopted this rule in a unanimous 9\\-0 decision in the case *Daimler Ag v. Bauman*, [571 U.S. 117](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/571/117/), 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014\\), which overruled a line of cases generally credited to the U.S. Supreme Court case of *International Shoe v. State of Washington*, [326 U.S. 310](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/310/) (1945\\). *International Shoe* had been widely interpreted for decades, before being effectively overruled by *Daimler*, to mean that simply having a registered agent in a state, a permanent employee based in a state, or a permanent office for the conduct of business in a state that need not be the company's headquarters, is sufficient to give U.S. courts general jurisdiction over that company.\n\nThe facts of the question, however, suggest that the foreign company wouldn't even meet the old *International Shoe* case standard. Certainly, the mere existence of the funding from a U.S. government agency, in and of itself, would not give U.S. courts general jurisdiction over a foreign company.\n\n*Specific Jurisdiction*\n\nThe other theory under which a court may assert jurisdiction (in an *in personam* case like a breach of contract case) is called \"specific jurisdiction\". This theory requires that the party sued did something to \"purposefully avail itself\" of the laws of the place where the court is located in connection with the course of events or transaction that form the basis of the lawsuit. Sometimes \"specific jurisdiction\" is also called \"[long arm jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-arm_jurisdiction)\".\n\nSo, unless the lawsuit related to the funding transaction from the government agency in some way (e.g. a suit by the agency to collect on a loan from it to the foreign company after it fails to repay the money lent to it as agreed), this funding transaction is not sufficient to establish \"specific jurisdiction\" over the foreign company.\n\nInstead, the transaction and events that form a basis for the lawsuit would have to have sufficient contacts with the U.S. to justify an exercise of \"specific jurisdiction\" over the company. A company isn't required to submit to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts for all dealings with U.S. persons simply as a result of receiving this funding.\n\n*Domestication of Foreign Judgments*\n\nIf the U.S. courts did not assert jurisdiction over the foreign company, however, and the U.S. person then won a foreign lawsuit against the funding recipient, the U.S. person could probably [domesticate the foreign judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_of_foreign_judgments) in a U.S. court (i.e. obtain formal recognition in a U.S. court that a valid judgment has been entered by a foreign court against a person), in order to garnish the proceeds of the U.S. Development Finance Corporation loan that would otherwise have been payable to the foreign person.\n\n*Footnote on Tag Jurisdiction*\n\nWhen you sue a natural person, a court can assert jurisdiction of that person (even in an *in personam* case), if that person has a summons from the court in that case is hand delivered to them in the state where the court is located. This is allowed even if neither the state where the court is located, nor the case, have any other connection to that person. *Burnham v. Superior Court*, [495 U.S. 604](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/604/) (1990\\). This is sometimes called \"tag jurisdiction\".\n\nBut, while the U.S. Supreme Court has not definitively ruled that companies are not subject to tag jurisdiction, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit (which is an intermediate federal appellate court immediately below the U.S. Supreme Court and covers most of the Western United States) has held that corporations aren't subject to tag jurisdiction, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider a certiorari petition from that ruling. *[Martinez v. Aero Caribbean](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/08/21/12-16043.pdf)*, 764 P.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2014\\) cert. denied 135 S.Ct. 2310 (2015\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A foreign company, XYZ Corp, incorporated in France with its headquarters in Paris, receives funding from the US Development Finance Corporation.

Sanctions being applied not only by USA but sometime by other states and unions of countries (EU for example).\n\nI know that equipment from, say, an American manufacturer, could not be supplied to North Korea (for example an Oracle Server or a Cisco router) pending legal action.

Giving everyone\n>  freedom means giving evil people freedom, too.\n\nThe notion of \"good people\" and \"evil people\" is beyond the scope of this question, but this tells me that anybody, anywhere could in fact use it without any troubles at all (talking about only the **usage** of the software).\nHowever, naively, even if I would see the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) as an Open Source License, I see it as well, naively, as a License created under US Law by an American Institution (MIT License).\n\nMy question is divided as this:\n\n1. Can developers from a state under such sanction, use Open Source Software as they want ?\n2. Could developers of the Open Source Software be sued for the use of their creation by the states under sanction ?\n3.

I'm essentially on a zero\\-hour contract, however my contract says that when work is available I will be given 24 hour/week \"basic\". There is usually more than enough work to go around and I can ask for overtime, with the exception of a few days in winter when our client airlines reduce their schedules.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was always a race for people to book Christmas off as the vast majority fairly reasonably don't want to work on Christmas Day and some are reliant on public transit (the company knows this and chose to hire us anyway). We're usually done by 11am unless a flight is delayed so it's not like I can't enjoy the holidays *and* work them (I can also refuse to work the past my scheduled finish time), however unless they remember to put me on shifts with colleagues who I can get a ride to/from work, it gets prohibitively expensive to get to and from work in a taxi.\n\nAbout a year before I started, the employment contract for new employees was changed.

A lesser included charge is a crime for which all the elements must be established to prove the greater charge, but the converse is not true.\n\nThus, if someone is charged only with manslaughter in an indictment to which they plead not guilty, they cannot be convicted of murder. But, if someone is charged with murder in an indictment, to which they plead not guilty, they can be convicted of either murder or manslaughter which is a lesser included charge relative to a murder charge.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nBasically, the criminal justice process goes through the following steps in **a felony case** (some of which may be omitted in misdemeanor and/or petty offense cases):\n\n1. Someone is charged with a crime in a **criminal complaint** and **arrested**. These two events can occur in either order. If the complaint is made first, an arrest warrant will be issued by a magistrate and form the basis for a subsequent arrest and booking. If an arrest is made first, usually because a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe a crime was committed, the criminal complaint will be drawn up once the defendant has been arrested and booked.\n2. After both events in step 1 are complete, a **first appearance** of the defendant **in person** before a magistrate or judge is held in a matter of one to three days, or even a matter of hours, at which counsel is appointed if the defendant is indigent, the defendant is formally advised of the charges in the criminal complaint, and bail is set (or denied for cause or waived). Confusingly a first appearance is sometimes called an \"arraignment on the complaint\", but I am assuming that your question used the term \"arraignment\" in the predominant sense of an arraignment on an information or indictment.\n3. Then, in felony cases (but not misdemeanors), the criminal complaint is reviewed for probable cause following a **preliminary hearing** and if probable cause is found to exist it is converted to an \"information\" (if the preliminary hearing is waived by the defendant, the complaint is automatically converted to an \"information\"); or a **grand jury** reviews the criminal complaint for probable cause and if probable cause is found to exist it is converted to an \"indictment.\"\n4. The defendant is **arraigned** **in person** on the information or indictment. In an arraignment, the defendant is formally informed of the charges in the information or indictment, and the defendant enters a preliminary plea to each of the charges in the information or indictment. This would typically take five minutes to half an hour, depending upon the number of charges brought.\n5. **Pre\\-trial proceedings** (e.g., \"discovery\" and motion practice), if any, are conducted by the lawyers for the prosecution and the defense.\n6. A **trial** is held (if the defendant demands it, before a jury).\n\n**Caveat:** There are also more steps prior to the filing of a criminal complaint or arrest (related to searches, seizures and interrogations), and there are also more steps after the trial (related to sentencing, appeals and collateral attacks on convictions and the sealing of records and pardons and commutations), but none of those steps are pertinent to this question.\n\nA jury trial would simply never be (definitively and officially) scheduled until an arraignment of the defendant was conducted. So, while it is true that a jury trial would not be conducted on charges in an indictment until the defendant is arraigned (i.e., until the defendant enters a plea to the probable cause screened charges), in the ordinary course, this is a trivial matter.\n\nBut, because criminal trials can only be conducted after a defendant has been arraigned in person, the only time that a defendant can be tried in *abstentia* (i.e., without being present at the trial), is when the defendant is arraigned and enters a not guilty plea or the equivalent, and then absconds after that points but before the trial is conducted.\n\n(I'm not a complete expert on this, it may be necessary for the defendant to be present when the trial is commenced as well, but I don't need to know to answer this question.)\n\nAlso, while the requirement of an indictment by a grand jury for felonies exists in federal court under the U.S. Constitution, and in some state courts (mostly in the Eastern U.S.) under state constitutions, the U.S. Constitution permits a state to substitute a preliminary hearing giving rise to an \"information\" for a grand jury indictment if its state constitution permits.\n\nMy source for this post is a hard copy of the book Israel, Kamisar and LaFave, *Criminal Procedure and the Constitution* (1994\\). But, these basic principles have been in place unchanged for a very long time."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal case, a defendant is initially charged with manslaughter in a criminal complaint.

Members of the public have a right to security and privacy, and information obtained about them must not be improperly divulged.\n\nMany police departments have similar codes of conduct or policies. Such a policy might apply in the circumstances described in the question.\n\nIn [this page on \"Confidential information\"](https://www.taylorwessing.com/synapse/protection_confidential_info.html) posted by the TaylorWessing law firm, it is said that:\n\n> There are three circumstances in which the disclosure of information gives rise to an obligation of confidence:\n> \n> \n> * An obligation imposed by contract \u2013 for example, non\\-disclosure agreements.\n> * An obligation implied because of the circumstances of disclosure \u2013 this is determined on the basis of whether a reasonable man standing in the shoes of the recipient of the information would have realised that the information was being given to him in confidence.\n> * An obligation implied because of the special relationship between the parties concerned \u2013 for example, employer/employee relationships.\n> \n> \n> The best way of ensuring that confidential information is recognised and treated as such is by contract. If no express requirement for confidentiality is imposed, the manner in which the discloser treats the information can be held as indicative of its level of confidentially. Talking about information in public places, for example, would cause the recipient to assume it was not confidential in nature.\n> \n> \n> An action for breach of confidence is based on the conscience of the recipient who must have agreed or known that the information is confidential. Thus an action for breach of confidence can be brought against the original recipient of the information and any subsequent recipient who becomes aware of the fact that the information is confidential.\n> \n> \n> An action for breach of confidence may be brought against a person who has used or disclosed, or threatened to use or disclose, confidential information without permission.\n\nA police officer engaged in a search of confidential documents, whether found on a phone, on a computer, or in a filing cabinet, is in a \"special relationship\" with the sub ject of the search, and the \"circumstances of disclosure\" are unusual. Use of such information for private, personal gain unrelated to any police function might be held to violate an implied duty of confidentiality, particularly if the officer is informed of the confidential nature of the documents.\n\nIf the documents contain or constitute ***trade secrets***, unauthorized use will give grounds for a lawsuit.

Drivers should stop behind the \"no stopping zone\", treating its back line as a stop line. This approach satisfies both the requirement to stop before a crosswalk and the rule not to stop in the \"no stopping zone\". The \"no stopping zone\" is designed to provide extra room for large vehicles to turn, and stopping behind it ensures both pedestrian safety and smooth traffic flow.

According to federal regulations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their ability to legally carry firearms during this event?\n\nA) The group can legally open carry firearms anywhere along their route, including on federal property, as New Hampshire state law permits open carry.\n\nB) The group can open carry firearms along most of their route, but must disarm or avoid the immediate vicinity of the federal building.\n\nC) The group cannot open carry firearms at all during their event due to the presence of a federal building along their route.\n\nD) The group can only open carry firearms if they obtain special permission from both state and federal authorities for their awareness event.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Federal rules on firearm carry generally apply only to federal buildings, military bases, and Indian reservations. The presence of a federal building along the route does not prohibit open carry for the entire event. However, the group would need to disarm or avoid the immediate area around the federal building, as carrying firearms is typically not allowed in or near federal facilities. For the rest of their route on public streets or state-managed lands, New Hampshire's open carry laws would apply.

I did not use any of their resources to create it, was not compensated for it and designed and built the program with little input. I don't mind giving them the technology, but am worried that I won't be recognized as its creator, and that the copyright can be used to claim ownership rights to my future projects, since I frequently recycle code that I've written. On the other hand, I need a reference and don't want to strain any relationships. Any thoughts on how to proceed is welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are an employee hired to program, your employer holds the copyright, as a \"work for hire\". So the main questions are, are you an employee, and is this work done in the scope of your employment? The fact that you did not receive a salary isn't entirely dispositive \u2013 I take it this was some sort of internship, where you receive academic credit. Under that premise, they might argue that you were an employee (but they might lose that argument in court). The other issue, whether this was done \"on the job\" versus \"during the time period when you had an affiliation\" is not something that can be judged from a legal perspective. They will have a certain position about what you were doing, which you may or may not agree with, so it depends on how compelling your argument is vs. their argument that it was work\\-related. Since the scope of one's \"employment\" is not narrowly defined by some initial agreement (it can change), the fact that you did this \"at the request of the department head to be distributed by the institution\" indicates that it wasn't something unrelated to the job, which you did as a hobby. So on the face of it, it looks that this is indeed within the scope of the job.\n\nThere is a separate and distinct possibility, that one of the forms you signed actually signed away your rights (which would moot the question about you benig an employee). It is not at all uncommon for affiliation agreements (intern, employee, adjunct member, independent contractor) to include a clause assigning the institution the rights to your IP.\n\nYou are correct that there is a potential for them to interfere with future programming projects of yours. If they in fact own the source code, then they own all of the sub\\-bits of the code. Copyright protects the means of expression, but not the underlying facts. What is unknown (in law) is where that dividing line is software. It would not overcome copyright protection to simply replace all of the variable names (e.g. \"item\\_count\" \u2192 \"count\\_of\\_items\"), and cosmetically reorganizing code a also doesn't get rid of copyright protection. However, variable names and structure of code often (ideally?) follows from the nature of what the program does, so necessarily (to take an example), all bubble sort programs resemble all other bubble sort programs to the point that one might accuse an author of infringement. It's an interesting and not clearly answered question, how similar two functionally identical pieces of code can be without there being infringement.\n\nAgain, since copyright protects expression and not ideas, if in the course of writing a program you discover a clever algorithm for doing something (rather than dividing by the nth power of 2, shift right n), that knowledge is not protected by copyright, and it is to be expected that if you learn how to solve a problem once, you can re\\-invent the solution again (and it will strongly resemble the earlier solution). This murky copyright situation means that writing any new code in a somewhat overlapping area is a bit risky, since there is a high probability that any new code would have the level of substantial similarity that constitutes evidence of infringement.\n\nThere is no reliable way to find out whether they would succeed in an infringement suit, other than to get sued and see what happens.

Generally, criminal trials proceed under the law as it existed at the time the alleged crime was committed.

The new law passed during the trial would not typically affect the ongoing proceedings, and the defendant would be tried under the legal framework that existed in 2020 when the alleged embezzlement occurred.

But chances are you won't be dealing with the bank; the bank will have to deal with the producers and art directors of the film, and vice versa, and you will be out of the loop. You will need to convince all parties to work together and reach a business licensing agreement to allow you to have a custom bank/credit card.\n\nYou will need to find the producers of the film and ask them if they will license the artwork to the bank; they won't be licensing the artwork to you. And they probably won't like your adaptation of the artwork, so they will want to do their own artwork and design suite. If that happens, they will need to sign a deal with the bank system. And there will be money involved; I can't see the artist licensing their artwork for free to another business, so the bank will need to decide if it is worth it to get more customers to open card accounts.\n\nIt's worth a try; sometimes it is possible to get a one\\-off personal clearance from a copyright holder for a single license of artwork. It's possible you could get a letter from the artist/producer to take to the bank, drafted by their lawyer, releasing the bank system from any copyright infringement with the artwork for the single card.\n\nMaybe it will give the producers of animated films the idea that they should license their artwork for checks and bank/credit cards. i.e., [http://wowjapan.asia/2015/12/anime\\-visa\\-gets\\-three\\-official\\-attack\\-titan\\-credit\\-card\\-designs/](http://wowjapan.asia/2015/12/anime-visa-gets-three-official-attack-titan-credit-card-designs/) Or at least you might get a nice email from the film producers turning you down."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer wants to use copyrighted artwork from the movie \"My Neighbour Totoro\" on their custom bank card.

The question presents a situation very similar to the one described in the LawStackExchange post. The key point from the expert's answer is that a work can be considered derivative even if it doesn't contain any \"mechanical part\" of the original. The fact that the album retells the story, uses similar plot points, and references character names and dialogue from the original movie likely makes it a derivative work, even if 99.9% of the lyrics are original.

If you pay close attention to such news articles you will see that they are usually very careful to use words such as \"alleged\", \"accused\", \"is on trial for\" etc.\n\nSee the case of [Christoper Jefferies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Joanna_Yeates#Media_controversy) for an example of a person who was accused of a murder, but subsequently found innocent, and who successfully sued various newspapers for defamation.

The consultancy reports and software are all delivered via internet.

How would that apply if a team of software developers had a virtual \"pair programming\" session, with one in USA, one in UK, and one in the Far East ? \"Where\" has that software been written?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a tricky question on the intersection of visa and tax laws. It is tricky because every country can make its own rules that apply when you are in that country or do business in that country. Even within the EU, there is no uniform approach because *freedom of movement* merely covers the right to work in a country, but not the rules which have to be followed when doing so. Thus, you have to fall back to reading each individual country's rules and legislation.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Whether you are even allowed to work or which work activities are permitted depends on your visa or visa\\-free status. If you are a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you can come to and work in every EEA country, until the end of the Brexit transition period, subject to the same rules as residents in that country.\n\nOften, visa\\-free visits or business visa allow some business activities such as attending meetings with clients or collecting information, but not performing actual work. If you're interested in what business activities the UK allows visitors from other countries to do, take a look at the [visitor rules](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor-rules).\n* Income tax may be due at the place of tax residency or where the income is generated/earned, in particular where you actually perform the work. There is a widespread belief that you only gain tax residency after staying in one country for 6 months, but this is misleading in the general case: every country makes its own rules, and income tax may be due even without (permanent) tax residency.\n\nThe relevant countries (the country where you work and the country where you normally reside) might have a tax agreement that specifies where tax is due. Within the EU, it is fairly common that a person works in a different country than the one they reside in, so there is a well\\-developed network of tax treaties. Often, certain activities are exempt from local taxes, such as compensation for visiting researchers or regular employment.\n\nThere's also a good chance that profit from independent work / business profits are only taxable at the place(s) where that enterprise has a permanent establishment \u2013 but it depends on the details.\n\nThis section is based on the OECD model tax treaty ([https://doi.org/10\\.1787/mtc\\_cond\\-2017\\-en](https://doi.org/10.1787/mtc_cond-2017-en)) which most treaties follow closely. If no tax treaty exists that exempts your income from local taxation, you must consult the local tax laws.\n* VAT rules are entirely different, and for B2B services are generally taxed at the location of the client (place of supply rules). But every country makes its own rules. Exception: within the EEA, cross\\-border B2B supply is always taxed at and by the client via the reverse\\-charge mechanism.\n\nSo things can get quite tricky, and a business visitor should inform themselves beforehand what activities they are allowed to perform abroad and whether there are tax implications.\n\n> is it any different from a UK author going travelling, taking lots and lots of notes, or even writing his/her next novel whilst in various locations, and publishing once returned to the UK?\n\nHere no tax implications arise because the travelling author is not paid during their travels, but they have to consider visa rules when performing their work. Such rules often have exemptions for artists. However, it depends on the rules of the travelled country.\n\n> what basis does a government have for deciding \"where\" work was done?\n\nEach country is sovereign and can make its own rules.\n\n> How would that apply if a team of software developers had a virtual \"pair programming\" session, with one in USA, one in UK, and one in the Far East ? \"Where\" has that software been written?\n\nIt is not generally relevant where software was written, aside from copyright or export regulation issues which might have their own rules. Since each of the three programmers is working in their own country, no particular visa or income tax issues arise. However, if they have a common employer, the employer does have to consider the local employment laws regardless of where the employer is established, which may include paying some taxes in every country."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based software consultant is planning to work remotely while traveling through various European countries for 3 months.

(See [17 USC 102](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) in the US, and similar laws elsewhere.) A machine\\-produced translation is not an original work, and it is surely not then work of the author of the overall book.\n\nHowever, the author would still have a copyright on the book **as a whole**. The legal situation is no different than if the author had simply quoted a 19th century work. One may incorporate public domain works into a later work, and that later work is still protected by copyright, provided that there is enough original contentr to make the work as a whole \"an original work of authorship\". Others may use the PD \\[arts, or the original from which they are taken, but not the rest of the work (beyond what fair use would allow in any case).\n\nFor example, I have made a number of posts here on LAW.SE.

Or does GDPR not extend to private individuals?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: GDPR probably applies.\n\nThe GDPR does not make a distinction between natural persons and corporations, or between \u201cprivate individuals\u201d and businesses. Any processing of personal data is covered.\n\nThere is a GDPR exception when the processing is done for *purely personal or household purposes*. In particular, ordinary social media use is explicitly covered by this exception. But case law (such as the CJEU *Lindqvist* case) suggests that this word \u201cpurely\u201d requires a narrow interpretation of this exception \u2013 it is likely that your survey wouldn't be exempt, and would then have to comply with GDPR rules. In particular, the survey would involve data from an indeterminate number of data subjects to which you have no prior personal relationship, suggesting that you aren't running the survey for purely personal or household purposes.\n\nOther potential arguments why GDPR might not apply, and why they don't hold in your case:\n\n* *Lack of material scope \u2013 no relevant means of processing*: GDPR only applies when the processing of personal data is done using electronic means, or when the data is intended to be incorporated into a filing system.\n\nBut here you propose to use an online survey, which definitely involves electronic means.\n\nAs an example of a survey method that *might* be GDPR\\-exempt, consider in\\-person or telephone interviews where answers are not recorded individually but are immediately aggregated on a tally sheet. This might sidestep issues of creating a filing system.\n* *Lack of material scope \u2013 no personal data*: GDPR only applies if the processing activities involve personal data. Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, where identification also includes indirect identification with the help of additional information and third parties, or just being able to single out one data subject's records. If there are no reasonable means that could likely lead to identification, the data is truly anonymous and GDPR wouldn't apply. Aggregate statistics are often anonymous.\n\nBut while the results of your survey might not be covered by GDPR, the individual survey responses would definitely be personal data. Conducting the survey involves processing these responses, so that these activities would be covered by GDPR.\n* *Lack of territorial scope*: GDPR only applies (1\\) if the processing activities are performed in the context of an EU/EEA/UK establishment, or (2\\) if the processing relates to the offering of goods or services or monitoring of behaviour of people who are in the EU/EEA/UK.\n\nBut since you live in the EU, criterion (1\\) is fulfilled and GDPR applies. Even if not, your survey seems to be directed to people who are in the EU, so that criterion (2\\) would also apply."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A university employee wants to conduct a personal survey about citizenship application timelines in a Facebook group.

No legal system can require that there be an actual \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d**, for that would provide too much of an incentive to those who would like to contract with their \u201cfingers crossed\u201d. The requirement that a subjective agreement exist would permit one party to stay with a contract only so long as it suited its convenience; when it did not, the party could claim that it had never really agreed to the other\u2019s terms.\n> \n> \n> (*MacNeil v.

As explained in the documentation, courts do not attempt to ascertain the actual subjective intentions of the parties. Instead, they use an objective standard, considering whether a reasonable bystander would conclude that the parties intended to contract and that the essential terms can be determined with reasonable certainty.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it focuses on subjective intentions, which courts explicitly avoid in contract interpretation. As stated in Eli Lilly & Co. v.

The correct approach, as outlined in Ron Ghitter Property Consultants Ltd. v.

Moreover, the state can prosecute the offender for fraud, which can result in significant criminal penalties, including jail time. The example given from NSW (which, while not in the US or UK, is indicative of how seriously such offenses are treated in common law jurisdictions) shows that fraud can be punishable by up to 10 years in jail.

Unless the work was created a long time ago, or was created by the US government (not the same as \"funded by government money\"), you should assume that the work is protected. That means that you must have permission to copy it. Sometimes, a work has associated with it some such permission, in the form of a \"license\". Without such a license, you have to request the copyright owner for permission to copy \u2013 whether or not they say that the work is protected by copyright (because by law it is protected, so they don't have to say that it is).\n\nIf you request permission to copy, and do not receive the required permission, then you cannot legally copy the work.

According to copyright law, any creative work, including images and diagrams, is automatically protected by copyright upon creation, even if there's no explicit copyright notice. The absence of a response to a permission request does not imply consent to use the image. The safest and legally correct approach is to assume the image is copyrighted and refrain from using it without explicit permission. However, the author can still reference the image by listing its URL in the appendix if necessary. Options A and B are incorrect because they involve using the image without permission, which could lead to copyright infringement. Option D is incorrect because \"fair use\" is a complex doctrine that doesn't automatically apply just because permission was requested, and using an entire image in a book is unlikely to qualify as fair use in most cases."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76645/if-a-property-changes-owner-during-party-wall-act-works-what-is-the-effect-on-c", "docs_id": 76645, "title": "If a property changes owner during Party Wall Act works, what is the effect on consents, s10 processes, and further work stages?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Party Wall Act governs works which by their nature may extend over a significant period of time, and are inherently not absolutely certain and deterministic at commencement. (For example, during the stated works a problem could arise, or unavoidable outside circumstances could force a change of plan).\n\nIt also contains a regime of notices and consents that a party wishing to build,must serve on adjoining owners and occupiers (all of them, if more than one exists), and they must serve back. Parties may also need to incur and defray expenses, and reimburse each other.\n\nI'm curious what the effect is, if the adjoining property changes hands midway through works. Usually, consent is given and notices served by one legal person to another.\n\n**Do the consents and notices stay with the original neighbouring owner, or stay with the property (hence move to the new one)? How would courts handle the fallout from a midway change of neighbours in practice, given the Act doesn't say a thing on the topic? How far if at all, is a new owner bound by the consent of a prior owner**\n\nTo make the question more concrete, and indicate what kind of area Im curious about, perhaps its easier to give a few example situations.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nSuppose A wishes to build on the boundary between her house, and that of adjoining neighbour B. At some point C will replace B as the owner of (or person legally responsible for) the adjoining property.\n\n4 examples capture the situations I can think of:\n\n1. B consents, but sells the property or dies, and C takes over. I assume C either should have taken due diligence and inquired during purchase, or B has a duty to disclose, or C \"took a chance\" on any legal matters if B died leaving no documents behind and C bought it anyway. But in any case, C finds out and objects. **Can C withdraw any of the consents B gave, or is he bound by B's acts so far? Must A re\\-request any consents?**\n2. B sells to C, and subsequently, A raises an unforeseen/unexpected expense allocation dispute. B may have incurred or defrayed the expense, or perhaps some of the inconvenience was suffered by B and some by C. **In either case, the Act only seems to contemplate the current owner/occupier C, being able to engage in the surveyor dispute resolution process. What happens?**\n3. The works are complex and undertaken in stages. Once commenced, they must be completed, but a description of the work for which consent will be requested at stage 2 or 3 cannot be known until stage 1 is complete, which will potentially take more than 12 months. Immediately after being told about the works and serving a consent notice, B (without telling A of this) sells to C, disclosing the stage 1 works and consent notices. A has in writing that B understood there would be further works beyond the original consented party wall notice for stage 1, but these were likely to take place outside the time limit for current consent. Meanwhile C wishes to argue that this constitutes a mere acknowledgement by B of A's future intent, and B clearly did not give PW Act consent to stage 2 or 3, and nor will C. Further the property is safe structurally so \"necessity\" doesn't apply. **Who wins? If C, then how can any owner safeguard himself from that situation? What should A have done if the works might have been of uncertain nature or duration, in his original notice to B?**\n4. A and B, as friends, decide that, as not sending irksome legalistic notices back and forth isn't a breach of the Act or an Offence, they will amicably agree A will do the works on a verbal agreement, and keep B apprised. In return for B's agreement and support, permission to enter B's garden through the side gate as needed, and generally making it easier to do the works, A will in turn undertake the works in a way that costs a bit more but is beneficial to B. In law, this would seem to be valid and also a contract, This works well until B dies and C becomes the owner. C is able to verify from numerous local families, and from emails A produces, that such an agreement did exist in the terms stated. **Is C bound by B's agreement, and can A enforce all, some or none of it, or indeed continue the works, from that point onward?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do the consents and notices stay with the original neighbouring owner, or stay with the property (hence move to the new one)?\n\nConsents remain valid\n\n> How would courts handle the fallout from a midway change of neighbours in practice, given the Act doesn't say a thing on the topic?\n\nIn accordance with the Act.\n\n> How far if at all, is a new owner bound by the consent of a prior owner\n\n100%\n\n1. No and no.\n2. The owner at the relevant time is the owner\n3. An agreement to agree is not a contract. Neither B nor C are required to give consent for future work under the arrangement you describe. A should have required B to grant a [covenant](https://www.isonharrison.co.uk/blog/covenants-on-a-property-explained/).\n4.
