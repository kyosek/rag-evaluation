The question is, who is responsible, the vendor or the manufacturer? Under The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the manufacturer primarily bears liability. The bad news is that the seller is not primarily responsible, unless they have \"done something\" with the product (installed it, modified it, further warrantied it), but also is \"the identity of the manufacturer is not known or if known the service of notice or process or warrant cannot be affected on the manufacturer or it the manufacturer is not subject to the law which is force in India\", i.e. the manufacturer is in another country and isn't subject to Indian law. If this is a simple redistribution contract (A provides wholesale to B, consumer buys retail from B), A bears responsibility: and therefore, you were to have applied to the manufacturer for a replacement.\n\nBut also note that [an expired warranty is not defense](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/expiry-of-warranty-no-defence-if-product-has-inherent-defect/articleshow/19359949.cms?from=mdr) to manufacturer liability, if there is an inherent manufacturing defect. The case underlying that ruling arose from a product that repeatedly failed after multiple repairs where the manufacturer played the \"expired warranty\" card after a number of repairs, but the underlying legal principle is equally applicable to the situation where a repair or replacement is not even made though applied for within the period of warranty.\n\nSo you should sue the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law, in which case you should sue the seller. However, you should really get a lawyer who will then devise a legal strategy (probably amounting to writing a letter) outlining the legal situation.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer in India purchased a defective electrical product that was under warranty. The supplier approved an exchange but was unable to procure a replacement due to the pandemic. The warranty expired during this delay. Now the supplier refuses to honor the exchange, claiming the product is no longer under warranty. Given this scenario, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customer's rights and the appropriate course of action?\n\nA) The customer has no recourse as the warranty has expired, and the supplier is within their rights to refuse the exchange.\n\nB) The customer should only pursue legal action against the supplier, as they are solely responsible for honoring the warranty regardless of circumstances.\n\nC) The customer should file a complaint against both the manufacturer and the supplier jointly, as they share equal responsibility under Indian consumer protection laws.\n\nD) The customer should primarily pursue action against the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law, in which case the seller becomes liable.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to Indian consumer protection laws, particularly The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the manufacturer bears primary liability for defective products. The customer should first seek recourse from the manufacturer, even if the warranty has technically expired, as an expired warranty is not a defense against inherent manufacturing defects. However, if the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law (e.g., based in another country), the responsibility shifts to the seller. Additionally, the article cited mentions that repeated failures after multiple repairs or inability to provide a replacement during the warranty period can extend the manufacturer's liability beyond the stated warranty period. Therefore, the most appropriate action would be to pursue the manufacturer first, unless they are not subject to Indian jurisdiction, in which case the seller becomes the liable party."

The DA is not required to provide new copies directly to the defendant. While it may be helpful for the defendant to have access to these materials, the responsibility for sorting out access to the discovery now lies between the defendant and their former attorney, not with the DA. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they misrepresent the legal obligations and rights in this situation.

My first knowledge of it was that my debit card was declined. Calling my local branch during business hours only got an answering machine under the new bank's name.\n\nI went home, checked 8 months or so of envelopes from the bank, and saw zero pertinent information.\n\nToday I finally got through to a human at my old bank's customer service. Their position: you are no longer a customer, we don't have your accounts. Would you like the new bank's customer service number?\n\nAnd, yes, I got middle\\-sized envelopes from my \"new owner\" twice over the last month. I didn't open them, just as I don't open the offers from other banks that I'm not a member of, insurance companies I have no policies with, car repair scams, etc.\n\nSo, how is any of this legal? There is another branch of my old bank about as far from me as my new one. There are branches all over the state I could have used. Why can't I keep using any of them? When I set up my accounts I had to sign papers: I have signed no papers with this new bank, why do they have a right to my accounts? Not to mention my personal information, which presumably has now been transferred without my permission to a third party that I have never seen a privacy policy for, all without my permission.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contracts are transferrable\n---------------------------\n\nThe default rule is that the rights and obligations that one person holds under a contract (your original bank) can be transferred to any other person (your new bank). This is only not the case where the contract is one for personal services (e.g. an employment contract) or where the contract explicitly proscribes or otherwise limits it.\n\nFor example, if I run a dog walking business and you contract with me to walk your dog on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for 6 months then, at any time, I can transfer my obligation to walk the dog and my right to be paid by you for doing so to anyone else. I can do this by subcontracting (in which case the rights and obligations are still mine \\- I'm just using someone else to fulfil them), or by selling individual contracts (which is how debt collection businesses operate), or by selling the entire business.\n\nIt would be completely normal that the contracts you agreed to when you opened your accounts would allow the bank to sell them.

According to the information provided, contracts are generally transferrable by default, including bank accounts. This is only not the case for personal service contracts or when explicitly prohibited in the contract terms. It's common for bank account agreements to allow the bank to sell or transfer accounts. The customer should check the terms and conditions of their original agreement with the bank.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it may seem logical from a customer's perspective, it's not legally required if the contract allows for transfer.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the legality of the transfer doesn't depend on whether the customer opens all mail from the bank.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no universal requirement for a 12-month notice period for such transfers, though banks typically do provide some form of notice."

You may then need to sue the landlord in small claims court to get the remainder of the deposit (the above guide will be useful). The thing that is not clear is exactly what constitutes \"normal wear and tear\". The state guide tends to emphasize extreme forms of damage such as dogs chewing the woodwork, or cigarette burns.

According to California law and the lease agreement itself, tenants are not responsible for normal wear and tear, even if the property was in \"new\" condition at the start of the tenancy. The lease explicitly states that the security deposit may be used to \"repair damage, excluding ordinary wear and tear.\" Additionally, California law protects tenants from being charged for normal wear and tear. While the tenant acknowledged the \"new\" condition initially, this does not override the legal protections against charging for normal wear and tear. The landlord's attempt to renovate at the tenant's expense for normal wear and tear is not lawful. If a dispute arises, the tenant may need to pursue the matter in small claims court to recover their security deposit."

My conclusion is that for most of the web\\-sites we manage, Google's IP anonymization is *adequate* to ensure *security of processing* as required by the DPIA process. However, on some sites that are likely to visited by users interested in what the GDPR calls \"special categories of personal data\" (Article 9\\), we either do not use Google Analytics, or we add additional layers of security in case the USA Government orders Google to disregard the stipulations in the DPA and hand over the data (yes, the US Government can legally do that \\- read the fine print in the Privacy Shield accord).\n\nAs for Facebook Analytics, I think you've simply misunderstood their [policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).\n\nNowhere in that policy document does Facebook say that they \"are not collecting Personal Identifiable Information\".\n\nAFAIK, they collect tons of it, in all sorts of obnoxious and sneaky ways.\n\nWhat they actually say about PII in the context of Analytics is this:\n\n> We do not *share* information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.\n\nLet me remind you that one of their \"analytics partners\" was Cambridge Analytica, so if this promise not to share is true, it looks like a pretty new policy.\n\nOK, moving on to cookie compliance.\n\nTo you (the controller), both Google and Facebook are processors.\n\nGiven the history of the NSA and the methods it have used and AFAIK still use to get US\\-based companies to hand over the personal data about Europeans through orders issued by secret FISA courts, plus the fact that total nutcases currently are in charge in the USA, I am not going to rely on the privacy policy of any US\\-company for protection of personal data.\n\nSo *if* I make use of Google Analytics (and I often do, they provide a great service), I always make sure that my users opt\\-in on that (hard cookie concent), even I make use of their IP anonymization feature (YMMV).\n\nAs for Facebook, the fact that they promise *not* to share PII with third parties is irrelevant because they *collect* personal data. You will always need consent from your users to hand over their PII to Facebook in the first place.

So A convinced B and C that if as co\\-tenants A,B, and C sign the new lease identical to the original without A's name on it (effectively \"removing\" A from the lease), A would in exchange, provide postdated checks to the landlord for the next three months of \"A's portion\" of the rent, plus the lease change agreement fee. So B and C signed the new lease without A on it.\n\nNote that here, A's agreement to pay \"A's portion\" (which technically isn't spelled out in the lease) of the rent was only communicated to B and C, and not the landlord. In fact, for the lease change, the landlord did not inquire nor care about who will pay how much \\- just that the rent for the place were to be paid by somebody (including possibly those outside the lease).\n\nSoon after A moved out, B and C found out that A in fact, asked the landlord to give A back the postdated checks, and B and C are the only ones obligated to pay the upcoming rent.\n\nSo in summary, what's remaining are 1\\) the new lease which is identical but without A on it, and 2\\) rental obligations of B and C (which are now increased), and 3\\) some traces of A saying that A will pay to the landlord \"A's portion\" of the rent after the lease change.\n\nFrom some of the answers to the original question, there seem to be contract between A and (B and C) for paying \"A's portion\" of the rent, and another contract, the new lease between (B and C) and the landlord.\n\nWhat legal actions do B and C have against A? And which actions are likely to succeed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: B and C have a contract with A\n------------------------------\n\nIn return for paying 3 months rent, B and C will remove A from the lease. This has all the required elements to be a [contract](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/6263/344).\n\nB and C have fulfilled their obligations and A hasn\u2019t. B \\& C could sue A for damages.\n\nThey would need to prove that there was such an agreement and that they agreement was a legally binding contract. Is this agreement written down? Was it witnessed by impartial third parties? What evidence of this agreement do you actually have? If A says they agreed to X, yet B \\& C say they agreed to Y: what evidence exists to show who is right and who is wrong?\n\nFailing to fulfill the obligations of a contract is not fraud. For there to be fraud, B \\& C would have to prove that A never intended to comply by the terms of the agreement. Given that the terms of the agreement are somewhat ambiguous, this would be very difficult. This seems to be more of a case where \\[Hanlon's Razor]: \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" That is, A's actions are more likely to be the result of a misunderstanding (by A, or B \\& C, or both) than a deliberate plan of deception.\n\nThe landlord is not involved \\- they removed A from the lease at the request of A, B \\& C; they\u2019ve done what they\u2019re required to do.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, what is the most accurate legal assessment of the situation between A, B, and C?\n\nA) A has committed fraud against B and C, and they can easily sue A for damages.\n\nB) There is no legal recourse for B and C, as the agreement with A was not in writing.\n\nC) B and C likely have a verbal contract with A, but proving its terms may be challenging.\n\nD) The landlord is partially liable for the situation and can be included in any legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The scenario suggests that there was an agreement between A, B, and C, which likely constitutes a verbal contract. A promised to pay \"A's portion\" of the rent for three months in exchange for being removed from the lease. This agreement has the elements of a contract: offer, acceptance, and consideration.\n\nHowever, proving the exact terms of this verbal agreement may be challenging for B and C. They would need to provide evidence of the agreement, such as witnesses or any written communications. The lack of clear documentation makes it difficult to definitively prove what was agreed upon.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fraud requires proof of intentional deception, which is not clearly established in this scenario. It could be a misunderstanding rather than deliberate fraud.\n\nOption B is incorrect because verbal contracts can be legally binding, though they are often harder to prove than written contracts.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the landlord is not involved in the agreement between A, B, and C. The landlord fulfilled their obligation by modifying the lease as requested by all parties."

The owners of the properties on each side have created a path through the wooded area to access each other, but the path is not required to specifically gain access to their property (basically their kids use it to go play, it's easier than doing an entire loop around the forest to get to each others houses). The properties on both sides have their own respective private roads to access their properties, which end on each side of the one I'm looking to purchase.\n\nI'm not a scrooge and don't plan on blocking them from walking through my property if I purchase it, but I'm wondering if there is an implied right of way that could be fought in court if my building plans end up inhibiting their access to each others properties. Is this a thing? Or does an implied right of way only pertain when it's the only source of access to your property and not necessary a \"luxury access\" between two properties.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *No,* but their use might give them a **prescriptive easement**. Under [Ontario law](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-l15/latest/rso-1990-c-l15.html), to establish a prescriptive easement, the trespassers would have to prove to the court that they:\n\n> 1. Used the property without permission;\n\n> 2. Used it openly and peacefully; and,\n\n> 3. Used it **continuously, uninterruptedly for 20 years.** (You can interrupt their use by giving them permission to use it for 20 years!)\n\n([This article](https://www.hummingbirdlaw.com/property-easements/) summarizes easements in Ontario; the discussion in [a recent decision](http://limitations.ca/?p=694) discusses the statutes in some detail.)\n\n**Implied Easement:** An easement is *implied* if it is necessary for the use of the property. For example, take your previous question. If your parents severed a portion of their property and sold it to you, there would be an implied easement across their land to give you access to the severed portion. The reasoning being that you would only buy the land if you had access to it, so you have the easement as an implication of buying it.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the neighbors' right to continue using the path?\n\nA) The neighbors have an implied easement because the path has been in use for a long time.\n\nB) John can legally block the path immediately upon purchasing the property as there is no established right of way.\n\nC) The neighbors have a prescriptive easement that cannot be challenged in court.\n\nD) The neighbors may be close to establishing a prescriptive easement, but John could prevent this by granting permission for path use upon purchase.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate. In Ontario, a prescriptive easement can be established if the use is continuous, open, and without permission for 20 years. The neighbors have been using the path for 18 years, so they are close to the 20-year mark. However, John could prevent the establishment of a prescriptive easement by explicitly granting permission for the use of the path upon purchasing the property. This would interrupt the \"without permission\" requirement for a prescriptive easement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an implied easement typically applies when access is necessary, not for convenience.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while John could legally block the path, doing so might lead to a legal dispute given the long-standing use.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a prescriptive easement has not yet been established (18 years of use instead of the required 20), and even if it were, it could potentially be challenged in court."

We always try to avoid each other as best as we can. In the past there where several incidents where he would unallowed just enter my room and steal some of my money or my things. Because of that our parents gave us different keys for our bedrooms. Everything worked fine. And nothing like that ever happend again. We are both a little bit on the aggressive side. After a very heated and very aggressive dispute which involved a girl we both are on the verge of fighting each other. My parents are on vacation and I thought that there could be no better time for me and my new girlfriend to also leave and travel somewhere nice. My worries are now that he could break into my room while I\u2019m gone. \nSo my question. If he breaks into my room...could I take some kind of legal action? \nI wouldn\u2019t do it. I just want to know if I could take legal actions. Because if I could, I would let him know that to scare him off. If He knows that I could take legal actions against him for breaking into my room, then he wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nThank you for reading everything and sorry for my bad English.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Germany, there is no statutory offense of \u201cbreaking in\u201d. Instead, break\\-ins are (depending on the nature of the crime) prosecuted as trespassing (Hausfriedensbruch, \u00a7 123 StGB), criminal damage (Sachbesch\u00e4digung, \u00a7 303 StGB) and/or theft (Diebstahl, \u00a7 242 StGB). (Some cases may fit additonal statutory offenses, e. g. tampering with an electronic lock can be computer fraud (Computerbetrug, \u00a7 263a StGB) and hurting someone can be robbery (Raub, \u00a7 249 StGB) and/or personal injury (K\u00f6rperverletzung, \u00a7 223 StGB).)\n\nThis means: If your brother breaks the lock, then that's vandalism. If your brother walks in (without authorization), it's trespassing and if your brother steals your stuff, it's stealing.\n\nOn top of that, since your brother is living in the same household as you, breaking into your room may also be considered domestic violence. The violence protection act (Gewaltschutzgesetz) is very harsh when it comes to domestic violence: The offender can be ordered by court to hand over their home to the victim and to stay away from the home. This means that if your brother breaks into your room, your brother may be removed from the house by court order.\n\nNon\\-compliance with a court order issued under the Gewaltschutzgesetz (e. g. your brother tries to show up at your house after he was ordered to stay away), can be prosecuted under civil *and*(!) penal law.\n\nYou can read the English translation of the German penal code (STrafgesetzbuch, StGB) here (although I prefer to use German because all translations at gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de tend to be low quality): [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/englisch\\_stgb/englisch\\_stgb.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html) \n\nAnd the Violence protection act is here (unfortunately untranslated):\n[https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001\\.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001.html)",

(I would assume it couldn't be member\\-managed, because in that case, nobody could manage it.)\n\nIf so, how would you do this? Could the original owner just sell the LLC to itself in the same way you could sell it to any other LLC?\n\nAlso, could the LLC sell itself later?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nA limited liability company cannot own itself. If a membership interest is transferred to the company itself, for example, in a redemption transaction, that interest simply ceases to exist.\n\nIn a manager\\-managed limited liability company, a manager can only be appointed by a member. See Section 63\\.130\\. And, a limited liability company is defined as \"an entity that is an unincorporated association that has one or more members and is organized under this chapter\".\n\nA \u201cmember\u201d under the law is \"a person with both an ownership interest in a limited liability company and all the rights **and obligations** of a member.\"\n\nThe [Oregon limited liability company law](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors063.html) requires limited liability companies to have members for various purpose, including allocation of tax liability. See Section 63\\.185\\. But under the applicable tax law, a limited liability company cannot allocate income and losses to itself. So, a limited liability company that purported to be a member would not have all of the obligations of a member under Oregon law.\n\nUnder Section 63\\.265 of the law, if the last member of the company ceases to be a member, for example, by dying, the person who becomes the owner of the membership interest (e.g., in the case of a death, the probate estate of the member) automatically becomes a member so that the company has members. This same section also describes transactions by which one can cease to be a member that do not have the effect of causing the company to be a member. If for some reason that couldn't happen, and a company had no members, it would be immediately dissolved by operation of law. See \u00a7 63\\.621(4\\).\n\nThe law also prohibits \"shell companies\", which while defined narrowly, still clarifies the legislature's intent.\n\nWhile an Oregon limited liability company can be formed by someone who is not a member, called an organizer, see \u00a7 63\\.044, and while not all members contemplated when the company is formed need to be members initially, \u00a7 63\\.245, by definition, it must have at least on initial member, and without a member it can't appoint a manager and hence can't conduct business in any way.",

If a membership interest is transferred to the company, that interest ceases to exist.\n\nB is incorrect because changing the management structure doesn't solve the fundamental issue of an LLC being unable to be its own member.\n\nC is correct. An LLC cannot be its own member in Oregon. If John transfers his membership to XYZ LLC, the company would have no members. Under Oregon law, if a company has no members, it is immediately dissolved by operation of law (\u00a7 63.621(4)).\n\nD is incorrect because appointing an external manager doesn't solve the issue of membership. In Oregon, managers can only be appointed by members, and the LLC must have at least one member to exist and operate.\n\nThis question tests understanding of LLC structure, membership requirements, and Oregon-specific LLC laws."

But there were also some British laws related to the enumerated powers of Congress, so perhaps they continued in force as US federal law, at least for a brief period of time until Congress repealed them?\n\nFor example, before Congress enacted the [Naturalization Act of 1790](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1790), would a person born outside the US to a US citizen father have been a US citizen by dint of the US \"inheriting\" the [British Nationality Act 1772](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1772) *mutatis mutandis*?\n\nAnd before Congress enacted the [Crimes Act of 1790](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_Act_of_1790), would an American who levied war against the US, gave aid and comfort to its enemies, or counterfeited US currency have been convicted and sentenced under the [Treason Act 1351](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_Act_1351)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Clearly, British laws against e.g. murder, theft, fraud, and most\n> other crimes were received into state law because those matters are\n> under the jurisdiction of the states.\n\nStates (and also to some extent federal criminal statutes) received British common law definitions of various crimes and defenses, but not British penal statutes (which often didn't define those crimes in the late 18th century).\n\nThe statutory law of Britain did not apply as U.S. law at either the state or federal level upon the U.S. Declaration of Independence, except in isolated cases where a state, or the federal government expressly adopted it by reference in their own statute.\n\nThe existence of British law, both statutory and through case law, informs how the U.S. common law was understood (something that was predominantly a matter of state law) and how concept in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. federal statutes, and state constitutions and statutes were understood (especially when terms from British statutes are used in a similar matter in U.S. state and federal statutes and constitutions). But, British statutes did not have direct force and effect in the U.S. after independence.\n\nAs much as anything else, this simply reflect how the nature of statutes v. common law was understood in the late 18th and early 19th century. Nobody expected that British statutes would be directly applicable, so they weren't.\n\nThere may have been instances where common law rules actually had their roots in British statutes that were mostly forgotten in long layers of British common law case law, and many statutes expressly adopting British case law also expressly incorporate selected relevant British statutes of generally applicability. But, no British statutes were applicable \"automatically\" in the U.S.\n\n> For example, before Congress enacted the Naturalization Act of 1790,\n> would a person born outside the US to a US citizen father have been a\n> US citizen by dint of the US \"inheriting\" the British Nationality Act\n> 1772 mutatis mutandis?\n\nNo. Basic ways of thinking about what nationality or citizenship even was or meant would have been received, but not by receiving the British Nationality Act 1772 as U.S. law.\n\n> And before Congress enacted the Crimes Act of 1790, would an American\n> who levied war against the US, gave aid and comfort to its enemies, or\n> counterfeited US currency have been convicted and sentenced under the\n> Treason Act 1351?\n\nNot really.\n\nFrom the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 until the adoption of the Articles of Confederation on June 11, 1777, as a practical matter, the revolutionary forced had very little actual control of the courts in an enforceable way, there was an insurgency against the British underway, and it was an ad hoc effort from day to day and month to month that was muddled through without a formal structure or guidance at a colony by colony level, or even more granularly within a colony.\n\nIn the period from June 11, 1777 until the new U.S. Constitution was implemented in 1789\\-1790, under the [Articles of Confederation](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation), the situation was fluid and irregular. State governments made most statutory and common law, adopting their colonial era colonial statutes but not necessarily British statutes that their local legislature didn't adopt. Central government laws usually acted on the states, not directly on individuals, much like treaties today. There was little or no directly applicable central government legislation.\n\nMany topics, like citizenship, were simply ignored in this era. The U.S. Constitution adopted in 1789, and the initial acts of the First Congress to implement it, were a response to the realization that after the war and its immediate aftermath had settled down, that the newly formed country needed to regularize, institutionalize, and deal with a lot of governance issues and legal questions that nobody had had the time or resources or authority to deal with while a war had been going on.\n\nFor much of this time period the Revolutionary War was in progress and it wasn't always obvious who even controlled the courts or had practice authority to enforce court judgments. The [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) was not concluded until 1783\\.\n\nIt was an improvisation at first, and not necessarily a uniform one, since the Articles of Confederation conceived of the U.S. as many countries in an alliance with each other rather than an actual single nation that had to address legal issues uniformly.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the federal court system under the U.S. Constitution of 1789 that remains in force, the only institution of the central government was Congress and its committees, which functioned as a legislative body, a body selecting people with executive authority, and as a court of last resort from state court judgments. Everything was carried out at the state level except for courts\\-martial.\n\nStructurally, the Articles of Confederation were a fused system, akin to the U.K. Parliament which had its highest court of appeals and its prime ministership fused with the legislative authority of parliament, layered on top of 13 separate sovereign state governments.",

The paper\\-reporting option is via form [DS\\-64](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/212245.pdf), which asks, among other things, whether you filed a police report; so it might be good to do that first.

It may prompt the sister to return the documents without further escalation.\n3. The police report information is requested on both Form DS-64 (for reporting a stolen passport) and Form N-565 (for replacing a certificate of naturalization).\n4.

[Authority to 3 or more](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/1/title1sec71.html). Words in any statute, charter or ordinance giving authority to 3 or more persons authorize a majority to act when the statute, charter or ordinance does not otherwise specify. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a vacancy on an elected or appointed body does not in itself impair the authority of the remaining members to act unless a statute, charter or ordinance expressly prohibits the body from acting during the period of any vacancy and does not in itself affect the validity of any action no matter when taken.\n2. [Shall; must; may.](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/1/title1sec71.html) \"Shall\" and \"must\" are terms of equal weight that indicate a mandatory duty, action or requirement. \"May\" indicates authorization or permission to act. This subsection applies to laws enacted or language changed by amendment after December 1, 1989\\.\n\nThe following excerpts are but one example of a particular regulatory board (this case, professional land surveyors) that might be affected. \n\n3. Rules (Title 32, Ch. 141\\) The board may establish guidelines and rules...\n4. Duties and powers (Title 32, Ch. 141\\) The board shall administer and enforce this chapter\n5. Meetings; chair; quorum. (Title 32, Ch. 141\\) The board shall meet at least once a year to conduct its business and to elect a chair. Additional meetings must be held as necessary to conduct the business of the board and may be convened at the call of the chair or a majority of the board members. Four members of the board constitute a quorum.\n\nAnd finally, since it might be relevant, here is one general rule pertaining to all occupational boards...\n\n6. Quorum; chair (Title 10 \u00a78010\\) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a majority of the members serving on a board or commission under section 8001, subsection 38 constitutes a quorum. The board or commission shall elect its chair.\n\n---\n\nI want to know how a vacancy on this board might affect the actions the board can take. Suppose there are only 6 members appointed to the 7 member board for the course of 2 calendar years.\n\nLaw \\#1, which I cited above, almost seems to answer the question in favor of the undermanned boards. However, that law says specifically that where **authority** is given to a group, then the majority of that group is permitted to act. Law \\#1 does not say that where a **duty** is imposed upon a board, that the majority may assume that duty alone. And we see that there is definitely a distinction in law \\#2\\. Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nIf you're thinking is that we would be lead to an absurd conclusion in thinking the whole of the land surveyor's board would be required to also (as in law \\#4\\) \"administer and enforce\" and that the \"obvious\" purpose of law \\#1 was to avoid such a burden, I think it is certainly possible that the board could develop its own bylaws to handle voting procedures during absences. If the board, on day 1, voted to empower a smaller minority to handle certain business, that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation. No?\n\nIt is not so important to me that there **always** 100% of the time be a full board. The important thing to me is that these occupational boards are meant to be filled by a majority of professionals in the field, plus a couple of lay persons for balance. Guess which seats are empty most often? The lay persons. I understand you can't always get people to show up, but if the laws say the board is composed of lay persons too, they ought to show up at least once a year like the law says. That's my take, and I think it provides a little bit of legislative intent to back up that side of the argument.\n\nCase history on this sort of thing is scant, as far as I can see. Again, I reiterate the question...here in Maine, how do you think vacancies on a board impact board actions? And why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Point \\#1 put simply says that when a decision or action (mandatory or otherwise) is given to 3 or more people then the decision of the majority is binding. For 1 or 2 people the decision must be unanimous.\n\nA quorum is either a) what the boards rules say (point 5\\) or b) a majority of the board (point 6\\) whichever is lesser. For the board you detail (7 members 4 for a quorum) the answer is the same either way \\- 4 members at the meetings make a valid meeting.\n\nIf there are 4 or more members on the board, the board can function providing that 4 or more members attend each meeting. \n\n> Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nNo, there must be one meeting where a quorum is in attendance.\n\n> ... that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation. No?\n\nYes, providing that such delegation (in the form of a sub\\-committee) was a power that the board had.\n\n> ... but if the laws say the board is composed of lay persons too, they ought to show up at least once a year like the law says.\n\nNo, it doesn't. The criteria for *appointment* to the boards may specify a given number of professionals and lay\\-persons, however, once appointed they are *all* board members. There is no legal obligation on a board member to attend board meetings. Obviously, if they don't then they are not very effective board members and will probably not be reappointed but you can't force them to turn up.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by the TED talk [Copyrighting all the melodies to avoid accidental infringement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJtm0MoOgiU) and [its Lobsters thread](https://lobste.rs/s/w3i7is/every_melody_has_been_copyrighted_they_re). Basically, the story is that Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin put every melody on a hard drive, thus automatically copyrighting them, in order to defend the independent creation of small musicians. In the following thought experiment, I am going to take one step further and try to copyright all creative works created hereafter. I'm not sure of its practicality, but I assure you it would be fun.\n\nLet me first introduce the Infinity Hard Drive. It is simply a device that echoes back its input. For example, if you feed a document/painting/music into it, it would echo back the identical document/painting/music. Essentially, it is merely a repeater that is unable to store anything like a conventional one, but you will see why I call it a hard drive in a moment.\n\nSay Alice publishes her creative work, and I would like to sue her for violating my copyright. I have the evidence that if someone feeds Alice's work into the Infinity Hard Drive, it will return the identical work. In fact, you can find anything in the Infinity Hard Drive, as long as you know what you are looking for.\n\nYou might say \"Seriously? You are literally taking Alice's work to generate yours!\" But think about it: what would Alice do if Bob sues her for violating his copyright law? She would read Bob's work, and try to find the relevant drafts on her drawer that proves her work is original and independent. Relevance is the key here: if Alice has thousands of drafts at hand, it would make no sense to submit all of them to a court in response to a lawsuit concerning a specific work. Alice can read Bob's work to find her relevant work, so why can't the Infinity Hard Drive read someone's work to find my original work? I am arguing that conceptually, the process is more like using Alice's work to query my infinite collection of creative works to compute the location where my work resides, rather than generating one from scratch. Maybe Alice doesn't need to read Bob's whole work, but this is because her collection is finite. The Infinity Hard Drive is infinite in capacity, so naturally, it takes more information to find a specific work. In fact, Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin also need to take a melody to locate its counterpart in their hard drive, so if their approach works, so will mine.\n\nTo reiterate, the Infinity Hard Drive serves as a \"tangible medium of expression\" of my infinite collection of creative works. From my understanding, the internal mechanism of such a media does not matter. It can be a piece of paper, an SSD, or the Infinity Hard Drive which conceptually contains everything. What really matters is the outcome, that \"(works) can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\"\n\nJust to clarify, what I\u2019m trying to (automatically) copyright is not the Infinity Hard Drive itself, or the process of \"querying\" stuff in it, or the idea of making one. I am copyrighting the conceptual contents within. Just like you don't copyright the ink on a paper or electronic signals on a hard drive; you copyright the conceptual content born.\n\nI probably also need to prove that my work is \"the result of creative decisions of a human being\", but that is arguable. We know that [a randomly\\-generated book is not a violation of copyright](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1985/is-a-randomly-generated-book-a-violation-of-copyright). Also, how could J.K. Rowling prove her work is creative instead of the accurate deception of an alternative universe? Anyway, if the contents of the Infinity Hard Drive is not copyrightable, then nothing is, because it contains everything.\n\nFinally, how do I prove that Alice had access to my infinite collection of creative works prior to her creation? Well, you are reading this right now, and the Infinity Hard Drive is, in fact, ubiquitous, e.g. a mirror, or a computer that echoes back your keystrokes on the screen.\n\nNow, can I sue you for copyright infringement with the Infinity Hard Drive? To extend the scope of this question a little, can I also claim its ownership? originality? If the answers to the above questions are all \"No\", then can I defend myself from a copyright infringement lawsuit with the Infinity Hard Drive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright requires originality\n------------------------------\n\nYour infinity hard drive appears to be a machine designed to violate copyright by immediately copying anything presented to it.\n\nDamien Riehl and Noah Rubin were creating original melodies. These do not have copyright until they are fixed in a tangible medium. That's what the hard drive is for. This is insurance against *them* being sued if they release a song and someone claims it violates that person's copyright \\- they can produce in court the melody with a date stamp of 2015 (or whatever). GitHub or similar would be even better evidence.\n\nIn this context there is a specific allegation that melody X infringes copyright. Riehl \\& Rubin can then go to their records (including metadata) and say no, here is melody X version 1 through n and they all predate your release so we didn\u2019t violate your copyright.",

Copyright protection requires originality and human creativity. The Infinity Hard Drive, as described, doesn't involve any creative input or original expression by a human author. It's merely a theoretical device that echoes back whatever is input. This fundamental lack of human creativity and originality means its \"contents\" would not be eligible for copyright protection. \n\nOption A is relevant but not the core issue. B is partially true but misses the key point about creativity. D identifies a potential problem with the device, but isn't the main reason it couldn't be used as a copyright defense."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Smart phones come in two different kinds: locked, and unlocked. A locked phone has been modified from its original design, in its software, hardware, or firmware, to only accept cell service from a specific provider. The provider sells these phones at a discount to a consumer, because the provider believes that the provider will make up the difference in price later when the consumer is forced to use the provider's phone plan.\n\nOrdinarily, circumventing the technological restrictions which prevent the user from accessing cellular networks other than the provider's would violate the DMCA. However, the Obama administration signed a law in 2014, creating an exception within the DMCA that permits users to circumvent technological restrictions for the purpose of unlocking their phones. This is called the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act.\n\nBut, many companies still sell locked phones, and they are not keen on people unlocking them. They put notices on the packaging of locked phones, stating that by buying the product the consumer implicitly agrees to their terms of service. Their terms of service state that the user is not allowed to unlock the phone, and that the user agrees that this action would financially harm the company. This presumably means that the company can sue the user (or, perhaps, a tech repair shop that unlocks the phone for the user) for financial damages if the user unlocks the phone.\n\nMy question is: is this really legally enforceable? If the DMCA explicitly says that the DMCA cannot be used to prevent someone from unlocking a phone, can cell phone service providers get around this by placing a notice on the package that says the customer, through the act of purchase and through the use of the phone, is implicitly agreeing to terms of service that restrict and make the user liable for financial damages to the company if he unlocks the phone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The consumer has violated the DMCA and can be prosecuted under federal law.\n\nB) The company can successfully sue the consumer for breach of contract and recover financial damages.\n\nC) The consumer's action is protected under the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, regardless of the company's terms.\n\nD) The consumer must pay a fee to the company to legally unlock the phone.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act of 2014 created an exception within the DMCA that explicitly permits users to circumvent technological restrictions for the purpose of unlocking their phones. This federal law takes precedence over any company's terms of service or contractual agreements. While the company may attempt to discourage unlocking through its terms, these cannot override the legal right granted by the Act. Therefore, the consumer's action is protected, regardless of the company's stated terms or potential claims of financial harm."

It asks for a blanket consent to stuff that is buried in MailChimp's \u201cAnti\\-spam Policy \\& Terms of Use\u201d.\n\nBut according to the GDPR, what the data subject consent to can\u2019t be buried in the ToU \u2013 it must spelled out in clear, plain language.

Blanket consent, as used by MailChimp, is not allowed.\n\nThe other clear requirement from the GDPR is that *opt\\-in* is mandatory. Pre\\-ticked and opt\\-out buttons are explicitly banned: \u201cSilence, pre\\-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent\u201d (Recital 32\\). \u2018No\u2019 must become your data default, but if the user chooses to opt\\-in by clicking a button, this is valid consent. The MailChimp\\-button complies witrh this.\n\nThe GDPR also requires you to keep a records of the consents given (so make that part of the user profile), and to withdraw consent at any time \u2013 so you make make provisions for that as well in your implementation of consent.",

If the document has been altered it is up to the other side to say no that document has been altered since we produced it. \n\nSo lets say documents were formally produced to law firm A. If they have trouble loading and need me to load the documents into my application would they need to tell the court and the opposing council a third party had access to the data? How can I best manage the that?\n\nThese load files come can come in jacked up. Control characters that look like they were inserted intentionally. You may agree to certain delimiters and 1/2 through a file they will change. Or delimiters conveniently in a meta field.\n\n99% of the time I would not even need access to the actual document. I could just fix the load files with the meta data and have them load the actual documents. But sometimes you get jacked up file names and file paths. With the litigation support service firms I work with I have never had to access the actual document but I have a system guy I can tell here is what is wrong and here is what needs to be fixed. \n\nMost of these ligation support applications are Web (HTML) based so it is hard to have a stand alone version that could be loaded on a lap top and take into court. You cannot always count on Internet access in a court room. Mine is an EXE where I can easily include the server side with the client and run it on a lap top. \n\nProductions are almost never symmetric. If you are suing a pharmaceutical they may produce a million documents but as complainant you may only produce like 10\\. And the pharmaceutical will produced jacked up load files. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question doesn't make much sense (chain of custody generally relates to admissibility of evidence) \\- admissibility issue rest with ER's (ER: evidence rules found usually under \"general application rules\" \\-chain of custody is normally used in criminal cases for evidence to insure no alterations to the evidence etc. I don't understand how format of data ties to chain of custody. However, simply getting an affidavit (or declaration depending on applicable criteria; namely, in state versus out of state i.e. affidavit for out of state and declaration for in state as a rule of thumb) from the original sender that says, \"this is a true and correct copy of original...that was produced or obtained in the normal course of business or from my email ...\" or \"I verify this is what it is ...\" in order to turn the evidence into admissible evidence \\-",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the chain of custody and admissibility of this evidence?\n\nA) The chain of custody is broken, and the evidence becomes inadmissible in court.\n\nB) The law firm must obtain court permission before allowing the IT specialist to access the data.\n\nC) An affidavit from the original sender verifying the authenticity of the documents is sufficient to maintain admissibility.\n\nD) Chain of custody is not relevant for civil cases and only applies to criminal proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concept of chain of custody is less critical in civil cases compared to criminal cases. In this scenario, the documents have already been produced by the opposing party. To ensure admissibility, the law firm can obtain an affidavit or declaration from the original sender verifying that the documents are true and correct copies of the originals produced in the normal course of business. This approach addresses any concerns about the authenticity of the evidence, even if a third party (the IT specialist) assists with loading the data. Options A and B are incorrect as they overstate the implications of involving the IT specialist. Option D is incorrect because while chain of custody is more commonly associated with criminal cases, the concept can still be relevant in civil litigation, albeit with less stringent requirements."

Outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel; for example, if no\\-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.\n\nOn the flip\\-side, not traveling has its own dangers; for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.\n\nOf course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel; economic, cultural and personal \\- life is to be experienced after all.\n\nIf you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism; the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.\n\nEverything is allowed unless it is prohibited\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBy and large, this is the way that the law works. It's legal to do anything you like. Unless it isn't.\n\nIt isn't illegal to travel to, say, Finland. So you can.\n\nIf the government (of whichever country) decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to Finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. However, that is a political decision; not a legal one.\n\nAs for your drink\\-driving example, I am old enough to remember when it *wasn't* illegal to drive drunk, although I was too young to drive. Of course, if you are in Somalia or Kenya it's still legal. Also, what counts a *drunk* varies by [country](https://www.rupissed.com/blood_alcohol_limits.html) \\- you can have a couple in Finland but cross over into Russia and you are breaking the law. Why does Finland allow such recklessness? Because it's a political decision and politicians in Finland and Russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable.

They weigh the costs and benefits of allowing travel against the risks. The analogy with drunk driving laws demonstrates how different countries can have varying standards based on their political decisions about acceptable risk levels.

However, I know that the design is originally a creation of [Barbara Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kruger), not Supreme, so I wonder whether they are able to claim ownership over their brand logo or not.\n\nIn my search for an answer, I found a few articles regarding Supreme trademark problems, but I don't know how reliable they are and how does it affect my issue:\n\n* [Why Supreme Isn\u2019t Allowed To Trademark Its Iconic Box Logo](https://designtaxi.com/news/401415/Why-Supreme-Isn-t-Allowed-To-Trademark-Its-Iconic-Box-Logo/)\n* [From the Name to the Box Logo: The War Over Supreme](http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/from-the-name-to-the-box-logo-the-war-over-supreme)\n* [Totally Uncool Jokers: Barbara Kruger\u2019s Conceptual Comeback to Supreme Lawsuit](https://hyperallergic.com/70227/totally-uncool-jokers-barbara-krugers-conceptual-comeback-to-supreme-lawsuit/)\n\nI have even come across [an online shop](https://buildabogo.com/) selling exactly this kind of stuff and they just disallow the word \"Supreme\" in the box. Is that all it takes to make this kind of business legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From those articles, it seems that at least some versions of the \"Supreme\" Logo have been successfully registered. Therefore, any \"confusingly similar\" logo would be infringement, and could subject anyone using such logos in trade to an infringement suit. And it seems that the owners of the Supreme line are quite willing to sue.\n\nIt does not, therefore, follow that every possible logo consisting of a red box with white lettering in the Futura font would be an infringement. Similarity depends on the overall effect of a mark, and the main test is the likelihood of confusion or deception of reasonable customers or potential customers. If the text is, say, multiple words, none of which is the word \"supreme\" or any similar word, then it might arguably be not the Supreme logo, but a different logo that has some similar elements. (If you describe it as \"the Supreme logo but\" you make your opponent's case for them.) \n\nWhether a specific choice of words would be confusingly similar is more specific than this forum can get. You should consult a trademark lawyer for advice on that point. But if in doubt you might want to go with a greater difference. How about a blue box instead of a red one?",

The use of a different color creates a distinct visual impression, and the text \"Cool Stuff\" is not directly related to Supreme's branding.\n\nOption A, while not using the word \"Supreme,\" still closely mimics the original logo's color scheme and style, which could be considered \"confusingly similar.\"\n\nOption B directly references Supreme, which could be seen as an attempt to associate with or parody the brand, potentially leading to legal issues.\n\nOption D uses Supreme's name directly, which would almost certainly result in a trademark infringement claim.\n\nThe key factors in avoiding infringement are creating sufficient visual distinction and avoiding any direct or implied association with the Supreme brand."

In that early form, the King's Court exercised both judicial and legislative functions. In 1215, with the Magna Carta and the beginning of Parliaments, [the House of Lords assumed the judicial functions of the King's Court](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834884).\n\nPrior to 1876, it was possible for any member of the House of Lords to hear appeals. Eventually, however, the judicial function tended to be exercised by those appointed specifically to judicial office in the House of Lords, although this was not a formal restriction until 1876\\.\n\nSince 1876 and [until 2009](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/), the judicial function of the House of Lords was formally restricted to be exercised by the [Law Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary) (see s. 5 of the [*Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/39-40/59/enacted/data.pdf)). However, the outcome of the appeal was also still formally an action of the entire House of Lords, on the recommendation of the panel of Law Lords that heard the appeal (see Stanley Clark, [\"Gentlemen, Their Lordships\", p. 1443\\-44](https://books.google.ca/books?id=OBE7jTuhi74C&pg=PA1443&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). And custom was that only the Law Lords that heard the appeal would vote, with all other members of the House of Lords abstaining.1 Rather than lords via hereditary peerage, the Law Lords were Lords/Ladies holding special qualifications and having received specific appointment to be a \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.\" Among other qualifications, they would have already served in a high court or practised as a barrister for fifteen years.\n\nAs an example of the kind of background a person might have before appointment as a Law Lord, this is [Lord Denning's Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Denning,_Baron_Denning):\n\n> He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 and became a King's Counsel in 1938\\. Denning became a judge in 1944 when he was appointed to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and transferred to the King's Bench Division in 1945\\. He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1948 after less than five years in the High Court. He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1957 and after five years in the House of Lords returned to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls in 1962, a position he held for twenty years.\n\nIn 2009, the judicial function of the House of Lords [was transfered to the UK Supreme Court](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/). The Law Lords at the time became the first justices of the UK Supreme Court.\n\n---\n\n1\\. Citation practice is to indicate that a judgment is from the House of Lords by using parentheses after identifying the reporter. E.g.: \"*Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co.* (1880\\), 5 App. Cas. 25 (H.L.).\" Starting in 2001, [the House of Lords used vendor\\-neutral citations](https://www.iclr.co.uk/knowledge/case-law/neutral-citations/) managed by the [British and Irish Legal Information Institute](https://www.bailii.org/bailii/citation.html). The vendor\\-neutral citations for judgments from the House of Lords use \"UKHL\" as the abbreviation.

In New Jersey, while eviction proceedings are considered \"summary actions\" with limited scope, the primary issue is whether the tenant owes money to the landlord. If the tenant can demonstrate that previous overpayments equal or exceed the current amount due, this serves as a valid defense against eviction for non-payment. The tenant can present this evidence during the eviction hearing, potentially leading to a dismissal of the case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because in summary eviction actions, tenants typically cannot file counterclaims. Option B is unnecessary if the tenant can prove no money is owed due to previous overpayments. Option D is incorrect as tenants have the right to present defenses in eviction hearings.\n\nThis question tests understanding of tenant rights, the nature of summary eviction proceedings, and the importance of actual payment status in such cases."

There are provisions against starving an animal, and provisions allowing the authorities to intervene, so that an animal care or control agency can deem that the horse is not being fed properly. They can then remove the animal to feed it. There is also [a provision](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52.100) that\n\n> If any domestic animal is impounded or confined without necessary food\n> and water for more than thirty\\-six consecutive hours, any person may,\n> from time to time, as is necessary, enter into and open any pound or\n> place of confinement in which any domestic animal is confined, and\n> supply it with necessary food and water so long as it is confined.

Specifically, there is a provision stating that if a domestic animal is confined without necessary food and water for more than 36 consecutive hours, any person may legally enter the property to provide these necessities. This makes option C the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the property owner's physical limitations would likely be taken into account, and the horse's owners bear primary responsibility. Option B is false because the law allows for intervention by any person, not just state authorities. Option D is incorrect because providing some food does not absolve owners of responsibility if the animal is still undernourished and at risk of starvation."

However, the law considers certain types of software installations, including operating systems, to have implicit consent. Importantly, the law allows users to withdraw their consent once given. This is why Microsoft likely includes the option to disable updates for Canadian users, although this option is generally available to all users.

Rev. 251\\. The article uses the term \"sexting\" to mean the exchange of sexually explicit messages or images between individuals using electronic messaging. When images, this can constitute child pornography under federal law.\n\nAlso (from [cyberbullying.org](https://cyberbullying.org/the-status-of-sexting-laws-across-the-united-states)),\n\n> States that do not have a specific sexting law often rely on existing statutes when dealing with teen sexting. All states, for example, have child pornography or child exploitation laws that prohibit sending, receiving, or possessing images of a sexual nature of a minor.\n\nBayliss notes though that some *states* have adapted their child pornography laws to account for teen sexting:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ko5JD.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ko5JD.png)\n\nFor example, in Rhode Island, teens will not be charged under state criminal child pornography laws but may be \"tried\" in family court.

That dataset also provides links to state\\-specific sexting laws where they exist.\n\nNote that no state law can exempt teens from the application of federal child pornography and related laws.\n\nOf course, if the image does not even constitute pornography, then all of the above is irrelevant, but I understand you to be asking about the circumstance where the content is typically or historically criminalized.",

The information provided indicates that states have varying approaches to teen sexting laws. Some states, like Colorado and Rhode Island, have adapted their laws to treat teen sexting less severely than traditional child pornography. For instance, Colorado treats it as a civil infraction for teens of similar age exchanging images consensually, while Rhode Island may handle cases in family court rather than criminal court.\n\nOther states without specific sexting laws often rely on existing child pornography or exploitation statutes. The source mentions that all states have such laws prohibiting sending, receiving, or possessing sexual images of minors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all states have explicit laws against teen sexting, and those that do don't always treat it as equivalent to child pornography.\n\nOption B is false because some states do have specific laws addressing teen sexting, as evidenced by the examples given.\n\nOption D is incorrect because teen sexting is not completely legal in any state, even if it's consensual between minors.

From reading [this web page](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Time+is+of+the+Essence), I think they meant to say \"time **is** of the essence\". What I'm curious about is how enforceable this aspect of the contract is. As they provide no real explanation (such as what I found on the linked page), and they've left out a word, would this be considered as legally binding as if they had put the word in, as well as a full explanation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **A piece of paper with writing on it is NOT a contract!**\n\nA contract is the terms and conditions that the parties agree that they will be bound to. A written contract merely serves as evidence (really good evidence) of what those terms and conditions were.\n\nFor this to matter, it would have to be part of a dispute about the contract. If the parties looking at the term know and agree on what it means then that is what it means. If there is a dispute about this term then a 3rd party (e.g. judge, arbitrator) will look at the term and the context of the contract (both the written contract and the actions of the parties in giving effect to the contract) and decide what they think the parties meant.\n\nFor the example given, I don't think there is any room for dispute about what is meant and it would be disingenuous of either party to claim that there could be. \"Time is of the essence\" is a commonly used legal phrase with a well understood meaning \\- it explicitly makes time a condition of the contract; generally, time is a warranty. A condition is a term for which termination of the contract is a possible remedy; you cannot terminate for breach of a warranty. \"Time of the essence\" is either a typo or, if deliberate, is clearly trying to get across the same concept.\n\nTL;DR\n\n100% enforceable.",

The phrase \"Time of the essence\" is a well-understood legal concept, making time a condition of the contract. Even with the typographical error (missing \"is\"), the intent is clear and would be recognized by a court. The lack of additional explanation doesn't diminish its enforceability, as it's a common legal phrase with an established meaning. The documentation emphasizes that if the parties understand the term's meaning, that is what it means legally, regardless of minor errors in wording."

The reason for the limitation is that if your employer asks for money back, you obviously should be able to defend yourself, for example by proving that you never received that money. After five or six years it is assumed that you wouldn't be able to provide any such evidence, so nobody can ask for the money back anymore. \n\nThat's not specific to overpaid wages but quite general. \n\nIn addition there is the question whether the pilots should have known they were overpaid. For example, I'm quite happy with my salary, but if it was less, I would look for and find a different job that pays better. If the company claimed in five years time that I had been overpaid all the time, then I would say that if they had given me the \"correct\" lower payment, I would have found a better job elsewhere, so asking me to repay the money seems quite unfair. \n\n(Why do you need to defend yourself? Maybe your salary was \u00a33,000 per month. Someone in the right position records that they are paying you \u00a34,000 but puts \u00a33,000 into your account and \u00a31,000 into their own.

And that requires some serious genealogical research to establish.\n\nThe coroner has been happy for Y to sign a form releasing B's remains for cremation, and the funeral directors are perfectly happy (of course) for Y to pay for the funeral, without any guarantee that she will recover the costs from the estate.\n\nDoes Y (a) have any obligations in this situation, (b) have any rights, such as being allowed access to the property?\n\nAnd if she isn't allowed access to the property, who is, and on what basis? Whose job is it to empty the fridge, or to repair storm damage to the roof? Is the property insured?\n\n(Note: I understand that if B is found to be intestate, Y as a second cousin has no right to be granted administration or to benefit from the estate, which passes to the Crown unless first cousins can be found \\- which is not impossible.)\n\n*POSTSCRIPT: The police never released their key. But a neighbour had another key and allowed Y in. After a very extensive search (the place was a tip), a 30\\-year old will was found, in which Y was indeed named as executor.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does Y (a) have any obligations in this situation, (b) have any rights, such as being allowed access to the property?\n\n(a) No. Y has no obligations. Indeed even if Y were a much closer relation or had been named as executor she should only have the obligations she chooses to accept. A relative can always refuse to act as next\\-of\\-kin and a named executor can always refuse to accept the role. If she chooses to pay for the funeral, she becomes a creditor of the estate and can seek recompense from the executor/administrator/the public trustee at the appropriate time.\n\n(b) No. However, if Y were to approach the police and ask one of them to accompany her while she secured the property (emptied the fridge, switched off the utilities) and searched for a will they would probably accommodate her.",

You would have to see exactly what it says, especially if the other party has the option to not give you money. A contract might say \"A shall at his option give B $5,000 by date X; if A elects not to make payment, notice must be given 60 days before X\". Failing to give timely notice is thus breech of contract. However if the clause only says \"A shall at his option give B $5,000 by date X\", then there is no requirement for advance notice. And this assumes that there is a contract whereby both parties have some obligation to the other.\n\nA gift, on the other hand, carries no obligations on the giving party.

One organization, which has provided significant funding for the past decade, has not confirmed whether they will provide funding this year, despite ongoing communication for 11 months. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The organization is legally obligated to provide a timely response, regardless of the nature of the funding arrangement.\n\nB) If there's no formal contract, the organization has no legal obligation to provide advance notice of funding decisions.\n\nC) The business owner can take legal action against the organization for breach of social code.\n\nD) The organization is only required to give notice if they decide not to provide funding.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. If there's no formal contract between the business owner and the organization, the funding is essentially considered a gift. In such cases, the giving party (the organization) has no legal obligations to the recipient (the business owner). While it may be considered rude or unprofessional to delay communication about funding decisions, it is not legally actionable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because without a contract specifying timely response requirements, there's no legal obligation for prompt communication.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because social codes or expectations are not legally binding or enforceable.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because without a specific contract clause requiring notice for non-funding, the organization has no legal obligation to provide any notice, regardless of their decision.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the difference between contractual obligations and informal funding arrangements, as well as the legal implications of each."

Did they? Or is there some other rationale for \"only\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The right belongs to the federal government because the Constitution says it does, in Article 1 (section 8, clause 3\\).\n\nThis, and the other rights listed in that section, are known as *enumerated rights* \\- that is, somebody has explicitly listed them out.

The Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, the exclusivity of this power is not explicitly stated in the Constitution. Rather, it has been established through judicial interpretation, as exemplified by cases like Sporhase v.

The Commerce Clause has been interpreted to give Congress exclusive authority.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Constitution does not explicitly prohibit states from regulating interstate commerce. The prohibition is a result of judicial interpretation of the Commerce Clause.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the nature of congressional authority.

If applicable, is there a Massachusetts\\-specific provision on this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While it seems like a simple question, the answer is somewhat complicated. As is frequently the case for \"white collar\" misconduct, There are several civil and criminal legal theories that could be applied, depending upon the nature of the offense, at both the federal and state levels (e.g. how was it done and what is the relationship of the offender to the victim).\n\nThe penalty will generally be specific to the legal theory under which punishment or compensation is sought.\n\nOne of the more obvious ones (if the stolen files are legitimately classified as trade secrets) is violation of the state's trade secret law:\n\n> If a court finds that a defendant has unlawfully taken a plaintiff's\n> trade secret(s), it may impose the following penalties and remedies:\n> \n> \n> Criminal Penalties: Unlawfully taking a trade secret (defined above)\n> constitutes the crime of larceny in Massachusetts and is punishable by\n> up to five years imprisonment, or by a fine of up to $25,000 and up to\n> two years imprisonment. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, \u00a7 30\\.\n> \n> \n> Damages: A court can make a defendant pay money damages to the\n> plaintiff in an amount up to twice its actual damages. See Mass.

Gen. Laws\n> ch. 93, \u00a7 42A. It appears that a court could order you not to publish\n> a trade secret if it found that you had unlawfully taken it from the\n> plaintiff. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution may limit the\n> court's authority to do so, however.\n\nAnother would be a civil action for conversion of intellectual or intangible property, or a criminal action for theft or sale of stolen goods.\n\nDepending upon the means by which the files were obtained, it might implicate common law fraud and criminal fraud offenses (including wire and mail fraud), and state and federal laws involving computer crimes. Another legal theory could be tortious interference with contract or tortious interference with business prospects.\n\nLess aggressively a common law constructive trust could probably be imposed on the digital files and the proceeds from them, and the person receiving the proceeds of the stolen files could be sued for unjust enrichments/restitution.\n\nIn many cases, it would be a civil and criminal federal copyright law violation (if the victim owns the copyright and the files are copyrightable material).\n\nThe proper offenses and hence the available remedies, would depend to a significant extent both legally and from a practical and litigation tactics perspective, on the means by which the digital files were obtained.",

According to the Massachusetts trade secret law cited in the documentation, unlawfully taking a trade secret constitutes larceny and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, or by a fine of up to $25,000 and up to two years imprisonment (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, \u00a7 30). Additionally, John may face civil penalties, including damages up to twice the actual damages incurred by TechCorp.\n\nOption A is incorrect because digital theft can indeed be a criminal offense in Massachusetts. Option C is wrong because Massachusetts does have provisions for such theft, particularly under trade secret law. Option D is incorrect as it understates the potential penalties; the law allows for up to 5 years imprisonment or a combination of fines and imprisonment."

The contractor is believed to be under 18 years old, and there was no written contract. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The homeowner cannot sue the contractor at all because they are a minor.\nB) The homeowner can easily sue and collect damages from the contractor's parents.\nC) The homeowner can sue, but must disclose the contractor's minor status and wait for a guardian ad litem to be appointed.\nD) The lack of a written contract makes it impossible for the homeowner to pursue any legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because the documentation states that it is possible to sue a minor contractor, but the plaintiff must disclose the defendant's minor status in the complaint. The court must then appoint a guardian ad litem before the case can proceed. This makes the process more challenging, but not impossible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that it is possible to sue an underage contractor, although it is more complicated.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that a minor's legal guardians or parents would not be responsible for a judgment entered against the minor in these circumstances.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the lack of a written contract is not a serious problem for a short job that was performed by both sides, according to the documentation.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of the complexities involved in legal action against minors, the importance of proper disclosure in legal proceedings, and the misconceptions about parental liability and contract requirements in such cases."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to understand how do legal systems handle situation where there is no clear causal responsibility of a person, but a well established stochastic relation. I am aware of the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard in some legal systems but I'd welcome any more information of text to continue research. For an example, let us assume that it's proven that certain chemical compound can induce a specific disease \\- some type of cancer, for an example. It is also well established that exposure to that chemical is not sole cause of this type of cancer, so there is incidence in a healthy population. So, let say that incidence doubles and it is found that a factory upstream of affected population has been dumping this chemical into water source. Person that has this disease sues the factory. There is no scientific way to prove that the person wouldn't get it without exposure, but it can be proven that this is probable (50%) and that the person was exposed. How would such situation be viewed in continental or common law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As an academic matter, the US system has struggled with this, and law professors spend their lives debating it.\n\nAs a realistic matter, I'd bet that company in your example gets nailed.\n\nOn the theory, the issue here is but\\-for cause. Civil liability requires that the jury find it more likely than not, or over 50% likely, that but\\-for D's actions, P's injuries would *not* have occurred. Your hypo puts it at exactly 50, and tie goes to the defendant, so in this case even the theory is clear. But, say you change it a little bit to make it more like 65 or 70%. Now, you're getting into the territory of the classic blue bus case. A man is hit by a blue bus. Two companies in town own blue busses, and one company owns 90% of them. Can he recover against that company with no other evidence? The black letter answer is no, that naked statistical evidence doesn't cut it. The rationale is that if it were the other way, anytime someone got hit by a blue bus, that company would automatically have to pay out unless they had some evidence to disprove their liability. The burden of proof has been shifted, violating a fundamental tenet of our legal system.\n\nBut, this doctrine obviously poses an issue for plaintiffs like yours. It's one thing to say that someone hit by a bus needs to have more evidence. Theoretically, they could go out and get it: they could find the bus routes and schedules, examine where they were, and show that X company had a bus going by there at that time. They can also canvas for witnesses. It's much harder when, as your excellent hypo touches on, the science is so complicated. One controversial solution that has been debated a lot recently is market\\-share liability, but that doesn't seem pertinent here because you have mentioned another company.\n\nOn the legal realist side. As far as I can tell the system usually finds a way to hold the company responsible. One example is the tobacco litigation. My understanding is the science couldn't definitively *prove* that smoking caused cancer, but it could prove that it raised the risk significantly. Here's some information on that [https://www.tortmuseum.org/the\\-tobacco\\-cases/](https://www.tortmuseum.org/the-tobacco-cases/) from the American Museum of Tort Law, which, yes, is a real thing.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit against a chemical company, scientific evidence shows that exposure to the company's chemical doubles the risk of a specific type of cancer. The plaintiff, who has developed this cancer, sues the company. Given the information provided about causation and liability in the US legal system, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The plaintiff will automatically win the case because the chemical doubled the risk of cancer.\n\nB) The case will likely be dismissed due to lack of definitive proof that the chemical caused this specific plaintiff's cancer.\n\nC) The court will likely apply market-share liability to determine the company's responsibility.\n\nD) Despite challenges in proving definitive causation, the company may still be held liable based on the significant increase in risk and other factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate based on the information provided. While there are theoretical challenges in proving definitive causation in such cases, especially with the \"but-for\" standard, the answer suggests that in practice, courts often find ways to hold companies responsible in situations with significant risk increase. This is exemplified by the tobacco litigation cases, where definitive proof of causation for individual cases was difficult, but companies were still held liable based on the significant increase in risk. The answer states, \"As far as I can tell the system usually finds a way to hold the company responsible.\" Options A and B are too extreme, representing oversimplifications of the complex legal considerations involved. Option C is incorrect because market-share liability is mentioned as not being pertinent to this specific scenario."

I decided to discontinue one of the platforms. The company that sells the hardware for that platform approached me about purchasing the software source code from me so they can continue to sell the software to their customers.\n\nSo, I would rework the UI and rebrand it so it doesn't look exactly like the other versions of the software, and they could claim it as their own. My question is, is there a way for me to sell and give them the source, without putting myself in legal danger since 50% of the source code is still in use with the other versions of the program I will continue selling?\n\nThe client is fully aware of the situation, and is not interested in exclusive rights to the code.

If you did that, you would put yourself in legal danger because they now own the copyright to code that you use in other products, and can sue you for copyright infringement.\n\nHowever, you selling a copy of source code does *not* imply transfer of copyright in any shape of form. When you buy a copy of a book in a book store, the author's copyright is not transferred to you. Accepting this deal would put the *other party* in legal danger. Even if they have bought the source code, they still don't have a license to make further copies of it and sell those.\n\nThis is why you need to *license* the software to them.\n\nIn brief: Copyright grants the copyright owner a lot of rights. These rights are always *licensed*, not sold. The right that is relevant here is the right to create derivative works.\n\nA *license* is simply a contract between the two parties, describing a particular business arrangement in legally binding terms.\n\nIf I were in your position, I would hire an IP lawyer to help drafting the license. But, basically, the license should say that you, as owner of the copyright to ABC software, grants XYZ company access to its source in its present form, and also grants XYZ company the right to create derivative works, but *only* for hardware platform DEF, and to create and distribute copies of their derivative work.",

It is my understanding that NC only applies to the digital copy, not the work itself.\n\nYour understanding is correct. An ancient text, or one long out of copyright, does not get new protection by creating an image of the text. At most the image itself is protected, not the underlying text. In the US, and other jurisdictiosn that follow the rule of the 1999 [*Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp* case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.) there is no copyright protection on the image because it has no original content. Some EU courts have indicated that they will be following the logic of bridgeman. To the best of my knowledge no EU decision grants copyright protection to an otherwise out\\-of\\-copyright work because of its presence in a digital library or collection.\n\nHowever, if a person gained access to a digital library or collection subject to a TOS agreement which includes \"no commercial use\" terms and then published a text from it commercially, that person might be subject to a breech of contract or similar suit by the library.

Before I consult an attorney and CPA I want to do some of my own informal digging/quasi\\-due diligence which is the motivation for this question.\n\nThe microbrewery would produce and sell its own beer and food. It would also possibly distribute the produced beer to other restaurants and beverage centers within the area (all within NY state).\n\nTo my knowledge, the main authoritative bodies that would have licensing and governing/auditing control over such a business are:\n\n* [New York State Liquor Authority](https://sla.ny.gov/) \\-\\-\\> at the state level; and\n* [Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)](https://www.ttb.gov/) \\-\\-\\> at the federal level\n\nTo anyone's knowledge, are there *any* other authorities (state or federal) that would have regulatory control, *other* than tax authorities (IRS and NYS DTF), over how that business produced and sold/distributed beer and produced/sold food?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're forgetting city and county health codes, business permits, zoning regulations, fire and occupation regulations, business and property insurance, labor laws, etc. These can differ between the city and the county, and depending on if you own or lease the building.\n\nBest thing to do is start with your city/county business permit office; they can provide information. Call the fire department and ask. Ask the county health department.\n\nFind out if a business incubator exists in your city/county and ask them: [https://esd.ny.gov/certified\\-business\\-incubator](https://esd.ny.gov/certified-business-incubator)",

Which of the following combinations of regulatory bodies and considerations is MOST comprehensive for this business venture?\n\nA) New York State Liquor Authority, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), IRS, and NYS Department of Taxation and Finance\n\nB) New York State Liquor Authority, TTB, city/county health codes, business permits, and zoning regulations\n\nC) New York State Liquor Authority, TTB, city/county health codes, business permits, zoning regulations, fire and occupation regulations, business and property insurance, and labor laws\n\nD) New York State Liquor Authority, TTB, city/county health codes, and a business incubator consultation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options include some relevant authorities, option C is the most comprehensive. It covers the state and federal alcohol regulatory bodies (NY State Liquor Authority and TTB), as well as crucial local considerations such as health codes, business permits, zoning regulations, fire and occupancy regulations, insurance requirements, and labor laws. This combination addresses the broadest range of regulatory and operational aspects the brewery owner would need to consider. Option A focuses mainly on alcohol and tax authorities, missing local regulations. Option B includes some local considerations but omits important factors like fire regulations and insurance. Option D, while mentioning a useful resource (business incubator), doesn't include the full spectrum of regulatory bodies and considerations necessary for the venture."

Which of the following statements is true regarding their obligations under the GPL?\n\nA) They must make their entire commercial project open source under GPL 3.0\nB) They can modify the plugin and keep the changes proprietary as long as they pay a licensing fee\nC) They must release any modifications made to the plugin under GPL 3.0, but can keep other parts of their project proprietary\nD) They can use the plugin commercially without any restrictions or obligations\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the GPL does not necessarily extend to the entire project, only to the parts directly derived from or linked to the GPL-licensed code.\nB is incorrect because the GPL does not allow keeping modifications proprietary, and there's no provision for a licensing fee to circumvent this.\nC is correct because the GPL requires that any modifications to the plugin itself must be released under the same license, but does not necessarily extend to the entire project.\nD is incorrect because while commercial use is allowed, there are still obligations under the GPL, such as providing source code for modifications.\n\nThe key point is that the GPL allows commercial use, but requires that modifications to the GPL-licensed code be released under the same license. The extent to which this applies to the rest of the project depends on how the GPL-licensed code is integrated, which often requires legal advice to determine."

The information provided indicates that fixed-term employment contracts are a relatively new area of law in the USA, outside of senior executive agreements. The enforceability and interpretation of these contracts are not clear-cut, and there may be variations depending on factors such as the specific terms of the contract, the jurisdiction, and whether the employer or employee is seeking to enforce the agreement. This lack of clarity and consistency in legal precedents makes option C the most accurate representation of the current legal landscape for fixed-term employment contracts in the USA.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest a level of clarity and consistency in regulations and precedents that does not exist according to the given information. Option D is too restrictive, as while fixed-term contracts may be more common for senior executives, the information does not state that they are only enforceable for this group."

I write a that book (let's call it thunderbolt) and I copyright it. I now officially own the copyright and intellectual property for my work, no?\n\nNow I open up my own company which will be creating content based on my thunderbolt intellectual property. But I do not transfer the IP to my company, instead I license my IP to my company for each and every project individually. So let's say I license the rights to thunderbolt the movie and thunderbolt the game to my company.\nThe licenses only allows my company to create one specific thing based on my IP, and can only do so for a limited time (like 4 years) and without the possibility of an update or expansion (in case of a the game).\n\nNow another company wants to buy my own company. If I agree to the sale, the new company will ONLY own the licenses that I gave to my company, and NOT my IP correct?\n\nOr another scenario: my company is going bankrupt and because of that all the assets (including the licenses) have to be liquidated. Does this, in any way, affect the IP that I personally hold? Can I be forced to cede the rights to my intellectual property?\n\nThis question is relevant because in the gaming industry it happens very often that some people make a really good game, then they fail for awhile and go bankrupt, and then suddenly another company with no regards to quality gets their hands on that intellectual property and starts ruining it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there any way one can have their own intellectual property licensed to their own company, such that the person owns that IP and not the company?\n\nYes. This is quite common. \n\nThe ideal asset protection strategy is to have one company that deals with customers, one that deals with suppliers, one that employs and one that owns property (including intellectual property). Local tax law may make it better for some assets (such as real property) to be held personally.\n\nObviously this imposes additional overhead which may not be warranted for small businesses and such ... pessimistic shall we say, arrangements are not acceptable in public companies.\n\n> If I agree to the sale, the new company will ONLY own the licenses that I gave to my company, and NOT my IP correct?\n\nThe issue is not if *you* agree to the sale, it\u2019s if *they* will agree. If you can get a buyer, expect to receive *much* less if you are not actually selling the thing that makes your business a business. Effectively your are renting the IP and you don\u2019t get as much for renting out your house as you do for selling it.\n\nLicensing models do work: for example, McDonalds (everywhere but the US) has a licensing agreement with McDonalds (USA) for the IP but that agreement is geographically exclusive, long\\- term (decades at least) and very secure.\n\n> Does this, in any way, affect the IP that I personally hold?\n\nNo\n\n> Can I be forced to cede the rights to my intellectual property?\n\nProviding every transaction was arms length and at market rates and above board: no.",

Under federal law in the United States, gender-based discrimination in public accommodations (such as nightclubs) is not prohibited, making \"ladies' night\" promotions generally legal. However, some states or cities have enacted their own laws or ordinances that extend anti-discrimination protections to include gender in public accommodations. For example, the question mentions that in Seattle, sex discrimination in public accommodations is illegal. Therefore, while these promotions are legal under federal law and in most jurisdictions, they could be challenged and found illegal in specific locations with broader anti-discrimination laws. This nuanced situation makes C the most accurate statement among the options provided."
