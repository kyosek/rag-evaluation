Does anything similar exist for trespass to person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are looking for the [*Judicial College Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/guidelines-for-the-assessment-of-general-damages-in-personal-injury-cases-9780192867629?lang=en), which had its sixteenth edition published in April 2022\\. This book sets out the range of compensation based on the type of injury suffered. The scale is very detailed. For example, we can find in Chapter 7,\n\n> **(G) Injuries to the elbow**\n>   \n> (a) A severely disabling injury \\- **\u00a339170 to \u00a354830**\n>   \n> (b) Less severe injuries causing impairment of function but not involving major surgery or significant disability \\- **\u00a315650 to \u00a332010**\n>   \n> (c) Moderate or minor injury\n>   \n>  (i) Injuries fully resolving after about one year \\- **In the region of \u00a33530**\n>   \n> (ii) Injuries with the majority of symptoms resolving within 18 to 24 months but with nuisance level symptoms persisting after that \\- **In the region of \u00a36500**\n>   \n> (iii) Injuries recovering after three years with nuisance symptoms thereafter and/or requiring surgery \\- **Up to \u00a312590**\n\nThere are lots of other rules about the calculations, which are beyond what can be summarised in a text box. In the case of assault, one might find reference to Chapter 4, which is on psychiatric effects including PTSD, as well as to the physical injuries. Probably the most important note is that they are *Guidelines*, not *Rules*, and so the court can deviate from them at its pleasure. But this is what the judge will have at their fingertips during the proceedings.\n\nBecause these concern damages, receipt of an award will depend on whether the respondent actually has the money. For that reason, there is a statutory scheme, the [*Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme*](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/criminal-injuries-compensation-a-guide), which can make additional payments to victims of violent crime. CICS awards are reduced based on civil damages already paid, because you can't be compensated twice for the same injury. They are also calculated after any insurance payout, so it's in the nature of a final resort.\n\nThe CICS tariffs are not the same as the JCG ones. Taking the elbow example, CICS 2012 rates damage to one elbow with substantial recovery at **\u00a31500** (level A2\\), and with continuing significant disability at **\u00a36200** (level A7\\). Other eligibility rules and procedures are different as well. In practice, the majority of CICS awards are for between \u00a31000 and \u00a32400 (bands A1 to A4\\); there is a proposed simplification of the bands into fewer levels, but this has not yet been implemented.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A victim of assault suffered a moderate elbow injury that resolved within 18 months but left lingering minor symptoms. They are seeking compensation through both civil litigation and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS). Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential compensation?\n\nA) The victim can expect to receive around \u00a36500 from civil litigation and an additional \u00a36200 from CICS, totaling approximately \u00a312,700 in compensation.\n\nB) The Judicial College Guidelines suggest compensation of around \u00a36500, while CICS would likely award \u00a31500, but the victim can only receive the higher of these two amounts.\n\nC) The court is bound by the Judicial College Guidelines and must award exactly \u00a36500, while CICS will automatically match this amount.\n\nD) The victim may receive around \u00a36500 through civil litigation based on the Judicial College Guidelines, but any CICS award would be reduced by the amount of civil damages already received.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. The Judicial College Guidelines suggest compensation \"in the region of \u00a36500\" for elbow injuries with symptoms mostly resolving within 18-24 months but with persisting nuisance level symptoms. However, these are guidelines, not strict rules, so the court has some discretion.\n\nRegarding CICS, the information states that \"CICS awards are reduced based on civil damages already paid, because you can't be compensated twice for the same injury.\" This means that if the victim receives compensation through civil litigation, any CICS award would be reduced by that amount.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests the victim would receive full compensation from both sources, which contradicts the information about CICS awards being reduced by civil damages.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it misinterprets the relationship between civil litigation and CICS awards. The victim isn't limited to only the higher amount; rather, the CICS award would be reduced by any civil damages received.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it states the court is bound by the guidelines, when in fact they are just guidelines and the court has discretion. It also incorrectly suggests that CICS would automatically match the civil award."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51681/can-i-leave-my-friend-my-body-if-i-die", "docs_id": 51681, "title": "Can I leave my friend my body if I die", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So when I die I want my friend to keep my body parts in a jars and maybe make a mask out of my face or some thing like that.

In Washington, [RCW 68\\.50\\.110](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=68.50.110) requires that\n\n> Except in cases of dissection provided for in RCW 68\\.50\\.100, and where\n>  human remains are rightfully carried through or removed from the state\n>  for the purpose of burial elsewhere, human remains lying within this\n>  state, and the remains of any dissected body, after dissection, must\n>  be decently buried, undergo cremation, alkaline hydrolysis, or natural\n>  organic reduction within a reasonable time after death.\n\nPer [RCW 68\\.50\\.130](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=68.50.130),\n\n> Every person who performs a disposition of any human remains, except\n>  as otherwise provided by law, in any place, except in a cemetery or a\n>  building dedicated exclusively for religious purposes, is guilty of a\n>  misdemeanor.

However, the law does allow for cremation, alkaline hydrolysis, or natural organic reduction of remains, and the resulting remains can be kept in jars. RCW 68.50.160 states that a person has the right to control the disposition of their remains with a valid written document, and does not specify an age requirement. Therefore, the 17-year-old could legally request cremation or alkaline hydrolysis and have the processed remains kept in jars, without needing parental consent, as long as they have a properly witnessed written document expressing their wishes."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17852/good-samaritan-law", "docs_id": 17852, "title": "Good Samaritan law", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What exactly is the Good Samaritan law?

As long as the bystander didn't cause the initial harm and tried to help to the best of their ability, they would be protected from liability even if the person didn't survive.

The injury has to flow from the assault but not necessarily from the assaulter.

According to the documentation, in cases of assault (which includes attempted assault), the victim can claim damages for injuries that \"flow from the assault but not necessarily from the assaulter.\" In this case, John's injury occurred as a direct result of defending himself from the mugger's assault, even though he technically caused the injury himself. The law recognizes that such injuries are a consequence of the initial assault. Furthermore, as assault is an intentional tort, John does not need to prove actual financial loss to claim damages.

According to the information provided, Charlton likely engaged in plea bargaining with the prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to five charges, while 17 other charges, including the one for overstaying, were taken into consideration but not pursued. This practice, common in Singapore's legal system, allows prosecutors to drop certain charges in exchange for guilty pleas on others. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there's no indication of diplomatic pressure affecting the enforcement of Singapore's laws.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the law regarding caning for visa overstayers was still in effect, as evidenced by its application to other cases mentioned.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the provided examples show enforcement against individuals from Asian countries, there's no explicit policy of exempting Western nationals from this punishment.

This meeting and resolution should be recorded in the corporate minutes. When the corporation representative goes to open the account, the bank will likely ask for confirmation that this resolution was passed. After the account is opened and the bank provides its own resolution document, this document is not a new resolution, but rather a confirmation of the resolution that was already passed. The corporation can then fill out this document with the date of the original board meeting where the resolution was passed.

For a successful lawsuit, there would need to be additional facts establishing that Dr. Smith had assumed a specific duty to be available at that particular time. Moreover, Mrs. Johnson would need to prove that Dr. Smith's failure to answer directly caused harm, which might be difficult given that the appropriate advice in an emergency would typically be to call emergency services.

The term \"constitutional carry\" is not a legal term but, rather, a catchphrase used to describe states that have adopted, either by statute or state constitution, that no permit is required to carry a gun either openly displayed or concealed. The phrase comes from a belief among many that the constitution is a permit to carry. [New Hampshire passed its constitutional carry statute in 2017](https://www.concordmonitor.com/sununu-signs-conceal-carry-bill-8252381). Prior to this date it was permitted to carry a gun openly (not concealed) without a permit and had been legal to do so since the founding of the state.\n\nThe Federal government originally passed The Gun\\-Free School Zones Act of 1990 which prohibited the carrying of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. This act was found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1995 ([United States v. Lopez](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1260.ZO.html)).\n\nSubsequently, the Federal government amended the law by adding the language, \"[...a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce...](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922#q)\" This law has not been overturned and is still active.\n\nHere are two of the several exceptions to the Federal restriction:\n\n1. The individual is licensed to carry a firearm by the State in which the school zone is located\n2. The gun is unloaded and locked in a container\n\nThere are other exceptions related to law enforcement officers, permission of the school, etc. These exceptions are independent; if one is licensed there is no need to unload the firearm and lock it in a container.\n\nThe first exception listed, an individual licensed to carry a firearm by the State, generates a fair amount of controversy. Many states license individuals to carry concealed firearms within their borders by recognizing, or granting reciprocity, to the licensee's home state's firearms license. Many people believe this is a grant of a license by the State to the individual to carry a firearm. The ATF disagrees with this position and has taken a position that only licenses issued by the State in which the school is located are valid as it relates to the Federal school gun safety act. Further reading on this particular issue can be found in the paper, \"[Federalism Implications of Non\\-Recognition of Licensure Reciprocity Under the Gun\\-Free School Zones Act](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2925240).\"\n\nThe [New Hampshire legislature has been working on a bill](https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB564/2019) (as of June, 2019\\) prohibiting the carrying of firearms on school property. Governor Chris Sununu has previously indicated he would veto a series of gun\\-control bills headed to his desk via a spokesperson's statment, \"[the governor is not looking to make any changes to existing gun laws.](https://www.nhpr.org/post/sununu-likely-veto-2-gun-control-bills-headed-his-desk#stream/0)\" The bill as written, prohibits the possession of firearms on school property, it does not prohibit firearm possession near school property. (The bill does appear to allow a firearm in an automobile being used to pick up or drop off a student at school.)\n\nThe bottom\\-line for firearms around schools in New Hampshire:\n\n1. There is no state requirement to be licensed to carry a firearm openly or concealed\n2. There is no state prohibition from carrying firearms near a school\n3. There is a Federal prohibition from carrying a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school without a license\n4. There is no Federal requirement that a firearm carried near a school be concealed\n\nYou can expect to be interviewed by law enforcement if you are openly\\-carrying firearms near a school. It is perfectly legal for law enforcement to approach you and engage in a voluntary interview. You can expect many such engagements if you make it a practice to openly carry firearms near a school. You can make people nervous if you are openly\\-carrying firearms generally, and you will absolutely make people nervous if you openly\\-carry firearms near a school.\\*\n\nNew Hampshire still issues Pistol and Revolver licenses and one should have such a license if carrying a firearm within a school zone.\n\nAs it relates to knives, New Hampshire is very liberal as its laws apply to knives. There are few, if any, restrictions on knives. In 2010, [New Hampshire passed a law](https://www.akti.org/state-knife-laws/new-hampshire/) removing some of the restrictions on the types of knives that could be carried.\n\n\\*I do not have a specific citation to provide regarding the expectations of a law\\-enforcement interview when openly\\-carrying a firearm near a school.

What's a VPN provider? If you have one, all your internet traffic goes through it.\n\nOne of the largest claims PIA makes is that it doesn't keep any logs so that theoretically even if a government issues a warrant they would be unable to disclose any information on the activities of its users.\n\nAccording to [this article](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition/) PIA claims \"We absolutely do not maintain any VPN logs of any kind.\" Is it legal not to keep any logs? Did they just \"pull a legal fast one\" by saying **VPN** logs so if they were to hand over information about a user they would just say it was from a non\\-VPN log?\n\nFrom the first linked page:\n\n> Failure to comply with the present Terms of Service constitutes a\n>  material breach of the Agreement, and may result in one or more of\n>  these following actions:\n> \n> \n> * Issuance of a warning;\n> * Immediate, temporary, or permanent revocation of access to Privateinternetaccess.com with no refund;\n> * Legal actions against you for reimbursement of any costs incurred via indemnity resulting from a breach;\n> * Independent legal action by Privateinternetaccess.com as a result of a breach; or\n> * **Disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities** as deemed reasonably necessary.\n\nWhen they say \"Disclosure of such information,\" to what information could they refer?

Information that they may keep may be:\n\n* Account information\n* Subscriber information\n* Information on breaches of the Terms of Service or Agreement\n\nSo yes, they might certainly not keep any logs \u2013 although that claim is doubtful, since they almost certainly keep at least error\\-level logs of their services \u2013 but that doesn't mean that they have no information to disclose to law enforcement.\n\nIt's also questionable what \"logs\" refers to \u2013 would aggregate statistics be considered a log, by law?

The VPN provider may not keep detailed logs of user internet activity, but still maintain other types of information such as account details, payment information, or records of terms of service violations. This non-log data could be disclosed to law enforcement if required, while still allowing the provider to claim they don't keep VPN usage logs. Additionally, the definition of \"logs\" may be narrowly interpreted, potentially excluding things like aggregate statistics or a user's last known IP address. This nuanced interpretation allows the provider to maintain their claim of not keeping logs while still having some information that could potentially be disclosed."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49453/can-us-drone-strike-pilots-be-charged-with-murder", "docs_id": 49453, "title": "Can US drone strike pilots be charged with murder?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can a case against a US serviceman be brought before the Federal government against those responsible for killings in war zones, like drone operators?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Killing people is not illegal\n-----------------------------\n\nKilling people in certain circumstances (e.g. murder, manslaughter, negligent driving occasioning death) is illegal but killing people when you have a lawful reason to do so isn't.

I rely on it, and have done so for over 15 years now. Losing access to it would be a serious blow to my business, hence I like to avoid losing the license, of course.\n\nMore than once in the past it has happened that I run into programming errors of said product, hindering me to use it as intended. And while the software lives up to its expectations in general (i.e. I cannot claim that it's useless to me), **certain bugs limit its provided and documented functionality**.\n\nNow, being an experienced developer, I am usually able to figure out the cause of the error by just observing how it behaves. And while I am often able to \"work around\" the bugs, **sometimes the only way to solve the issue is to modify the product's code or interfere with it in some way that requires me to look at the code, i.e. reverse engineer parts of it**. (Note: The code in question is not encrypted nor protected in some other way.)\n\n**By doing that, the company claims I am in clear violation of their EULA.**\n\nI initially argued that the *purpose* of their \"no reverse engineering\" rule is to prevent harmful hacks, such as trying to disable their product registration and copy protection, and the company agrees with that. However, they argue they cannot make exceptions to their rule at all (which I believe they confuse with enforcing trade mark violations, where too much leniency could make them lose the rights to their claims).\n\nWhich leaves me almost no options:\n\n* **I am not allowed to fix their bugs myself**, even if only for my own use of the software.\n* **Neither are they willing (or able) to fix them**.\n* Which leaves me to to simply not use parts of their product due to the bugs in them, even though these buggy functions are provided for my use.

Does that make a difference, i.e. are their laws in Europe that help me with arguing for my case? (Let's ignore the often\\-heard argument that shrink\\-wrapped licenses are not enforcable \\- instead I like to focus solely on the issue of defects in a product.)\n\nSure, even if the company is in the wrong, they could still then disable my license, but I'd like to understand if I am in the wrong here by expecting that they're liable to either fix bugs or let me fix them myself.

Your jurisdiction may have similar laws.\n\nAt first blush you must comply with the term of the contract preventing reverse engineering.

However, this doesn't guarantee protection from the company attempting to revoke the license. The situation involves complex legal issues spanning multiple jurisdictions, and the developer's right to fix bugs doesn't automatically override the EULA.

If a friend comes to visit for a month, and it is clear from e.g. conversations that the intent is to stay for a month then leave, they will not have created a right of tenancy. Changing the scenario a bit, e.g. \"stay until I get back on my feet\" signals a different intent, and could be taken to be a rental agreement.

The response was to deny Congress\n>  power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear\n>  arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. (p. 2\\)\n* The Court, citing [*U.S. v. Miller*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174), 307 U.S. 174, holds that the weapons protected are \"those in common use for lawful purposes\". There is some discussion on pages 55\\-56, in which the majority seems to explicitly deny that the Second Amendment grants a specific right to possess military weapons. Instead, they reason that historically \"the militia\" would have reported for duty with the sort of firearms they normally had at home, whether or not those were the preferred weapons for fighting a war, and so therefore the Second Amendment protects the right to bear \"household\" weapons, not military weapons. They seem to agree that laws banning \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" are constitutional, even if those weapons are in military use. They specifically mention M\\-16 rifles as a type of weapon that can be banned.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court's interpretation in District of Columbia v. Heller, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the Court's view on the Second Amendment and military-style weapons?\n\nA) The Second Amendment guarantees the right to own any weapon currently used by the military, including M-16 rifles.\n\nB) The Second Amendment only protects weapons used by organized state militias or the National Guard.\n\nC) The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms commonly used for lawful purposes, but allows for the banning of \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" even if used by the military.\n\nD) The Second Amendment requires that anyone who can complete basic military training must be allowed to own military-grade weapons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms unconnected with service in a militia. However, the Court also stated that this right is not unlimited. The Court indicated that the Second Amendment protects weapons \"in common use for lawful purposes,\" but does not necessarily extend to all military weapons. The majority opinion specifically mentioned that laws banning \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" could be constitutional, even citing M-16 rifles as an example of weapons that could be banned.

That term is [defined](http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/7/title7sec3907.html) as \"off the premises of the owner and not under the control of any person whose personal presence and attention would reasonably control the conduct of the animal\". The term \"premise\" is not defined in a general manner in title 7, though in the definition of \"dangerous dog\" and \"nuisance dog\", it is defined as \"the residence or residences, including buildings and land and motor vehicles, belonging to the owner or keeper of the dog or wolf hybrid\" (the primary question being whether \"the land\" is part of \"the premise\"). In light of the mixed definition of \"premise\" in Maine law and given the extant evidence of legislative intent in title 7, the courts would conclude that \"in the yard\" is being \"on the premise\". In other words, the dog is not \"at large\". [Chapter 727](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/7/title7ch727sec0.html) contains separate provisions for a court determination that a dog is \"dangerous\" or \"a nuisance\", which is triggered by assault or threaten of bodily injury by a dog.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Maine, a landlord owns a multi-unit property where two tenants share a common foyer.

The term \"premises\" is not clearly defined for this situation, but based on the information provided, courts would likely interpret the entire rental property, including shared areas and the yard, as part of the \"premises\".

(The main exceptions are employees with written employment contracts usually in senior management, unionized employees and civil servants, which sometimes also limit schedule changes.)\n\nIf you are fired for cause, or quit, you are not entitled to unemployment benefits. But, if you are fired without cause, or you are \"constructively discharged\" then you are entitled to unemployment benefits. A \"constructive discharge\" colloquially speaking, means that conditions were made so bad for you that you were forced to quit.\n\nThere are also no rules limiting changes in schedules, assuming that each schedule allocates you the break time mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and that you get paid overtime is you work sufficient hours to qualify for it under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nIt is conceivable that frequent changes in schedules could cause a \"constructive discharge\" although I've never encountered a case (personally or in reported case law) where that has happened because it is quite unusual behavior for an employer.\n\nUltimately, the logic of employment at will is that if your employer is not good to work for, that you should seek employment with another employer who is more tolerable.

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the legal reality of the situation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the employer's actions, while possibly unfair, are not illegal under current Colorado law. \n\nOption B is incorrect as there are no specific laws in Colorado protecting employees from schedule changes or giving them the right to refuse newly assigned shifts without consequences.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no law in Colorado requiring additional compensation for short-notice schedule changes.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the employer's actions are likely legal, they could potentially lead to issues like high turnover or even claims of constructive discharge if the scheduling practices become extremely unreasonable.

More often, the conversion right would establish a fixed number of shares for which $X of debt could be converted if Y and Z conditions are met.\n\n> and has anyone seen 64% as a 'common' threshold?\n\nA 64% threshold is very unusual. \n\nUnder Robert's Rules of Order, there are many things that can be done only with a two\\-third's threshold. But, those rules contemplate a situation where there are many equal participants in voting. \n\nThe percentage threshold for extraordinary actions in a closely held company is, instead, usually individually negotiated on a case by case basis, usually so that: \n\n(1\\) more individual shareholders (or a the same number of shareholders with a larger percentage interest), in practice and as contemplated, have to vote yes than are required to secured an ordinary majority vote (otherwise it really isn't a supermajority at all), and \n\n(2\\) so that either none of the major shareholders or no more than one of the major shareholders can dissent for a matter to pass, but so that minor shareholders objections can be overruled.\n\nThe exact percentage varies based upon the circumstances and there is no one \"common\" percentage across the board. \n\nIn a situation like this one, assuming that exercising the conversion right would give him 72\\.5% of the shares (leaving the remaining shareholders with a 22\\.5% and a 5% share respectively after dilution), any percentage above 72\\.5% and not in excess of 77\\.5% would require at least two votes for supermajority action post\\-conversion, any percentage in excess of 77\\.5% would require the converter and the now 22\\.5% shareholder to approve, and any supermajority in excess of 95% would require a unanimous vote post\\-conversion. \n\nPre\\-conversion, a majority requirement would require any two shareholders to approve, any percentage in excess of 55% and not in excess of 90% would require both 45% shareholders to approve, and any percentage in excess of 90% would require a unanimous pre\\-conversion vote.\n\nNormally, in a case like that, the requirement for a supermajority would usually be any percentage in excess of 77\\.5% and not in excess of 90%, and a supermajority would almost never be 72\\.5% or less. A cut off of 80% or 85% would be pretty common in that situation (to leave room for overriding some future new small percentage interest shareholder like a key employee as well), a cut off of 75% would be uncommon but not unheard of, and a 64% supermajority would be very unusual in a case like that unless the debt converter has great economic power in the relationship (e.g. the deal just can't go forward without him).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small business has 3 partners with shares distributed as 10%, 45%, and 45%.

This range ensures that at least two shareholders (including the majority shareholder) must agree for any extraordinary resolution to pass, while still allowing for some flexibility.

For example, I guess that in the absolute majority of cases a natural person needs to provide at least a birth certificate in order to obtain nationality in other countries, therefore proving that they are, indeed, the same \"natural person\" that is also registered in their birth country.\n\nHowever, does the same also apply to a legal person? I have the impression that, while the same company can open subsidiaries into different countries, they are regarded as different entities (each existing into each country that the main company has registered their subsidiaries).\n\nDo countries actually recognize that a local subsidiary (i.e. Google Ireland) is the same company as Google LLC in the US? Or they are, most of the time, treated as separate entities?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To the extent that a company does have subsidiaries and they are located in other countries, then yes, those should be treated as different companies because they are structured in that manner. This is fairly common for tax reasons, structural subordination, valuation, liability (legal) reasons, etc.\n\nTo the extent that it is one company with no subsidiaries or other related entities, operating in more than one country, then it comes down to the laws of each respective country. In international law, there is really no set in stone law but rather a bunch of vague treaties and understandings that countries are really not necessarily obligated to follow. There is no international army or police force so there isn't really any teeth to enforce much. Therefore, two countries could in theory say one company is a native of each of them \\- and the company could say they are native of a third country altogether. What matters more for these countries is the appearance of uniformity and the appearance that they are on the up and up and that they are reasonable and make sense. They also want to attract other companies to do business there and receive their tax revenues etc. This also means that the company must agree to pay those tax revenues. So what occurs is an gradual reversion to an acceptable mean, which we all view as the international law or standard and over time this has become more and more uniform for and amongst countries in the aggregate taking into account what businesses ultimately want too taking into account taxes etc.\n\nThe way it works from a liability standpoint etc. is that a parent company owns stock or shares or interest in the subordinate company so if the subordinate company makes money and this money is distributed to the parent there will be taxes accordingly. Also, if the subordinate owes something and can't pay the parent will lose its ownership if they do not transfer in money (bankruptcy means the creditors win not the stock/share/interest holders).\n\nSo, in short, they are recognized and treated as separate legal entities because they are only if they are. A single company can still do operations in multiple locations, but the advantages of structuring separate entities may be more important and more profitable (tax reasons etc.) Whether others will recognize entity relationships depends on the names for each etc. (or research conducted to find owners). A lot depends on the structure that the company sets up for itself which is governed by a host of issues as mentioned above.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A multinational corporation, XYZ Corp, operates in several countries. In the United States, it's registered as XYZ LLC, while in Ireland it's registered as XYZ Ireland Ltd. The Irish subsidiary is wholly owned by the US parent company. How are these entities likely to be viewed from a legal and tax perspective?\n\nA) XYZ LLC and XYZ Ireland Ltd are considered the same legal entity in both countries, sharing all liabilities and tax obligations.\n\nB) XYZ LLC and XYZ Ireland Ltd are separate legal entities, but share all tax obligations across both countries.\n\nC) XYZ LLC and XYZ Ireland Ltd are separate legal entities with distinct liabilities and tax obligations in their respective countries, but XYZ LLC may be responsible for XYZ Ireland Ltd's debts if the subsidiary cannot pay.\n\nD) XYZ LLC and XYZ Ireland Ltd are completely independent entities with no legal or financial connection, despite the ownership structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a company establishes subsidiaries in different countries, these are typically treated as separate legal entities. This structure is often chosen for various reasons, including tax optimization, liability protection, and compliance with local laws. In this case, XYZ LLC (the parent company in the US) and XYZ Ireland Ltd (the subsidiary in Ireland) would be considered distinct legal entities with their own liabilities and tax obligations in their respective countries.\n\nHowever, the parent-subsidiary relationship means that XYZ LLC, as the owner of XYZ Ireland Ltd, has a financial stake in the subsidiary. If XYZ Ireland Ltd were to face financial difficulties and be unable to pay its debts, XYZ LLC might choose to provide financial support to protect its investment and maintain the subsidiary's operations. In extreme cases, if XYZ Ireland Ltd went bankrupt and XYZ LLC didn't intervene, the parent company would lose its ownership stake as creditors' claims would take precedence.\n\nThis structure allows for separate accounting, taxation, and legal treatment in each country, while maintaining an economic relationship between the entities. It's a common approach for multinational corporations to manage their global operations while navigating different legal and tax systems."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8762/what-is-the-legal-limit-of-alcohol-concentration-in-a-persons-sweat", "docs_id": 8762, "title": "What is the legal limit of alcohol concentration in a person&#39;s sweat?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the legal limit of alcohol in the sweat of a person, so that it is deemed illegal for him to drive?

And also based on that:\n\nThere was a prior case (Romania v Ukraine on the Serpent Island in the Black Sea) in which the parties argued extensively around the article 121 definition, but the ICJ ignored those arguments *entirely*, and ruled instead that the island/rock in question could not be used to alter the provisional equidistance line between the two countries.\n\nAnd for some details on the Philippines\\-China case, the thesis has a pretty extensive analysis. The most relevant bits seem to be:\n\n> The Tribunal was of the view that \u201chabitation\u201d also implies that the insular feature must\n>  be inhabited by a group or community. Although Article 121(3\\) does not specify any specific\n>  number of people, the habitation of an insular feature by a sole person would not typically be\n>  considered human habitation in the ordinary sense.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> The Tribunal was of the view\n>  that in order for an economic activity to be classified as the economic life of an insular feature,\n>  the resources on which the economic activity centres must be local as opposed to imported and\n>  must also be to the benefit of the economic activity in question. Thus, any form of economic\n>  activity that relies on the injection of external resources for its continuation does not fall within the\n>  scope of \u201can economic life their own\u201d. Economic activity of this kind would not constitute the insular\n>  feature\u2019s own economic life, but rather an economic life which is reliant on outside support. \\[...] economic activity derived\n>  from an insular feature\u2019s territorial sea may constitute the economic life of the feature only if it is\n>  connected to the feature itself, be it via the local population or via other mediums. This means\n>  that the exploitation of the territorial sea by distant fishermen or extractive enterprises which\n>  operate in the territorial sea of an insular feature, but make no use of the actual feature, will not\n>  be sufficient in bestowing the insular feature with an economic life of its own.\n\nSo I think the decision (on this issue) rested on the lack of connection between the group living on the island and the economic activity (around the island).\n\nOf course, Taiwan (and China) disagreed with the court's conclusion.\n\n---\n\nAs an aside, according to a [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/20/the-japanese-islet-of-okinotori-is-the-size-of-a-tokyo-bedroom-but-the-basis-of-a-big-claim/), the fact that UNCLOS has no explicit definition of \"rock\" is the basis for Japan's claim to Okinotori:\n\n> Relevant to the issue is the definition of \u201cisland\u201d and \u201crock.\u201d UNCLOS stipulates that \u201can island is a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide\u201d \\[Article 121 (1\\)].

This is a [frequent scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/03/dont-bank-check), where a forged check is presented and the victim is asked to buy something of value, and sent it to the scammers. (This is called the \"[secret shopper scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0053-mystery-shopper-scams)\"). The bank making money available is not a guarantee that the check is legitimate.\n\nThe problem with suing the bank in small claims court is that there will be an important question of fact, namely exactly what the bank's agent said to you. It is unlikely that they actually said \"The other bank has promised that this is a legitimate check which they will honor, so you can safely spend the money\". More likely, they implied that there is such an account, that there are funds to cover the check, an so on. It's only weeks later after the dust has settled (the account\\-holder has notified their bank that the check was forged) that the bank can apply the higher\\-level forensic tools needed to determine that the check was bogus.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding trademark enforcement and app distribution in this scenario?\n\nA) The US trademark holder has global precedence and can prevent the EU trademark holder from distributing their app worldwide.\n\nB) Both developers can distribute their apps globally without any restrictions, as app stores operate independently of regional trademark laws.\n\nC) The developers can distribute their apps globally, but may need to restrict distribution in regions where they don't hold the trademark if the other party complains.\n\nD) App stores will automatically enforce trademark rights globally based on the US registration alone.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because trademark protection is generally limited to the countries or regions where it is registered. App stores like Google Play and Apple's App Store allow developers to choose which countries their apps are distributed in. If one trademark holder complains about infringement, the other developer may need to restrict distribution in the countries where they don't hold the trademark.

There is no clear line between airspace and space but 60,000 feet is clearly in the former.\n\nThe US, like all other nations except Lichtenstein for some reason, is a signatory to the [Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation) which, among other things, makes it an act of war to use force against a civilian aircraft. Now, acts of war are not, per see, illegal \\- there are international laws about armed conflict and there are philosophical arguments about just and unjust wars but war itself is a political rather than a legal construct.\n\nArticle 5 of the convention gives the right to all other states the right to operate *civil* aircraft within US airspace (and vice\\-versa) without prior permission (apart from regularly scheduled flights which do require permission) subject to compliance with the convention. Relevantly, unmanned balloons are dealt with in Annex 4 \\- it states that permission is not needed for light meteorological balloons but is needed for any other balloon which might enter foreign airspace.\n\nThe Chinese claim that the balloon was \u201cmainly\u201d meteorological but the convention requires it to be \u201cexclusively\u201d meteorological. It also requires it to be \u201clight\u201d meaning having a payload weighing less than 4kg \\- unless the payload of this ballon was made of unobtainum, it weighed more than 4kg.\n\nThey also argue that it drifted off course and entered US airspace inadvertently. This would be a legitimate claim if the entry of US airspace was unlikely at the planning and launch stages of the operation. We simply do not have the information to assess this claim.\n\nThe US claim that this was a surveillance aircraft. If this is so, then the aircraft is not a civil aircraft and the Chicago Convention does not apply which brings us back to pure sovereignty \\- the US can do what it likes with things in its own airspace.\n\nThere is a treaty between NATO members and former Warsaw Pact members dating from the 1990s that allow surveillance overflights of each other\u2019s territories. However, there are two problems with this: China was never a signatory, and the US withdrew during the Trump Presidency.\n\nSo, if this wasn\u2019t a balloon that inadvertently and unexpectedly drifted off course, the US was allowed to shoot it down.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on international law and treaties regarding civil aviation, which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the U.S. shooting down the alleged Chinese balloon in February 2023?\n\nA) The U.S. clearly violated international law by shooting down a civilian aircraft, as prohibited by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation.\n\nB) The U.S. action was fully justified under international law, regardless of the balloon's purpose, due to absolute sovereignty over its airspace.\n\nC) The legality of the U.S. action depends on whether the balloon was genuinely a civilian meteorological device or a surveillance aircraft, and whether its entry into U.S. airspace was inadvertent.\n\nD) The U.S. action was legal under the treaty between NATO and former Warsaw Pact members allowing mutual surveillance overflights.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of the U.S. action hinges on several factors. If the balloon was truly a civilian meteorological device that inadvertently drifted into U.S. airspace, the Chicago Convention might apply, potentially making the shoot-down illegal. However, if it was a surveillance aircraft or intentionally entered U.S. airspace, the U.S. would have the right to take action under its sovereignty. The correct classification of the balloon and the nature of its entry into U.S. airspace are crucial in determining the legality of the U.S. response. Option A is incorrect because the applicability of the Chicago Convention is not clear-cut in this case. Option B oversimplifies the situation by ignoring international agreements.

On the other hand, having an information earlier due to his math skills which are available to everybody does not constitute insider trading.\n\nUsing the new discovered super algorithm for shorting the bitcoin price is not illegal since the super algorithm is not illegal either, but proprietary to the mathematics.
