This theory invariably refers to some unnamed US case where a passer\\-by attempted CPR on the victim of a heart attack, was unsuccessful, and was sued as a result. This came up on a first aid course I attended, and the tutor was fairly certain that the risk is very small if the passer\\-by takes such care as is reasonable given the lack of expertise. \n\nWas the tutor correct?\n\nI'd be interested in views from other jurisdictions, but my main interest is the position in the UK. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This effectively comes under duty of care. Firstly, in England and Wales there is no obligation to be a Good Samaritan \\- in other words, there is no obligation to be a rescuer. Until you intervene to try and rescue someone, you do not owe that person a duty.\n\nAs soon as you do intervene, however, you **do** owe them a duty. Specifically, you owe them a duty not to make the situation worse (Horsey and Rackley, *Tort Law*, 3rd ed., OUP 2013, p. 75\\). The specific situation Horsey and Rackley give is that of resuscitating a drowning child and breaking a rib as you do so: this *may* be 'making the situation worse' (Horsey and Rackley, pp. 75\\-76\\). \n\nDoes this mean that you'll be liable if you give someone first aid and in doing so, you make the situation worse? Not necessarily, because, as Horsey and Rackley point out, duty is different to liability. Using the drowning child example again, they state:\n\n> So, for example, while someone who intervenes may owe a duty not to make the situation worse, their actions would still be judged against those of a 'reasonable person' in the circumstances (and so if a reasonable person would have tried to resuscitate the child in the same way, there will be *no breach* of their duty and therefore no *liability* to pay compensation.) (p.76\\)\n\nThe 'reasonable person' standard corresponds to what you mentioned in the question about lack of expertise. If a doctor intervenes in such a situation, the standard of care they'd be expected to give would be higher than, say, for someone who's simply done a basic first aid course. The question is whether or not you've acted as the reasonable person in your situation would have done.\n\nOn that basis, then, your tutor is pretty much correct: so long as you take such care as is reasonable based on your expertise, or lack thereof, then under English and Welsh law, you're unlikely to be liable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In England and Wales, a bystander attempts to perform CPR on a person who has collapsed in the street.

However, this duty is judged against the standard of a \"reasonable person\" in similar circumstances. The bystander's actions would be evaluated based on what a reasonable person with similar first aid knowledge and expertise would have done in the same emergency situation. This means that if breaking the rib was a reasonable consequence of attempting CPR for someone with basic first aid training, the bystander is unlikely to be held liable. The law recognizes the difference between a layperson and a medical professional in these situations, and doesn't expect the same level of expertise from both."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46489/is-replacing-a-failed-part-with-a-faulty-design-with-the-same-part-considered-a", "docs_id": 46489, "title": "Is replacing a failed part with a faulty design with the same part considered a repair, in the EU", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am wondering about a situation that used to happen with the 2011 series of MacBook Pros.\n\nAt one time, they all started to fail, one after the other.\nThe root of the problem was identified and well documented.

I disagree.\n\nTheir point was that they extend, through replacements, the lifetime of the computer until it is 'vintage'. Vintage seems to be 5 years for them.\n\nMy point was that since we have machines made in the 80s that are still running, 5 years is not acceptable as a lifespan. Even if a machine is made obsolete, it should have a significantly longer lifespan. And I argued that swapping a part with another one that both parties know will fail is not a repair.\n\nI made the argument that if a part is known to have catastrophic failure on an airplane, we don't replace that part with the same model, but with a fixed design. At that stage they wouldn't comment anymore.\n\nA current situation is very similar with the Boeing 737 where it was found that, on some planes, a critical component started to fail at 1/3 of its expected lifespan.

This is where to begin the analysis.\n\nOften, when parents aren't married there is a custody decree from a court that spells out who does and does not have custody of a child with respect to issues like medical care, but it does not appear that this is the case here.\n\nThe way paternity law works is that there are certain circumstances which cause someone to be presumed to be a parent until disproven (a couple of which are conclusive presumptions that can't be overcome with facts at some point), but a lack of a presumption doesn't mean that you aren't a parent, just that it is harder to prove that you are a parent. \n\nSomeone who is, or is presumed to be, a parent, continues to be a parent until that status is legally terminated (usually in a legal proceeding, but sometimes by operation of law). Since you are an actual parent, you continue to be a parent and have that authority, until that status in terminated for purposes of the law or until a court order limits your parental authority.\n\nA lack of a father's name on a birth certificate does not create a presumption that a child does not have a father or that you are not a father, although the name of a different man on a birth certificate does create a presumption which can become conclusive at some point, that the person named on the birth certificate is the father. \n\nOften this presumption becomes conclusive after five years, although I haven't (as I write this) confirmed that this is the case in New York. It isn't clear from the question if there is a different man named as a father on the birth certificate although it sounds as if it simply fails to name any father. And, often paternity petitions are disfavored or disallowed once a child turns eighteen for at least some purposes.\n\nA [written acknowledgement of paternity](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/family-court-act/fct-sect-516-a.html) delivered to the appropriate vital statistics record keeping office can establish paternity if not contested. The [standard version](https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/family/paternityAcknowledgment.shtml) of [this form](https://www.childsupport.ny.gov/dcse/aop_howto.html) must be signed by both parents, in each case before two witnesses.\n\nThe extent to which you are acknowledged as the parent of the child by the mother and others, and the extent to which you are involved in a child's life is also relevant to legal paternity, because a termination of parental rights can proceed in the absence of showing these things. The fact that the child share's your last name and that you are actively involved enough in the child's life to make it seem unlikely that this could be established even if a proceeding was brought, and in the absence of a formal termination of parental rights proceeding, you would not normally have your legal status as a parent terminated.\n\nSo, probably, you are legally the child's parent whose authority is not limited by any custody decree, and therefore, you are entitled to authorize a vaccination. But, for a wide variety of reasons, it would be prudent to have your paternity formally established under the law if you are going to have an ongoing involvement in your child's life.\n\nAlso, as DaleM notes, if you have the child with you, even if you are not the legal parent, you would usually be considered \"in loco parentis\" and have the authority to do this even in the absence of actual paternity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John and Mary are unmarried parents of a 4-year-old boy in New York State.

I am confused why the two bases are **different**, and what **impact** they give to us in today's claim handling.\n\nThank you. Any help is welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Strict Liability**\n\nThis [means](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_liability) that a defendant is liable for committing the action and it does not matter what his mental state was nor what he intended to do when he committed the action. Easy examples are possession of narcotics (you have them, it doesn't matter what you were going to do with them, you're liable) or statutory rape (it doesn't matter if she said she was 18, if she showed a (fake) ID, etc., if you sleep with someone underage, you're liable).\n\n**Negligence**\n\nThis is [failing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/negligence) to behave with a level of care that a reasonable person would have behaved with under the same conditions. In order to prevail on negligence claim, one must establish four elements:\n\n1. the existence of a legal duty from the other person to you\n2. the other person's breach of that duty\n3. you having suffered an injury\n4. proof that the breach of that legal duty was the cause of that injury\n\nWhile usually this has to do with actions taken (e.g., you negligently sped your car out of a parking lot...) in situations where there is a duty to act, even an omission can suffice.\n\n**The Difference?**\n\nStrict Liability and Negligence are both standards are liability. Put simply, negligence law requires a defendant to pay for the harms done by their unreasonable activity; strict liability requires a defendant to pay for all harms caused by their activity, regardless of whether the activity was reasonable or unreasonable.\n\n**Res Ipsa**\n\n[Res Ipsa Loquitur](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/res_ipsa_loquitur) doesn't apply to strict liability. Strict liability is *strictly* the simple formulation described above: you did it, it's on you. None of your \"But\\-buts...\" or proclamations of \"I was misled!\" are going to get you off the hook.\n\nRes Ipsa Loquitur is Latin for \"the thing speaks for itself.\" Basically, it allows a Plaintiff to create a rebuttable presumption of negligence by the defendant by proving three things:\n\n1. The thing that happened was the type of thing that generally doesn't happen without negligence.\n2. It was caused by something solely under control of the defendant.\n3. The plaintiff did not contribute to causing that thing that happened.\n\n**Difference in Final Compensation**\n\nThis is hard to answer because of the types of cases usually found applying each. Strict liability is usually seen in criminal law in the ways described above and in tort law in specific circumstances...

The dangerous animal concept is why pitbill owners don't want the breed classified as a \"dangerous breed.\"\n\nNonetheless, though, here's a [Harvard](https://cyber.harvard.edu/bridge/LawEconomics/neg-liab.htm) article actually comparing compensation in strict liability vs. negligence lawsuits!\n\nI hope this helps.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small town has recently passed a local ordinance classifying all pit bulls as \"dangerous animals.\" John, a pit bull owner, is walking his dog on a leash when it suddenly breaks free and injures a passerby. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential liability?\n\nA) John will only be liable if the injured party can prove he was negligent in handling the dog.\nB) John will be strictly liable for the injury, regardless of any precautions he took.\nC) John can avoid liability by proving he had no knowledge of his dog's aggressive tendencies.\nD) The injured party must invoke res ipsa loquitur to establish John's negligence.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. When an animal is classified as \"dangerous,\" the owner is typically held strictly liable for any injuries it causes. This means John would be liable regardless of the precautions he took or his lack of negligence. \n\nOption A is incorrect because strict liability does not require proof of negligence. \n\nOption C is incorrect because in strict liability cases, the defendant's knowledge or intent is irrelevant. \n\nOption D is incorrect because res ipsa loquitur is a doctrine used in negligence cases, not strict liability cases. Moreover, it would not be necessary here as the liability is strict.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the difference between strict liability and negligence, as well as the application of strict liability in the context of dangerous animals."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3380/is-it-illegal-to-spray-weeds-on-another-persons-land-without-permission-and-th", "docs_id": 3380, "title": "Is it illegal to spray weeds on another person&#39;s land without permission, and thus to harm animals?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *I am in England*.\nI rent a field off an elderly friend who can no longer tend it.

Local council / DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food \\& Rural Affairs) / police?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You would need to be able to prove that he encroached on your land (or your tenancy to land) with his pesticide/herbicide. You should speak to him and let him know that you feel his herbicide made its way (it could've come with the wind if its just on the borders) to the land, and as a result your animals were harmed. It's always better to see if you can handle this by appealing to his sense of responsibility. Just ask him to not spray the border, or not spray on a day with any breeze if he insists on spraying the entirety of his land. If he denies spraying the border (or at all), you can try to catch him in the act and film it, or find neighboring witnesses, such that you can file a complaint for trespass. It is probably not illegal in the true sense of the word, but it may subject him to damages. \n\nYou may try contacting your department of agriculture.\n\nIf he is a commercial applicator there are likely regulations that dictate the necessity of following label instructions or specific regulations or laws in your community that may also subject him to liability under common law, if the pesticide drift enters the properties of others (like yours) and causes damage. While pesticide particles carried by air may cause harm to people, your type of damage or damage to another's agricultural crops is the typical claim made and the typical measure of damages. More\\-so when they drift to organic crops. \n\nGenerally, plaintiff(s) must show that defendant(s) breached either the label instruction or a regulatory provision to succeed in recovering damages outside of common law. Typically, there are labeling instructions or regulatory provisions that limit spray drift. \n\nIs he spraying whole fields such that you think he is purchasing commercial amounts? \n\nIf he is just spraying his small field or plot of land, you will have to establish a claim for trespass in order to recover damages. You also must be able to prove damages \u2013 e.g., veterinarian bills, loss of use of the animals for plowing or whatever. You have to have show the act (spraying), causation (the cause and effect) and damages (the actual effect to you that brought about specific damages) to make a claim. So far, you don't seem to have actual evidence of the act, although if you can acquire that, causation seems to be met, as well as the potential to show specific damages.\n\nUnfortunately, the pain and suffering of animals does not have the same impact or carry any of the same rights as people incurring some sort of physical harm. It must be some actual quantifiable damage to you. Only you can determine what this is. \n\nIn neighborly disputes, the measure of damages is often not worth the cost of litigation. Sad but true.\n\nAs a plaintiff (if it comes to that), you'll need to establish trespass or another common law cause of action as a basis for the recovery. Or you could seek equitable relief (ask the court to order he stop the practice). These claims prove challenging for plaintiffs to establish because of the common usage of pesticides. Also, strict liability is generally not available as a cause of action. You may have a claim in nuisance, but you still must show those three elements of proof. There are typically laws that preempt negligence claims concerning labeling (like in the US), and remaining negligence claims tend to be difficult to prove, for the very reason you stated (you didn't see him do it but you know he did).\n\nThis means that in order to show you (or your chattel) were injured by spray drift you will probably have to file a claim in trespass. However, chemical spray drift is so intangible it is difficult for plaintiffs to meet the requirements for a trespass claim. States\u2019 approaches to trespass for securing damages resulting from spray drift vary, and this can mean that a plaintiff must carefully plead interference with exclusive possession (your right to the land) together with injury meaning substantial property damages or damage that is physical, to establish their cause of action in trespass.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of suspected pesticide drift causing harm to horses on rented land in England, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal recourse available to the affected party?\n\nA) The affected party can easily file a criminal complaint against the farmer for illegal pesticide use, as any form of spray drift is strictly prohibited by law.\n\nB) The affected party must only prove that the horses were injured, and the farmer will be automatically held liable for damages without need for further evidence.\n\nC) The affected party needs to establish trespass, causation, and specific damages, potentially through gathering evidence of the spraying act, in order to have a viable civil claim.\n\nD) The affected party can claim compensation for the horses' pain and suffering without needing to prove any economic damages or loss of use of the animals.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that to pursue a legal claim, the affected party would need to establish three key elements: the act of spraying (trespass), causation (linking the spraying to the horses' injuries), and specific, quantifiable damages. The answer highlights the challenges in proving these elements, especially without direct evidence of the spraying act. It also accurately reflects the legal complexities involved in such cases, including the need for tangible proof and the difficulty in establishing trespass for intangible chemical drift.

So an employee could still give one month of notice.\n\nAnd any other conditions of the employment contract (working hours, location, etc.) would still apply.\n\n**My question is, could a company still keep illegal/unenforceable clauses in its contact, knowing full well these are indefensible in court?**\n\nIf it matters, let\u2019s suppose the illegality of the clause has been determined before both parties signed.\n\nJurisdiction: answers from any are welcome, I am especially interested in the U.K. and Germany.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Severability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severability)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n> My understand \\[sic] of contract law in general, is that an illegal or unenforceable clause does not render the whole contract void, but rather that specific clause is essentially stricken out, as if it did not exist.\n\nThis is not true. Or, at least, not necessarily true.\n\nThe courts, when interpreting a contract, try to give effect to the parties intentions. Or, more precisely, what an impartial, reasonable person would conclude their intentions at the time were based on the evidence.\n\nA contract is a set of mutual promises \\- if one of those promises is unenforceable, was it the parties intention that:\n\n* the remainder be enforced, or\n* absent that promise, they would not have made a deal, or they would have made a different deal, say, at a different price?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make general statements about severability because they turn on the particular facts of each case.\n\nHowever, the common law doctrine is that severance means severance \\- you can take words out, but you can\u2019t add words in or change the meaning of words you left behind. If doing that leaves nonsense, then the clause can\u2019t be severed, and the whole contract is void.\n\nFurther, what\u2019s left must still be a contract. If the severed portion leaves a remainder that does not meet the requirements of a contract (e.g. because the severance totally removed one party\u2019s consideration), then the whole contract is void.\n\nSimilarly, if the severed item is central to the purpose of the contract, then the whole contract is void.\n\nFinally, at least in Common Law countries, there is a difference between provisions that are unenforcable (e.g. unfair restraint of trade clauses) and those that are illegal (e.g. your murder before resignation clause).\n\nIn most jurisdictions, if a provision is unenforcable at common law or through statute, severability is an option. However, if the provision is illegal, then responses differ.\n\nIn England and Wales, a provision that requires criminality or the commission of a tort cannot be severed \\- the illegality 'infects' the entire contract and makes the whole thing void. However, in Australia, the degree of illegality matters \\- heinous illegality infects the entire contract, but incidental illegality may not. For example, see [*REW08 Projects Pty Ltd v PNC Lifestyle Investments PTY LTD* \\[2017] NSWCA 269 \\[23 October 2017]](https://www.turnbullhill.com.au/articles/illegal-contract-void-enforceable/) \\- the NSW Court of Appeal ruled that a property sale that contained clauses designed (by both parties) to defraud the state of Stamp Duty was nevertheless enforceable against the vendor \\- this would likely have been decided the other way in England and Wales.\n\nOf course, many contracts make express provision for unenforcable terms in what are known as severability clauses. These can go further than mere severance and allow the court to add words or even redraft entire sections to preserve the contract. However, this is not a [panacea](https://whitmanlegalsolutions.com/blog/severability-clause) because what you agreed to in your severability clause may not be what you thought you agreed to when the rubber hits the road. For example, when you are forced to sell your Picasso for the 1,000USD deposit only, and you can't get the 100,000,000,000 Iranian Rial balance due to US sanctions.\n\n**Therefore, deliberately leaving unenforcable provisions in a contract is dangerous because you don't know what you are going to get.**\n\nHowever, is it unlawful?\n------------------------\n\nWell, that depends.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making legally unenforceable agreements. You and I can agree to go to the movies this Thursday. That's an unenforcable social arrangement, not a contract. If you stand me up, I can't sue you even if I bought popcorn for you.\n\nSimilarly, there is no prohibition on having unenforcable terms in an otherwise legally binding contract, particularly if everyone knows they are unenforcable. Indeed, many large contracts are accompanied by Memorandums of Understanding that are unenforcable statements about how various organisations intend to work together to give effect to the contract.\n\nHowever, if the term is included to be deceptive or misleading by one party against the other (intentionally or otherwise), there may be legal consequences. A person who was misled into entering a contract may be able to have that contract declared void.

While including an unenforceable clause doesn't always have legal consequences, doing so intentionally to mislead could be considered deceptive conduct, which is often prohibited in trade or commerce.\n\nC is incorrect because while the specific clause might be unenforceable, there could still be consequences for the company for including a misleading term.\n\nD is incorrect because an illegal or unenforceable clause cannot be enforced, regardless of whether the employee signed the contract."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79097/why-are-religious-exemptions-to-anti-discrimination-laws-legal", "docs_id": 79097, "title": "Why are religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example, why is a cake maker allowed to refuse to serve people celebrating same sex marriage, due to personal religious beliefs?\n\nWhy is this exemption allowed?\n\nWhy is the government allowed to carve out religious exemptions to anti\\-discrimination laws?\n\nDoesn't this violate the Establishment Clause?\n\nGovernment sanctioned religions prayer is already illegal per \"Engel v.

The Commission decision against the cake maker was overturned on procedural grounds, and no final decision on the merits has been made to date, to the best of my knowledge. And as Trish points out, the baker claimed that the law was, in effect, forcing him to use his individual artistic talents to make a statement endorsing a view that he deemed religiously wrong.\n\nNote that anti\\-discrimination laws are not an inherent right, they are statutes, created in the US by Congress and the state legislatures, and they prohibit just what the legislators have chosen to prohibit. For most of the history of the US there were no such laws, and Congress could repeal them tomorrow if it chose. So in a sense the only real reason **why** the laws grant certain religious exemptions is because Congress (or the various state legislatures) has said so.\n\nThe actual exemption is found in [42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000e\u20131 (a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-1) which provides that:\n\n> This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.\n\nThus it exempts a \"religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society\" from complying with that part of the anti\\-discrimination law that refers to **employment**. That would particularly be [42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000e\u20132 (a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2) which provides that:\n\n> (a) Employer practices \\-\\- It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014  \n> \n> (a) (1\\) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nThere is a further similar but more limited exemption in 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000e\u20132 (e)\n\nIt would pretty obviously violate the free exercise clause to require a religious organization to hire, say, priests, ministers, or other religious leaders regardless of religion. But the exemption goes farther than that. A church may discriminate on religion, or on race or sex, say, in hiring janitors or other people whose functions have nothing to do with religion. Nothing in the US Constitution requires that broad an exemption. But on the other hand, nothing forbids it either. That was the decision of Congress, and was no doubt in part the product of a political compromise. There is a long history in the US of providing churches and other religious organizations a degree of exemption from ordinary laws, and this is in line with that tradition. Beyond that, why this particular exemption and not a somewhat narrower one was chose, is a matter of politics, not law.\n\nThe question asserts:\n\n> Government sanctioned religions prayer is already illegal per \"Engel v. Vitale\".\n\nThat is an over\\-broad reading of [*Engel v. Vitale*, 370 U.S. 421 (1962\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_v._Vitale). In that case (as the Wikipedia article puts it):\n\n> the Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and encourage its recitation in public schools, due to violation of the First Amendment. ... The Court held that the mere promotion of a religion \\[by the government] is sufficient to establish a violation, even if that promotion is not coercive.\n\nThe case focused on the fact that the government had composed the text of the prayer in question, and that encouragement to recite it was a matter of official government policy. That is quite different from permitting private individuals or organizations to say voluntary prayers, or make hiring decisions based on religious distinctions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, which of the following statements most accurately describes the religious exemption in anti-discrimination laws in the United States?\n\nA) The exemption allows any business to refuse service based on religious beliefs.\nB) The exemption primarily applies to employment practices of religious organizations.\nC) The exemption was established by the Supreme Court in Masterpiece Cakeshop v.

The terms of service users agree to when using such services are legally binding contracts, and that contractual relationship can give each service the power to remove nudity (and user accounts) if their TOS forbids it.

Social media platforms and dating apps, as private companies, have the right to set their own terms of service, which users agree to when signing up. These terms often prohibit nudity for several reasons:\n\n1. To maintain a comfortable environment for their broad user base.\n2. To protect themselves from potential legal issues, particularly related to the distribution of illegal content such as child pornography.\n3. To align with their business model and ethical standards.\n\nWhile these companies have significant freedom in setting their policies (as mentioned in option B), they still consider legal implications, making B not entirely accurate. Option A is incorrect because private companies are generally not bound by the First Amendment, which applies to government restrictions on speech.

The law allows for all non-exempt property to be taken and sold to satisfy a judgment, regardless of the judgment amount. However, practical considerations such as clearing existing liens, cost of sale, legal costs, and the likelihood of court approval make seizing real property often a less preferable option compared to other methods like wage garnishment or seizing a vehicle. The court would typically consider seizing real property as a last resort, especially if the defendant has other assets available.

How might a more conscientious tool creator properly declare that their tool's contributions can be merged in without licensing and IP problems?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As @amon stated in a comment, copyright requires creativity. If the author of a tool wants to claim copyright on the output of that tool, then that output must contain something that required the creativity of the tool author.\n\nFor a tool that just re\\-indents its input, the output is created from the input with a mechanical, non\\-creative, transformation and the output does not contain any creative content that wasn't already present in the input. For that reason, authors of such tools can't claim any copyright on the output.\n\nFor a tool like `bison`, which was mentioned in the comments, the output contains a measurable amount of creative content that was *not* present in the input, but which was provided by the authors of `bison`. For that reason, the authors of 'bison' *do* have a copyright claim on the output of the tool (for which they give a broad permission to use).\n\nSo, the basic question becomes, how much of the (creative) content of the output can be traced back to the tool itself and not to the input that the tool processed. For linters/formatters, that is likely to be very little. For code generators, it can be anywhere between very little and all of the output. \n\nThe license restrictions on the code produced by the tool itself are by default the same as the license restrictions on the source of the tool, but the tool author can choose to apply any other license to the tool code that ends up in the output.  \n\nIf the output of the tool is, at least in part, dependent on an input file, then the authors of the input file also have a copyright claim on the tool output (as their creative work influenced the output), so the tool author can not claim exclusive ownership.\n\nThe usual situation is that for tools that don't add creative content to the output, the author explicitly states that the don't have any copyright claims on the output.  \n\nFor tools that *do* add creative content, that content might be released under very permissive conditions (like, \"you can use the output as a whole for any purpose, but you can only separate out the code that comes from the tool's codebase if you adhere to the \\<X\\> license\")", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company develops an AI-powered code refactoring tool that automatically suggests and implements complex code improvements.

So for clearance, I paid for it. I asked if I could use a webserver for testing and they agreed and gave me a **free** webserver to use, for a non\\-discussed period.\n\nI used it, but after a couple of years I didn't use it anymore. When I got an invoice to pay, I thought that if I didn't pay it the domain would not extend and the webserver would be shut down. After that I did not look at the domain/webserver anymore, I've got an email that reminded me that if I didn't pay my domain would be deleted/sold and that was it. After that I didn't got any messages from the company.\n\nAfter a while I was going to the website, and it was still online, I looked if I could still log in to the webserver and I could still log in and modify it. I have since sent other emails to the company and received no response.\n\n**Question:**\n\nIs it legal to use the domain/webserver? I don't pay anymore and have received no invoice. Could I be required to pay for all the years I had the domain but did not pay for it?\n\nNote that I live in the Netherlands.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is rather unclear what the facts are, and the legal answer would depend crucially on those facts. My understanding is that you bought a domain from a provider, and they allowed you to use a web server for some period. It also appears that you don't have a clear understanding of the contract, which may have been made online and you might not have retained a copy of the agreement (which would allow you to look at the terms).\n\nThe assumption that failing to pay substitutes for explicitly cancelling a service is incorrect. If under the contract you agree to pay a certain amount per year, then you have been racking up charges for some time, and you would need to actually cancel. Ultimately, they could take you to court to force you to pay what you owe, although usually there are less drastic intermediate steps. In court, they would produce their documents to show that you owe money, and your attorney would somehow counter, perhaps by alleging that you had a good\\-faith belief that the contract had been terminated. It is possible that they simply messed up and failed to send you an invoice earlier, which could explain the lack of invoice. At any rate, the fact that you haven't gotten an invoice does not legally entitle you to avoid paying for the service, whether or not you use it.\n\nOn the premise that they haven't taken back the domain (seems like they didn't), you can legally use it. However, if you do use it, then that would trash any claim that you believed the contract had been terminated (to argue \"I thought it had been canceled\" entails \"and thus I didn't use the service\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Netherlands, a user purchases a domain and receives a free webserver for testing.

The user may indeed be legally responsible for paying for all years of service, even those without invoices. The lack of an invoice does not absolve the user of contractual obligations.

It seems very strange that a person at a company who might be interested in using the nonprofit's services cannot even be sent a one\\-line opt\\-in request to receive more details on LinkedIn. **Any thoughts gratefully appreciated.**\n\nSome solutions I have considered:\n\n1. Take advantage of the difference between 'corporate subscribers' and 'individual subscribers' in the UK's implementation of the ePrivacy Directive (PECR), which [allows direct marketing to employees' corporate email addresses](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing/business-to-business-marketing/). *Only applies to the UK and probably does not apply to LinkedIn.*\n2. Phone the individual concerned to obtain consent prior to sending a message. *Requires knowing the phone number and is time\\-consuming.*\n3. Contact the company's official email address (e.g. info@company.com) instead. *Impractical as reply rate is very low from such addresses.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You seem to have a solid understanding of the ePrivacy implications, but lack a fundamental insight: your organization does not have a right to achieve its mission or a right to disseminate unwanted marketing. But other people do have a right to not be subject to excessive marketing.\n\nOf course, reality is more complex, so it's probably not entirely impossible to do marketing.\n\n* In your point 1, you note that some EU/EEA/UK countries distinguish ePrivacy protections between consumer and business subscribers. You can research the exact rules in the potential customer's country. This may allow you to email corporate/business accounts.\n\nI would strongly advise against messaging via Linkedin if there is a chance that the person is using that account for personal purposes like networking or hunting jobs, not just for conducting official company business.\n* ePrivacy has markedly different rules for email marketing vs phone marketing. Whereas there are pretty strict rules for electronic messages and robocalls, manual cold calling can be OK from an ePrivacy perspective. However, many EU/EEA/UK countries have rules that go beyond ePrivacy, and may have a kind of do\\-not\\-call registry that you must respect. Of course manual calls take more effort than spamming emails, but recall the above point that you don't have a right to spam other people.\n\nPhone calls are probably the most appropriate approach when the company lists individuals' phone numbers on its website. This will at least give you a few seconds of attention with a real human, more than you can expect from an email that is likely to be caught by spam filters.\n* Marketing via physical mail tends to have very lax rules. Note that every company/business that has a website will have to disclose its contact details including an address there, so this information is easy to acquire. However, chances are low that anyone would seriously engage with that marketing.\n* You can consider alternatives to direct marketing, so that interested companies eventually come to you. Things like press releases, writing guest articles in industry publications, speaking at relevant conferences, working on search engine optimization, buying ads.\n\nOn the GPDR aspects:\nGDPR and ePrivacy overlap, and it is necessary to comply with both sets of rules (GDPR likely applies here via Art 3(2\\)(a)). But where they potentially contradict each other, ePrivacy as the more specific law has precedence. For example, ePrivacy overrides the default GDPR legal basis rules when it comes to email marketing to existing customers (opt\\-out basis, no consent needed) or to using cookies (needs consent unless strictly necessary).\n\nInformation that relates to corporations is not personal data, but information that relates to individual employees or to sole proprietors would typically be personal data. Since you are unlikely to obtain consent for using this data, you would need an alternative GDPR legal basis such as a \"legitimate interest\".\n\nRelying on a legitimate interest requires that you conduct a balancing test, weighing your interests like marketing against the recipient's interests, rights, and freedoms. Core question in this context is whether the data subject can reasonably expect their personal data to be used like this, taking into account the nature of their relationship with you. Since there is no pre\\-existing relationship, claims of a legitimate interest are weak to start with. However, it may be possible to argue that when a company makes employee contact details available via its website (not LinkedIn!) then relevant marketing can be reasonably expected.

It's important to understand how this happens: the merchant isn't just picking an arbitrary amount of money and doing a new \"sale in reverse\"... they are identifying a specific past transaction that already happened, and modifying or reversing it. That is a system safeguard so they don't credit the wrong person or be tricked into a reversal on a transaction that never happened. That's why they want your receipt.\n\nOn a cash transaction, it is sellers prerogative whether to issue cash or store credit. Issuing store scrip is a reasonable option to deter theft and fraud. For instance someone who wanted an item could get it for free, by buying the item, taking it home, returning the next day without the item, grab *another* identical item off the shelf and sneak over to the CS line and \"return\" it with yesterday's receipt. **With cash sales, that would be completely untrackable, and the thief is gone**.

According to the documentation, the UK government grants limited statutory rights for returns, during which consumers are entitled to a cash or cash-like refund (such as a reversal of a credit card charge). However, for returns beyond these statutory limits, retailers have the liberty to offer store credit or vouchers instead of cash refunds as a courtesy to customers. This policy allows retailers to go above and beyond the legal minimum while also protecting themselves from potential fraud or abuse of return policies.

If you carefully copy something even if you are also deliberately changing features of the original, then you are copying. Copyright law gives the copyright holder the exclusive right to make copies. There is a difference between copying music and visual art in this respect, since music can be reduced to a small set of specific symbols, so \"being inspired by\" a musical work is often found to be infringement. The difficult part is legally distinguishing \"making a copy\" versus \"being inspired by\". The courts use a subjective test of \"substantial similarity\" to decide if there has been copying. the case of [Mannion v. Coors](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/2005%20Mannion%20Abridged.pdf). \"Pose\" is an element that is considered in assessing similarity: the question the court would ask (itself) is whether such a pose could ever have come from elsewhere (such as, your own creative efforts).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An artist creates a drawing of a fictional character using a photograph as reference for the body pose.

While the artist has changed elements like hair and face, keeping an identical pose could potentially be seen as copying rather than just being inspired by the photograph. The courts use a subjective test of \"substantial similarity\" to determine if copyright infringement has occurred. In cases like Mannion v. Coors, pose is considered an element in assessing similarity. The court would consider whether such a pose could have originated from the artist's own creative efforts or if it's so unique to the photograph that using it constitutes copying. Option A is incorrect because there's no strict \"80% different\" rule in copyright law. Option B oversimplifies the issue, as pose can be a factor in copyright considerations. Option D is too absolute, as the legality depends on the specific circumstances and the court's interpretation.

Austria, 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 48\\-55\\).\n> * 5 years and 11 months, complexity of case on account of the number of people to be questioned and the technical nature of the documents for examination in a case of\n> aggravated misappropriation, although this could not justify an investigation that had taken five years and two months; also, a number of periods of inactivity attributable to the authorities. Thus, while the length of the trial phase appeared reasonable, the investigation could not be said to have been conducted diligently (Rouille v.

A person can enter unlawfully by accident, or with no intention to be there unlawfully, in which case the person committed the act without the requisite criminal intent. If a person intends to enter but not remain, and they enter, they have committed the misdemeanor of trespassing. The question of whether unlawful entering with the intent to unlawfully remain satisfies the \"intent to commit a crime\" called for in the Washington statute has not been directly addressed in case law, as far as I know.\n\nWhile the state generally shoulders the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the crime, in Washington, under [RCW 9A.52\\.040](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.52&full=true#9A.52.040), the accused may bear the burden of disproving intent (this is a permissive inference on the fact\\-finder's part):\n\n> In any prosecution for burglary, any person who enters or remains\n>  unlawfully in a building may be inferred to have acted with intent to\n>  commit a crime against a person or property therein, unless such\n>  entering or remaining shall be explained by evidence satisfactory to\n>  the trier of fact to have been made without such criminal intent.\n\nThis does not mean that the state shoulders no burden of proof regarding intent, according to [State v. Newton](https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/321541.unp.pdf):\n\n> A jury may, however, infer the defendant's specific criminal \n>  intent from his or her conduct if it is not \"'patently \n>  equivocal'\" and instead 'plainly indicates such intent as a matter of logical probability'\n\nIn this instance, the burglary conviction was overturned because \n\n> no evidence shows his intent was anything other than to show\n>  her she could walk\n\nThe relevant fact is that the accused was under the influence of PCP, and believed that God had told him that his disabled mother could walk, and he broke into the residence to tell her this.\n\nPursuant to [State v. Bergeron](http://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1985/50960-3-1.html) where the conviction for attempted burglary was upheld, the court held that\n\n> The intent to commit a specific named crime inside the burglarized\n>  premises is not an \"element\" of the crime of burglary in the State of\n>  Washington...\n>  The intent required by our burglary statutes is simply the intent to\n>  commit any crime against a person or property inside the burglarized\n>  premises\n\nThe court observed in this case that \"there is absolutely no evidence in the record to prove what specific crime it was the defendant intended to commit inside\". \n\nWhat distinguishes Bergeron from Newton (the latter, not precedential, citing the former) is that there was a good case that Bergeron had an intent to commit *some* crime, though not a specific identifiable crime; but for Newton, there was no evidence that defendant intended to commit any crime whatsoever, even remaining unlawfully. In the hypothetical instance, the fact that the criminal smashed a vase is evidence of an intent to commit a crime (destruction of property). It's unlikely that a mere assertion \"I just did that on the spur of the moment\" would carry any weight.

That person is supposed to settle the decedent's debts, and divide the remainder equally among the siblings. It is virtually guaranteed that the mortgage\\-holder will get their share \u2013 you can't just sell a house with a mortgage and run. In the meantime, the estate has to keep paying the mortgage and property taxes.\n\nThe executor has wide latitude to dispose of the estate, and clearing out personal possessions is a necessary part of liquidating the estate. Those possessions being part of the estate, they \"count\", therefore that mink coat worth $10,000 can't just be \"taken\" by the executor in order to tidy things up. But that broken weed\\-eater worth $1 can just be thrown away and not stored for some months, waiting for the final reckoning. The executor is entitled to compensation for his work and reimbursement for his expenses, so nickle and diming the small possessions is probably economically counterproductive. The executor has the legal power to determine how the legally required distribution is carried out, that is, the law doesn't require a majority vote of the heirs in order to dispose of each and every item of property.\n\nIf there is an actual legal dispute, if you believe that the executor is improperly carrying out the job, you can hire a lawyer to have him removed, or otherwise put pressure on him to get a change in how things are. This will probably cost you more than you might get from the estate. It *is* possible that the real estate market will not support the current sale price and therefore a lower asking price is necessary (i.e. the executor needs a reality check).

While the executor has wide latitude in disposing of the estate, their actions must still be proper and in the best interest of all heirs. Consulting with a real estate agent and lawyer can help assess whether the house is being marketed effectively and if the executor's actions are appropriate. This approach allows for a professional evaluation of the situation without immediately resorting to costly legal action (A) or making unrealistic demands (B).

They are not married.\n\nBefore the child is born, they end their relationship. Each parent finds another partner and they live separately.\n\nWhat are the options provided by Pennsylvania law regarding child custody and/or visitation rights? Obviously the best thing would be for the parents to work it out among themselves, but what would the law say if they cannot?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Either party can petition the appropriate court for an adjudication of paternity (if this has not already been established in connection with the issuance of the birth certificate), and for a parental responsibility and child support order, at any time, if no such order is in place (assuming that Pennsylvania is the \"home state\" of the child and venue is proper).\n\nChild custody and visitation rights are determined based upon the \"best interests of the child\" with very little other formal guidance from the statute or even case law which also affords a judge very broad, although not unlimited discretion in resolving the issue if the parents don't reach an agreement. Any parent who is not adjudicated to be \"unfit\" (whose parental rights would then be terminated), is entitled to some reasonable visitation under the circumstances at a minimum. In practice, courts tend to prefer to enter an order that preserves the pre\\-litigation status quo is one was established for any reasonable length of time.\n\nOnce a custody and visitation schedule are established (logically, this is actually done contemporaneously), a child support award is also entered based upon the number of nights per year that the child spends with each parent, the income of each parent, and the extraordinary expenses, if any of the child, pursuant to guidelines that exist under state law but are federally mandated. Generally speaking, child support payments are quite small relative to the incomes of the parties. If a parent is willfully refusing to work or underemployed so as to reduce child support, in some circumstances, income that could have been earned is imputed to that parent for purposes of determining the appropriate amount of child support.\n\nThere is a small body of civil procedure that goes to the nitty gritty of how this is handled after a petition is filed, but that really goes beyond the scope of the question.\n\nIn the simplest case, only the two parents are involved in the litigation. \n\nBut, there are circumstances in which there can be other parties. For example, if the child has been supported by welfare, a representative of the state is a party to make sure that child support is paid reducing the need for welfare payments or repaying welfare payments already made by the state. Guardians of an un\\-empancipated minor or disabled parent might participate. Grandparents can sometimes have standing to participate. A non\\-parent who has physical custody of the child would usually have standing to participate. This all gets a little technical, and since the question doesn't suggest any facts that would call for additional parties, I will leave it at that.\n\nIn the event of a substantial change of circumstances after a statutory period after the last order was entered, a court may start over, more or less from scratch, and establish a modified child custody, visitation and child support order that reflects the changed circumstances. As a practical matter, for parents who are separated from shortly after the birth of a child and can't work things out between themselves, there will probably be several to half a dozen modification proceedings until the child is an adult.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Pennsylvania, a unmarried couple has a child and separates before the child is born.

The timeline on this seems confusing, but I'll summarize information I found:\n\nIn March of 2016, [Republican senators sought to compel](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/7/bryan-pagliano-must-testify-hillary-clinton-email-/) Mr. Pagliano's testimony reportedly indicating that his grant of immunity by the DOJ prohibited him from invoking the Fifth Amendment right against self\\-incrimination. In May, it was reported that [\"The \\[State] Department has searched for Mr. Pagliano\u2019s email pst file and has not located one that covers the time period of Secretary Clinton\u2019s tenure,\u201d](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/emails-found-hillary-clintons-senior-staffer-state-department/story?id=38989504)\n\nIn June 2016, it was reported that [Pagliano had filed a motion in seeking to keep the immunity agreement secret](https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/06/bryan-pagliano-hillary-clinton-emails-immunity-224015) in a case involving a Judicial Watch FOIA request. Later that month the judge the document should remain sealed \u201cbecause the government\u2019s criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential.\u201d (Presumably Pagliano's deal was related to the FBI investigation into the private e\\-mail server he administered for and which Hillary Clinton used instead of official state department servers.)\n\nLater, on September 13 of 2016, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee [voted to send to send a contempt resolution](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/bryan-pagliano-contempt-house-panel-228520) to the full House for Pagliano's refusing to testify in a hearing. (Note: Pagliano's attorney indicated he would take the 5th in open session, but be willing to testify in closed session.) [Wikipedia's summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress) indicates that the full House never considered the resolution.\n\nCan Congressional Committees still compel Mr. Paliano's testimony? \n\nHas this situation been clarified in the subsequent 24\\+ months?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If someone testifying before congress refuses to respond to appropriate questions (questions within the scope of the congressional inquiry), that person can be cited for contempt of Congress. One way to avoid this is if the witness can invoke the [Fifth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment) privilege against self\\-incrimination. That says that a person may not be compelled to be a witness against himself (or herself) in a criminal case, and has been interpreted to mean that if testimony **might** in future be used against the witness in a criminal case, it cannot be required, even if the current occasion is not a criminal case.\n\nHowever, if a person has been granted immunity in a particular matter, no testimony can be used against the person in a criminal case on that matter, and so there is no Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify on that matter. This applies to testimony before a court as well as before Congress. The grant of immunity must be at least as comprehensive as the refusal to testify would have been, or the privilege remains.\n\nTherefore, if a person has been granted immunity on a subject, that person cannot refuse to testify before Congress by invoking the Fifth Amendment. If the person does refuse, s/he can be cited for contempt of Congress. However, the person can raise a claim that the inquiry was not a proper one, for example because the subject was not a proper one fo Congressional inquiry, or that the Committee was not properly authorized. If the court upholds such a claim, the person will not be convicted of contempt. Also, while Congress can issue a citation, the Justice Department is not required to prosecute the person, and may choose to let the issue drop. Or the court might not convict on some other ground. And of course Congress (or one house of it) has to vote to issue the citation, which it might decide not to do, for political reasons, or indeed for any reason at all.\n\nSo a grant of immunity alone is not enough to say that testimony will be compelled, but it is a significant step towards such compulsion.\n\nNote that under *Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n*, 378 U. S. 52 (1964\\), a state grant of immunity also bars Federal use of the compelled testimony or its fruits, and under [*Kastigar v. United States*, 406 U.S. 441 (1972\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/441/) a Federal grant of immunity bars state use of the compelled testimony or its fruits.

They subpoena John Doe, who previously received immunity from the Department of Justice for his testimony on this matter. John Doe appears before the committee but refuses to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

When a person has been granted immunity on a subject, they cannot refuse to testify before Congress by invoking the Fifth Amendment. If they do refuse, they can be cited for contempt of Congress.

This question was inspired by [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84088/ordered-to-unlocking-a-car-trunk-may-i-lawfully-refuse) and random things I've heard/read over the years.\n\nI'm quite confused by a concept that comes up again and again and which people seem to hold for self\\-evident. And that concept is that there is some evidence which a court will refuse to admit. And that confuses be because... well, there's evidence. It leads to the truth. Why aren't you taking it?!\n\nIt's very easy to come up with realistic examples where:\n\n* There is a piece of evidence which is clearly and irrefutably shows that a person did something very bad (say, murder)\n* This evidence is for whatever reason \"not admissible\" (say, it was obtained illegally)\n* And there is no other piece of evidence that would incriminate this person.\n\nDoes that mean that the perpetrator gets to go free? How can the court refuse to admit evidence, especially if it's the only useful evidence existing? And if yes, then why is this so and where is this practice useful?\n\n---\n\n#### Some examples from the top of my head\n\nThe example question above deals with unlawful searches. Imagine that a police officer decided to search a car (or an apartment) and forcefully did so against the protests of the owner (or maybe the owner wasn't even present). They thought they might find drugs or something, but instead they are surprised to discover a dead body, clearly murdered. So... now what? According to the above question, since the search was illegal, this is inadmissible evidence in the court. Does that mean that the owner of the car/apartment gets to go away scott\\-free? Do they launch a new investigation and try to find other evidence *except* the fact that it was inside the property of this guy here (and failing to do that, release them)? If the owner of the car/apartment says \"I don't know what you're talking about, I last saw Jimmy here alive and well at the pub last night; I never seen his corpse before.\" \\- can they call him out on the obvious lie?\n\nOr, another example. I don't know about USA, but here in Europe it's illegal to record someone's phone calls without a warrant (or something like that; it's serious). Any recordings obtained unlawfully will be inadmissible as evidence.\n\nLet's now imagine that I've gone the full extra mile and have secretly bugged everything in my neighbour's house because I suspect (but have no evidence) that they murdered my child last month. I've got hidden cameras, microphones everywhere, etc. So one day I catch him talking to his spouse on the phone and mentioning the murder, admitting to doing it, and even telling where he buried the body.\n\nNow I have evidence... or do I? I give the recording to the police, they search the indicated place and they do find the body, but since they cannot accept my recording as evidence... does that mean that my neighbour now has no consequences? Let's also suppose that no other evidence is found that would indicate his guilt (the guy was thorough). Obviously I'd get some grief for bugging my neighbour's house, but do I now also become the prime suspect in the murder of my own child? After all \\- the recording of my neighbour's confession \"officially doesn't exist\", and I'm the one who told the police where to dig, so...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Different exclusionary rules have different reasons.\n\nHearsay is frequently inadmissible because it's less reliable for the court to hear Alice saying \"Bob told me that Carol hit him\" than to hear Bob saying \"Carol hit me.\" Another even more critical problem with hearsay testimony is that the defense cannot cross examine the person who made the statement in court. If Bob is there, the defense can ask questions such as \"where did Carol hit you\" and \"did Carol use her right or left hand\" to clarify the testimony or call its veracity into question. Alice, not having been a direct witness to the act, will not be able to respond to many of these questions.\n\n[united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nEvidence obtained in violation of a constitutional right is inadmissible because admitting it amounts to allowing police or prosecutors to violate people's constitutional rights in order to obtain convictions. Not only does an unconstitutional search itself violate the rights of the person being searched, but so does the use of evidence acquired in such a search.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility and consequences of this evidence in a U.S. court?\n\nA) The evidence is admissible because it proves a serious crime, regardless of how it was obtained.\n\nB) The evidence is inadmissible, but the police can use the information to conduct a new, legal investigation to find alternative evidence.\n\nC) The evidence is inadmissible, and the suspect must be immediately released without any further investigation.\n\nD) The evidence is admissible, but the police officer will face disciplinary action for conducting an illegal search.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In the United States, evidence obtained through an illegal search (violating the Fourth Amendment) is generally inadmissible in court under the exclusionary rule and the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine. This is to protect citizens' constitutional rights and deter law enforcement from conducting illegal searches.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean the suspect goes free without further investigation. The police can use the information they've learned to conduct a new, legal investigation. They can seek a warrant based on other evidence or find alternative ways to legally obtain evidence related to the crime. The goal is to encourage law enforcement to follow proper procedures while still allowing for the pursuit of justice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the seriousness of the crime doesn't override constitutional protections. Option C is too extreme; the suspect isn't automatically released, as further investigation is possible. Option D is incorrect because the evidence would still be inadmissible, even if the officer faces consequences for the illegal search."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42176/definition-of-privileged-information-in-investor-law", "docs_id": 42176, "title": "Definition of privileged information in investor law", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Person X makes a scientific discovery about some new metallic alloy.

I would appreciate pointers on this area of legal finance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is she allowed to short the stocks of some company trading in this other metal, before she publishes her result ?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes. The main exceptions consist of her being under certain form of *fiduciary duty* toward the company of which she is shorting stock, or (2\\) her transactions being motivated by *superior knowledge* resembling *insider trading* or *fraud*.\n\nAbsent an element of fiduciary duty or insider trading, what you describe is an entirely valid *arms\\-length* transaction. Indeed, this happens all the time in financial markets, except that a lawful asymmetry of information may come in forms other than the scientific discovery of new metallic alloys (example: statistical models developed by the entity).\n\nSearching for case law containing the terms in italics will show you how these concepts *supposedly* are applied. For instance, see [*Procter \\& Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust*, 925 F.Supp. 1270 (1996\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19962195925fsupp127012043):\n\n> No fiduciary relationship exists ... \\[where] the two parties were\n>  acting and contracting at arm's length. Moreover, courts have rejected\n>  the proposition that a fiduciary relationship can arise between\n>  parties to a business relationship.\n\n(citations omitted)\n\nYou will notice that the court in *Procter \\& Gamble* points to case law in the sense that a party's superior knowledge imposes on him a contractual duty to disclose that information. But the notion of *superior knowlege* as applied in case law seems typically narrowed down to situations where the seller conceals defects for which he is responsible ([*Haberman v. Greenspan*, 82 Misc.2d 263 (1975\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/197534582misc2d2631269)) or when the concealment resembles fraud. *Haberman* points to a case of fraud \n\n> where (1\\) the seller of a boat before the sale took it from where it\n>  lay and placed it afloat in a dock to prevent the examination of the\n>  bottom which the seller knew to be unsound \\[...]; and (2\\) where the\n>  seller of a log of mahogany turned it in order to conceal a hole\n\n(citations omitted).\n\nThat is different from the *superior knowledge* that a party obtains through the design of superseding techniques.\n\nIt would be extremely inept for a court to rule against a party for trading without first bringing everyone up to speed as to her superseding developments. Not only that would contradict the tenets of trade secrets, perhaps patents, and so forth, but in the context you outline it would create inconsistencies with respect to other financial instruments associated to the same perception of downside risk that is inherent to taking a short position on stocks.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher discovers a new metallic alloy that could potentially decrease the market value of an existing metal.
