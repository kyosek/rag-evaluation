I recently found out that someone who I did not allow to follow me sent me a screenshot of one of my posts. I know that they didn\u2019t hack me, so the next thing I go to is that someone is allowing them to see through the account I did allow to follow me. Is this against the law in any way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, there are no such laws which restrict what a person can see. You have no recourse against the sender. You might be (remotely) able to get the service to expel the friend whom you suspect of being instrumental in the sender seeing your material, if whatever the friend did was contrary to the terms of service. Read the section \"How You Can't Use Instagram\" to see if you think your friend did any of those things.\nYou might think you would be able to sue the service for breach of contract, except that the service never promised that they would protect you from people who might see what you have posted. Also, if you read their TOS, you will see that you actually can't sue them (arbitration clause)\nRealistically, there is nothing you can do other than to retract \"following permission\".",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah posts private content on her Instagram account and only allows select friends to follow her. She discovers that Tom, who is not approved to follow her, has somehow seen and shared a screenshot of her private post. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Sarah can sue Instagram for breach of contract since they failed to protect her private content.\n\nB) Tom's actions are illegal under US law, and Sarah can pursue legal action against him.\n\nC) If Sarah's approved follower shared access with Tom, it would be a criminal offense.\n\nD) There are no specific laws prohibiting Tom from viewing Sarah's content through another account, but Sarah can revoke access from the suspected sharer.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because Instagram's Terms of Service likely include an arbitration clause and do not guarantee absolute privacy protection.\n\nOption B is incorrect as there are no specific US laws prohibiting someone from viewing content shared through another person's account.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while sharing access might violate Instagram's Terms of Service, it is not a criminal offense under US law.\n\nOption D is correct. The law does not specifically prohibit viewing content through another's account. Sarah's best recourse is to identify and revoke access from the follower who may have shared her content, as there are no legal actions she can take against Tom for viewing or sharing the screenshot."

MacDonald on them. For context John A. MacDonald(the first Prime Minister of Canada) was on all $10 bills until 2017, when the new series had the obverse replaced by Viola Desmond, of bills currently in circulation I would say roughly half are of the old variety, just based on my experience.\n\nForgetting all nuances and subtleties of current events and why this man made his decision; is this allowed? The bills are recognized as Canadian Currency, and as a business operating in Canada is there not an obligation to serve all Canadians fairly regardless of the person on the face of their currency, since they definitely did not make that choice themselves?\n\nOf course many places do not accept $100 bills, but that is because of forgery. It seems to be that being able to deny someone business based on when their money was printed is awfully shakey ground, what if something terrible happened to me in 2020 and I refuse all coins minted that year?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Canada may have specific different laws, but in most countries any legal tender must be accepted for payment of a debt. There are subtleties; in the UK for example more than 20 one penny coins are not legal tender. Old coins or banknotes may cease to be legal tender at some point and can only be exchanged at a bank; it seems Canada's $10 bill is nowhere near that point.\n\nThe biggest \"loophole\" is that a business owner doesn't have to allow you to create a debt. Say you go shopping in a supermarket for $40\\. You take your shopping, you now have a $40 debt. You take four $10 bills and hand them over, your debt is paid. At that point this $10 bill must be accepted. However, the shop owner could refuse to let you take the shopping if he doesn't like your bills. So you have no debt, so he doesn't have to accept legal tender as a debt.\n\nIn a restaurant, where you typically eat your food, creating a debt, then he cannot refuse the $10 bill. And in a shop, this will not be good for his business. If my $10 bills are not accepted, then I will take advantage of my right to shop elsewhere.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and implications of this practice?\n\nA) The shop owner is legally obligated to accept all forms of Canadian currency, regardless of who is depicted on the bills.\n\nB) The shop owner can refuse the bills only if the customer has already consumed the pizza, creating a debt.\n\nC) The shop owner can refuse the bills before selling the pizza, but must accept them if the customer has already eaten and owes money.\n\nD) The shop owner has complete discretion to refuse any form of currency at any time, without legal consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, businesses generally must accept legal tender for the payment of a debt. However, they can refuse to enter into a transaction in the first place. In the case of a pizza shop:\n\n- If the customer hasn't yet received or eaten the pizza, the shop owner can refuse to sell to them based on the type of currency they're using. This is because no debt has been created yet.\n- If the customer has already eaten the pizza, creating a debt, the shop owner would be legally obligated to accept the $10 bills as payment, even if they feature John A. MacDonald.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because businesses do have some discretion in refusing currency before a debt is created.\nAnswer B is the opposite of the correct scenario.\nAnswer D is too extreme, as there are legal obligations once a debt is created.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances in currency acceptance laws and the difference between refusing service and refusing payment for an existing debt."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The UK is a common law country. It is a widely held belief of many people that statute Acts of parliament (i.e. most 'laws') only apply with the \"consent of the governed\"; and that one may be a \"free man of the land\" or a \"Scottish Sovereign\".\n\nThey assert that only common law applies to them, i.e. laws surrounding assault, threat or theft. Statutes such as the Road Traffic Act are seen as enacted by the private corporation of 'parliament'; and since they don't consent to being governed, these 'laws' don't apply to them, e.g. speeding.\n\nGoing one step further, free men and other groups of people state they have a right to travel under the Magna Carta, and since Blacks Law defines 'driving' as doing so commercially; they're entitled to drive (\"travel\") non\\-commercially without insurance.\n\nHas such a defence ever held in court? If you look on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=free%20man%20on%20the%20land%20uk) you'll find plenty of people who believe it will.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I haven't found any cases where this defence has worked. I strongly suspect that that's because it never has. Every piece of advice I've read on this unsurprisingly suggests you'd be a fool to attempt to rely on this defence in court, including some cases in which defendants have attempted to rely on it and have failed.\n\nThere are a couple of Freedom of Information requests to the government which state very clearly that it *won't* work:\n\n<https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/statute_law_4>\n<https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/consent_of_the_governed>\n\nThe last link is particularly clear on the matter: every citizen of the UK tacitly consents to be governed, according to Blackstone. And this one makes it even clearer:\n\n[https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/18097/response/56511/attach/html/3/TO%20255452%20TO09%205866\\.doc.html](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/18097/response/56511/attach/html/3/TO%20255452%20TO09%205866.doc.html)\n\nUnder the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty, Acts of Parliament override common law. So it simply wouldn't be possible to argue that you choose to live under the common law alone; no court in the land would allow it, as it's a cornerstone of our legal system that Parliament is sovereign, and therefore that statutes enacted by Parliament will 'trump' the common law. Parliament derives its sovereignty from the fact that the current government is elected and therefore represents the citizens of the UK, and for this reason, Acts of Parliament take priority over case law. On that basis, it wouldn't be possible for a citizen to argue that they choose not to abide by statute: their consent is tacitly assumed. \n\nBased on all the above, then, I would say no: the 'common law' defence will never hold water if relied on in court.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal validity of this claim?\n\nA) This defense has been successfully used in court to avoid statutory obligations like traffic laws.\n\nB) The claim is valid because individuals have the right to choose which laws apply to them under the Magna Carta.\n\nC) While not widely accepted, this defense has occasionally succeeded in lower courts but fails in higher courts.\n\nD) This claim has no legal validity as Acts of Parliament override common law under the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The \"freeman of the land\" or \"Scottish Sovereign\" defense has never been successfully upheld in court. The UK government has explicitly stated through Freedom of Information requests that this defense is not valid. Under the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty, Acts of Parliament take precedence over common law. All UK citizens are considered to have tacitly consented to be governed, and cannot choose to only abide by common law while ignoring statutory law. The idea that individuals can opt out of statutory obligations is not recognized by the UK legal system."

My state does not require an operating agreement, but I read online that it's a good idea to have one to protect your personal finance from liability further that just having an LLC would, so I made an operating agreement. My question is: what do I do to put this agreement on record, besides just keeping it in my personal folder at home? There is nowhere on my state's filing website where I could upload such an agreement. \n\nI'm a sole proprietor with no employees at this time. My concern is that if a question comes up that would put the operating agreement into play, how would people know that the agreement was established originally and I didn't just write a new one to suit the situation? Would the creation date of the PDF file be enough proof? How often is such proof needed? Or am I worrying about this for nothing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Normally operating agreements are kept in private files in a home or office. The law in Iowa legally requires the managers or manager\\-members of an LLC to maintain the records of a limited liability company in an organized fashion including an operating agreement, if any. \n\n(In most countries in continental Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia, these kinds of company records have to be kept instead in the custody of a notary public who has more record keeping responsibilities and education comparable to a lawyer, unlike a U.S. notary public. I don't know what the rule is in Puerto Rico and Louisiana, where the legal systems are based on Spanish and French law respectively, but have been influenced by the law of other U.S. states over the years.)\n\nAn operating agreement can't change the rights of the LLC vis\\-a\\-vis third parties. It is only binding on the members of the company, the company itself, and tax authorities. When you have only one member, the LLC is disregarded for tax purposes, so what the operating agreement says doesn't even affect the tax authorities. So, as a practical matter, there are almost never meaningful disputes over the authenticity or date of execution of an operating agreement in a single member LLC, and if there are, your signature and the date on the original operating agreement will be presumptively valid.\n\nIf you have more than one member, the presence of original signatures from more than one person on the operating agreement will typically be sufficient to authenticate the operating agreement in any dispute that arises between the members, between a member and the company, or with taxing authorities.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to have a copy somewhere as well, because an operating agreement is not like a dollar bill. The physical document isn't something with legal power, the physical document is only evidence of what you have decided to do and your decision is what has the actual legal power. So, as long as you can authenticate a photocopy of the original operating agreement that is just as good as the real thing, and normally identifying the fact that you signed the operating agreement will be sufficient to authenticate it.",

He's concerned about proving the authenticity and original date of the agreement in case of future disputes. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the handling and importance of John's operating agreement?\n\nA) John must file the operating agreement with the Iowa Secretary of State to ensure its legal validity.\nB) John should have the operating agreement notarized by a U.S. notary public to establish its authenticity.\nC) As a single-member LLC, disputes over the operating agreement's authenticity are highly unlikely, and John's signature and date on the document are typically sufficient.\nD) John must upload the operating agreement to the state's filing website to make it officially recognized.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. For a single-member LLC, disputes over the operating agreement's authenticity are rare. John's signature and the date on the original document are generally considered presumptively valid. The operating agreement primarily affects the relationship between the member and the company, and in a single-member LLC, it doesn't even impact tax authorities as the LLC is disregarded for tax purposes. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Iowa does not require filing the operating agreement with the state.\n\nOption B is unnecessary. While notarization can add a layer of authenticity, it's not required for an operating agreement in the U.S., unlike in some other countries.\n\nOption D is incorrect as there is typically no provision for uploading operating agreements to state websites in the U.S.\n\nThe key point is that for a single-member LLC, the operating agreement has limited practical impact on external parties, making authentication concerns less critical."

Imagine the exam question \"what is the third law of thermodynamics?\" There would be no need for the student to give a source, because nobody asked for it and nobody could possibly believe that the student just invented that law.

In academic settings, citation is primarily required when presenting original work or specific ideas attributed to others.

The need for citation arises when there's an implicit or explicit claim of originality, such as in research papers or theses.

The Tribunal could otherwise impose an outcome without hearing your side of the story. If you ultimately paid the rent and the late fees, and the Tribunal didn't know that, you could be unjustly evicted if you don't present your side of the story.\n\nIt could simply be a case, for example, where the landlord confused your non\\-payment with someone else's. But after the Tribunal rules, fixing that mistake is much more difficult than fixing it at a hearing.\n\nIt could be that making two late payments that are cured later is still grounds for eviction under the lease, although I very much doubt it.

It's crucial for the tenant to attend the hearing, even if they admit to paying the rent late. This allows them to present their side of the story and ensure the Tribunal has all the facts before making a decision. Ignoring the hearing (option A) could result in an unjust eviction if the Tribunal makes a ruling without hearing the tenant's perspective. Option B is incorrect because attendance is important regardless of having a \"valid\" excuse. Option C is not advisable, as in-person attendance is more effective for presenting one's case and responding to questions. By attending, the tenant can confirm that the late payment was received and potentially avoid unnecessary eviction proceedings."

No they probably cannot: it would have nothing to do with the matter of your contract or nature of your professional relationship with them.\n\nHowever, if they are in the position of power, they will have discretion in making decisions that will affect you.

While a PI can ask a PhD student or postdoc to perform various tasks, including personal errands, they cannot legally require tasks unrelated to the professional role outlined in the contract. However, the answer notes that refusing such requests, while legally permissible, may have informal consequences due to the PI's position of power and discretion in making decisions that affect the student or postdoc. This reflects the nuanced reality of workplace dynamics in academic settings. Options A and D are incorrect as they represent extreme positions not supported by the information provided. Option B is too restrictive, as it doesn't account for the fact that PIs can ask for tasks beyond those strictly outlined in a contract, even if they cannot require them."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Any intelligent/educated guesses by people who perhaps work more or less full time as lawyers as to how much time it would have taken the judge to research and to write up all of the precedents and to address all of the different aspects of the vexatious party's peculiar quirks would be welcome. Alternatively, are there any mechanisms by which one could possibly learn on a less speculative basis, perhaps by a FOIA request or the local equivalent, for the judge's timesheet entries that might have logged his efforts deliberating and working on that case as a government employee? Or simply writing to him on an informal and candid basis inquiring as to how long this impressively comprehensive reference on vexatious litigation tactics took him to produce?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judges don't have timesheet entries (and are often expressly excluded from FOIA obligations). They get paid salaries and are expected to work hard enough to clear their dockets in reasonable periods of time, however long that takes.\n\nIf you wanted a more direct evidentiary estimate, you could estimate that a judge and his clerk together probably work 90\\-120 hours a week, figure out how many trials and hearings of what length were conducted and deduct that time spent on that from the total, and then divide the remaining hours by the number of opinions one can estimate that the judge wrote (or better yet, a reasonable estimate of the number of pages of opinions that one can estimate that the judge wrote).\n\nTypically, a lot of the legal research grunt work and more boilerplate parts of an opinion are written by the law clerk under some general instructions from the judge, with the judge writing the more substantive sections personally and heavily (or lightly, depending upon the quality of the law clerk) revising the draft opinion as a whole. The longer the opinion, the more likely it is that a substantial portion of it was written by the law clerk.\n\nFor similar kinds of legal writing (e.g. appellate briefs and motions for summary judgment and proposed orders or written closing arguments) one to six hours per page from all professionals working on the document would be in the right ballpark.\n\nJudicial opinions come with some efficiencies, because once a judge decides a point of law or reaches a factual conclusion it doesn't have to be belabored in the same way that a litigant who isn't sure if their reasoning will be persuasive or not must.\n\nBut, judicial opinions also typically have to spell out a greater proportion of legal and factual foundation for the end analysis that isn't hotly contested, will summarize all of the material points from the evidence presented in the case, and will frequently also recap in some detail the arguments made by the advocates for both sides of the case before actually engaging with those arguments in an analysis section.\n\nOn balance, those factors probably pretty much balance out.\n\nIf the judicial opinion is shorter, elegantly written, contains pithy turns of phrase, and/or contains lots of legal citations or factual analysis not raised by either party, it is probably closer to five or six hours per page or more. If the opinion is longer, has a rote and mechanical feel to it, and has very little factual analysis or references to law not mentioned by the parties, it is probably closer to one hour per page or even less. When some of these factors go one way, and other of these factors go the other way, it is probably in between in terms of hours per page.\n\nThis said, sometimes it takes a judge a long time to write an opinion, but the end product is very short and elegant. In these situations, often what happened is that the judge and the judge's clerk spent lots and lots of hours writing a long and detailed first draft, then got an insight that provided a much more efficient and succinct way to reach a resolution to the case. In those circumstances, there would be dozens or scores of hours of work that went into the discarded first draft, only to be superseded by a half a dozen or dozen hours devoted to a much shorter final draft. In those cases, the final draft of the opinion might be ten or twenty hours per page or more once you include the time spent on the discarded draft.\n\nOf course, another factor is that some judges are just more efficient legal writers than others, and some judges have more familiarity with some areas of law than others. A opinion that might take one judge twenty hours to write might take another judge presiding over the very same case and producing an opinion of the same length and quality a hundred hours to write.\n\nThe opinion in *Meads v. Meads* was [176 pages](https://www.slaw.ca/2012/10/01/meads-v-meads-the-vexatious-litigants-case/). If I had to make a best guess, I'd estimate that it probably took about 600 hours to write, probably about two\\-thirds of which was law clerk hours and probably about one\\-third of which was judge time.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A judge has written a 50-page opinion on a complex legal matter involving vexatious litigation tactics. Based on the information provided, what is the most reasonable estimate for the total time spent by the judge and their law clerk in researching and writing this opinion?\n\nA) 25-50 hours\nB) 50-100 hours\nC) 150-300 hours\nD) 400-600 hours\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage suggests that for judicial opinions, a reasonable estimate is one to six hours per page from all professionals working on the document. For a 50-page opinion, this would translate to a range of 50 to 300 hours. However, given that this is a complex matter involving vexatious litigation tactics, it's likely to be on the higher end of this range.\n\nThe passage also mentions that for opinions that are \"shorter, elegantly written, contains pithy turns of phrase, and/or contains lots of legal citations or factual analysis not raised by either party,\" the time could be closer to five or six hours per page or more. Given the complex nature of vexatious litigation tactics, this opinion likely falls into this category.\n\nTherefore, an estimate of 150-300 hours (option C) is the most reasonable choice. This allows for the higher end of the time range per page, accounting for the complexity of the subject matter and the likely need for extensive research and analysis.\n\nOption A (25-50 hours) and B (50-100 hours) are too low given the length and complexity of the opinion. Option D (400-600 hours) is possible but less likely, as it exceeds even the higher end estimates provided in the passage for a 50-page document."

Unauthorized borehole being illegal even if you are the owner of the land. What is the case with rain water in these countries? Are you free to collect that or does that also belong to the government?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Water ownership (rights) in the US is determined by local law, and things can be different for catching rainwater vs. extracting underground water. In Washington state, you have to have a right to take any amount of surface water, but you can take state underground water [without a right](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.44.050) in amounts less that 5,000 gallons per day (non\\-agricultural) or non\\-commercial irrigation of a half\\-acre or less. Collection of rainwater is managed at the county level and depends on purpose. In general (by policy of the Dept. of Ecology which is authorized to interpret the law in this domain), you can collect rainwater if it is used on the property where it is collected, but it must be collected from a structure with a different purpose (e.g. runoff from a roof, not a structure simply designed to scoop up all of the rainwater). Your county can prohib you from drinking it. [This paper](http://courses.washington.edu/ess454/ESS_454/DOCUMENTS_files/WashingtonWaterLaw.pdf) (360pp) emitted by the AG in 2000 gives various details about water law in Washington.\n\nBut ultimately, nobody owns the water. You can temporarily use it, but when you're done with it it can be temporarily used by someone else, and you cannot reclaim the water as your rightful property. Once the water flows out of the state, not even the state government exercises control over the water unless there's relevant inter\\-state law about water usage ([which there is](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-s-2020-2021-preview-interstate-water-rights)).",

It correctly notes that rainwater collection is generally allowed with specific conditions (used on property, collected from structures not primarily designed for collection). It also accurately states the provision for underground water extraction without a right for amounts less than 5,000 gallons per day for non-agricultural purposes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because rainwater collection is managed at the county level, not uniformly at the state level. \n\nOption B is partially correct about the 5,000 gallon limit, but it's too broad - this applies to non-agricultural use, and there are additional provisions for non-commercial irrigation.\n\nOption C is entirely incorrect.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding his ability to legally operate the boat?\n\nA) John can operate the motorboat without any restrictions in both states as long as he is accompanied by an adult.\n\nB) John can operate the motorboat in Illinois if he has a valid Boating Safety Certificate, but in Wisconsin, he must be accompanied by a parent, guardian, or designated adult regardless of certification.\n\nC) John can operate the motorboat in both states if he has completed a boating safety course accepted by the Wisconsin DNR, but in Illinois, he also needs to have the certificate issued by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.\n\nD) John cannot legally operate the motorboat in either state under any circumstances until he turns 16.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex and differing regulations between Illinois and Wisconsin for teenage boat operators. \n\nOption A is incorrect because neither state allows unrestricted operation for 14-year-olds, even with adult supervision.\n\nOption B is incorrect because in Wisconsin, a 14-year-old can operate a motorboat independently if they have completed an accepted boating safety course.\n\nOption C is correct because:\n- In Illinois, John (born after 1998) needs a valid Boating Safety Certificate issued by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.\n- In Wisconsin, a person 12-15 years old can operate a motorboat if they have completed a boating safety course accepted by the Wisconsin DNR.\nThe Wisconsin course would likely be accepted in Illinois, but John would still need the Illinois-issued certificate for full compliance in both states.\n\nOption D is incorrect because both states allow 14-year-olds to operate motorboats under certain conditions."

John earns $200,000 annually, while Mary earns $50,000. Mary has hired an expensive attorney and her legal fees have reached $100,000. The judge is considering an order for John to pay Mary's legal fees. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the judge's decision?\n\nA) The judge must order John to pay all of Mary's legal fees because he is the wealthier spouse.\nB) The judge cannot order John to pay any of Mary's legal fees because they are excessive.\nC) The judge will consider various factors, including the parties' relative circumstances and financial resources, to determine a just and reasonable award.\nD) The judge must cap Mary's legal fees at 50% of the difference between John and Mary's annual incomes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to California Family Code \u00a72030-2034, the court has discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs. The judge must consider what is \"just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties.\" This includes taking into account the need for the award to enable each party to adequately present their case, as well as the parties' financial resources. The court is not obligated to pay all of the less wealthy spouse's legal fees (ruling out option A), nor is there a specific cap based on income difference (ruling out option D). While the fees may seem excessive, the court has the discretion to award partial fees if deemed appropriate, so option B is also incorrect. The judge will weigh various factors to make a fair determination, which may result in a partial award or no award at all, depending on the specific circumstances of the case."

In the United States, it is legal and common practice for a contractor (Company B) to bill their client (Company A) for hours worked by their own subcontractors (Individual C) as if they were the contractor's own employees. This is one of the key distinctions between a contractor relationship and an employment relationship. Contractors have the ability to subcontract work and still bill the client for those hours. There is no legal requirement to disclose the use of subcontractors unless specified in the contract between Company A and Company B. Options A and D are incorrect because they misstate the legal situation, while option B adds an unnecessary condition that is not typically required by law."

While I was quickly told that wasn't going to happen, I have to wonder what could happen if he was actually named that.\n\nFor the less technical, this name contains what is called \na SQL injection attack. If the name is entered into a poorly designed SQL system, it could potentially execute a sql command and drop all tables (i.e. cause the organization's IT manager to have a somewhat bad day, depending on how good their backups are).\n\nSo assuming I am able to get this name on his birth certificate and get his SSN assigned under that name (let us assume that the government has been able to build their system such that this name can be handled without issue), what would happen if his name fulfills its intended purpose when signing him up for day care? In that while signing little Bobby tables up for day care, his name wiped out all their data, and because of their lack of a good IT policy, they have no backups, causing no small amount of trouble for the day care.\n\nWhat would I be charged with or sued for in this case?\n\nI assume I am on the hook for some sort of malicious destruction of data or somehow liable for the loss of data. \n\nWould this being his name afford any sort of protection? Or would the fact that it was selected intentionally to cause damage be an issue? \n\nJurisdiction: United States, pick any state you feel like.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your kid is not in trouble; he's a minor. You're in trouble.\n\nA criminal case for the charges a prosecutor would bring, i.e. destruction of property (the data) or for a relevant cyber or computer crime (malware, etc.), and/or a civil case for damages due to the destruction of the data would both hinge on one point: the concept of *intent*. See [intent \\- Wex Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intent) and [Civil Law vs. Criminal Law: The Differences \\| Rasmussen College](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/justice-studies/blog/civil-law-versus-criminal-law/).\n\nDid you knowingly intend to cause damage or data loss with the structure of the name? It's pretty clear you did. The structure of a name that can invoke an SQL command is not in any sense a standard name in spelling or format or punctuation. So how would you convince the jury or judge that you had no intent when you named your kid?\n\nThe possible poor design of a data system that didn't sanitize inputs is no defense. Saying *the door was unlocked so I assume the homeowners didn't care if I trashed their house* will get you laughed into jail or on the hook for a stiff civil judgement.",

The key factor here is intent. By deliberately choosing a name designed to cause data loss through SQL injection, the parent demonstrates clear intent to cause harm. This could lead to criminal charges such as destruction of property or computer crimes, as well as civil liability for damages resulting from the data loss. The fact that the name was legally registered does not provide protection against the intentional misuse of that name. The child, being a minor, would not be held responsible. The daycare's poor data security practices do not excuse the parent's intentional act to exploit those vulnerabilities."

While the Sexual Offences Act 2003 criminalizes sexual activity with a person who has a mental disorder that impedes their ability to consent, Article 8 rights must be considered, especially in cases of long-term, loving relationships. This consideration helps balance the public interest in prosecution against the individuals' rights to private and family life. It doesn't automatically override charges (A) or have no relevance (B), nor is it limited to cases where both individuals have mental disorders (D).

They submit their resignation on October 1st, 2023. The last week of December 2023 includes Christmas Day (Monday) and Boxing Day (Tuesday) as bank holidays. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the employee's last working day and payment?\n\nA) The employee's last working day will be December 29th, 2023, and they will be paid until this date, including the bank holidays.\n\nB) The employee's last working day will be January 1st, 2024, as the notice period extends due to the bank holidays.\n\nC) The employee's last working day will be December 31st, 2023, but they will only be paid until December 29th, 2023.\n\nD) The employee's last working day will be December 27th, 2023, as bank holidays and weekends are not counted in the notice period.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: In English law, notice periods are calculated in calendar months, not working days. The 3-month notice period starting from October 1st, 2023, would end on December 31st, 2023. However, since December 31st is a Sunday, the last working day would be Friday, December 29th, 2023. The employee is entitled to be paid for the entire notice period, including weekends and bank holidays that fall within this time. Therefore, they would be paid until December 29th, 2023, which includes the Christmas and Boxing Day bank holidays."

Based on the \"minimum contacts\" test mentioned in Worldwide Volkswagen, it would be difficult for a California court to establish personal jurisdiction over Tom if he has no significant connections to California.\n\n2. The case would likely be litigated in New York, where the events occurred and where the defendant resides, satisfying both personal jurisdiction and venue requirements.\n\n3. In federal court, the law of the state where the court is located (in this case, New York) is typically used to decide substantive issues.\n\n4.

It seems that there could be a number of potential issues here:\n\n* Invasion of privacy (assuming the sender hasn't given permission to the recipient to do so)\n* False light (out of context, the texts could be misconstrued)\n* Copyright (as I understand, recipients have ownership of the physical message, but not the content \\- and messages are only content with no real physical side)\n\nDo any of these ideas hold merit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Invasion of privacy and false light torts would probably not be applicable here. Very few states have adopted the false light tort because of its conflict with First Amendment principles and there was no agreement or even request to keep the text private.\n\nThe copyright issue is trickier. First all, the TOS may provide that the copyright belongs to the text service provider or that there is a license. But, even in the absence of an express license, sending someone a message which is equivalent to sending them a letter, probably gives rise to an implied license that the person to whom it is sent can use the message that arises merely from the act of sending it without restriction or qualification. Implied license and fair use also heavily overlap.\n\nPublishing the text exactly as it was sent to you protects you from defamation liability because it is true.\n\nOn the whole it would be extremely unlikely for there to be any legal liability for publishing a text from someone that they sent to you. \n\nOf course, one can imagine exceptions. \n\nIf the person receiving the text was in an attorney\\-client relationship, or priest\\-parishioner making confession relationship, or was communicating regarding classified national security matters, or there was a non\\-disclosure agreement in place, among other possibilities, an evidentiary privilege and duty of confidentiality could apply and disclosing the material without the permission of the privilege holder could breach a duty of confidentiality and give rise to liability.\n\nIf the picture was a nude picture of a minor, there could be a criminal and/or civil liability issue, and some states have also made posting \"revenge porn\" a criminal offense and/or a basis for civil liability.\n\nIf the disclosure was effectively a way to facilitate insider trading that could be a problem.\n\nIf the contents of the text were accurately transmitted but known to be false and were disseminated without disclosure of its falsity for the purpose of defrauding a third party, that could be a problem.\n\nBut, no facts that obviously flag any exception are identified in the question. The mere fact that the posting may be embarrassing, or hurt someone's reputation, or was made without someone's express consent, in general, would not be a basis for liability.",

The message contains confidential company information, which creates a duty of confidentiality. By sharing this information publicly, John may be breaching this duty and could face legal consequences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while an implied license might exist for personal messages, it doesn't extend to sharing confidential business information.\n\nOption B is incorrect because invasion of privacy typically wouldn't apply to text messages sent willingly, even if shared without permission.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the First Amendment doesn't protect the disclosure of confidential information in breach of a duty."

I have made attempts to contact the leasing office and I typically I get either voicemail, or promises without a time frame or urgency.\n\nI called the office and was told \"someone is coming out\" and then never hears back from them. Typically, this can go for days, requiring me to do follow ups to get anything. I would like to know how easily I can get out of my lease agreement.\n\nI reviewed my lease agreement and it's, of course, vague saying I have to allow a \"reasonable time for them to repair\" it doesn't specify what a reasonable time may be. So under U.S. laws, what's considered a reasonable time for leasing agreements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Reasonableness\" is a deliberately vague and flexible term. It does not \\-\\- and is not meant to \\-\\- have any precise definition.\n\nInstead, it is meant to be highly case specific. A \"reasonable\" time to repair will therefore be longer or shorter, depending on the circumstances. If you want a scratch in your countertop repaired, a \"reasonable\" time is probably a lot longer than if you want the plumbing repaired. And a reasonable time to repair the plumbing may itself vary with the availability of vendors, supplies, etc.\n\nLikewise with the air conditioning. It's probably a lot more reasonable to wait three months to fix the AC if it breaks down in December than in if it breaks down in the summer, which it sounds like is what's happened to you.\n\nBased on the timing, I'd feel very comfortable arguing that the leasing company has breached the agreement. The \"reasonableness\" standard is meant to give the landlord adequate time to respond and get the job done properly, but it can't be stretched indefinitely as seems to be happening here, to the point where you have essentially lost the entire benefit of air conditioning by sitting in a hot apartment for the entirety of the summer.\n\nNew York City has pretty strong tenant\\-protection laws, so I suspect that you would have the option of hiring someone to handle the repairs yourself and then deducting your costs from the rent you owe.",

The concept of \"reasonable time\" for repairs is intentionally vague and context-dependent. In this case, three months of air conditioning issues during summer likely exceeds what would be considered reasonable. New York City has strong tenant protection laws, and in such situations, tenants may have the right to arrange for repairs themselves and deduct the cost from rent. Options A and B are incorrect as they misrepresent the concept of \"reasonable time\".

In certain circumstances this may even be constitutionally required. See *Sheppard v. Maxwell*, 384 U.S. 333, 363 (U.S. 1966\\) (\"where there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity\"). But, there's no mechanism to move a state criminal trial to another state.\n\nA cousin of the scenario you're talking about is where D has committed crimes in multiple states. In such a situation the prosecutors from different states (and also the federal system) may meet and co\\-ordinate their strategies, and part of that will be deciding who charges what and who goes first. An example of this is the DC sniper case, which I remember pretty vividly because I grew up in the area.

According to the information provided, there is no mechanism to move a state criminal trial to another state. Change of venue is possible, but it is limited to moving the trial from one county to another within the same state. This is sometimes constitutionally required to ensure a fair trial, especially in cases with extensive pre-trial publicity that might prejudice potential jurors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because interstate transfers are not possible for state criminal trials. Option C is also incorrect for the same reason; even agreement between governors cannot authorize such a transfer. Option D is incorrect because state criminal cases cannot be arbitrarily moved to federal courts, and changing the court system (from state to federal) is not the same as changing venue.\n\nThe case of Sheppard v.

According to the information provided, German law strongly supports the concept that if you work somewhere, you are employed there. This means the employee could potentially sue Company B to obtain a proper employment contract, even if the original contract was signed with Company A. The arrangement, while potentially questionable, doesn't necessarily mean the employee is not legally employed at all. The law recognizes actual work performance in determining employment status. However, the situation does raise red flags and the employee should consider consulting with a works council (Betriebsrat) or trade union for further guidance. Options A and D are too extreme, while B doesn't account for the actual work situation and documentation provided by Company B."

As a concerned citizen affected by the emissions, which UK authority should you contact first to address this potentially misleading claim?\n\nA) Advertising Standards Authority\nB) Local Trading Standards office\nC) Department for Transport\nD) Environmental Health Department\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the UK Government guidance on making green claims, Trading Standards is the appropriate authority to contact for advice on dealing with complaints related to potentially misleading environmental claims. The question specifies that the advertising is on the product itself, which rules out the Advertising Standards Authority. The local Trading Standards office can enforce consumer protection legislation and advise on how to handle such complaints. The Department for Transport and Environmental Health Department, while related to transportation and environmental issues, are not the primary authorities for addressing misleading product claims. Therefore, the correct first step would be to contact the local Trading Standards office."

The criminal law of Canada recognizes no middle category called \u201clegal impossibility\u201d. Because Mr. Dynar attempted to do the impossible but did not attempt to commit an imaginary crime, he can only have attempted to do the \u201cfactually impossible\u201d. For this reason, Mr. Dynar\u2019s proposal that s. 24(1\\) criminalizes only attempts to do the factually impossible does not help him.\n\nAn example of a \"factual impossibility\" cited by the court was \"impossibility due to inadequate means... For example, A tries to kill B by shooting at him from too great a distance or by administering too small a dose of poison.\"\n\n> That this man\u2019s design is premised on a mistaken understanding of the facts does not make it any less his design. A mistaken belief cannot be eliminated from the description of a person\u2019s mental state simply because it is mistaken.\n\n### Example 1: the curse\n\nIn your examples, the person who took steps to kill a person via inadequate or factually impossible means could be guilty of an attempt. Of course, this is subject to proof of the required mental state (intention to kill) beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n### Example 2: hanging out\n\nHowever, the *actus reus* of attempt in Canada is that the accused must have taken \"some step towards the commission of the offence attempted going beyond mere acts of preparation.\" You haven't described anything about the person who hangs out with a militia that would constitute a step beyond a mere act of preparation.",

The sorcerer genuinely believes this ritual will cause the neighbor's death. Under Canadian law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential criminal charges?\n\nA) The sorcerer cannot be charged with attempted murder because magic is not a factually possible means of causing death.\n\nB) The sorcerer can only be charged with a lesser offense, such as harassment or threatening behavior, as no physical harm was possible.\n\nC) The sorcerer can be charged with attempted murder, as the impossibility of the method does not preclude an attempt conviction if the intent to kill is proven.\n\nD) The sorcerer cannot be charged with any crime, as thoughts and beliefs alone are not punishable under Canadian law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Canadian legal precedent set in United States v. Dynar, the fact that the chosen means (in this case, magic) could never have actually killed the target does not preclude an attempt conviction. The court recognizes \"factual impossibility\" as a valid basis for attempt charges, which includes \"impossibility due to inadequate means.\" The key factors are the accused's intention to commit the crime and taking steps beyond mere preparation, regardless of whether the chosen method could actually succeed. If prosecutors can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the sorcerer genuinely intended to kill the neighbor and took concrete steps to do so (performing the ritual), they could potentially secure an attempted murder conviction, despite the impossibility of the method."

I've always assumed that the birth certificate has always been a simple record keeping device used by the government as a basis for identity and to prevent frauds. One uses a birth certificate to establish one's identity and obtain other forms of identification.\n\nIs there any kernel of historical truth in the explanation given by organized commercial pseudolegal argument (as meads Vs. Meads dubs them) proponents of the BC as originally a type of financial device?\n\nIncidentally I was reading the other day about indentured servitude contracts and they seem to be more along the lines of what these movements are describing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in the United Kingdom is a nineteenth\\-century innovation, based on the previous practice of keeping parish records of baptisms, marriages, and burials. The history is different but parallel in England (and Wales) and Scotland.\n\nWhat the churches were originally trying to do was to record information about their own ceremonies, because there are religious consequences to being baptized, married, etc. Civil law follows: you might have to prove in court that you were validly married to such\\-and\\-such a person, now deceased, and therefore had the right to live in his home as his widow.\n\nThe parish system, because of its general utility, was regulated by legislation. In England, it was made mandatory in all parishes in the middle of the sixteenth century (although in practice, this happened at different rates in different places). Legislation in the following centuries covered the manner of keeping records, penalties for non\\-compliance, and fees for registration. For example, by the late seventeenth century you would have to pay sixpence to register the birth of each child, and a massive 40 shillings if you failed to do so within five days of the event. Registration also served as a device to give nonconformists an incentive to join the established churches, as there was no secular way to prove age, and few ways to marry.\n\nWith liberalisation of religious strictures in the nineteenth century, the civil system began in England and Wales in 1837, and in Scotland in 1855\\. Under the Acts ([6 Will 4 c.33](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1836_(33)_Registration_of_Births_%26c._A_bill_for_registering_Births_Deaths_and_Marriages_in_England), [17\\&18 Vict c.80](http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)&active=yes&mno=4048)), records were kept by governmental authority, with no religious qualification required. This was helpful for non\\-Anglicans or non\\-Presbyterians wanting to live their lives, and helpful for the government for having a more complete set of records for the population in general.\n\nCurrently, registration of births is free, but there are various penalties for not doing it in time, and it costs money to get copies of birth certificates. The fees are not based on any estimate of lifelong earning power or anything of the kind. There was a *very brief* period (1695 to 1706\\) where in order to fund a war with France, the government levied a variable rate tax on parish register entries. The rates depended on the degree of the person registered. It was abolished due to its considerable unpopularity, also resulting in low rates of compliance and therefore revenue gained.\n\nThe law, [An Act for granting to his Majesty certaine rates and duties upon Marriages Births and Burials and upon Batchelors and Widowers for the terme of Five yeares for carrying on the Warr against France with Vigour](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol6/pp568-583), 6\\&7 Wm\\&Mary c.6, now called the \"Duties on Marriages, etc. Act 1694\", set out the following for births:\n\n* Paupers: Free\n* Most people: Two shillings\n* Aristocrats: Between twelve and thirty pounds depending on rank, and with a surcharge for the eldest son, in addition to the two shillings.\n* Baronets, knights, lawyers, academics, gentlemen and senior clergy: Between one and five pounds, plus the two shillings.\n* Anyone not included in the above but who is rich: Twelve shillings.\n\nSimilar fees were charged for marriages and so on. I believe this is the only time in UK law when there were differential fees for registration depending on the status of the parents. The scale was presumably based on the idea that wealthier people could afford to pay more. There were no legal consequences for the *child* as a result of the different fee paid, except insofar as they would be disadvantaged later in life if they were not properly registered.\n\nThe law was repealed and the \"Warr against France\" has also been over for a long time.\n\nAs usual, the \"sovereign citizen\" conception is completely bogus. There is not, and has never been, any notion of a birth certificate being a financial instrument. The confusion may be due to the word *instrument* being used for lots of different kinds of official documents, as well as a general boneheadedness about how the law works. A birth certificate is a convenient way to prove the circumstances of your birth, and for the government to collect statistics. Indeed, a paper copy of a certificate is just a way to make the management simpler \\- you can get many copies or none, at your option \\- since it saves effort compared to inspecting the centralised registers themselves.",

But, what if someone's personal opinion is that a company is bad in some way, and then the company loses money as a result of that person voicing that opinion? Can they be sued? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As I understand it, libel is construed as untruthful statements that\n>  damage a company in some way. But, what if someone's personal opinion\n>  is that a company is bad in some way, and the company loses money as a\n>  result? Can they be sued?\n\nLibel is a statement that tends to damage someone's reputation that is made to someone other than the subject of the statement. Truth was historically a defense to liability for libel (although in many circumstances in the United States is has been made part of the prima facie case that must be proved by an accuser).\n\nOrdinarily a libel must be a statement of fact, and a mere opinion is not actionable. But, sometimes an opinion so clearly implies a closely related statement of fact in a particular context that the implied statement of fact arising from the statement of opinion, if false, is actionable.\n\nAnybody can be sued, but they will not have a viable cause of action and their suit will be dismissed, if the alleged statement is truly a statement of opinion, even if it has consequences for a person's reputation and causes them economic harm.\n\nFor example, if I say that Calvin Klein clothes look better than American Outfitter's clothes, and people care about my opinion and purchase fewer American Outfitter's clothes, I have not committed actionable libel (even if I don't sincerely believe what I said since it is an opinion either way), even though my statement harmed the company that makes American Outfitter clothes.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal action by XYZ Clothing?\n\nA) XYZ Clothing can successfully sue the blogger for libel because the statement caused financial harm to the company.\n\nB) The blogger is protected from any legal action because they prefaced their statement with \"In my opinion.\"\n\nC) XYZ Clothing can sue the blogger, but the case will likely be dismissed as the statement is primarily an expression of opinion.\n\nD) The blogger can be held liable for libel if XYZ Clothing can prove that the materials used are not actually cheap.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The blogger's statement is primarily an expression of opinion about the quality and appeal of XYZ Clothing's products. Even though it resulted in financial harm to the company, opinions are generally protected from libel claims. While XYZ Clothing could attempt to sue, such a case would likely be dismissed because:\n\n1. The statement is presented as a personal opinion rather than a factual claim.\n2. Terms like \"cheap\" and \"uninspired\" are subjective and not easily proven false.\n3. The recommendation (or lack thereof) is clearly presented as the blogger's personal stance.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because causing financial harm alone is not sufficient for a successful libel claim if the statement is opinion-based. Answer B is overly simplistic; merely prefacing a statement with \"In my opinion\" doesn't automatically protect against all potential legal action. Answer D misunderstands the nature of opinion statements; even if the company could prove their materials aren't cheap, the overall statement would still likely be protected as opinion."

The car passes the cyclist leaving only 1.2 meters of space. As the car passes, the cyclist extends their arm to signal a turn and accidentally scrapes the side of the car. Who is liable for the damage in this scenario?\n\nA) The cyclist is fully liable as they extended their arm and made contact with the car.\nB) The driver is fully liable as they did not provide the legally required passing distance.\nC) Both the cyclist and driver share equal liability for the incident.\nD) Neither party is liable as it was an unavoidable accident.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Australian road safety regulations, motor vehicles are required to give cyclists 1.5 meters of clear berth on roads with speed limits higher than 60 km/h. In this scenario, the speed limit was 70 km/h, but the car only left 1.2 meters of space. This means the driver did not comply with the legal passing distance requirement. Even though the cyclist's arm made contact with the car, the primary fault lies with the driver for not providing sufficient space when overtaking.

Their EULA says that I cannot create derivative works. So does that mean when I uninstall these existing virtual machine programs from my computer and delete their installers I can then create derivative works?\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Virtual machines have been around for quite some time now. The first commercially offered VM system was from IBM with their System/360 but it was based on idea from MIT that were funded by DARPA. My patent search skills are not that great but even if this was patented then, in the early 1960's, those patents have long since expired. So the basic idea of a virtual machine is now unencumbered.\n\nThat being said, VMs are an area of ongoing research and development today and many aspects of VM operation have been patented. If you are going to develop a new and improved VM system you will want to do your own research to ensure that the parts of your system that you believe are unique have not already been patented by someone else. If your ideas are novel you may want to consider patenting them.\n\nYour questions:\n\n> So, is the general software concept of creating, managing, and running\n> virtual machines legally\\-protected?\n\nThey are protected the same as any other invention. Through patents and/or trade secrets. There are any number of companies today that hold various patents on various aspects of VM systems.\n\n> How come there are a lot of virtual machine software out there that\n> basically do the same thing but are not in legal trouble?\n\nThe same way as any other invention. They either license the patented technologies or they find a non\\-infringing alternative and probably patent that themselves. In many cases the leading companies in theses area may have cross\\-licensing agreements.\n\n> Also, how can I know if the feature I am planning to include will not\n> lead me to legal trouble?\n\nYou do your homework and determine if your ideas are already covered by someone else's patents. Or you simply proceed and wait to hear from someone that thinks you are infringing.\n\n> Their EULA says that I cannot create derivative works.\n\nThe EULA is still in effect regardless of whether the software is currently installed or not. (In my opinion at least.) So its terms bind you regardless. But what is a \"derivative work\"? Just because it's something that works similarly to another application doesn't make it a \"derivative\". Usually the EULA will define what they mean by derivative work and it almost always involves using the source code to create your own version or flavor of the original application.\n\nYou'll want to be sure you are creating an original application and not a derivative of someone else's application.",

New Mexico does not impose a separate entity level tax on LLCs that are taxed for federal income tax purposes as partnerships rather than as corporations and its income instead flows through to the individual tax returns of the members of IRS Form K\\-1\\. LLCs taxed at the federal level as corporations must file a state corporate income tax return in New Mexico if it does business there as well.\n\nThe New Mexico tax filings are confidential. But New Mexico tax officials have a right to disclosure of an LLCs owners from the LLC.\n\nThe ownership of an LLC is [not disclosed on an application to register as a foreign LLC in California](https://bpd.cdn.sos.ca.gov/llc/forms/llc-5.pdf). [California's Franchise Tax Board](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/business/types/limited-liability-company/index.html) taxes limited liability companies doing business in the state on a crude, entity level income basis in which one of five possible flat fees is imposed based upon the California source income of the entity. In addition, owners of LLCs taxed as partnerships must report their share of California income from the LLC on California state income tax returns, and LLCs taxed as corporations must pay California state corporate income taxes.\n\nThe California tax filings are confidential. But California tax officials have a right to disclosure of an LLCs owners from the LLC.\n\nThere is (or recently was) litigation in California seeking to obtain disclosure of LLC ownership in a freedom of information act request (or the state equivalent). But it is unlikely to prevail because the only place that California maintains such records (and even then, not in an organized fashion) is in its tax records which are declared by statute to be confidential.\n\nThe privacy protections for owners of LLCs are essentially identical in California and New Mexico.\n\nI am not aware of any U.S. state that makes ownership of an LLC a matter of public record, although I don't claim to know definitively the state of the LLC laws on that point in every single U.S. state.\n\nThe owners of an LLC must be disclosed to U.S. tax officials in connection with filing IRS Form 1065 with Schedule K\\-1 sent to the owners and filed with their personal form 1040s, if it is taxed as a partnership, and in connection IRS Form 1120 if it is taxed as a corporation, but this information is confidential.",

According to the information provided, both New Mexico and California require LLCs to disclose their ownership to tax authorities, but this information remains confidential. Neither state makes LLC ownership a matter of public record. \n\nOption A is incorrect because registering as a foreign LLC in California does not make the ownership public record. \n\nOption B is incorrect because, while the LLC maintains public anonymity, it must disclose ownership to tax authorities in both states. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the LLC must disclose ownership to tax authorities in both states, not just New Mexico.\n\nThis question tests understanding of LLC anonymity across state lines and the balance between government reporting requirements and public disclosure."

Original tenant is still responsible to the landlord in subletting. Assigning is where original tenant is completely excused, and the person replacing him takes over all responsibilities and deals directly with the landlord.\n\nI think in BC subleasing is considered the same as subletting.",

The sub-tenant would pay Sarah, who would then pay the landlord.\n\nB) Assigning the lease is the best option for Sarah. In an assignment, the new tenant takes over all rights and responsibilities under the original tenancy agreement, dealing directly with the landlord.

In this scenario, there is a direct contradiction between the company's stated policy and the terms on their invoice. This creates ambiguity in the contract terms. In contract law, when there is ambiguity in terms that were drafted by one party (in this case, TechSoft), the ambiguity is typically construed against the drafter. This principle, known as \"contra proferentem,\" would likely lead to an interpretation favoring the customer.

In particular \"market makers\" are permitted to take actions that would not be allowed to others. Beyond that, if the seller is in fact able to \"cover\" the short sale, and was not deceptive, there may be no violation.\n\nSo let us look at a more official source. [\"Key Points About Regulation SHO\"](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) is an official DEC page on the regulation, It explains the history of the regulation, and summarizes the specific rules that make up Regulation SHO.\n\nThe page reads:\n\n> Although the vast majority of short sales are legal, abusive short sale practices are illegal. For example, it is prohibited for any person to engage in a series of transactions in order to create actual or apparent active trading in a security or to depress the price of a security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others. Thus, short sales effected to manipulate the price of a stock are prohibited.\n> \n> \n> \u201cNaked\u201d short selling is not necessarily a violation of the federal securities laws or the Commission\u2019s rules. Indeed, in certain circumstances, \u201cnaked\u201d short selling contributes to market liquidity. For example, broker\\-dealers that make a market in a security generally stand ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price, even when there are no other buyers or sellers. Thus, market makers must sell a security to a buyer even when there are temporary shortages of that security available in the market. (*citation omitted*)\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> *Rule 203(b)(1\\) and (2\\) \u2013 Locate Requirement.* Regulation SHO requires a broker\\-dealer to have reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any equity security. ...(*citation omitted*)\n> \n> \n> *Rule 204 \u2013 Close\\-out Requirement.* Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency\\[8] to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. ... If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T\\+6\\. ... Rule 203(b)(3\\) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as \u201cthreshold securities,\u201d if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> * *Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement*. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, **except for short sales by market makers engaged in *bona fide* market making**.

This allows them to provide liquidity to the market, even in situations of temporary shortages. However, they are still subject to close-out requirements if they fail to deliver. Option C most accurately reflects this scenario, where the market maker's actions would likely be considered legal if they can demonstrate it was part of legitimate market making activities, even without locating the stock beforehand or immediately delivering at settlement. Options A and B involve failures to comply with settlement requirements without the market making exception. Option D describes a standard short sale process that would be legal for any participant, not specifically addressing the market maker exemption for naked short selling."

It seems reasonable to say a 100,000\\+ LOC codebase written by in\\-house developers belongs to the company they work for. You could stretch further and say \"this function is mine\". It might be a very specialised function using an algorithm you created to perform some task, so really yes, that is yours because no one else created it, you did.\n\nBut what about boilerplate code and small snippets? What about \"Hello World\"? Millions of programmers have written a Hello World [since the early 70's](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12785204/4742941), but you couldn't say because you wrote one that you 'own' Hello World in your chosen language.\n\nWhat factors distinguish code classed as something that can be owned from code \"anyone could have written\"?

In other jurisdictions laws are, of course, different (though usually not drastically so.)]\n\nIn the US there are (at least) three different bodies of law that might apply to code: copyright, patents, trade secrets.\n\nCopyright covers original *expression*. Anything you write is automatically, immediately protected under copyright. The copyright applies to the code itself, and anything \"derived\" from that code. It's up to the courts to decide exactly what \"derived\" means. One case that's long been viewed as a landmark in this area is Gates Rubber v. Bando Chemicals. The [Court of Appeals for the tenth Circuit decision](http://digital-law-online.info/cases/28PQ2D1503.htm) includes a section titled: \"The Test for Determining Whether the Copyright of a Computer Program Has Been Infringed.\" Note that you can register a copyright, and that can be worthwhile, such as helping recover some damages you can't otherwise.\n\nPatents are quite different from copyrights. Where a copyright covers expression of an idea, a patent covers a specific invention. Rather than being awarded automatically, a patent has to be applied for, and awarded only after the patent office has determined that there's no relevant prior art to prevent it from being awarded. A patent, however, covers things like somebody else independently discovering/inventing what's covered by the patent.\n\nA trade secret could (at least theoretically) apply to some process or procedure embodied in the code. A trade secret mostly applies to a situation where (for example) you're trying to form an alliance with some other company, and in the process tell them things you don't tell the general public. If you've identified the fact that what you're telling them is a trade secret, and they then tell a competitor (or the general public, etc.) or more generally use that information in any way other than the originally intended purpose, it could constitute a trade secret violation. As a side\\-note: patents and copyright fall under federal law, so they're basically uniform nation\\-wide. Trade secrets mostly fall under state law, so the exact details vary by state.\n\nAbsent a reason to believe otherwise, I'd guess your interest here is primarily in copyright infringement. The key here would be showing that one piece of code was derived from the other. That is, it specifically would *not* apply in a case where there were only a limited number of ways of doing something, so anybody who wanted to do that had to use one of those ways. Since this would not indicate actual derivation, it would not indicate copyright violation.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer, Alice, creates a unique algorithm for data compression and implements it in code while working for TechCorp. After leaving TechCorp, Alice starts her own company and wants to use a similar algorithm in her new product. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications?\n\nA) Alice can freely use the algorithm and code in her new product as long as she rewrites it from scratch, since algorithms cannot be copyrighted.\n\nB) Alice cannot use the algorithm or any similar code in her new product, as TechCorp likely owns both the copyright and patent rights to the algorithm and its implementation.\n\nC) Alice can use the general concept of the algorithm but must be careful not to copy or derive her new code from the specific implementation she wrote at TechCorp, as that would likely infringe on TechCorp's copyright.\n\nD) Alice can use the algorithm and code without any legal concerns, as long as TechCorp did not specifically file for a patent on the algorithm.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the different types of intellectual property protection that can apply to software. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Algorithms themselves are generally not copyrightable, but their specific implementations in code are.\n2. Copyright protects the expression of ideas (the specific code), not the ideas themselves (the general algorithm).\n3. Alice needs to be cautious about not copying or deriving her new code from her previous work at TechCorp, as that would likely infringe on TechCorp's copyright.\n4. Patents are not automatically granted and require a separate application process, so without specific information about a patent, we cannot assume patent protection applies.\n5. Trade secrets don't apply here as the scenario doesn't mention any confidentiality agreements or secret processes.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the legal situation and ignore copyright implications. Option B is too restrictive, assuming both copyright and patent protection without evidence of the latter."

We plan to go to the HR department about this soon. I will detail out more context below, but to cut to the chase I just want to know a) Has the Lead actually broken any laws by encouraging my wife to quit in order to be with family and b) are there any other obvious next steps we could be taking?\n\nNo serious adverse actions have been taken against my wife yet other than that her superiors had a performance meeting with her and treated her as though she was guilty of doing a poor job, and now they are monitoring her closely.\n\nBefore meeting\n==============\n\n* Wife tells Lead of pregnancy.\n* Lead meets with wife to encourage her to quit and spend time with family.\n* Lead visibly upset when my wife explains she wants to keep working.\n* Wife later inquires whether there were any issues with her performance. Lead says no and specifically clarifies that the conversation was really only about her concern for my wife's well being with raising her children.\n* Lead asks direct reports to video tape themselves working with the idea that they will receive constructive criticism.\n* At the same time Lead shared constructive criticism with my wife, criticisms were also emailed to their Supervisor, before any opportunity was given to make improvements based on criticisms.\n* Lead met privately with Supervisor and scheduled performance meeting with my wife.\n\nDuring meeting\n==============\n\n* Lead's Supervisor asks if my wife had since shown improvement. Lead responds yes.\n* One a prior day Lead instructed my wife to observe Lead as Lead worked and take notes. In the meeting, Supervisor berates my wife for taking notes instead of working. Lead fails to speak up and share that my wife was following direct instructions.\n* Lead and Supervisor give criticism over petty points found in work video my wife was asked to make. Imagine reprimanding an Algebra teacher for not stopping to teach students basic addition every time they made an adding mistake (and imagine that many of same teacher's students from prior years generally qualified for advanced classes). It was something that, if my wife had stopped to do it, they could have just as easily accused her of not accomplishing the thing which she was actively working on. Basically, it feels very much like the whole thing was a planned attempt to contrive evidence against her rather than a genuine attempt to provide constructive criticism.\n* Other points of criticism were points that both Lead and other coworkers have struggled with at various times.\n* Lead and Supervisor asked wife what she will do to improve her performance, but did not provide any guidance as to what steps she should take. Instead they will continue to monitor her more in order to provide further guidance (or fabricate more \"evidence\", depending on your point of view).\n\nAfter meeting\n=============\n\n* Wife asks lead if she wants her there next year. Lead responds that she does not.\n* Wife says it would be hard to find another job while pregnant. Lead encourages her not to share that she is pregnant.\n* Lead says she is tired of holding my wife's hand for past 3 years, despite having told her very recently she was doing fine and having repeatedly told her she was doing a good job over the past years.\n\nOther notes:\n============\n\n* In addition to Lead's own repeated approval of my wife's performance up until now, my wife has a great work history at same job at other workplaces, consistently performing better than her predecessors everywhere she has worked.\n* Even her current performance is better than that of those who came before her at this workplace.\n* Lead has at times given conflicting advice. One day says \"Don't do X\" and another day says \"You need to be doing X\".\n\nAnd there are other points I could make as well, but not without being more specific than I would like.\n\nEdit\n----\n\nTo be clear, my question about what further actions we can take is in the same line as if someone had a car accident then there are certain steps you take such as getting the other person's information, taking pictures, contacting insurance, possibly filing police report, etc. None of these things are specific legal advice, and though they may be considered \"common sense\" many people fail to do these things until it is too late. So I am just trying to ensure there are no obvious steps I am overlooking to do now that I will regret not doing later. It sounds like there aren't since no one has offered any, but that's where my question was going.\n\nI also would have thought my question about whether it's illegal to encourage and/or pressure someone to quit their job after becoming pregnant would be simple yes/no answer after knowing some basic context such as type of business and location. But perhaps I'm wrong about that? And perhaps I should be clear and state that I am not asking whether I might be able to meet the burden of proof to succeed in court on such an issue; I know that a question like that can't be answered here. I'm just wondering whether any laws exist prohibiting it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't stress this enough: Document everything as it seems like the management are building a case against her by \"Moving the Goal Posts\" i.e. the don't do this thing/do the thing we told you not to do.\n\nYour wife needs to get copies of every e\\-mail exchanged with her and the bosses, as well as any e\\-mails between co\\-workers that are relevant as well as any print outs of performance documents. Keep these in a place where they can be filed and looked at on your own... you want them out of office to the greatest extent possible. If you can't remove them, make sure she has pertinent information about who's addresses were sent the e\\-mail and the date it was sent, with a note of possible importance.\n\nIn addition, if you are not already doing this, your wife should find someone in the company who she trusts and ask them if she can BCC them on any e\\-mails she sends to management (including replies to e\\-mails they sent). BCC (or blind carbon copy) sends a copy of the e\\-mail to the address listed in the BCC line, but will hide that person from being seen by other recipients of the email (including if you have multiple addresses in the BCC line). This allows further copies of documentation that is preserved incase an \"accident\" happens to her account. The best people to ask should be people who your wife trusts, who are out of her management chain (their supervisor isn't her supervisor) and has some experience with the company. Be sure she asks for permission to do this first, as the goal of this is not just evidence preservation but also witness creation. Her bosses might not turn over any response e\\-mails she sent to them and won't turn over anything that makes them look bad.\n\nI would also get copies of company policies with respect to termination of employment and the process that needs to be gone through, as well as their harassment policy and equal opportunity employment policy. You also want to get copies of her employment contracts and any benefits listings she signed for and compare those with Texas laws on discrimination. As always, if you're not sure if it's something that could be helpful, err on the side that it is, and save it.\n\nHere's a link to the Texas Workforce Commission's brief list of \"To Dos\" regarding [pregnancies](https://twc.texas.gov/news/efte/pregnancy_rights.html) and I'm sure taking a look at the sight for other related matters will help.",

Documenting all interactions, collecting relevant emails and company policies, and reporting the situation to HR while continuing to perform job duties is the best approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Documentation: This creates a paper trail of evidence that can be used if legal action becomes necessary later.\n\n2. Collecting policies: Having copies of company policies on termination, harassment, and equal opportunity employment helps ensure the employee knows her rights and can identify any violations.\n\n3. Reporting to HR: This is an important step in addressing the issue internally before escalating to external authorities, which is often required before taking legal action.\n\n4. Continuing job duties: This shows professionalism and prevents giving the employer any legitimate reasons for termination.\n\nOption A is premature without first addressing the issue internally. Option B would potentially forfeit the employee's rights and job unnecessarily. Option D could escalate the situation without proper documentation or support."

Should I worry, and\n>  is there anything I can do about it?\n\nReceiving stolen property is a crime and using stolen information to acquire goods or services is a crime.\n\nWhether or not you have legal liability comes down to whether you have the requisite intent to be guilty of the crime. \n\nIf you \"know\" that the gift card code is stolen, you are guilty of a crime. \n\nIf you accidentally or negligently use a gift card code that is stolen, you are very unlikely to be guilty of a crime. \n\nThere is considerable variation between states on the question on whether you are guilty of a crime when you do know for sure that the gift card code is stolen, but the likelihood that it is stolen is so great that your conduct amounts to be being reckless or to willful blindness.\n\nYou might also have civil liability on a non\\-fault based restitution theory for the purchases, if the gift card code turned out to be stolen, in an amount equal to the value of gifts that you received less the amount you paid for the gift card code.\n\nThe likelihood that you would be prosecuted or sued for an isolated instance of this conduct is very low. The likelihood that you would be prosecuted or sued for this conduct if you did it on a very systemic basis for profit, without doing any further due diligence into whether the cards are actually stolen, is considerable higher.\n\nIf you believe that the gift card codes are probably stolen, it would be best for you to refrain from purchasing them in the future.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential legal situation?\n\nA) John is definitely guilty of a crime because he used a potentially stolen gift card.\n\nB) John has no legal liability whatsoever since he paid for the gift card.\n\nC) John's legal liability depends on his level of knowledge about the gift card's origins at the time of purchase and use.\n\nD) John is only liable if he can be proven to have purchased multiple gift cards from the same vendor.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because John's legal liability in this situation primarily depends on his level of knowledge or intent regarding the gift card's potentially stolen status. If John had no reason to believe the gift card was stolen at the time of purchase and use, he is unlikely to be guilty of a crime. However, if he knew or had strong reason to suspect the gift card was stolen, he could be liable for receiving stolen property or using stolen information to acquire goods or services. The law considers the mental state (mens rea) of the individual in determining criminal liability in such cases. Options A and B are incorrect because they represent absolute positions that don't account for the nuanced nature of intent in criminal law. Option D is incorrect because while systematic purchases might increase the likelihood of prosecution, a single instance could still result in liability if the requisite knowledge or intent is present."

How does this work if the debt has no clear monetary value? If I create a cryptocurrency (ABCcoin) and my friend creates another (XYZcoin), I mine some ABC and he mines some XYZ, and we sign a contract to trade 50 ABC for 100 XYZ, that is the only transaction involving the currencies, so it sets the market value at 1 XYZ \\= 2 ABC.

How would the value of ABCcoin in dollars be determined with no market to determine a market value?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that you are distorting the legal situation by describing it as a debt denominated in XYZcoins. According to the [LII page \"Debt\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/debt):\n\n> Debt is a financial liability or obligation owed by one person, the debtor, to another, the creditor.\n\nNote that a debt is a **financial** liability. That means that it is payable in money, in some recognized currency. In the XYZcoin case, there is not a debt, but a contract of exchange. It can only be satisfied by handing over the cryptocurrency specified in the agreement, unless the parties agree to change that.\n\nWhen a person signs a contract to sell a house, for example, that person does not owe a debt denominated in houses. Rather, that person has agreed to deed over a specific house on specific terms. If the seller refuses to close the deal and the would\\-be buyer brings a legal action, the judge may order ***specific performance***, that is, order the seller to sign the papers needed to transfer title to that specific house. A similar remedy may be available on a contract to sell a painting or other object that is unique, and cannot be replaced easily by a different object of the same type. Something similar may occur with a contract to sell or trade stocks not listed on any exchange, where there is no clear market value, and the purchaser wants shares in that particular company, not a sum of money.",

This means it is valid without consideration, it also means if you are in violation of the license, then you are committing copyright infringement, instead of being in breach of a contract. \n\nIn Germany, the GPL is a contract. And that's fine, because German law doesn't require consideration for a contract to be valid. It's interesting in that the GPL license doesn't require you to state whether you agree to the license/contract or not. But if you don't agree to the contract then there is no contract, and you have no right to use the software.",

Additionally, consideration is not required in German contract law.\n\nOption B is correct. In the US, the GPL is indeed treated as a license, which means it doesn't require consideration to be valid. In Germany, it is considered a contract, but German law doesn't require consideration for a contract to be valid.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the GPL is treated as a license in the US, it is considered a contract in Germany.\n\nOption D is incorrect on both counts. In the US, the GPL is a license, not a contract, and doesn't require consideration. In Germany, it is a contract, not a license, but still doesn't require consideration.\n\nThis question highlights the differences in how open-source licenses are interpreted in different legal systems and the varying requirements for validity in contract law across jurisdictions."

This scenario involves a complex web of illegal activities that fall under the purview of the RICO Act, which was designed to combat organized crime and its infiltration into legitimate businesses and politics.

If it comes out that the government had a lack of probable cause to search your house for the harboring a fugitive case would that also make the drug bust invalid?\n\nCan a lack of probable cause affect evidence of a separate but related case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Conducting an illegal search does not amount to a permanent get out of jail free card (\"does that invalidate all evidence against you\". What is excluded is evidence derived from that illegal search, regardless of what crime they were searching for. It would include later evidence for an unrelated crime where the probable cause was uncovered by the illegal search. The doctrine is not absolute, so a grand jury can inquire about a matter brought to their attention via an illegal search (\"the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons\", US v. Calandra). Also, the doctrine excludes the product of a bad faith search without probable cause e.g. where the officer lies about the probable cause. There is also a \"social cost\" consideration, see [Pennsylvania v. Scott](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/524/357/).\n\n[Utah v. Strief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf) establishes three related doctrines. Unlawfully\\-obtained evidence independently acquired by officers from a source may be admittede. Evidence may be admitted if it would have been discovered without the unconstitutional source. Finally, since the poison fruit doctrine is intended to limit illegal police action, it may be admitted when there is a remote connection between illegal police conduct and gathering of evidence (e.g. the existence of an arrest warrant, discovered after the search).\n\nNothing in your hypothetical points to an exception. The \"social costs\" consideration was specifically related to\n\"social costs of allowing convicted criminals who violate their parole to remain at large\", but the potential for wider application is established (however, it is well\\-established that evidence of ordinary drug possession is excluded, from the myriad cases of such exclusions over the past century).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer conducts an illegal search of a suspect's home without probable cause, looking for evidence of tax fraud. During this search, the officer discovers a large quantity of illegal drugs. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility of the drug evidence in court?\n\nA) The drug evidence is admissible because it was found incidentally during a search for a different crime.\n\nB) The drug evidence is inadmissible due to the exclusionary rule, unless it can be proven that it would have been inevitably discovered through lawful means.\n\nC) The drug evidence is automatically admissible because drug possession is a serious offense that outweighs the unlawful search.\n\nD) The drug evidence is inadmissible, and additionally, any future evidence related to tax fraud that stems from this search would also be excluded.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the exclusionary rule, evidence obtained through an illegal search is generally inadmissible in court. This applies regardless of what crime the police were originally searching for. However, there are exceptions to this rule, one of which is the \"inevitable discovery\" doctrine. If the prosecution can prove that the evidence would have been discovered through lawful means anyway, it may still be admissible.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the incidental discovery of evidence during an illegal search does not make it admissible.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the seriousness of the offense does not automatically override the exclusionary rule.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in that the drug evidence would likely be inadmissible, but it goes too far in stating that any future evidence related to tax fraud would also be excluded. While evidence directly stemming from the illegal search would be excluded, if investigators later found independent evidence of tax fraud through legal means, that evidence could potentially be admissible."

It reads (emphasis mine):\n\n> Section. 3\\. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, **shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof**. But Congress may by a vote of two\\-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nApologies because this is a multi\\-part, not\\-straightforward question:\n\n1. Does the above bolded part correspond to breaking any specific laws? That is, how would one show that a person engaged in insurrection or rebellion, or given comfort to enemies?\n2. If this could be demonstrated by finding someone guilty of a particular law, in theory couldn't someone bring federal charges against Trump for doing so? (assuming one of his many bad faith acts like cooperating with Russian election interference, or tweeting classified information appeared to be breaking said law).\n3. Couldn't this happen even if a Republican controlled senate decided not to remove him from office after being impeached? That is, even if it wouldn't cause him to be removed from office, couldn't he, separate from impeachment, be convicted of a crime while still holding office?\n4. If he was found convicted of a crime which fit the above bolded passage (and didn't engage in some shenanigans like pardoning himself), who would keep him from taking office? (i.e. enforce the law).\n\nI apologize if I'm grossly misinterpreting things here. My background knowledge is just from Wikipedia and constitution.findlaw.com, and I couldn't find any articles dealing with Trump and the 14th amendment, section 3 (all results were about him trying to unilaterally change citizenship laws, so for a different section).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I apologize if I'm grossly misinterpreting things here.\n\nYou are grossly misinterpreting things here. Your mistakes aren't terribly uncommon, but you are completely and totally wrong in what you are suggesting.\n\n> Does the above bolded part correspond to breaking any specific laws?\n> That is, how would one show that a person engaged in insurrection or\n> rebellion, or given comfort to enemies?\n\nThe language intentionally mimics the only crime defined in the U.S. Constitution, which is treason, defined in U.S. Constitution, Article III.\n\n> If this could be demonstrated by finding someone guilty of a\n> particular law, in theory couldn't someone bring federal charges\n> against Trump for doing so? (assuming one of his many bad faith acts\n> like cooperating with Russian election interference, or tweeting\n> classified information appeared to be breaking said law).\n\nNone of the things you imagine could constitute treason. 'Enemy\" is a term of art that means a country that the United States is actually at war with, militarily, by providing aid and comfort to the other side that aides them in waging war with the U.S.\n\nCooperating with Russian election interference isn't treason. Inaction isn't treason. The President probably has an absolute legal right to disclose information that is classified for national security purposes. The President is immune from civil and criminal liability for his official acts while he is President.\n\nIf the President, from his private funds, and not as part of his officially duties, personally paid Taliban soldiers bounties to shoot and kill American soldiers, that might be treason (since the U.S. is at war, within the meaning of the treason statute, with the Taliban). Cooperating with Russia, despite the fact that it has done so is not treason.\n\nEven then, federal prosecutors would not press these federal charges against the President while the President was in office. And, the President would be immune, in all probability, to state treason charges for conduct while in office. So the President would have to be prosecuted after leaving office. On the other hand, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not require a criminal conviction to be effective.\n\nThe intent of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was to deny civil rights in the post\\-Civil War governments of the United States by Confederate officials and military officers. In practice, Congress used the authority it was granted to remove political disabilities from all but about 500 of the hundreds of thousands or millions of people eligible for this treatment under the 14th Amendment.\n\n> Couldn't this happen even if a Republican controlled senate decided\n> not to remove him from office after being impeached? That is, even if\n> it wouldn't cause him to be removed from office, couldn't he, separate\n> from impeachment, be convicted of a crime while still holding office?\n\nThe federal government prosecutes treason. Ultimately, the President is the one who decides whom the federal government prosecutes. So, the President as a practical matter could not be convicted of treason while still holding office, even if he committed acts which actually constitute treason, unlike anything could be plausibly alleged in this case.\n\n> If he was found convicted of a crime which fit the above bolded\n> passage (and didn't engage in some shenanigans like pardoning\n> himself), who would keep him from taking office? (i.e. enforce the\n> law).\n\nA future President can pardon the crime of treason by a former President. Ford pardoned Nixon of crimes that Nixon committed, and many Presidents have pardoned treason convictions at times close to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution and to the adoption of the 14th Amendment. But this just can't come up in this case. You'd need a treason to have been committed before someone was elected.",
