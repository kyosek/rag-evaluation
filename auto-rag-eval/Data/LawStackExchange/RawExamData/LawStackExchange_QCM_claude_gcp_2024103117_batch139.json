The notice includes two options:\n1. A one-year lease with a 10% rent increase\n2. A month-to-month lease with the amount from option 1 plus an additional $500\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding the legality of this notice?\n\nA) The notice is illegal because the month-to-month option exceeds a 10% increase, requiring at least 60 days' notice.\nB) The notice is legal because the one-year lease option meets the 30-day notice requirement for increases of 10% or less.\nC) The notice is illegal because both options must be within the 10% increase limit to be valid with 40 days' notice.\nD) The notice is legal only if the tenant chooses the one-year lease option; otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The notice is legal because the one-year lease option meets the 30-day notice requirement for increases of 10% or less. According to California Civil Code Section 827(b)(2), a rent increase of 10% or less requires at least 30 days' notice. The landlord has provided 40 days' notice, which exceeds this requirement. The fact that there's a second option with a higher increase doesn't invalidate the notice, as the tenant still has the option to choose the 10% increase, which complies with the law. The month-to-month option with a higher increase is simply an additional choice, not a requirement, and doesn't affect the legality of the notice itself."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51599/strict-liabilty", "docs_id": 51599, "title": "Strict liabilty", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a Civil Law legal system there is a distinction made.\n\nProper Strict Liability which is plainly Strict Liability as used in the English Language (guiltless liability/ liability regardless of guilt simply because damages occured).\n\nAnd improper Strict Liability in which guilt is required but the burden of proof is reversed. e.g. The consumer is in a weaker position to prove and bargain so the merchant is usually required to prove that they did nothing wrong (they abode by the law).

Strict liability of an employer or principal for acts of an employee or agent, or by one general partner for another one, or of an insurer or surety for someone insured or guaranteed.\n2. Strict liability for a defective product. Defectiveness is also a \"back door\" form of fault, even though it is not evaluated by the usual negligence standard in which there is no liability for mistakes that a reasonable person could make.\n3. Strict liability for harm caused by an ultra\\-hazardous activity. The inference is that a reasonable person wouldn't engage in ultra\\-hazardous activities at all.\n4. Strict liability is imposed for breaches of contract.\n\nGenerally the common theme is that someone subject to liability consciously assumed a risk of liability in advance of an incident, and often has some control or influence over the events that could conceivably cause harm.\n\nStrict liability is not constitutionally required or prohibited.

In civil law systems, \"improper strict liability\" refers to a situation where guilt is still required, but the burden of proof is reversed. This means that the defendant (often a merchant or business) must prove that they acted lawfully and without fault, rather than the plaintiff having to prove the defendant's guilt. This concept is distinct from \"proper strict liability,\" which aligns more closely with option A.\n\nOption A describes \"proper strict liability,\" not \"improper strict liability,\" so it's incorrect.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while strict liability often applies to ultra-hazardous activities in common law systems, this is not the defining characteristic of \"improper strict liability\" in civil law systems.\n\nOption D is incorrect because strict liability, whether proper or improper, is not constitutionally mandated.

Typically the share or bond certificates are held in the name of a nominee company which in turn are held by a brokerage for the benefit of its customers, and not infrequently the brokerage account is in turn owned by a revocable trust or other trust for the benefit of the beneficial owners.\n\n[The commercial reality](https://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/pdf/20080507045332_large.rtf) is discussed in the official comments and memorandum discussions of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States. Shares held in nominee form all called \"[street name securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_name_securities)\" in the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nOwnership of mortgages sold in the secondary market in the U.S. is handled similarly. The original lender typically transfers nominal status as holder of the note obligation to [MERS](https://www.mersinc.org/products-services/mers-system/faq), a nominee firm, that in turn is held by a trust that owns a pool of mortgages called a mortgage backed security, that is in turn owned by secondary market investors through brokerage account trusts and often through personal trusts or a charitable pooled trust for the benefit of ultimate beneficial owner charities.

Any legal charge of treason is treason against the country. Article III, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US constitution reads:\n\n> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\n\nSee also [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2381 \\- Treason](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) which reads:\n\n> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\nIt is hard to see how making war on the United States, or helping an open enemy do so, could \"save the nation\" and in the absence of either of these, there is no treason, although other charges might possibly apply.\n\nThe [interactive Constitution site](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/article-iii/clauses/39) from the National Constitutions Center says about this provision of the Constitution:\n\n> Treason is a unique offense in our constitutional order\u2014the only crime expressly defined by the Constitution, and applying only to Americans who have betrayed the allegiance they are presumed to owe the United States. While the Constitution\u2019s Framers shared the centuries\\-old view that all citizens owed a duty of loyalty to their home nation, they included the Treason Clause not so much to underscore the seriousness of such a betrayal, but to guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition. Debate surrounding the Clause at the Constitutional Convention thus focused on ways to narrowly define the offense, and to protect against false or flimsy prosecutions.\n> \n> \n> The Constitution specifically identifies what constitutes treason against the United States and, importantly, limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct: (1\\) \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States; or (2\\) \u201cadhering to \\[the] enemies \\[of the United States], giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American history\u2014indeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954\u2014the Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.\n\n> The offense of \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States was interpreted narrowly in *Ex parte Bollman \\& Swarthout* (1807\\), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans. The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burr\u2019s associates\u2014Bollman and Swarthout\u2014on the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s opinion emphasized, merely to conspire \u201cto subvert by force the government of our country\u201d by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans. Conspiring to levy war was distinct from actually levying war. Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an \u201cactual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.\u201d In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.\n\n> The Court construed the other treason offense authorized by the Constitution similarly narrowly in *Cramer v. United States* (1945\\). That case involved another infamous incident in American history: the Nazi Saboteur Affair. Cramer was prosecuted for treason for allegedly helping German soldiers who had surreptitiously infiltrated American soil during World War II.

But since juries do not normally give reasons for their votes, it is hard to establish when it has and when it has not happened, and I have seen no statistics on such occurrences.\n\nBy the way, \"Jury Nullification\" is simply when one or more jury members vote in a particular way because of something other than the law and evidence as presented in the trial. Most often the term is used when a jury votes to acquit because they dislike or disapprove of the law involved. For example, in the 1850s a number of people accused of violating the US Fugitive Slave Law by harboring runaway slaves were acquitted, reputedly because juries who disliked the law (quite unpopular in many northern states) no matter what the evidence. Later, during Prohibition, some people charged with possessing or selling alcohol were acquitted, reputedly by juries who disapproved of Prohibition. In both cases, it is hard to get authoritative sources that specific cases were actual instances of jury nullification.\n\nAnyway, a juror need not \"ask\" for jury nullification, that juror just votes to acquit.

Jury nullification can indeed occur when one or more jurors vote based on their personal or political beliefs rather than strictly on the evidence and law presented in the trial. This aligns with the information provided, which states that jury nullification happens when jury members vote in a particular way because of factors other than the law and evidence presented.\n\nOption A is incorrect because jury nullification doesn't require unanimity; even a single juror voting against conviction for reasons other than the evidence can lead to a hung jury, which is a form of nullification.\n\nOption B is false because jurors don't need to explicitly request nullification. As the text states, a juror \"need not 'ask' for jury nullification, that juror just votes to acquit.\"\n\nOption C is misleading.

According to the information provided, copying and redistributing computer code without the author's permission constitutes copyright infringement, even if the original code was publicly accessible. The absence of an explicit license does not grant permission to redistribute the code. While reading and implementing concepts from publicly available code is legal, wholesale reproduction and distribution of the code itself, as the AI is doing, likely infringes on the original author's copyright. The scenario described goes beyond what would typically be considered fair use, as it involves reproducing substantial portions of code (about 50 lines) verbatim. Therefore, the AI company has likely infringed on the original author's copyright by redistributing the code without permission."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24349/friend-had-a-right-of-way-accident-in-a-parking-lot-entrance", "docs_id": 24349, "title": "Friend had a right of way accident in a parking lot entrance", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Charleston, SC.

The general law is that\n\n> A person shall not drive a vehicle on a [highway](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/2016/title-56/chapter-5/section-56-5-430/) at a speed greater\n>  than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard\n>  to the actual and potential hazards then existing. Speed must be so\n>  controlled to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle, or other\n>  conveyance on or entering the highway in compliance with legal\n>  requirements and the duty of a person to use care.\n\nThere are various maximum lawful speeds that may not be exceeded, for example 70 on the interstate, or 30 in an \"urban district\". Local jurisdictions are authorized to modify the limits, and in [Charleston](https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIOPVEGE_DIV3SPRE) the maximum is generally 25\\. However, a posted limit can also be set, so if the sign says 20, the limit is 20\\. Note though that state law refers to highways, defined thusly:\n\n> The entire width between boundary lines of every way publicly\n>  maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for\n>  purposes of vehicular travel is a \"street\" or \"highway.\"\n\nA parking lot is not for the purpose of travel, so one cannot conclude that highway speed limits apply.

There's no fixed two week notice requirement, the amount of notice required depends on the circumstances. It would be necessary for an employer to prove damages that resulted from an employee quitting without giving notice or sufficient notice.\n\nAn example of this would be [Consbec v Peter Walker](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2014/2014bcsc2070/2014bcsc2070.pdf) where the defendant was determined to have failed to give reasonable notice of his resignation:\n\n> \\[212] Peter was obliged to provide Consbec with notice of his resignation.

Accordingly, it suffered no damages as a result of Peter\u2019s failure to give notice.\n\nIn many ways having a notice period specified in a contract is a much better option than ultimately leaving it up to a court decide. There seems to be very little precedent for this, especially for non\\-fiduciary employees. In Consbec the trial judge opted not to make a determination of what notice period was required in the case, something the appeal court determined was an error. The appeal court determined that a one month notice period was reasonable, but didn't explain how it came to this determination.\n\nOn the other hand, lawsuits like these a very rare for low ranking employees with little or no authority. As in the Consbec case, it would be hard for an employer prove damages. If Consbec hadn't been seeking large damages on other claims it's unlikely it would've brought a lawsuit.\n\n---\n\nSomeone who tried to falsely claim to be sick in order to avoid having to work their remaining notice period would likely at minimum owe their employer the same damages as if they had failed to give notice. If the sick time is paid and/or includes benefits they'd have to pay back or compensate the the employer for these wages and benefits. In addition, because they're still employed, they still owe a duty of loyalty to their employers that former employees do not, and so could face additional damages for doing things like working for a competitor.\n\nSomeone who started work at another job couldn't use this as an excuse to avoid working during the required notice period. The person would have meet their obligations to both employers and both employers would be entitled to damages for the employee failing to do so.

When, if ever, would calling a black person the N\\-word not be covered under free speech? I'm guessing it varies from state to state, but I'm not certain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The spectrum of \"illegal\" is broad. One way in which racial epithets are (indirectly) illegal is via anti\\-discrimination laws, indeed labeled [\"harassment\"](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment) by the EEOC\n\n> Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color,\n> religion, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, or\n> pregnancy), national origin, older age (beginning at age 40\\),\n> disability, or genetic information (including family medical history).\n> Harassment becomes unlawful where 1\\) enduring the offensive conduct\n> becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2\\) the conduct is\n> severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a\n> reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.\n> Anti\\-discrimination laws also prohibit harassment against individuals\n> in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or\n> participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit\n> under these laws; or opposing employment practices that they\n> reasonably believe discriminate against individuals, in violation of\n> these laws.\n\nIf an employer tolerates racial epithets, they are likely to be the target of a harassment lawsuit. There is no limit on who utters the epithet, thus a customer can be the trigger for a suit. In cases not involving supervisory employees, liability arises if the employer \"knew, or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action\". Analogously, racial epithets in educational institutions are actionable. Framed in terms of a random epithet by a non\\-employee or campus visitor (where the institution has minimal leverage over the offender), the institution must act, when it becomes aware of such circumstances arising, and cannot just say \"What can *we* do??\".\n\nA second (remote) possibility is through the [fighting words doctrine](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/959/fighting-words), that the government can limit speech that is \"likely to incite immediate violence or retaliation by the recipients of the words\". This arose initially in [Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/315/568/) \u2013 one of the holdings was that\n\n> The Court notices judicially that the appellations \"damned racketeer\"\n> and \"damned Fascist\" are epithets likely to provoke the average person\n> to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace.\n\nThere have been numerous refinements of the doctrine over the decades, so the mere utterance of a racial epithet would not run afoul of properly\\-restrained \"breach of peace\" laws. One of the two most\\-relevant current opinions is [Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/), 395 U.S. 444, where the court held that the government cannot\n\n> forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where\n> such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless\n> action and is likely to incite or produce such action\n\nbut uttering an epithet is not advocacy of force or law violation. The second is [R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/), 505 US 377 where defendant was charged with violating an ordinance that\n\n> prohibits the display of a symbol which one knows or has reason to\n> know \"arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of\n> race, color, creed, religion or gender\"\n\nSCOTUS ruled that \"the First Amendment does not permit a state to use content discrimination to achieve a compelling interest *if it is not necessary to achieve that interest*\" (emphasis added), holding that\n\n> A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation, and\n> fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally\n> proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely\n> invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate them\n> based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable message\n> they contain. Thus the regulation of \"fighting words\" may not be based\n> on nonproscribable content. It may, however, be underinclusive,\n> addressing some offensive instances and leaving other, equally\n> offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective proscription is not\n> based on content, or there is no realistic possibility that regulation\n> of ideas is afoot.\n\nA further holding is that the law is\n\n> is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special prohibitions\n> on those speakers who express views on the disfavored subjects of\n> \"race, color, creed, religion or gender.\" At the same time, it permits\n> displays containing abusive invective if they are not addressed to\n> those topics. Moreover, in its practical operation the ordinance goes\n> beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint, discrimination.\n\nThe court has not clearly identified a context in which a law against a racial epithet would be constitutional, they have simply identified other bars that would have to be cleared for such a law to be permissible. No utterance, devoid of context, is illegal, so to discover where such an utterance could be part of a prosecutions, we would need a lot of specific context in the hypothetical.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, under what circumstances could the use of a racial slur potentially be considered illegal?\n\nA) Any use of a racial slur is always illegal under federal law\nB) Use of a racial slur is protected speech in all circumstances\nC) Use of a racial slur could be illegal if it creates a hostile work environment or educational setting\nD) Use of a racial slur is only illegal if it directly causes physical harm to someone\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because there is no blanket federal law making all uses of racial slurs illegal. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while speech is generally protected, there are circumstances where use of slurs could be part of illegal conduct.\n\nOption C is correct.

But recently a friend of mine had the same issue and my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to learn what the law is on this. \n\nSay you book an apartment through booking.com (or any other booking website) and pay the amount in advance (no refund possible at this point). Say you arrive late at night (outside the indicated check\\-in time) and the owner then asks you to pay extra for the check\\-in, is he/she allowed to do that? In my friend's case, there was no mentioning of a late check\\-in fee but you can also not refund the booking so you are sort of forced to pay the extra amount if you don't want to loose the payment you have already made for the apartment. What does the law say on this?\n\nIn my case it ended there but in my friends case the airplane got delayed and as a result my friend arrived 2 hours late at the property. In the meantime (while on the airplane), my friend received angry emails (capitalised words, every sentence marked with several exclamation mark, the whole array ...) saying because of the late arrival the late check\\-in fee has doubled which my friend was then forced to pay (which were equal to 2 nights rent, so it was a significant amount which was not agreed upon before and again, there was not really an option to avoid this fee (other than, again, losing the down payment and looking for a different hotel at 5 in the morning with all your luggage). Again, is the owner allowed to just arbitrary set prices and force you to pay (as the owner knows that you don't really have another option). It feels a bit like exploitation, just wondering if there is a law on that. \n\nOK, so now to the interesting bit. I understand that booking.com (or the website you booked through) is just a facilitator of sorts, so they don't need to mediate between you and the apartment owner (and from experience it seems that's exactly their strategy), but if we look more closely at the problem, effectively you were making a booking through their website based on incomplete information. I understand that this is the owners fault of not providing this information, but is booking.com (or again your favourite website) not, at least, being sloppy with due diligence by pretty much saying \"your problem, not ours, we only run this website and don't care if you have to pay extra\"? I have a feeling that they are operating within the margin of the law, but that then means that you are pretty much at the mercy of the apartment owner and if he/she wants to drain your vacation funds there is nothing stopping him/her?\n\nAnd one more thing, if make your booking in country A for an apartment in country B through booking.com, which law should be considered? The one from country A (where you booked from), country B (where you are going to) or maybe where the website you bought it through is registered? (possibly a third, different country)\n\nOh and just one last thing, thankfully it didn't happened (to neither me nor my friend), but out of curiosity and on that topic, what happens if the owner decides to withhold the deposit you paid? Again, there seems little that you can do. I guess you can take pictures of everything but in the end it will be your word against the owner, it seem pretty easy then for them to just cash in some extra money if they wanted to do so. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am not a lawyer, but to me this sounds like it is a case of **contract law**, and contracts are enforceable worldwide as long as the terms in them are not illegal.\n\nbooking.com has a contract with the Trip Providers for offering their trips/hotels. And when you order an airBnB via booking.com you sign a contract with booking.com. In both cases, the [booking.com terms and conditions](https://www.booking.com/content/terms.en-gb.html?aid=318615;label=New_English_EN_DE_21457879225-Jdut*siugXVp60tvDpgYjQS99511067545:pl:ta:p1:p2:ac:ap1t1:neg:fi:tidsa-55482331735:lp9043572:li:dec:dm;ws=&gclid=CjwKCAjwkrrbBRB9EiwAhlN8_AdF2SIsE8HIrJmfIP2UcVqx3o7kHGVDO3SyxwdihwzGsoQHcZJ9EhoCDoYQAvD_BwE) apply. These conditions do include this (emphasis mine):\n\n> 2. Prices, crossed\\-out rates and We Price Match\n> \n> \n> The prices as offered by the Trip Providers on our Platform are highly competitive. **All prices for your Trip are** displayed **including VAT/sales tax and all other taxes** (subject to change of such taxes) **and fees**, unless stated differently on our Platform or the confirmation email/ticket. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding.\n\nThis should protect you from sudden fees, but beware, there is also this, that does allow *some* fees that were not so obvious:\n\n> 6. Pre\\-payment, cancellation, no\\-show and fine print (emphasis mine)\n> \n> \n> By making a Trip Reservation with a Trip Provider, you **accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no\\-show policy of that Trip Provider**, and to **any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Trip Provider** that may apply to your Trip (including the fine print of the Trip Provider made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Trip Provider), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Trip Provider. The relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Trip Provider can be obtained with the relevant Trip Provider. The general cancellation and no\\-show policy of each Trip Provider is made available on our Platform on the Trip Provider information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). Please note that certain rates, fees or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund or change.\n\nThese additional delivery terms and conditions could arguably be cover fees for late check in. However, these would have to be in the Terms and Conditions of the Trip provider, so unannounced fees that were not in the terms and conditions should default to the booking.com Terms and Conditions Part 2\\.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nMy layman's opinion based on this: the Trip Provider might be in breach of contract with booking.com and you or not depending on his own Terms and Conditions, which you did not provide. If the Trip Provder breached the contract with booking.com and thus with you is up to booking.com to decide, so you should call their customer support. How to do this is in the above mentioned Terms and conditions of booking.com contain this:\n\n> 7.

As is typical, the DMV does not accurately say what the law is, they only paraphrase a regulation that they wrote that is related to the law. The law simply says that to operate a vehicle in NY, you have to have insurance of a bond. Violation yields a fine of $150\\-$1500, 15 days in prison, or both. There is no provision that says \"you may delay getting insurance for N days\". When the DMV says \"To register a vehicle in New York State you must have New York State issued automobile liability insurance coverage\", they are not accurately saying what the fundamental law is \u2013 have insurance, period. Them refusing to register a vehicle without insurance is a way to enforce the law (via [\u00a7 312](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/vehicle-and-traffic-law/vat-sect-312.html)), but it doesn't mean that you can skip the insurance if you're unregistered.\n\nIt is worthwhile to consider why this is so. If you don't have the required insurance, then you might smack somebody and do damage, and the victim would have no practical way of recovering their damages. This would clearly be a problem, and therefore it is, as far as I know, a universal requirement in the US that you absolutely must have liability insurance (or a bond) to drive, so that you can live up to your legal obligations in case you cause damage. The state's interest in registering vehicles is entirely separate (as a revenue\\-generating scheme and means of establishing ownership). You are required to have insurance even to drive through New York; you are not required to register your vehicle to drive through. So insurance is really about the liability, and not the registration: connecting it to registration is just a means of enforcing the law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John recently moved to New York State and purchased a used car from a private seller.

The law requires that all vehicles have valid insurance or a bond in place before they can be legally driven. While the DMV allows up to 180 days from the insurance effective date to register a vehicle, this does not mean a driver can operate the vehicle without insurance during that time. The primary purpose of mandatory insurance is to ensure that drivers can cover potential damages in case of an accident, which is why it's required even for vehicles just passing through the state. The registration process is separate from the insurance requirement and is mainly for revenue generation and establishing ownership. Therefore, John must obtain insurance immediately before driving his new car, regardless of when he plans to register it."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85133/why-is-there-usually-a-six-month-time-limit-for-bringing-disability-discriminati", "docs_id": 85133, "title": "Why is there usually a six month time limit for bringing disability discrimination actions to court?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Kester Disability Rights note in a blog post of 25 Jun (page 6\\) that\n\n> There is usually a six month time limit to get your case to court.\n\nWhat provision might they be referring to and where can I read more about it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is probably refering to the time limit at [Section 118 of the *Equality Act 2010*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/118).

My main characters are the crew of a US Navy seaplane from WWII, and they've ended up in a new world of similar tech level. Now, they're still loyal service members of their nation, but they don't have any knowledge of this place they've been dumped into nor any contact with the United States but they *have* made contact with the local's military.\n\nThe major problem the bomber's crew has is that they have no money or identification here, aliens in more then one sense of the word. They can't refuel their plane here without committing a crime and stealing the fuel, and spare parts are limited to the few onboard that they were carrying on their bombing run.\n\nOne theory for their next course of action would possibly have the crew make an alliance of sorts with the local military, possibly agreeing to trade some knowledge and/or the services of their aircraft to the locals in exchange for fuel, parts, identification, and possibly cash to sustain themselves and their aircraft.\n\nSo, what I'm wondering is if they can somehow pull this off without committing treason against the USA by military law, or are they in a real Morten's Fork situation here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **It's only treason if they wage war with the US**\n\nTreason is unique in American law: It is the **only crime** that is defined in the [Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3). It is made a crime in the US code (**[18 USC \u00a72381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381)**) not \"military law.\"\n\nFollowing the Constitution's Treason Clause, USC \u00a72381 has two prongs. To be guilty of treason, one must either:\n\n1. Levy war against the United States; or\n2. Adhere to its enemies, giving them aid or comfort.\n\nSince this country is not at war with the US, the first prong does not apply. \"Enemies\" has been interpreted narrowly, to mean only enemies *in a real war.* Thus, one can only be guilty of treason in the US during wartime, so the second prong does not apply either.\n\nThe Founders defined treason narrowly and put it in the Constitution to de\\-politicize it. According to James Madison (in [Federalist 43](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a3_3_1-2s17.html)), in the past, \u201cviolent factions\u201d had often used \u201cnew\\-fangled and artificial\" definitions of treason to \u201cwreck their alternate malignity on each other\u2026\u201d To keep from repeating this sorry history, the Constitution \u201copposed a barrier to this peculiar danger,\u201d by defining what constituted treason and specifying how it was to be proved.\n\nExactly how narrowly treason is defined can be seen in the Supreme Court's 1807 decision in *[Ex Parte Bollman](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/8/75/).* This case arose out of the [Burr Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_conspiracy), Aaron Burr's plan to carve a new country out of the US. Bollman was charged with conspiring with Burr. The Court ordered Bollman released. In his opinion, John Marshall explained why:\n\n> However flagitious may be the crime of conspiring to subvert by force the government of our country, **such conspiracy is not treason.** *To conspire to levy war, and actually to levy war, are distinct offenses.*\n\nIf you want to read more about treason, here's a short [article](https://theconversation.com/treason-is-now-a-popular-word-heres-what-it-really-means-102968) by a law professor, and here's a nice [overview](https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1943021600) of the topic from the Congressional Quarterly.\n\n**Denationalization: Another problem they *probably* don't have to worry about**\n\nIf you are looking for reasons for these patriots to worry about joining the military of another country, treason is not the only legal danger they face. Volunteering in the armed services in another country's military can also lead to losing one's citizenship, *even if that country is not at war with the US.* During WWII, loss of citizenship was controlled by \u00a7401 of the Nationality Act of 1940\\. Under [\u00a7401(c)](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/76th-congress/session-3/c76s3ch876.pdf#page=33) US citizens could serve in foreign armed services if \"expressly authorized by the laws of the US.\" Otherwise, the law **only** provided for the denationalization of any citizen who served in a foreign military in which he *had or acquired* nationality. The 1940 Act said nothing about serving as an officer or intending to renounce American citizenship. Those provisions were added in later Acts.\n\n**How to apply real law to an imaginary world**\n\nYou will have to stretch the words of the *Nationality Act of 1940* and the \"Neutrality Acts\\* to get them to apply to this imagined situation. Instead of parsing these texts ever more finely in the hope you can figure out how to apply them to a situation those who passed these laws did not (and probably *could not*) imagine, a simpler and more direct approach would be to interpret these laws light of their purpose. The purpose of \u00a7401 of the *Nationality Act* is clear: If an American citizen shifts (or splits) his allegiance from the US to another country, he will lose his citizenship. \u00a7401 lists various acts that will be taken as evidence of shifting (or splitting) allegiance. So unless your guys do things that show they have changed their allegiance, they will be fine.\n\nKeeping your guys on the right side of the *Neutrality Acts* might be a little trickier. Their purpose is simple: To keep anyone from dragging US into war before Congress declares it by making sure every American remains neutral between \"belligerents.\" Unless you've built this world in such a way that the US could be easily dragged into a war on it, it seems your guys won't violate the purpose of the Neutrality Acts.

Treason in US law requires either levying war against the US or adhering to its enemies during wartime, neither of which applies in this scenario.\n2. Under the Nationality Act of 1940, loss of citizenship for serving in a foreign military only applied if the person acquired nationality in that country or if it was not authorized by US law.\n3. The crew's actions would likely not be interpreted as changing their allegiance to the US, which is the primary concern of citizenship laws.\n4.

However, academic units are usually set up in such a way that \"the department\" can't do anything, but the chair can, perhaps following a vote of the faculty. The faculty could denounce the accused, but as long as they didn't cross the line to defamation they can express themselves as they see fit. The chair, on the other hand, probably has the power to actually punish the accused, and would need to back off somewhat. For example, the faculty might wish to impose a substantive sanction, but they almost certainly don't have the power to do so, whereas the chair probably does.

There is no comprehensive database. So, one has to turn to appellate court rulings on complaints dismissed for being too long, and to media reports.\n\nThe governing rule in federal court is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, so annotations to that rule of court decisions interpreting it are the natural place to begin to look. As a practical matter, complaints are far more often dismissed for not saying enough than for saying too much.\n\nA rare such case said this about the Complaint before it (although it doesn't appear to have had all that many pages):\n\n> The amended complaint is still extremely verbose and rambling, and\n> contains a lengthy recital of evidentiary matters, examples of\n> which are paragraphs 26, 32, and 36\\.

Mass. 1961\\).\n\nA 317 page complaint in a securities fraud complaint that attempted to incorporate as many facts as possible, and repeated many allegations three or four times was too long and striken.\u2002*In re Metropolitan Securities Litigation*, 532 F.Supp.2d 1260 (E.D. Wash 2007\\). On the other hand a 70 page complaint with 30 pages of exhibits in a class action securities fraud case was not too long. *In re Intuitive Surgical Securities Litigation*, 65 F.Supp.3d 821 (N.D.Cal.2014\\).\n\nAnother 300\\+ page *pro se* complaint against mortgage broker and others was held to be too long when it contained over 1,000 specifically numbered paragraphs and hundreds of additional, non\\-numbered paragraphs, was disjointed and unorganized as whole, and contained hundreds of paragraphs that were irrelevant or were relevant only to claims that had already been dismissed with prejudice. *Grimes v. Fremont General Corp.*, 933 F.Supp.2d 584 (S.D.N.Y.2013\\).\n\nIn general, complaints are held to be too long when they are not only long in absolute terms, but also contain repetition, irrelevant material, or don't have almost every paragraph advance the general narrative.\n\nFor example, a *pro se* plaintiff's 56\\-page complaint alleging negligence was too long where it consisted of poorly numbered paragraphs that combined different sets of circumstances in disorganized fashion. \u2002*Cintron\\-Luna v. Roman\\-Bultron*, 668 F.Supp.2d 315 (D.Puerto Rico 2009\\). Typically, a simple negligence complaint would be only five to fifteen pages long with no exhibits.\n\nSimilarly, a complaint of 96 pages, much of which consisted of background information, was held to be too long, although the remedy was for the court to strike irrelevant or unnecessary parts of the complaint, effectively editing it, rather than dismissing the complaint in its entirety, and demanding that the plaintiff start over. *Verfuerth v. Orion Energy Systems, Inc.*, 65 F.Supp.3d 640 (E.D.Wis.2014\\).\n\nOn the other hand, it wouldn't be unusual for a law firm to file a commercial debt collection case, perhaps foreclosing on a mortgage of business real estate in a shopping center or high rise, or in an HOA dispute, to have a complaint of ten or twenty pages supported by all of the core contractual documents of the mortgage or homeowner's association as exhibits, that would run to 50\\-100 pages.\n\nStandards for complaint length have evolved over time. In 1946, a 14 page complaint with 17 pages of exhibits was stricken for being too long.\u2002*Renshaw v. Renshaw*, 153 F.2d 310 (D.C. App. 1946\\).\n\nI've personally seen complaints of about 120 pages in the early 1990s in relatively straightforward civil rights cases stricken for being too long, but complaints of 20\\-40 pages with additional exhibits running dozens of more pages aren't uncommon in a complex fact pattern.\n\nHistorical context does matter. There were four phases of pleading at the federal level, most of which were also present at the state level. And, in general, courts have become more tolerant of long complaints with many long exhibits in recent times.\n\nThe first was \"common law pleading\" which was quite arcane with a lot of idiosyncratic rules. For some kinds of claims this produced very short complaints, for other kinds of claims this demanded very long complaints.\n\nThe second was pleading based upon New York States's Field Code, which required the pleading of non\\-conclusory facts in support of each element of the claim asserted in the case, but that legal authority should generally not be referenced unless a specific statute was at issue. This standard produced complaints similar in length to the current standard, but usually somewhat shorter in practice.\n\nThe third was pleading based upon the federal rules of civil procedure as reformed in the 1930s, which required a \"short and plain\" statement of the facts merely sufficient to put the defendant on notice of the nucleus of facts giving rise to the dispute with the safe harbor federal rules of civil procedure as a guide. Under this standard a case could be dismissed on the face of the complaint only if no relief would be available on any set of facts consistent with the allegations of the complaint, even if it seemed far fetched and did not set forth facts in support of every element of a claim. This was the most bare bones stage of federal pleading and is still the de jure standard in some state and local courts, and the de facto standard in most courts of limited jurisdiction (e.g. hearing claims only up to $15,000\\).\n\nThe fourth and current standard of plausibility pleading, in which non\\-conclusory specific facts must be set forth sufficient to support the material elements of a claim for relief in a manner that is plausible in the eyes of the judge under a pair of U.S. Supreme Court cases known as *Twombly* and *Iqbal*. The fact that relief would be possible consistent with the facts set forth in the complaint, if it is not enough to make success plausible, is insufficient. Also, under this standard, one must have actual knowledge of the facts in support of a claim, rather than making allegations of facts necessary to make a claim plausible based merely upon \"information and belief.\" This makes complaints significantly longer. Given the vast discretion inherent in determining if a complaint is \"plausible\" in some areas of the law, there is a strong incentive to \"over write\" a complaint so that it includes detail that may not be legally necessary, because you don't know in advance how picky or skeptical the judge that your case is assigned to will be.\n\nIn addition to these four legal standards, the other issue is technology. It is much easier to cut and paste language into a complaint, and to attach copies of key documents supporting a legal case, than it was prior to computers and photocopiers and scanners and printers. The advent of electronic filing made filing of a long complaint even easier, avoiding the need to mail or hand deliver a large stack of documents in many cases.\n\nFrom a comparative perspective, there was once a time in recent history in Spanish jurisprudence, when, to file a lawsuit, you needed to include all of the documentary evidence and affidavits you intended to present in the case, literally wrapped in a ribbon.

This is supported by examples such as the 300+ page complaint that was held to be too long due to its disjointed nature and irrelevant content.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage mentions cases where complaints over 100 pages were accepted, such as the 70-page complaint with 30 pages of exhibits in a securities fraud case.\n\nOption B is false because the passage clearly outlines how pleading standards and acceptable complaint lengths have evolved over time, from the common law pleading era to the current plausibility pleading standard.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the current plausibility pleading standard actually encourages more detailed complaints to meet the \"plausibility\" requirement, often resulting in longer complaints compared to previous standards."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/68188/is-it-required-to-have-someone-on-premises", "docs_id": 68188, "title": "Is it required to have someone on premises?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say I have a premises that one can enter to do fun activities, costing \u20ac5 to enter.\n\nI was thinking that you could use a turnstile and an automated payment system to allow guests to enter the premises.\n\nThis means there wouldn't be a need for a manager/receptionist on the premises at all times (or at any time for that matter).\n\nI'm curious, however, if there is any legal requirement to have someone on the premises to keep an eye on things?

I consider it to be a [practical problem](https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) and hope for great answers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is right there in the quote:\n\n> any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\n\nSo if the data can in *any* way be tied to a specific individual then it is personal data. Note that you have to consider the data collection as a whole \\- even if there are no names in your data, if there is enough info in it that you can work out who the individual is (or probably is) its personal data.\n\nObvious things include names, dates of birth, physical addresses, electronic addresses, social media profiles etc. Less obvious things include job or profession, memberships of organisations, friends and associates, town/suburb etc. i.e. things that in combination can reduce the set of people it could be to a small number of individuals.\n\nBasically, if you collect and store information about individuals *in any way* you are caught by this regulation. Even an email address used for login is personal data in that it identifies an individual and tells a hacker that they use your software.\n\nExamples of what is *not* personal data includes information about [judicial persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality) (companies and other organisations that are sufficiently large that individual information cannot be inferred) or properly [anonomized data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization) where the data set is sufficiently large that identifying any particular individual is highly improbable (several dozen people at least depending on how revealing the data is).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing an app for EU citizens that collects user information.

An anonymized dataset of 100 users' purchasing habits, with no identifying information, is likely large enough and properly anonymized to prevent identification of individuals, making it not personal data under the regulation.\n\nC) Usernames are considered online identifiers and thus fall under personal data, even if only associated with post counts.\n\nD) While not as obvious as option A, this combination of job title, company size, and industry sector could potentially narrow down to identify an individual, especially in smaller companies or niche industries, thus qualifying as personal data.\n\nThe key is that personal data is any information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual.

The high likelihood that a street name is used in many locations in a state (e.g., Florida) precludes the identification of a specific natural person if someone else gained access to the version of data you store.\n\nIt is noteworthy, though, that storing the state (Florida) might defeat the purpose of omitting the initial portion of the IP address. That is because the distribution of IP addresses has some correspondence with geographical location unless the user is connecting through a VPN. \n\nAccordingly, you might want to assess which part(s) of the IP address is most judicious to omit or devise a different data implementation that enforces the purpose you have in mind (i.e., to prevent a user from making multiple attempts to win the lottery).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A website is running a lottery game where users can only participate once.
