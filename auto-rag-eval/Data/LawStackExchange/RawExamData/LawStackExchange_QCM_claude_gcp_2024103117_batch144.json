Filming other people does involve the processing of personal data, and GDPR will apply unless this is for \u201cpurely personal or household purposes\u201d.\n\nBut exactly that will be the case for most holiday snapshots or short clips for your personal social media. As far as I understand, you do not have to worry about purely personal activities.\n\nEven if GDPR would apply, this doesn't mean it would be illegal. It means you'd need a \u201clegal basis\u201d, such as a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d. If there are just a couple of people in the background of a video, it's possible that their rights might weigh less important than your interest in shooting the video \u2013 but that would need a case by case analysis.

Most examples given in military manuals, or which have been the object of condemnations, have been cases where persons were actually taken to military objectives in order to shield those objectives from attacks.\n\nThere have recently been claims that the opposite can constitute a war crime, where the placing of weapons within cities has been interpreted as breech of this law.

The legal definition of human shields, as interpreted by Western courts and international tribunals, typically involves deliberately using civilians to protect military objectives.

The laws of war apply equally to all parties regardless of their relative military strength.

The creativity of the employee is why the employer pay them to create these inventions. Examples of service inventions include product designs for business purposes of the employer produced by a designer whose work contract includes \"producing graphics design and other visual components\" as one of their duties. The key factor in determining whether an invention is a service invention is its close connection to contractual responsibilities in the employment contract, rather than the location or timing of the invention's creation.\n\nIncidental inventions are inventions that are not created in exercise of a listed contractual duty, but are still closely connected with the employee's employment. In such cases, the employer can reserve the right to acquire the employee's incidental inventions for fair compensation. An invention is likely incidental to employment if it is created in connection with work resources or during work time. However, even if the invention is created during the employee's free time, it may still qualify as an incidental invention if it is closely related to the employee's employment generally, even if the work contract does not explicitly foresee it. For example, a salesperson at a clothing store designs a better coat hanger, whether during work time or not, may be subject to the incidental invention rules. The invention or design is owned by the employee. But if the work contract reserved the right of acquisition, the employee must notify the employer, who then have six months to declare its intention to abandon the right or acquire the invention for a fair compensation. Otherwise, the salesperson is free to do whatever they want with their invention, subject to their other obligations. For example, the salesperson cannot use their invention rights in detriment to their current employer (e.g. selling the design to a competitor) due to their duty of loyalty under employment (but once the employment ceases, the duty ceases).\n\n---\n\nThe situation where an employee has similar intellectual work for multiple employers is rare in Switzerland. If a conflict of interest arises because a work can be argued to be the result of contractual obligations of more than one employer, the employee is likely in violation of their duty of loyalty to the employers unless consent was given. In the case of a service invention created pursuant to the contractual responsibilities to one employer only, that employer is the owner of the invention from the beginning. The incidental case does not apply since the first employer only has the right of acquisition from the employee, not the other employer.\n\nIn the case of incidental inventions, I did not find any cases settled by court. If an incidental invention was produced on the premises of the other employer or used the resources of the other employer, the other employer probably has the priority claim, possible conflict of interests notwithstanding. If the invention is created during the employee's free time and can be reasonably seen as within the general missions within the framework of both employers, it would be difficult to decide and the whole circumstance would need to be taken into account.\n\nIf the invention is created during the employee's free time and can be reasonably seen as within the general missions within the framework of both employers, it would be much more difficult to decide and the whole circumstance would need to be taken into account.\n\n---\n\nJust as a sidenote, softwares as such are protected by the copyright law, and do not usually qualify as an invention or design. The employer has the exclusive usage right of softwares created in employement duties. Incidental creations of softwares on the otherhand are not regulated by law, but usually dealt with in employement contracts.\n\n1.

The invention is related to both companies' general business areas, but not specifically mentioned in either employment contract. Both contracts reserve the right to acquire inventions produced by the employee. What is the most likely outcome in this situation?\n\nA) The invention automatically belongs to the company that pays the higher salary.\nB) The employee retains full ownership and can sell the invention to the highest bidder.\nC) The invention is split equally between both companies.\nD) The ownership would be determined by considering all circumstances, potentially leading to a complex legal dispute.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario falls under the category of \"incidental inventions\" in Swiss employment law. When an invention is created during an employee's free time and can be reasonably seen as within the general missions of both employers, it becomes a complex issue. The answer D is correct because, as stated in the source material, \"If the invention is created during the employee's free time and can be reasonably seen as within the general missions within the framework of both employers, it would be much more difficult to decide and the whole circumstance would need to be taken into account.\" This situation would likely lead to a complex legal dispute where various factors would need to be considered to determine the rightful owner or how the rights should be allocated.\n\nOption A is incorrect because salary is not a determining factor in such cases.

Is there some kind of theoretical/practical limit on how many people president can pardon at once or per day?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: She does not assume a power to pardon for state crimes. The main impediment is the practical one, since a vague order regarding victimless crimes may not be enforceable. POTUS has historically granted general amnesties, such as Lincoln's [Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction](https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/13/STATUTE-13-Pg737.pdf) which did not specify particular laws that were violated or individuals who violated the laws. Some degree of resistance to such an order (by prison officials and the judiciary) is to be expected, to the extent that the scope of an amnesty is ambiguous. The Lincoln proclamation is clear enough in its scope (it was triggered by taking an oath of allegiance and the persons to whom this remedy was not available are clearly\\-enough described).\n\nThere are on the order of 70,000 federal criminal convictions with sentencing every year, so probably over a million cases would be subject to review. She would need to sharpen the criteria, presumably by enumerating the applicable statutes. This may include or exclude convictions for perjury or lying to a federal officer. In an individual case, it could be argued that in this case, lying did not violate the rights of another person, but in that case it did \u2013 case by case review could be required. Violation of [18 USC 228 (Failure to pay legal child support obligations)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/228) might be considered to have a victim, or not, so just saying \"non\\-violent victimless crimes\" leaves open the question whether interstate refusal to pay child support is in the pardoned set.

While there is no theoretical limit on the number of pardons a president can issue, practically implementing a mass pardon for \"victimless crimes\" would face significant challenges. These include the need to clearly define what constitutes a victimless crime, enumerate specific applicable statutes, and potentially conduct case-by-case reviews for ambiguous situations. The president's pardon power is limited to federal crimes, not state crimes (eliminating option C). There are no constitutional restrictions on daily pardon numbers (eliminating option A). A vague order for all \"victimless crimes\" would likely face enforcement difficulties and resistance, requiring more precise criteria (eliminating option B)."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25435/when-should-a-constitution-or-bylaws-have-separate-articles-versus-sections-with", "docs_id": 25435, "title": "When should a constitution or bylaws have separate articles versus sections within an article?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My church is in the process of re\\-organizing our constitution and bylaws. Currently, we have individual articles for some elected positions. Others get defined only in context of the board that they lead.\n\nI've proposed having one article covering all elected officers (with sections for each officer). A second article would exist for all standing boards and committees (with a section for each).\n\nOne member of the committee raised the issue of definitions applying throughout an article and suggested that each officer and each board ought to have their own article.\n\nMy question boils down to this: What is the significance of having several closely\\-related topics under one article versus each of those topics having their own article?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When it makes more sense to do so\n---------------------------------\n\nRemember, the primary purpose of the document is to communicate; concisely and unambiguously \\- the drafting should be structured to best support that purpose.\n\nFor your problem\n----------------\n\nYou're both wrong. The constitution needs to deal with elected officials \\- it shouldn't concern itself with particular standing boards and subcommittees. \n\nSet up the rules for committees and allow *the* management committee (or whatever its called) to establish and dissolve subcommittees at its discretion. A \"annual fete\" committee might make sense now but in 15 years time when you no longer hold them its just silly to still have it in the constitution. Similarly, just because you have a committee of 8 now doesn't mean that that will always be the best number.\n\nBasically, don't lock in current practices \\- just because they work now doesn't mean they will always work and its way easier to change a practice by a committee resolution than by having to redraft the constitution ... *again*! As a foundational document it should only need to deal with high level issues like elections, dispute resolution, membership and management structure (rather than management practice).\n\nA few points to remember\n------------------------\n\n**Status of the constitution**\n\nYour constitution is a (quasi\\-)contract, not a constitution.\n\nThis means:\n\n1. That your church is subject to whatever state or national laws allow for your church to exist as an organisation. For example, in NSW, Australia the relevant law is the [ASSOCIATIONS INCORPORATION ACT 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aia2009307/). You should start with whatever legislation applies to you to make sure your constitution is in compliance with it. If it isn't then it isn't a valid constitution.\n2. Unlike a national constitution it can be externally enforced. That is, if the office bearers are breaking the rules someone can go to court to stop them. National constitutions must be internally enforced \\- a sufficiently powerful national office bearer can simply \"nope\" the court.\n\n**Reference that law, don't copy it**\n\nLaws change, if you have copied large swathes of it into your constitution then your constitution becomes invalid when they do.\n\nDon't redefine things the law deals with \\- if the law defines \"officers\" and \"committees\" don't come up with your own definitions for these things: adopt those (by reference).\n\n**Use a template**\n\nCheck the applicable legislation \\- it is not uncommon for it to incorporate a \"model constitution\", for [example](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/air2016398/sch1.html). If you start with this you have the advantage of knowing that it starts complying with the law and will be relatively common and familiar across many organisations; lowering the learning curve for new members/executives.\n\n**Write in [plain English](https://www.victorialawfoundation.org.au/plain-language-resources)**\n\nSee above\n\n**Keep it legal**\n\nThis doesn't just mean complying with legislation \\- it also means complying with common law principles like natural justice and procedural fairness. For example, if your constitution deals with disciplinary matters like expelling members, people are entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal.\n\n**Have a dictionary**\n\nFor terms with a definite meaning define these (by reference if appropriate) in one place at the start of the document \\- don't make people flick to the back just to work out what \"sub\\-committee\" means. Even better, put the document online as web pages with hyperlinks.\n\n**Don't prescribe**\n\nResist the temptation to be overly prescriptive or limiting on current or future office bearers/committees \\- trust them to act responsibly. You guys are reasonable people \\- why to you think your replacements won't be?\n\nFor example, don't set hard discretionary spending limits, set a rule which allows the management committee to set these at their discretion. After all the committee in 2047 is going to be in a better position to deal with the issues of 2047 than you are.\n\nThe constitution is a document that should *enable* the organisation to act, not prevent it from acting.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When drafting a constitution for a church organization, which of the following approaches is most appropriate according to the advice given?\n\nA) Include detailed articles for each elected position and standing committee to ensure comprehensive coverage\nB) Group all elected officers under one article and all standing boards and committees under another article for organizational clarity\nC) Focus on high-level issues like elections and management structure, allowing flexibility for specific committees to be established or dissolved as needed\nD) Copy relevant sections of state or national laws directly into the constitution to ensure compliance\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The advice given emphasizes focusing on high-level issues in the constitution rather than getting too specific about current practices or individual positions.

If the answer is the courts, what kind of remedies can they possibly provide?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The direct answer is simple \\-\\- the US Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 2\\) provides that electors are appointed in the manner that state legislatures direct \\-\\- so the answer is the state legislature decides. But state legislatures don't exist in a vacuum, and the reality is not so simple.\n\nState legislatures direct the manner of choosing electors by passing state laws, which, in the case the state decides to choose electors by holding some sort of popular election, include laws for how and when ballots can be cast or received, and how recounts are to work, etc. Normally, state laws are interpreted by state courts, and state courts can strike down or modify state laws if they find that the state laws violate the state constitution. And more fundamentally, state legislatures derive their authority from state constitutions, so in principle, state legislatures should not be able to perform any act that does not conform to the state constitution (which is interpreted by the state courts).\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court decision in *Bush v. Gore* (2000\\) overturned the Florida state supreme court ruling on how to conduct recounts in the Florida election for presidential electors. Normally, federal courts do not get involved in state law issues, but the decision was mostly made on equal protection grounds, and the equal protection clause is part of the federal Constitution. So federal courts can get involved if there is an issue that relates to federal law or Constitution. In the Bush v. Gore case, there was an interesting concurring opinion that said the Florida supreme court had acted contrary to the Florida legislature, but this opinion was only joined by 3 justices, so it is not binding.\n\nRecently, the issue came up again when the US Supreme Court declined to stay a decision by the Pennsylvania state supreme court that said the Pennsylvania constitution required mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received up to 3 days after Election Day to be counted, even though the state law said they must be received by Election Day. Notably, although the US Supreme Court declined the stay, the order listed that 4 conservative justices dissented and said that they would have granted the stay. This was before Justice Barrett was confirmed, so, now that she is confirmed, depending on her legal position on this issue, there might now be a majority of 5 justices that would intervene against the state court if such an issue were to come up again. The order did not list the legal reasoning for each of the dissenting justices, so it is unclear what legal justification they had in mind in agreeing to overrule the state court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical scenario where a state's supreme court interprets the state constitution to require an extension of mail-in ballot deadlines for a presidential election, contrary to the state legislature's enacted law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential resolution of this conflict?\n\nA) The U.S. Supreme Court has no jurisdiction and must defer to the state supreme court's interpretation of its own constitution.\n\nB) The state legislature's decision is automatically final due to the U.S. Constitution's grant of authority in choosing electors.\n\nC) The U.S. Supreme Court could potentially intervene, but only on grounds related to federal law or the U.S. Constitution.\n\nD) The governor of the state has the final authority to decide between the conflicting interpretations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the authority to direct the manner of choosing electors, the situation is more complex in practice. State courts typically interpret state laws and constitutions. However, the U.S. Supreme Court can intervene in state election matters if there are issues related to federal law or the U.S. Constitution, as seen in Bush v. Gore (2000) where the Court ruled on equal protection grounds. More recently, in the Pennsylvania case, four Supreme Court justices indicated willingness to intervene in a similar state court decision, suggesting that federal intervention remains a possibility, particularly if it involves federal constitutional issues. Option A is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court can intervene in certain circumstances. Option B oversimplifies the complex interplay between state legislatures, state courts, and federal courts.

Of these, based on the methodology you have described, I view fair comment as the more directly applicable defence, but it does really depend on what the content of the publication is.\n\n### Fair comment defence\n\nThe [test for fair comment is](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/5670/index.do):\n\n> (a) the comment must be on a matter of public interest;\n> \n> \n> (b) the comment must be based on fact;\n> \n> \n> (c) the comment, though it can include inferences of fact, must be recognisable as comment;\n> \n> \n> (d) the comment must satisfy the following objective test: could any \\[person] honestly express that opinion on the proved facts?\n> \n> \n> (e) even though the comment satisfies the objective test the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant was \\[subjectively] actuated by express malice.\n\nFor a fair comment defence, the receivers of the impugned statement must be able to identify the underlying facts on which the statement is based. Therefore, it would not be enough for the hypothesis to be \"reasonably based on facts\"; those facts need to be also published to the listeners/readers and a reasonable listener/reader needs to be able to associate the impugned statement as being based on those.\n\nAnother component of the fair comment defence is that the statement must be one of opinion, not fact.

Bob's statement appears to meet the criteria for the fair comment defense against defamation:\n\n1. It's on a matter of public interest (a murder case).\n2. It's based on facts that are presented in the article.\n3. It's recognizable as a comment or opinion (\"it is my opinion\").\n4. It could be an honest opinion based on the facts presented.\n5.

In your situation, this means that the owner occupying your space cannot bring a case in tort against you.\n\nWhile it is generally applied to harm to people, there is precedent (albeit in British case law) for the doctrine to be applied to vehicles, and specifically, to the situation you describe \\- see *[Arthur v Anker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_v_Anker#Judgment)* and *[Vine v London Borough of Waltham Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_v_London_Borough_of_Waltham_Forest)*.\n\nWhile cases from other jurisdictions are not binding, I have not been able to find any similar cases in the United States, and so it is possible that such cases will be persuasive.

That is, under the law, a financial firm does not make a legal determination regarding your rights to some part of the estate. There are many financial privacy laws that prevent institutions from dispensing private financial information, for example, I cannot get access to your bank records based on the fact (let us assume it were a fact) that I am your cousin, or that you have power of attorney to manage my mother's affairs. If we have a joint account, then I have an equal right to the account, but otherwise, the law protects the privacy of a person's financial records.\n\nThe only way to legally get the information you are interested in is to politely request it from the person who owns the account, or else to get a court order to compel such an accounting. I don't think there is a way to sue the institution to compel disclosure in this situation and leave the executor out of the matter, rather you have to sue the executor alleging a wrong\\-doing (the point being that you want to subpoena the records, and a court will not issue a subpoena just because you are curious: there has to be an actual court case).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where an individual is a beneficiary of an estate but not listed on the financial accounts associated with that estate, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their right to access account information?\n\nA) The beneficiary has an automatic legal right to review all financial records associated with the estate.\n\nB) The financial institution is required to provide account information to any named beneficiary upon request.\n\nC) The beneficiary must rely on the executor to provide financial information or seek a court order if they suspect wrongdoing.\n\nD) The beneficiary can force the financial institution to add them to the account to gain access to the information.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, beneficiaries do not have an automatic right to access financial records of accounts they are not listed on, even if those accounts are part of an estate they are set to inherit from. Financial institutions are bound by privacy laws that prevent them from disclosing information to individuals not listed on the account. The beneficiary must either rely on the executor to provide the necessary financial information or, if they suspect wrongdoing, seek a court order to compel disclosure of the information.

Anyone (as an individual or a group who conspires) who commits a crime can be indicted. (But, it's a fantasy to think that millions would be indicted as part of a conspiracy.)\n\nThe reason many people are not indicted for crimes is because they are not caught by law enforcement (LE) or because of the lack of the sheer numbers of LE required to pursue all criminals. And, if criminals are caught, the reason they may or may not be indicted is either prosecutorial discretion, i.e., a prosecutor decides not to indict because the crime isn't very serious. Or, probably much more relevant, is that there simply are not enough personnel in a county or state attorney's office to prosecute everyone who could be indicted. Prosecutors must oftentimes make decisions on who to indict and consider their available time, the seriousness of the crime, the available evidence and the possibilities of the success of their indictments.\n\nAnd, of course, politics sometimes comes into play; prosecutors may or may not pursue indictments because of political expediency, i.e. deporting an model citizen who also happens to be in the country illegally. But political pressure can work both ways, for and against prosecutorial discretion. Depending on your persuasion, it's either a bug or a feature in our legal system. But political influence and public opinion can also lead to changes in the legal system, as it is the representational branch of our governmental system that legislates the laws that the judicial system uses and enforces.

It could be justified because, for example, the grantor needs cash for a brain operation. Self\\-dealing (acting in one's own interest, which is a conflict of interest), is prohibited for a trustee. With real estate, \"fair market value\" is a fluid concept, but within limits one can determine that a sale (to self) at $900,000 undervalued the house and that a sale to another would have garnered $1,100,000, therefore this would be an illegal self\\-dealing. However, the simple act of a trustees purchasing an asset from a trust that he is the trustee of is not categorially prohibited.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Person X is both the sole trustee and beneficiary of an irrevocable asset protection trust containing various assets, including a house.

While self-dealing is generally prohibited, the documentation states that \"the simple act of a trustees purchasing an asset from a trust that he is the trustee of is not categorially prohibited.\"\n\nC is correct. X may purchase the house, but must do so at fair market value and be able to justify the sale as being in the best interest of the trust (e.g., if liquidating the asset is necessary for some important purpose).\n\nD goes beyond what's required.

The\u00a0 procedure to obtain material in an evidential format from, say, a foreign service provider is not RIPA but usually via an [International Letter of Request](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_rogatory) which *may negate the need for the key* if it can't be cracked by digital forensics investigators.\nThe ILOR will specify what the UK authorities are seeking which may be just the key but will probably be a portion of, if not the entirety of, the available stored data relating to the username, IP or any other identifier **therefore making the need for the key redundant**. It's then up to the receiving jurisdiction to decide on the format with which to proceed (terminology varies around the world so it could be called a warrant, production order, writ etc).

Contracts 101 teaches that whether a communication from one party to another constitutes an actionable offer, as distinguished from mere preliminary communications or an invitation to make an offer, is a fact\\-intensive inquiry, looking at all the circumstances.\n\n...\n\n> Some online retailers have adopted website terms and conditions that attempt to overcome such uncertainties by explicitly characterizing the customer\u2019s order as the offer, thereby leaving the retailer free to reject it for any reason, including because the advertised price was erroneous. Others simply reserve the right to cancel orders, either for any reason or specifically where the posted price was erroneous. In addition, even absent such contractual hedges, under the common law doctrine of unilateral mistake of fact, a contract is voidable if its enforcement despite one party\u2019s mistake regarding a material term such as price would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d or if the other party \u201chad reason to know of the mistake . . . .\u201d Thus, at least where a posted price is so egregiously low\u2014or, in Razor\u2019s case, a coupon so dramatically over\\-generous\u2014that a reasonable consumer would suspect it is a mistake, this doctrine would entitle the retailer to repudiate the contract.\n> \n> \n> On the other hand, none of these safeguards is necessarily ironclad. The unilateral mistake doctrine is so obviously fact\\-dependent that in all but the most egregious circumstances, its applicability is likely to be disputable. Using agreed terms and conditions to avoid the otherwise\\-uncertain application of general contractual rules is a time\\-honored strategy. But online terms and conditions are both adhesive in nature and subject to special FTC rules requiring that they be \u201cclear and conspicuous.\u201d Thus, their enforceability is also inherently very fact\\-bound. And whatever protection the common law and artful drafting might provide in other circumstances, some states impose particular obligations on retailers when it comes to honoring the prices they advertise, however egregious the error.\n\nIn the *Telegraph*'s story [\"Do retailers have to honour pricing mistakes?\"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/10602641/Price-glitches-Do-retailers-have-to-honour-pricing-mistakes.html) it is said that:\n\n> The legally binding contract is complete when a retailer accepts an order. However, acceptance does not necessarily happen at the point of order. Even the confirmation email may not be an acceptance. Some retailers reserve the right to cancel an order up to the point of delivery. It is therefore important to carefully check the retailer\u2019s terms and conditions (which must be available on their website) and emails \u2013 if a retailer simply acknowledges an order, there may be no contract at that point.\n\nIn short, this is a very fact\\-specific question, and the details of what was posted on the site of the firm involved will matter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchases a ticket for an event in London through an online retailer at a significantly discounted price.

After the patient returns home, Dr. Smith provides follow-up care via telemedicine. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this arrangement?\n\nA) Dr. Smith can legally provide telemedicine follow-up care to the Wisconsin patient without any additional licensing, as the initial in-person treatment occurred in Texas.\n\nB) Dr. Smith must obtain a full medical license in Wisconsin to provide any follow-up care via telemedicine to the patient in Wisconsin.\n\nC) Dr. Smith's ability to provide telemedicine follow-up care depends on the specific regulations of both Texas and Wisconsin, which may require additional licensing or have exceptions for established doctor-patient relationships.\n\nD) Dr. Smith can only provide telemedicine follow-up care if Wisconsin and Texas have a reciprocity agreement for medical licensing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legality of telemedicine practice across state lines varies greatly depending on the specific regulations of the states involved. Some states require full licensure for any patient care, while others offer special telemedicine licenses or have exceptions for ongoing care. The answer acknowledges that both Texas and Wisconsin's regulations would need to be considered, and that there may be specific provisions for established doctor-patient relationships. Options A and B are too absolute, not accounting for the variability in state laws.

Each country in the world is a jurisdiction. Sub\\-national entities like states, provinces and municipalities may be a jurisdiction depending on the operation of law in the country they are part of. Some supra\\-national bodies like the EU and the UN are jurisdictions. To some extent, even companies, clubs and similar bodies are jurisdictions to the extent that they can make, interpret and enforce its own rules.\n\nA jurisdiction can decide that it has jurisdiction based on a whole raft of matters including:\n\n* where the event took place\n* where the party(s) are resident\n* where the party(s) are citizens\n* registration of things like planes, trains and automobiles\n* if money passed through their financial system\n* etc.\n\nA court or tribunal *has* jurisdiction if the jurisdiction has jurisdiction and it is the correct body within its jurisdiction to hear a particular matter.\n\n**Which laws apply?**\n\nOnce a court or tribunal has decided that it does have jurisdiction it then needs to know what law to apply. This may be the law of their jurisdiction or another jurisdiction or both.\n\n**Example**\n\nFor example, imagine there is a company in New York, USA that sells a product to a consumer in New South Wales, Australia. Further suppose that the contract says it will be governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada (don't ask me why).\n\nIn the event of dispute, let's say the consumer begins proceedings in the Local Court in New South Wales. The New York company petitions the court to say that the correct forum is the court in Ontario, or New York, or Mexico where the product shipped from but certainly not New South Wales.\n\nThe court in New South Wales will consider the jurisdictional arguments and decide if it does or does not have jurisdiction. If it decides that it doesn't then the customer would have to bring an action somewhere else (where the process repeats). Worth noting that the New York company would be precluded from arguing in that forum that New South Wales was the right jurisdiction because they can't have their cake ...\n\nIf it decides that it does have jurisdiction then it would consider what law applies. Its quite probable that they would accept that the contract is governed by Quebec law. However, Australian law, most specifically the Australian Consumer Law would also apply.

Option D is correct because:\n\n1. The Victorian court has the authority to determine if it has jurisdiction, considering factors like where the consumer resides and where the transaction occurred.\n2. If it accepts jurisdiction, the court isn't limited to applying only local law or only the law specified in the contract.\n3. The court may apply British Columbia law to contractual matters as per the agreement, but Australian consumer protection laws would likely still apply.\n4. For any tort claims, the court might need to consider whether Victorian or California law is more appropriate.\n5.

Here's how I think a court would treat each of them:\n\n1. This transaction is itself illegal. When a transaction is illegal or for an illegal purpose, courts will not intervene and will just let the parties live with whatever happened. So if I bought a bag of pot from you and got home to discover oregano, a court wouldn't care \\-\\- at least not if we came in on a breach\\-of\\-contract case. Of course, there would be separate criminal sanctions possible.\n2. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the buyer would have several theories by which he could recover the price of the vehicle from the dealer: warranty of title, unilateral mistake, fraud, etc. But the buyer might not actually want to do that. Because he's what the UCC considers a \"bona fide purchaser\" he may be able to keep the car, even if the original owner tried to recover it.\n3. The fact that the software doesn't comply with regulations probably doesn't make the sale itself illegal.

This scenario most closely aligns with the third example in the provided information.

The situation is legally complex, and the landlord's rights may be limited.

The constitution is drafted by statespersons within the state and voted on in a referendum within the state or within the area that is proposed to become a new state.\n\nIn all but one instance, when Congress as admitted a new state to the Union, a new constitution of that state took effect at the time of admission and superseded whatever system of governance existed there before that, and a new governor and other new officers of the state (legislators, judges, etc.) began their terms.\n\nBefore March 4, 1791, a polity then called the State of Vermont was neither one of the states of the Union nor a territory governed under and according to an act of Congress (as was done in many territories later), but was under a constitution drafted and put into effect within Vermont without any participation from outside Vermont, just as in states of the Union. In October 1790 Thomas Chittenden was sworn in to a one\\-year term as governor of the State of Vermont, succeeding Moses Robinson who had likewise been sworn in as governor of the State of Vermont one year earlier, and less than five months later when Vermont was admitted to the Union, he continued uninterrupted in the same one\\-year term as governor of the State of Vermont under the same constitution of the State of Vermont, as did all judges, sheriffs, members of the Governor's Council, etc.\n\nSo now my terminology question: Should one say that this was the only state that did not undergo an **internal constitutional discontinuity** at the time of its admission, or would some other phrasing be more correct or otherwise better?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Law and language: You are asking the wrong question**\n\nI take your point, but I'd say you are asking the wrong question. The more interesting question is why Vermont did not need to change its constitution upon statehood. The answer is simple: Vermont had this constitution because, **from its beginning,** Vermont's citizens **hoped for statehood.** They made this clear in their very first constitution, written in 1777\\. After explaining at length why Vermont could not remain in either the British Empire or New York state, the [preamble](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/vt01.asp) says Vermont should be:\n\n> a *free and independent State*; and a...proper form of government, should exist in it, *derived from*, and *founded on*, the *authority of the people* only, **agreeable to the direction of the honorable American Congress.**\n\nExcept for Vermont, Texas, California and West Virginia, the rest of the new states needed new constitutions because they had been territories of the US before statehood. As such, they did not have constitutions.\n\nOnly Vermont and Texas were \"independent\" until statehood. Unlike Vermont, Texas **had** to change its constitution before statehood because its constitution explicitly provided for national powers. For example, [Sections](https://tarltonapps.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1836/a2) 4 and 5 of Article II of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas gave its Congress the power to:\n\n* To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and to regulate captures.\n* To provide and maintain an army and navy, and to make all laws and regulations necessary for their Government.\n\nObviously, these powers are inconsistent with statehood.\n\n**How to talk about drastic change in governance institutions**\n\nI see what you mean about there being a discontinuity, but I'd be wary of mathy metaphors, such as discontinuities, bifurcations, catastrophes or singularities. I'd stick with words commonly used to describe drastic constitutional change. For example, \"Vermont was the only new state that did not have a *constitutional revolution* when it became a state.\"\n\nHaving said that, I realize that constitutional historians and others love to talk about continuities, so why not use discontinuity? My only caveat is that usually, they are talking more broadly than your wording (\"a discontinuity\") suggests.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which statement most accurately describes Vermont's unique situation when it joined the Union, compared to other states?\n\nA) Vermont was the only state that maintained constitutional continuity upon admission, as it had deliberately designed its constitution for eventual statehood.\n\nB) Vermont experienced an internal constitutional discontinuity like all other states, but kept the same governor in office.\n\nC) Vermont was forced to adopt a new constitution upon admission, but chose to keep its existing governmental structure.\n\nD) Vermont's admission process was identical to that of Texas, as both were independent before joining the Union.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct because Vermont uniquely maintained its existing constitution upon admission to the Union. This was possible because Vermont had deliberately crafted its constitution with the hope of eventual statehood, making it compatible with U.S. membership from the outset.\n\nB is incorrect because Vermont did not experience a constitutional discontinuity. It maintained its existing constitution and governmental structure.\n\nC is incorrect because Vermont was not forced to adopt a new constitution. It kept its existing one, which was already suitable for statehood.\n\nD is incorrect because while both Vermont and Texas were independent before joining the Union, their admission processes differed significantly. Texas had to change its constitution to remove national powers incompatible with statehood, while Vermont did not need to make such changes."}}
