This case happened in the UK (England to be specific, should that make a difference).\n\nAbout two weeks ago, a colleague of mine told me that while getting their mortgage application sorted through a mortgage broker, the mortgage broker offered some insurances to protect him and his family for the duration of the mortgage (life insurance and income protection), as he seemingly was working together with some insurance companies to offer that as part of the mortgage application. My colleague was hesitant to sign any deal on the spot, as he wanted to review all of the policies / quotes before signing anything, as insurances were never covered before in any of the appointments. He then felt pressured by the broker who seemingly was using typical sales techniques (\"only I can offer these quotes\", etc.) to which he then just replied that he will not make a decision on that during their meeting and insisted on review the policies / quotes, which makes sense to me.\n\nThey agreed to have a follow\\-up meeting to discuss this, but the mortgage broker never called again. Much to their surprise, they later received a letter from one of the policies who confirmed they have set up the direct debit for their insurance and that payment would be taken once the mortgage payments would start. They had, however, since looked for alternative policies and decided to go with a different policy and so basically had now two life insurances, one of which they didn't need and which was arranged by their mortgage broker without explicit consent (email, telephone, signature, etc.). In\\-fact, they wanted to inform the mortgage broker in the follow\\-up meeting that they had gone with a different insurance company but figured that since the mortgage broker never showed up again they do not need to inform him then (they did not assume the mortgage broker would take out insurance in their name without getting permission beforehand to do so).\n\nThey were able to get out of that by talking to the insurance company but were quite upset with their mortgage broker (understandably).

While the broker's actions are questionable, several factors complicate the scenario:\n\n1. Agency: The documentation states that \"a life insurance agent is an agent of the insurer, whereas a mortgage broker is your friend's agent.\" This means the broker's actions regarding life insurance could be considered as actions of the insurer from the client's perspective.\n\n2. Lack of damages: The client suffered no financial loss as they were able to cancel the policy.

Potential misunderstanding: The documentation suggests applying Hanlon's Razor, indicating that miscommunication or misunderstanding could be at play rather than malicious intent.\n\nOption C is the most accurate because it acknowledges the potential ethical violation while recognizing the lack of grounds for a lawsuit due to the absence of financial harm. This aligns with the complex interplay of agency, ethics, and legal standing described in the documentation.

What if the landlord decides to send a bill of $500 for trash. That would unreasonable. Does this hypothetical tenant have any legal standing to demand itemized computation. Would such a tenant have a chance of winning a case if they would pursue a case against a landlord in the California Court of Law demanding either reduction of the cost or rendering this porsion of the lease invalid.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> would the tenant have any right to demand detailed explanation how to the bill is calculated or the lease is pretty solid and the tenant must absorb whatever charges the landlord throws at them.\n\nThe clause is valid, but it does not entitle the landlord to arbitrariness or discretion. The method is explicit in that tenants are to be charged \"*\\[t]he provider's bills*\".\n\nLandlord's evasion of tenant's scrutiny causes reasonable suspicion of *breach of contract* and/or *breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing*. That covenant is implied in every contract.\n\nDuring court proceedings, the tenant will be entitled to conduct discovery on the defendant landlord, the non\\-party provider, and other non\\-parties who might be relevant to the claim(s).\n\nSince the clause is valid, relief in the form of striking that clause from the lease seems unlikely to be granted. In case of overcharge, the relief for breach of contract will be primarily in the form of reimbursements plus interest (see sections [3300](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=4.&title=2.&part=1.&chapter=2.&article=1.) *et seq* of CA Civil Code), or the corresponding deductions on subsequent bills.

Which legal strategy would be most effective for the tenant to pursue?\n\nA) File a lawsuit to invalidate the entire utility clause in the lease\nB) Withhold rent payments until the landlord provides a detailed explanation\nC) Pursue discovery during legal proceedings to obtain billing records from the provider\nD) Report the landlord to the San Francisco Rent Board for unfair pricing practices\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the lease terms, tenant rights, and legal procedures in California. The most effective strategy is C) Pursue discovery during legal proceedings to obtain billing records from the provider. \n\nWhile the lease clause is valid, it doesn't allow for arbitrary charges. The landlord's refusal to provide details raises suspicions of a potential breach of contract or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the clause itself is likely valid, making it difficult to invalidate entirely. Option B (withholding rent) could put the tenant in breach of the lease and is not recommended without legal guidance. Option D may not be effective as the Rent Board typically deals with rent control issues, not utility billing disputes.\n\nPursuing discovery during legal proceedings allows the tenant to legally compel the landlord and utility provider to produce detailed billing records. This approach addresses the core issue of transparency, provides evidence for potential overcharging, and aligns with California civil procedure. It also tests the integration of contract law, landlord-tenant regulations, and legal strategy, requiring critical thinking beyond simple memorization of facts."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26710/can-an-unfinished-product-be-patented", "docs_id": 26710, "title": "Can an unfinished product be patented?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say two companies are working on some software that does essentially the same thing: Can one of the companies patent the idea before it's finished to prevent the other company from working on it, or can they only patent the software once they have a working product? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Patenting does not require a working product in fields where the performance is predictable before hand.

The correct answer, C, is the most advantageous strategy because:\n\n1. The documentation states that patenting \"does not require a working product in fields where the performance is predictable before hand,\" which likely applies to software development.\n\n2. The patent application needs to be \"detailed enough that someone of ordinary skill in the field could make and use the invention.\" This suggests that rushing with minimal details (option A) would be insufficient.\n\n3.

We don't process any personal data, but we place an analytic cookie (to recognize returning visitors) so we need to ask for the consent. Do we have to store this consent?\n\nWe don't process any personal data so we don't need privacy policy, only cookie policy explaining that we place an analytics cookie. But storing this consent, requires us to store user identifiable information about the consent: user (IP), date, consent version etc.\n\nSo, to have non\\-personal data cookie, we need to create privacy policy for recording information about user who agreed to that non\\-personal cookie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cookies are information stored on the end users device and require consent\u00b9 per the ePrivacy directive, even if the cookies or similar technologies don't contain personal data. Conditions for consent are defined by the GDPR. This was also confirmed by the \"Planet49\" case.\n\n1\\. consent is required unless the storage of or access to information on the end users device is either strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user, or necessary for technical reasons. E.g. functional cookies like a shopping cart feature in a web shop are fine, as are cookies used solely for security purposes or technical features like TLS session resumption.\n\nIt is however likely that this cookie does qualify as personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The cookie contains an ID that lets you single out/distinguish this user from all other users, even though that ID doesn't link the user to a real\\-world identity. It is also possible to argue that the cookie is entirely anonymous, but the safer approach is to treat it as personal data. Similarly, other features of the website necessarily involve the processing of personal data, such as processing the user's IP address, if only for the purpose of responding to their HTTP requests.\n\nThe GDPR's criteria for valid consent are mainly about ensuring that the consent is a freely given unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. For example, consent can never be the default, it needs to be an opt\\-in. However, Art 7(1\\) GDPR says that the data controller has the burden of proof of showing that valid consent was given. The GDPR itself does not provide further guidance on what this means specifically. I would argue that it can be decomposed into two aspects:\n\n* Showing that *valid* consent was given. The manner in which you ask for consent must enable a free choice, and must respect that \"no consent\" is the default. For example, you could archive screenshots of the cookie management flow to show that there is a free choice. You could archive the frontend software so that it can be demonstrated that the cookie is not set until consent is given.\n* Showing that *this user* gave consent. There is a wide variety of opinions on how to do that.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the existence of a cookie paired with a valid consent flow to set that cookie demonstrates that the cookie can only have been set in a valid manner.\n\nHowever, there are consent management solutions that provide additional insight, such as the user's entire history of giving and revoking consent. For example, the user's browser might generate a pseudonymous ID enabling that user's consent history to be stored on some server. Indeed, that would be personal data, and this would have to be disclosed transparently. It would not be valid to use the consent management information for other purposes, for example by using the consent management ID for analytics purposes.\n\nStoring the user's consent history is definitely appropriate if you have a concept of identity, such as for signed\\-in users. I have doubts whether this is also helpful on websites that don't have user accounts, and I have not heard of a case where the existence of such records made a difference. After all, such records can only be relevant if the user gave consent but later disputes this in a complaint with a DPA or in a lawsuit.\n\nWhich approach to choose will depend on more specific guidance provided by your country's data protection authority, and on the risk balance appropriate for your business. After all, the purpose of such compliance work is not to be 100% safe from lawsuits, but to reduce risks from enforcement/litigation to acceptable levels. What is acceptable is ultimately a business decision. E.g. the only 100% safe way to do web analytics is to have no analytics at all, but that is not acceptable for most businesses.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small e-commerce website uses a single analytics cookie to recognize returning visitors without processing any other personal data.

There are also specific exemptions where a minor can possess a firearm (e.g. temporarily for hunting or target practice).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A gun enthusiast in Oregon wants to transfer a firearm to his neighbor's 17-year-old son, who is an avid hunter. The transfer is not for immediate use in hunting. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The transfer is legal as long as the minor's parent provides written consent.\nB) The transfer must be conducted through a licensed dealer with a background check on the minor's parent.\nC) The transfer is illegal due to the recipient's age, regardless of parental consent or method of transfer.\nD) The transfer can proceed without paperwork if the gun is temporarily loaned for a specific hunting trip.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves multiple complex aspects of Oregon's firearm transfer laws. According to ORS 166.435, most firearm transfers between individuals require going through a licensed dealer and conducting a background check. However, there are exceptions for certain family members, which don't apply in this case as the neighbor's son is not a relative listed in subsection (4)c.\n\nMore critically, ORS 166.250 makes it illegal for a minor to possess a firearm, with specific exemptions for temporary possession during activities like hunting or target practice. The question specifies that the transfer is not for immediate use in hunting, ruling out this exemption.\n\nOption A is incorrect because parental consent alone does not override the prohibition on minor possession. Option B is incorrect because even if conducted through a dealer, the transfer would still be illegal due to the recipient's age. Option D touches on a valid exemption but doesn't apply here as the transfer is not described as temporary or for an immediate hunting trip.\n\nThe correct answer is C because, given the information provided, any transfer of firearm possession to a minor in this scenario would be illegal under Oregon law, regardless of the method of transfer or parental consent. This question requires integrating knowledge of transfer requirements, exceptions, and age restrictions, while also considering the specific context provided."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31394/how-does-the-us-legal-system-treat-car-accidents-with-pedestrian-casualties", "docs_id": 31394, "title": "How does the US legal system treat car accidents with pedestrian casualties?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 2 years ago in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a guy was driving 105 km/h (max allowed 60\\) through red light and killed two teenage girls on crosswalk. He didn't even bother to stop. Instead, he called his sister and friend to get him to Serbia border where he fled to Serbia. Later he turned himself and was extradited to Bosnia where the trial began. Now the trial is over and he is accused of \"causing general danger\" and \"not helping injured\", but there is no mention of killing someone. The prosecutors want the maximum sentence for those two crimes which is, I believe, only 8 years. \n\nSo, how would the crime be treated in the US? What would be the charges? What is the maximum sentence he could get?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that this wasn't a planned murder or assault, the most serious charge would be vehicular homicide. In the US, this is governed by state law, but states are not radically different in whether this is a crime. In Washington, under [RCW 46\\.61\\.520](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.520), vehicular homicide is a [class A felony](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.20&full=true), punishable by\n\n> imprisonment in a state correctional institution for a maximum term\n>  fixed by the court of not less than twenty years, or by a fine in an\n>  amount fixed by the court of not more than fifty thousand dollars, or\n>  by both such imprisonment and fine\n\nThe crimes is defined as causing death while driving\n\n> (a) While under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, as\n>  defined by RCW 46\\.61\\.502; or (b) In a reckless manner; or (c) With\n>  disregard for the safety of others.\n\nand such speeding is highly likely to be found to constitute the element of recklessness. There are also [hit\\-and\\-run charges](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.52.020), which is a class B felony (10 years and $20,000\\). A person can be found guilty of both charges, and the judge can apply the prison sentences consecutively, meaning you add them up, rather than serve the jail time at the same time (in this case, essentially dispensing with the hit\\-and\\-run term). The law is written so that a killing is a crime, and if you kill two people that could be two charges (the question is whether there is a single act or two \u2013 most likely there was a single act in this particular case). There is no state where recklessly killing a person while driving is legal.\n\nFirst degree murder could be considered under [9A.32\\.030](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.32&full=true) if a person \"Under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life, he or she engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to any person, and thereby causes the death of a person\". That kind of charge was applied to the [Charlottesville driver](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/driver-accused-of-plowing-into-charlottesville-crowd-killing-heather-heyer-due-in-court/2017/12/13/6cbb4ce8-e029-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?utm_term=.dc8dd11b7d35), but it is highly unlikely to be applied to even the most extreme speeding.\n\nThe actual penalty imposed depends on the sentencing laws of the state. In Washington there is a complex calculation based on the severity of the crime (16 degrees \u2013 vehicular homicide is level 11\\), prior criminal history, whether there are multiple convictions (vehicular homicide and hit\\-and\\-run). Aggravating and mitigating circumstances can also be considered to compute the actual sentence; I don't see any way for a non\\-specialist to guess what the actual penalty would be in this case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A driver in the United States causes a fatal accident by speeding excessively through a red light, killing two pedestrians, and then fleeing the scene. Which combination of charges and potential consequences would most accurately reflect how this case would be treated in the US legal system?\n\nA) Vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run, with a maximum combined sentence of 10 years\nB) Two counts of first-degree murder, with a potential life sentence without parole\nC) Vehicular homicide and hit-and-run, with potential consecutive sentences totaling 30 years or more\nD) Causing general danger and failure to render aid, with a maximum combined sentence of 8 years\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C, which most accurately reflects how such a case would be treated in the US legal system.\n\nVehicular homicide would be the primary charge, as the documentation states it applies when causing death while driving \"in a reckless manner\" or \"with disregard for the safety of others.\" Excessive speeding through a red light clearly meets this criteria. In many states, like Washington, vehicular homicide is a class A felony with a potential maximum sentence of 20 years or more.\n\nAdditionally, fleeing the scene would result in hit-and-run charges, which the documentation describes as a class B felony with up to 10 years of imprisonment. \n\nImportantly, the question mentions two fatalities. While the documentation suggests that in this case it might be considered a single act, it also notes that killing two people could potentially result in two charges. \n\nFurthermore, the explanation states that sentences can be applied consecutively, meaning they are added together rather than served concurrently. This supports the potential for a combined sentence of 30 years or more.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the combined sentence is too low given the severity of the crimes. Option B is incorrect because first-degree murder charges would be highly unlikely in this scenario, as the documentation explicitly states. Option D mirrors the charges mentioned in the Bosnia case but does not accurately reflect how such a case would be treated in the US legal system.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple legal concepts and application to a real-world scenario, rather than simple memorization of facts."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37311/can-you-unilaterally-renege-on-a-signed-contract-if-the-other-party-tries-to-pus", "docs_id": 37311, "title": "Can you unilaterally renege on a signed contract if the other party tries to push you into doing something illegal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question came up when I was reading this recent thread:\n\n[Is it illegal to infringe copyright if your boss or your client ordered you to do it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37252/is-it-illegal-to-infringe-copyright-if-your-boss-or-your-client-ordered-you-to-d)\n\nin which that the poster was asking about a scenario where that someone was hired to develop a piece of software as a freelancer, and their hirer told them they needed to install some software to complete the job and, moreover, that the way they were to get this software was to download it illegally from a pirate site.

Suppose that also, the contract explicitly states that they are not going to have to pay for any additional software that will be required in the course of construction. Now, the hirer, during the course of development, asks the person to download a necessary component illegally. The developer is aware of this law and points out to them, as mentioned in the answers, that to do so is to commit a crime. The hirer responds with \"I don't want to pay for it, here you go, now download it\" and also that sie will not accept software developed with another tool. You tell them again, point blank, it's a crime. They repeat the demand. Then, in response, with no further warning, not feeling up to doing the job anymore, you, the developer, simply walk away and abscond from the contract of your own volition and agency as a free human being, never delivering anything and just letting it go.\n\nThe question is:\n\n* how serious is what you have done, legally? If the contractor tries to take you to court for a breach and you argue you didn't do nuffin because it said explicitly that you would not incur any fees and the hirer was demanding a criminal act on your part, would you be able to be absolved of any liability?

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Legally, a contract becomes void if it requires illegal actions. When the client demanded the use of pirated software, they effectively voided the contract. This protects the developer from liability for breach of contract.\n\n2. The \"no additional cost\" clause doesn't implicitly allow illegal actions. It's more likely interpreted as the client being responsible for necessary legitimate software costs.\n\n3.

States can impose wealth taxes, although this doesn't clarify the validity of a federal wealth tax. States have broader taxing power than the federal government in terms of kinds of taxes that they may constitutionally impose.\n\nA state may impose any tax (1\\) that does not unduly discriminate against a federally protected constitutional civil liberty (like freedom of the press), (2\\) that does not purport to tax the federal government (arguably any other sovereign) without its consent, (3\\) that does not unduly discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4\\) that has some rational basis.\n\nApart from these specific limitations and (5\\) any found in state law or the state's constitution, (6\\) a state's taxing power is plenary as to conduct or activity or property that has a sufficient connection to the state to provide it with jurisdiction. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case repealed some clear rules of the road regarding what states do not have the jurisdiction to tax, effectively increasing state tax jurisdiction considerably, for example, to impose sales taxes on Internet retailers.\n\n> the biggest problem for a state like California trying to extract\n> revenue from its uber\\-wealthy populace would be that they would simply\n> move their residence and use any other possible legal loophole to\n> avoid having to pay.\n\nThis is true. The primary question regarding the validity of a state wealth tax would not be whether a state could impose a wealth tax, but what assets could a state make subject to its state wealth tax. This might be easy to answer in the case of real property, but hard in the case of intangible property or property held via entities. Federal statutes may, however, establish which states have jurisdiction to tax which assets with a state wealth tax as part of the power to regulate interstate commerce, or by ratifying a compact reached between multiple states which have state wealth taxes.\n\nStill the facts that many countries in the European Union impose or have historically imposed wealth taxes that generate significant tax revenue, despite the easy ability to the affluent to relocated to other countries in the E.U. that is closely analogous to that of U.S. states seeking to do the same thing, suggest that this is not an insurmountable task, even if there might be some leakage of untaxed wealth at the margins.\n\nThe Validity of Federal Wealth Taxes\n====================================\n\nIn contrast, Congress may only impose taxes expressly authorized by some provision of the U.S. Constitution as amended. The applicable case law on the issue of the constitutionality of a federal wealth tax is not entirely settled.\n\nThe gift, estate and generation skipping transfer tax system has been held to be constitutional, but since this is a tax imposed on transfers of wealth, it is arguably a tax in lieu of an income tax treated separately for ease of administration (since gifts and inheritances are within the core definition of income in the Internal Revenue Code at Section 63, but then specifically exempted from income taxation in lieu of donative transfer taxes like the gift and estate tax, in a separate statutory Section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code.).\n\nFederal property taxes in areas not in exclusively federal jurisdiction (e.g. Virginia rather than the U.S. Virgin Islands) were briefly in force in the 1700s, but were repealed before they could be subject to a constitutional challenge.\n\nIncome taxes, even at 90% marginal tax rates, have been upheld as valid.\n\nThe analysis and doctrines involved are rather involved for a short answer in this forum, and I am fairly certain that there is published legal scholarship arguing both sides of this question of first impression.\n\nIn a nutshell, a federal tax must either be an income tax; tax imposed on states rather than individuals on a per capita basis; or an excise tax or duty or tariff. The first two types of taxes are comparatively well defined. The third is the subject of thin, mushy and somewhat inconsistent or indeterminate case law.\n\nOne could argue, for example, that a wealth tax is really a form of income tax on imputed income from assets that could generate additional value to the owner even if the value that arises from this ownership is not monetized or realized. This argument would be particularly strong if wealth taxes paid with respect to an asset were allowed as a tax credit against taxes imposed on income generated by that same asset, in a manner similar to the foreign tax credit today.\n\nA wealth tax clearly isn't a per capita tax on a state government. No such tax has ever been imposed for any meaningful amount of time and has never been a more than nominal source of federal revenues if it has ever generated any federal revenues.\n\nThere is also a credible argument that a wealth tax is a constitutionally valid excise tax or duty or tariff, focusing on the excise tax component, which is quite ill defined, because the courts have tended to side with the government on issues of the scope of the federal power to tax except in the clearest and most blatant cases of violations of the federal power to tax.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about state and federal wealth taxes, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy tech entrepreneur based in California is concerned about a potential state wealth tax. They own significant real estate in California, have the majority of their wealth in stock options of their California-based company, and maintain a vacation home in Nevada. Which of the following strategies would be most likely to successfully reduce their exposure to a California wealth tax while considering legal and practical constraints?\n\nA) Establish residency in Nevada and argue that all intangible assets should be taxed there\nB) Transfer ownership of California real estate to a Nevada-based LLC\nC) Relocate the company headquarters to Nevada and claim all stock options are now Nevada-based assets\nD) Maintain California residency but challenge the tax based on undue discrimination against interstate commerce\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is A for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"the primary question regarding the validity of a state wealth tax would not be whether a state could impose a wealth tax, but what assets could a state make subject to its state wealth tax.\" Establishing residency in Nevada would be the strongest argument for shifting the taxable location of intangible assets like stock options.\n\n2. Real estate in California would likely still be subject to California's wealth tax regardless of residency, as the documentation mentions this would be \"easy to answer in the case of real property.\" Thus, option B would not be effective.\n\n3. Option C, while potentially reducing some tax exposure, would face significant practical challenges. The documentation notes that moving large tech companies would be \"immeasurably expensive\" due to reliance on \"an elite talent pool that is very locale-centric.\"\n\n4. Option D is unlikely to succeed because the documentation states that a valid state tax merely needs to \"not unduly discriminate against interstate commerce\" and have \"some rational basis.\" A wealth tax applied equally to residents would likely meet this standard.\n\n5. While option A doesn't eliminate all California tax exposure, it provides the strongest legal argument for reducing the tax base, particularly for intangible assets which are often the largest component of tech entrepreneurs' wealth.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of legal concepts, practical business considerations, and understanding of asset types and jurisdictional issues in taxation."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34363/interpretation-of-the-document-speaks-for-itself-in-answer-to-a-complaint", "docs_id": 34363, "title": "Interpretation of &quot;the document speaks for itself&quot; in answer to a complaint?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've got a question about the complaint/answer process in the context of Maryland regarding a Trust.

The defendant's answer to this allegation states that \"the document speaks for itself.\" Given this scenario and Maryland's civil procedure rules, what is the most likely legal implication of the defendant's response?\n\nA) It constitutes an admission of the allegation due to failure to specifically deny\nB) It effectively denies the allegation by implying the complaint misrepresents the trust document\nC) It preserves the defendant's right to contest the allegation without admitting or denying it\nD) It shifts the burden of proof back to the plaintiff to provide evidence of the missing transfer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of Maryland's civil procedure rules, particularly MD Rule 2-323, in the context of trust litigation. The defendant's response that \"the document speaks for itself\" is a common legal phrase that doesn't clearly admit or deny the allegation. While MD Rule 2-323(e) suggests that failure to deny might be considered an admission, the defendant's response isn't a clear failure to deny. Instead, it's a strategic response that:\n\n1. Avoids directly admitting to the allegation about failing to transfer assets.\n2. Doesn't specifically deny the allegation, which could be risky if evidence later proves it true.\n3. Implicitly challenges the plaintiff's interpretation of the trust document without committing to a specific position.\n\nThis response preserves the defendant's options for later arguments. It doesn't constitute an admission under MD Rule 2-323(e) because it's not a complete failure to respond. However, it also doesn't provide the clear denial that would fully protect the defendant under the rule. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the response, while vague, isn't a complete failure to deny. Option B goes too far in interpreting the response as an effective denial. Option D is incorrect because the burden of proof generally remains with the plaintiff in civil cases, and this response doesn't shift that burden.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze legal responses in the context of civil procedure rules, requiring integration of multiple concepts and application to a real-world scenario in trust litigation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94098/does-missouri-revised-statute-578-018-imply-that-a-law-enforcement-officer-must", "docs_id": 94098, "title": "Does Missouri Revised Statute 578.018 imply that a law enforcement officer must get a warrant to enter private property to check on an animal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Missouri Revised Statute 578\\.018](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=578.018) vaguely states that a law enforcement officer and other officials \"MAY\" seek a warrant to enter onto private property to check., inspect or impound an animal etc. and must be preceded by an affidavit of probable cause I believe per my recollection.\n\nThis is also stated by the fourth amendment concerning illegal search and seizure But of course with every Constitutional right and \"for the good of the people\" law, there are many loopholes used against the citizens such as, with reference to the 4th amendment, curtilage access, exigent circumstances, emergencies, protection of evidence,wellness checks to name a few.\n\nSection 578\\. Is an animal related statute rather than people. So is a public official required to have a warrant to enter posted private property for an animal neglect call when the property and animals are visible from the road or not? Additionally and specifically Barry county Missouri has no animal control laws or leash laws and it is not illegal to cage dogs for example. The 578 statute has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary which was overruled but that was serious abuse case.\n\nThe definition \"Adequate care\" is vague as well. So warrant needed or not? and if so, what legal action can be taken for trespass, rights violations under color of law etc. if any?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that a warrant is required to enter private property (absent constitutional case law exceptions to the warrant requirement such as exigent circumstances and consent), and that a warrant is available only when there is probable cause that a crime has been committed.\n\nWhether the neglect or abuse of an animal constitutes a crime within the meaning of this 4th Amendment requirement could potentially be seen as a gray area, since historically, in the absence of statutory authority in early common law, an owner of an animal had absolute authority to deal with his or her property (the animal) as the owner of the animal saw fit.\n\nThe purpose of the statute is to clarify that this conduct by an animal owner constitutes a crime for 4th Amendment search and seizure purposes by making a state law determination that it is a crime, which states can do, even though they can't change the constitutional requirement under the 4th Amendment.\n\nAlso, just because a state can authorize law enforcement to get a warrant for any search authorized by the U.S. Constitution, that doesn't mean it has to allow law enforcement to do so in every case where it is constitutional for the state to do so.\n\nThe duty to get a warrant for law enforcement to enter onto private property at all arises not only from other state statutes, but also from the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (as incorporated to apply against state and local governments though the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution).\n\nBut, the constitutional requirement has case law exceptions, so it isn't required in all circumstances. In particular, exigent circumstances, and the consent to entry exceptions, which are allowed by constitutional criminal procedure case law, could apply to the requirement to get a warrant in the first place.\n\nBut, law enforcement needs to have the authority to search at all with a warrant under state law, for an exception to the warrant requirement to be relevant. This statute appears to carry out that purpose by authorizing searches for this particular purpose. For what it is worth, it is not the best drafted possible statute to achieve this objective, and it could have been written to be more clear, but it still gets the job done.\n\nSo, in answer to the top\\-line question, no, I wouldn't read this statute as requiring a warrant in every possible circumstance in order to go onto private property to check on an animal, although a warrant would be required in every case where an exception to the warrant requirement under 4th Amendment case law does not apply.\n\n> Section 578\\. Is an animal related statute rather than people.\n\nThe people involved are the property owners. The property owner's rights in their real property are potentially infringed if there is a warrantless entry.\n\nThe human beings owning the animals are potentially violating a law which the State of Missouri wants law enforcement officers to be able to enforce (the relevant laws are [the state animal cruelty and agricultural laws expressly referenced in the statute](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneChapterRng.aspx?tb1=578.005%20to%20578.023), so, it is irrelevant that \"Barry County Missouri has no animal control laws or leash laws\").\n\nAmong other things these statutes make it a crime if a person \"Has custody or ownership of an animal and fails to provide adequate care\\[.]\" As the question claims that: \"The definition \"Adequate care\" is vague as well.\" But the question also notes that: \"The 578 statute has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary which was overruled but that was serious abuse case.\"\n\nThe state has a right to decide what is and is not illegal. It is not prohibited from banning treatment of animals that is not serious abuse. The state has every right to make it a crime to fail to provide adequate care for an animal, even if that failure to provide adequate car does not constitute severe abuse.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that a lawful search requires only probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and a good faith belief that an exception to the warrant requirement is present.\n\nIf the law enforcement officer has a good faith belief that the animal will die or seriously suffer or be hidden by the owner in the time that the law enforcement officer reasonably thinks that it will take to get a warrant, the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applies.\n\nThe fact that the lawful search later reveals that a crime was no committed does not mean that the search was improper. A mere belief that an animal was abused or neglected and that exigent circumstance were present with a reasonable factual basis (e.g. a tip from a neighbor who seems credible and claims to have personal knowledge of the facts) will usually suffice to establish probable cause.\n\n> So warrant needed or not? and if so, what legal action can be taken\n> for trespass, rights violations under color of law etc. if any?\n\nIf there is a search without a warrant or probable cause was not present, and an exception to the warrant requirement does not apply, and the property owner believes that their 4th Amendment rights were intentionally violated by law enforcement in the warrantless search in violation of clearly established law to the contrary, a civil lawsuit against the law enforcement officer under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 can be brought in state or federal court.\n\nThe employer of the law enforcement officer can be sued as well, under the same statute, if the warrantless search in violation of the clearly established constitutional right was made pursuant to an express policy of the law enforcement officer's employer. But the fact that the law enforcement officer violated someone's rights does not automatically make the law enforcement officer's employer civilly liable for the wrong.\n\nIn most U.S. states, law enforcement officers are protected by state law governmental immunity from common law trespass lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their official duties, but I haven't checked specifically to see if that is the case in Missouri.\n\nA claim of a 4th Amendment violation can also be a ground for suppressing evidence obtained with an unlawful search when defending a prosecution under some ordinance or statute that relies upon that evidence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A concerned citizen reports a potentially neglected dog on private property in Barry County, Missouri.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Missouri Statute 578.018 allows for seeking a warrant to enter private property for animal welfare checks, but does not mandate it in all cases. This suggests a warrant is preferable when possible.\n\n2. The Fourth Amendment generally requires a warrant for entering private property, but has exceptions such as exigent circumstances and consent.\n\n3. While the dog's condition may be concerning, it's not clear from the given information that there's an immediate threat to life that would justify warrantless entry under exigent circumstances (option A).\n\n4. Obtaining a warrant based solely on a citizen's report (option B) may not meet the probable cause standard required for a warrant. More investigation is needed.\n\n5. Attempting to contact the owner for consent addresses the possibility of a consensual entry, which would be legally permissible. Simultaneously preparing a warrant affidavit is prudent in case consent is not given or the owner cannot be reached.\n\n6. Option D is incorrect because while Barry County may lack specific animal control laws, state laws still apply, and the officer has a duty to investigate potential animal neglect.\n\n7.

And easier for them as I move the packages right to their sorting area.\n\nAlthough it is clear to me that I am allowed there, I still feel a bit odd for being in the clearly labeled \"employees only\" area. I would think that at any time, they could revoke this permission, but do not since it is mutually beneficial.\n\nI had some \"Facebook lawyers\" tell me that one day, I will get arrested. While I guess that could happen, I find it far more likely that if a postal police officer happened to be there one day, he'd question me, question the supervisor and either tell me that I cannot (or can) continue to access this area.\n\nDoes the long\\-standing policy of allowing my access grant me some\\-sort of (revocable) license to continue until told otherwise?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Trespassing requires that you be on someone else's property without their permission. The supervisor has explicitly given you permission, so it's not possible for you to trespass. You are correct that someone with the proper authority could revoke this permission at any time, at which point you would have to leave or be guilty of trespassing. The only way this situation could constitute trespassing is if they revoke your permission and you ignore them.

The correct answer is C because the business owner has been granted implicit permission through the long-standing practice, creating a revocable license. This aligns with the documentation stating, \"Trespassing requires that you be on someone else's property without their permission.\" The supervisor's allowance, even if not explicitly stated, constitutes permission.\n\nOption A is incorrect because no irrevocable right has been established; the permission can be revoked at any time. Option B is a common misconception (addressed in the documentation as the \"Facebook lawyers\" argument) but is incorrect because there is implied permission. Option D is a distractor that introduces a related legal concept (adverse possession) but is not applicable in this scenario, as it typically requires a much longer time period and different circumstances.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts (implied permission, revocable license, trespassing) and applying them to a real-world scenario.

Would it have made a woman who got an abortion not specifically protected under Roe v. Wade criminally liable for murder? What other interesting consequences might it have had?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One consequence would be that rape or robbery of a pregnant woman which resulted in the death of the fetus (not the mother) would be [first degree murder](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-32/), since the death arises \n\n> in the commission of, or attempt to commit, arson, rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate or animate object sexual\n>  penetration, robbery, burglary or abduction\n\nPremeditated murder of a pregnant woman, like premeditated murder of a non\\-pregnant woman, is first degree murder.

Research using such eggs would be impossible, since the egg would fall under human subject research protection. A destroyed embryo would require a death certificate. Surrogate motherhood would more complicated since it would now involves implanting a person into a host mother, and the courts would need to intervene to protect the rights of the fertilized egg. Any facility that stores embryos for later implantation would be open to a wrongful death suit in case the embryo doesn't survive.

If HB 1 had become law, it would have defined personhood as beginning at conception, granting full legal rights to unborn children at all stages of development. \n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to the documentation, the bill would have granted \"all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons\" to unborn children at every stage of development.\n\n2.

In this scenario, although the death of the fetus was not premeditated, it occurred during the commission of a robbery, which elevates it to first-degree murder. The combination of the woman (who survived but was a victim of attempted murder during a robbery) and the fetus (who died) would likely be interpreted as \"more than one person\" under this law.\n\n5. This makes the crime eligible for capital murder charges, as it involves the death of more than one \"person\" (as newly defined) in the same criminal transaction.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple legal concepts and their application to a real-world scenario.

The most effective strategy for Company A is to file a motion for separate trials and pursue a confidential settlement with the plaintiff. This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1.

And, the accuser's telephone data, together with the accuser's testimony, is admissible evidence which is sufficient to bring charges.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nTo bring charges, all that the prosecutor must show to proceed to trial and to comply with the professional ethics standards that apply to lawyers is to show \"probable cause\" which is a much lower standard than the proof beyond a reasonable doubt that is necessary to obtain a conviction.\n\nThe testimony of the accuser alone is almost always going to be sufficient to charge someone with a crime that would involve a \"conversation\" of some kind, and to convict someone of that crime.\n\nThe evidence from the phone would usually be admissible and would corroborate the accusers testimony, which might increase the likelihood that a jury would find that the evidence taken as a whole constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt, even though the phone alone, without the accuser's testimony, probably wouldn't suffice to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt unless the content of the conversation was sufficient to identify the defendant (e.g. because it mentioned things that only the defendant could have known).\n\nIt is not at all uncommon to use an accuser's phone as evidence in a criminal prosecution where that kind of communication has something to do with the crime that the defendant is charged with (of course, most crimes are far less articulate like physically trespassing, punching somebody, shoplifting, burglary, etc.). The side of the conservation that allegedly involved the defendant would normally not be subject to the hearsay rule, for example, because it would be the alleged statement of a party\\-opponent.\n\nIf the accuser was involved in the conversation, the testimony of the accuser is also sufficient in most cases to authenticate evidence from a phone that sets forth the conversation because the testimony of the accuser corroborates the evidence from the phone.\n\nBasically, all the accuser has to do is testify credibly that the phone was not tampered with and that the data on the phone is not fake to the best of the accuser's knowledge and that the accuser believed that the conservation was related to the crime.\n\nThe evidence should be at least admissible for the purpose of showing that a conversation took place with someone at the times indicated at the IP addresses indicated (assuming that the jury believes that accuser's testimony that it is authentic) even if it doesn't, by itself, prove that the defendant was the other person involved in the conversation. The existence of the conservation and nature of the conservation is one of the things that the prosecution needs to prove in your hypothetical case, and if proves that, even if this evidence doesn't by itself prove the defendant's identity, it is still relevant to proving part of the case, which reduces the amount of the case that has to be established with other kinds of evidence.\n\nThe fact that the conversation alleged by the accuser actually happened and is corroborated by digital evidence makes it more likely that the accuser is telling the truth and that the defendant is guilty, even if this single piece of evidence by itself doesn't prove the entire case.\n\nThe defense can certainly urge the jury consider the fact that the phone evidence isn't very rigorously linked to the defendant as they make the argument that there isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, but the jury, considering the totality of the evidence in which the phone evidence and the testimony of the accuser corroborate each other, find that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard has been met.\n\n**There Will Almost Always Be Some Other Evidence**\n\nAlso, usually, in any prosecution based in part upon a \"conservation\" by telephone or text message, there will be other evidence from context, timing, the defendant's motive, etc. that provides further circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime that may also be considered, even if it doesn't \"feel\" like other evidence in the sense that it is testimony from someone else or additional physical evidence.\n\nIn many cases, even though a defendant has a right to remain silent and not present any witnesses and not have that held against him, a defendant that fails to present some kind of evidence to overcome latent circumstantial evidence that tends to point to his guilt is usually going to be found guilty by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nFor example, the fact that the defendant was in a place where he could have used the IP address in question, rather than having an alibi is probably not, by itself, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but is circumstantial evidence that can remove one source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if he does have an alibi or subpoenas records to show that the IP address in question was available at the location where he was six months earlier, the case against him becomes much weaker.)\n\nThe fact that the defendant lived at the same location six months earlier is relevant and corroborates the testimony, even if one doesn't definitively establish that the ISP address was the same six months earlier. This removes some doubt that the other evidence might have left hanging.\n\nThe fact that the conversation is something that the defendant could have said, while probably not proof beyond a reasonable doubt by itself, is circumstantial evidence that can remove a source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if the conversation is, for example, in Farsi, and the defendant doesn't know how to speak Farsi and doesn't even have access to a Farsi dictionary or translation program, in contrast, proof of a case against him beyond a reasonable doubt may be impossible.)\n\nSimilarly, if the defendant can't offer any plausible narrative in which someone else could plausibly have been using the IP address at the times in question and could have said the things that were said in the conversation, that too, while probably not proof beyond a reasonable doubt by itself, is circumstantial evidence that can remove a source of doubt from the other evidence.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that to bring charges, a prosecutor only needs to show \"probable cause,\" which is a much lower standard than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2.

Can they legally take pictures of the inside of my home while performing requested maintenance? \n\nI spent all day cleaning and do not want to argue with my landlord, but if she chooses to evict me, are there any legal actions I can take?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: <http://www.tenantslegalcenter.com/html/eviction_notices.html>\n\n> 3 DAY NOTICE TO CURE BREACH (sometimes called PERFORM COVENANT) OR QUIT is used to notify a tenant that he/she has 3 days to do or stop doing something as per the rental agreement or the law. The tenant can comply with the notice or vacate within the 3 days. If the tenant vacates within the 3 days, he/she is NOT relieved from the rent obligation under the lease or rental agreement.\n\nSo, the notice must be based on a law and/or the lease agreement. Presumably, the law and/or lease provision must be cited in the notice.\n\n> The City of San Diego has a GOOD CAUSE law (Right to Know Ordinance) protecting certain tenants in a residential tenancy of at least TWO years and that good cause must be written in the notice.\n\nYou state that you've been there seven years, so this law applies.\n\n> To count the days of a notice, you begin on the next day after service as the first day. Weekends and holidays are counted but the last day of a notice to act generally may not land on a weekend or holiday. If it does, and if applicable to that notice, the \"last day\" can carry over to the next business day. For example, if a 3 day notice to pay rent is served on a Thursday, we count Friday as the first day Sunday is the third day. Since the last day of this type of notice cannot be a Sunday, the \"third day\" is then Monday (giving the tenant four days instead of three) to pay the rent. If that Monday was a legal holiday, then Tuesday would then be the \"third\" day (giving the tenant five days instead of three) to pay the rent.\n\n[http://www.rogerfranklin.org/Instructions\\_for\\_Landlords\\_2017\\.pdf](http://www.rogerfranklin.org/Instructions_for_Landlords_2017.pdf)\n\n> B.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The notice is valid, and the tenant must clean the apartment by Saturday or face immediate eviction.\nB) The notice is invalid due to improper service, but the tenant should still comply with the cleaning request.\nC) The notice is valid, but the landlord must postpone the inspection until Monday due to weekend exclusion rules.\nD) The notice may be invalid due to multiple factors, including service method, timing, and lack of specificity.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation:\n\n1. Service method: The notice was left on the door, which doesn't comply with proper service methods outlined in the documentation. Valid service requires personal delivery, delivery to another adult with mailing, or posting with mailing if no adult is available.\n\n2. Timing: While the notice itself might be dated Wednesday, it wasn't received until Thursday. The counting of days begins the day after service, making Friday the first day. Weekends are generally counted, but the last day cannot fall on a weekend for this type of notice.\n\n3. Specificity: The notice lacks clear details about what needs to be cleaned, with no attached picture as claimed. This vagueness could be grounds for challenging the notice.\n\n4. Tenant rights: As a long-term tenant (7 years), the San Diego \"Good Cause\" law applies, requiring specific reasons for eviction.\n\n5. Inspection timing: While weekends are typically counted in the notice period, the landlord's planned Saturday inspection doesn't allow for the full three-day period, especially considering the weekend rules.\n\nOption D is the most comprehensive and accurate response, acknowledging the multiple potential issues with the notice and the complexity of the situation.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to Ohio landlord-tenant law (ORC 5321.05), tenants are obligated to dispose of waste properly and comply with local health and safety codes. Leaving trash by the road likely violates these obligations.\n\n2. The law states that if a tenant violates their obligations, \"the landlord may recover any actual damages that result from the violation.\" The citation is a direct result of the tenant's actions and qualifies as actual damages.\n\n3. While the full citation amount is $750, and the security deposit is only $600, the landlord can legally deduct up to the full amount of the deposit to cover these damages.\n\n4. This approach is more practical and likely to yield results than the alternatives:\n   - Option A (appealing) is unlikely to succeed without evidence and incurs additional costs.\n   - Option B (suing in small claims court) would be time-consuming and may not be cost-effective.\n   - Option D (ignoring the citation) would leave the landlord fully liable for the fine.\n\n5.

Is this illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The terminology is different, but there are analogous concepts that aren't about shares in publicly traded companies. Jurisdictions generally have laws designed to resolve / prevent \"conflict of interest\". There is a [big section of Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.52&full=true) that regulates ethics in public service. Therefore, the Chief of the Washington State Patrol cannot award a contract for new vehicles to himself, because \"No state officer or state employee may have an interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in a business or transaction or professional activity, or incur an obligation of any nature, that is in conflict with the proper discharge of the state officer's or state employee's official duties\".

You may sell all of your diamonds if you think the bottom will fall out on the diamond market, indeed people do this all the time (and are often wrong about the future). People often buy land because they have a reason to believe that it will become valuable (e.g. they heard a rumor about a business expanding into the area); many people invested in micro\\-computer companies because they got the idea (even from people who has specific technical knowledge) that microcomputers would become very popular.

The correct answer is C, based on several key Supreme Court decisions cited in the documentation.\n\nReynolds v.

They are not specifically targeted at any religious practice. Therefore, the Dayak citizen's claim of religious motivation for headhunting would not provide a legal defense against a murder charge.\n\nOption A is incorrect because First Amendment protections do not extend to criminal acts, even if religiously motivated.

Most trials turn on the facts, not precedent\\-setting points of law \\- usually, there is no dispute about the law at all.\n\nEven then, most appeal decisions don't set a precedent either and sink into obscurity until at some point in the far future when a lawyer doing research on a particularly tricky case has an \"ah\\-ha\" moment and says \"Look at what Justice Bozo said in paragraph 365 of this 56 page judgement about a tangentially related issue between different people at a different time in a different place \\- I need to spin this as dicta.\" Meanwhile, the lawyer on the opposite side has a different precedent from a different case that contradicts this one \\- one of them must be wrong.\n\nSo a trial judge faced with this paradox has to resolve it; they don't get to say \"this is too hard\". Basically they have 2 methods of doing so:\n\n1. The decide that one (or both) are obiter and make the decision based on the precedent that remains.\n2. They decide that both are ratio and write a judgement that they know **has** to be appealed because they have to follow both precedents and they can't. At least in Australia, this is becoming more and more common. The judge basically says \"I have two conflicting binding precedents, I pick this one for \\[reasons]. Now go off to the Court of Appeals to see if I got it right. I look forward to finding out.\"\n\nOf course, the winner isn't going to appeal and it may not be in the loser's commercial interest to do so.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that \"What exactly is the ratio decidendi of a case is often a matter for much argument.\" This indicates that there isn't always a clear, single ratio decidendi that all future courts will consistently apply (eliminating option A).\n\n2.

The correct answer, D, is supported by several key points:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"There is no law pertaining to top level domains, defining 'appropriateness'.\" This means that non-profit organizations are not legally required to use .org domains.\n\n2. It's mentioned that com, org, and net domains are \"open to anyone,\" further supporting the flexibility in domain choice.\n\n3. The answer emphasizes the need to be \"truthful in registering the domain,\" which aligns with the documentation's point about avoiding deception.\n\n4. The other options represent common misconceptions:\n   - Option A incorrectly suggests legal liability for domain choice.\n   - Option B falsely implies that domain choice affects tax status.\n   - Option C misinterprets the relationship between ad revenue and customer status.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring candidates to integrate multiple pieces of information and apply them to a real-world scenario. It also challenges common assumptions about domain names and organizational status, pushing candidates to analyze the actual legal implications rather than relying on widespread misconceptions."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37724/theres-a-potentially-large-mistake-in-my-contract-is-there-a-need-to-address", "docs_id": 37724, "title": "There&#39;s a (potentially large) mistake in my contract, is there a need to address it?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A company that's using the contracting firm said they'd pay me $X per hour, and the same amount for hours over 40 in a given week. Apparently there's an exemption from the 1\\.5x pay for certain engineering positions, which I was told this was. I was (and am) happy with the pay we agreed on.\n\nSo the contracting firm sent me a copy of the standard contract to read and sign. But the contract said I was to be paid 1\\.5x the amount of my normal rate for overtime. \n\nBefore signing, I sent them a message saying, \"I think this is a mistake.\" And they came back and said, \"You're right, it's supposed to be 1x for overtime.\" They sent me another copy, but it had the same mistake in it. At that point, I signed it since we were on the same page regarding the terms even though it was still wrong. My thinking was that it was just a piece of (digital) paper that was wrong, and in my favor anyway. The actual contract (the intangible agreement between the two parties) was correct and mutually agreed upon.\n\nMy question is, **with the contract as it stands, is there any risk that I am taking by not fixing it?** I'm getting paid the amount I expect (1x for overtime) and have no intentions to pull more out of them just because the written contract is wrong.

If you were to bill for 1\\.5x your normal rate for hours over 40/week, relying on the writing, and it came to court, you might win, based on the general rule that matters explicitly covered in the written agreement are treated as final, and evidence of contradictory oral agreements are often not accepted to contradict the contract document. This is known as the *parole evidence* rule. \n\nBut you don't plan to issue such a bill, so that won't come up. I don't see that you are at any legal risk. But you could send the client a letter saying that you signed the contract document so as not to hold the job up, but you think there is a mistake in it (pointing out exactly where and what the error is). This would help establish your ethics and good faith, so that if somehow there was a problem over this later (although that seems unlikely) you can't be accused of any improper actions. Keep a copy of any such letter.\n\nBy the way, if you are an independent contractor, the governmental standard for overtime does not normally apply (in the US). If you are an **employee** of a consulting company, it may or may not, depending on your salary level and the kind of work you do.

Because what I learned from my Criminal Justice education was that a person can only act in self defense if they did not know the officer was an officer or if the officer turned out to be someone impersonating an officer. Unlawful arrest or even misuse of force can only be legally remedied by civil suits not self\\-defense.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It appears that [*Plummer v. State*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plummer_v._State) is still valid, but only in a very limited fact pattern. It is often quoted on the internet to justify the idea that a person may resist any unlawful arrest with force. That may have been true when *Plummer* was decided, and it was the clear holding of [*Bad Elk v. United States*, 177 U.S. 529 (1900\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Elk_v._United_States) \n\nBut *Bad Elk* is bad law today \\-\\- the wide adoption of the Model Penal Code starting in 1962 removed the right to resist a merely unlawful arrest. The right to use self\\-defense against excessive force by an officer remains, but is narrowly limited, and courts rarely find such resistance justified.\n\nIn [*State v. Mulvihill* 57 N.J. 151 (1970\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1970/57-n-j-151-0.html) The Supreme Court of New Jersey held: \n\n> If, in effectuating the arrest or the temporary detention, the officer employs excessive and unnecessary force, the citizen may respond or counter with the use of reasonable force to protect himself, and if in so doing the officer is injured no criminal offense has been committed.\n\nHowever, the *Mulvihill* court cautioned:\n\n> State v. Koonce, 89 N.J. Super. 169 (App. Div. 1965\\) held that \"a private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows or has good reason to believe is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances obtaining.\" (89 N.J. Super. at 184\\.) The opinion put to rest the notion that the common law rule existing in some jurisdictions, which permits a citizen to resist, even with reasonable force, an unlawful arrest by a police officer, was applicable in New Jersey. ... Accordingly, in our State when an officer makes an arrest, legal or illegal, it is the duty of the citizen to submit and, in the event the seizure is illegal, to seek recourse in the courts for the invasion of his right of freedom.\n\nThe *Mulvihill* court explained the difference in the two csase by saying:\n\n> Despite his duty to submit quietly without physical resistance to an arrest made by an officer acting in the course of his duty, even though the arrest is illegal, his right to freedom from unreasonable seizure and confinement can be protected, restored and vindicated through legal processes. However, the rule permitting reasonable resistance to excessive force of the officer, whether the arrest is lawful or unlawful, is designed to protect a person's bodily integrity and health and so permits resort to self\\-defense. Simply stated, the law recognizes that liberty can be restored through legal processes but life or limb cannot be repaired in a courtroom. And so it holds that the reason for outlawing resistance to an unlawful arrest and requiring disputes over its legality to be resolved in the courts has no controlling application on the right to resist an officer's excessive force. *People v. Curtis*, 70 Cal. 2d 347, 74 Cal. Rptr. at 719\\.\n\nThe *Mulvihill* court further warned that:\n\n> \\[A citizen] cannot use greater force in protecting himself against the officer's unlawful force than reasonably appears to be necessary. If he employs such greater force, then he becomes the aggressor and forfeits the right to claim self\\-defense ... Furthermore, if he knows that if he desists from his physically defensive measures and submits to arrest the officer's unlawfully excessive force would cease, the arrestee must desist or lose his privilege of self\\-defense.\n\nThe court said that the duty to desist and submit if that would stop the excessive force is analogous to the duty to retreat rather than use force in self defense when this is feasible.\n\nThe Nolo Press page [\"Resisting Arrest When Police Use Excessive Force\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/resisting-arrest-when-police-use-excessive-force.html) says:\n\n> It\u2019s rare that someone being placed under arrest has the right to forcefully resist. But in most states, if the arresting officer uses excessive force that could cause \u201cgreat bodily harm,\u201d the arrestee has the right to defend him or herself. That\u2019s because most states hold that an officer\u2019s use of excessive force amounts to assault or battery, which a victim has a right to defend against.\n\n...\n\n> An officer\u2019s use of force is \u201cexcessive\u201d if it is likely to result in unjustifiable great bodily harm (serious injury). Most states consider whether a \u201creasonable person\u201d under the circumstances would have believed that the officer\u2019s use of force was likely to cause great physical harm (including death). If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014if a reasonable person would have felt it necessary to resist in self\\-defense, and if that person used a reasonable degree of force when resisting, then the resistance is typically justified. But this is a very high standard to meet, such that courts hardly ever find that an arrestee\u2019s forceful resistance was defensible.\n\n[This article from policeone.com](https://www.policeone.com/legal/articles/372596006-Civilian-self-defense-vs-police-excessive-force-Its-not-that-simple/) citing California law, says that forceful resistance to an arrest is almost never justified. It does agree that resistance to excessive force can be used;\n\n> Section 693 requires that even if the officer were committing a public offense (crime), only that \"self\\-defense\" force that is sufficient to prevent the offense may be used. In other words, the subject may only use force to simply stop the assault/battery under color of authority and never any more than that.\n\nand says that:\n\n> It is a rare circumstance when this assault/battery under color of authority actually occurs and an officer is charged, not because of some great law enforcement driven conspiracy but because it rarely happens.\n\nIn short, *Plummer* is still valid, but limited to the fact pattern when the person being arrested is actually being subjected to excessive force likely to cause great bodily harm, or death, and only justifies sufficient force to prevent such harm. The lawfulness of the arrest does not matter, it the the danger caused by the excess force that justifies possible resistance. As a practical matter, if resistance is likely to escalate rather than prevent harm, it is highly unwise. \n\nWhen *Plummer* is cited, often with *Bad Elk*, to justify resistance to an **unlawful** arrest **because** of its unlawfulness, that is no longer valid law and has not been for decades.\n\nNote that is a person who is not a law enforcement officer (LEO) but who is pretending to be one, tries to make an \"arrest\" this would not be an arrest at all, but an assault or an attempted abduction, and the victim would be justified in using reasonable force in self\\-defense, although not excessive force. This is not the *Plummer* rule, but the normal law of self\\-defense. However any arrestee should be careful. Claiming that the arresters are impersonators when they are in fact plainclothes LEOs will not go well. If a reasonable person should have known that they were LEOs, there is no right to resist unless excessive force is used.\n\nNote further that if non\\-LEOs attempt to make a \"citizen's arrest\", not impersonating officers, the right to self\\-defence only applies if excessive force is used, or there is a reasonable fear of excessive force likely to cause great bodily harm or death. Basically the *Plummer* rule still applies.\n\nAlso, all of this is a matter of state law, and while *Plummer* should be good law in most if not all states, the exact rule may vary by state. In 2012 a few US states retained the common\\-law rule that any unlawful arrest justified resistance, according to the Nolo page linked above. That may have changed, or may change when a case arises.

Board of Education of Topeka*, 347 U.S. 483 (1954\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education).\n\n(The Justice is known as \"John Marshal Harlan I\" because his grandson, also named \"John Marshal Harlan\", was a Justice during the mid 20th century. The grandson is known as \"John Marshal Harlan II' or just as \"Harlan II\". Harlan II was significantly more conservative than his grandfather.)\n\nSupreme court decisions may be overruled because there has been a change in the constitution. An example is [*Barron v. Baltimore*, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_v._Baltimore) which was undone by the ratification of the 14th amendment. This reason is rare, but particularly important.\n\nDecisions interpreting statutes can be altered or reversed if Congress or a state legislature changes the statute. Indeed sometimes a Court decision explicitly invites a legislative change. Not infrequently, however, such invitations are ignored by Congress.\n\nSupreme court decisions may be overturned when a later majority decides that the previous decision was simply wrong. A special case was [*Dred Scott v. Sandford*, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford). That decision held that blacks could never be citizens of the US, and was effectively overruled by the outcome of the US Civil War, and formally by the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution.\n\nA more usual example is the case of [*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*, 319 U.S. 624 (1943\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette) the case that held that a state could not make the flag salute and Pledge of Allegiance mandatory for school children. This overruled [*Minersville School District v. Gobitis*, 310 U.S. 586 (1940\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minersville_School_District_v._Gobitis), decided only three years before. In this case the opinion included what was in effect a point\\-by\\-point refutation of the *Gobitis* opinion, although it was not described as such. This angered Justice Frankfurter (author of the *Gobitis* opinion), who issued a dissenting opinion from the *Barnette* decision. Many prominent lawyers and legal scholars had challenged the *Gobitis* decision, and *Gobitis* had led to increased persecution of members of the **Jehovah's Witnesses**, the group whose members refused to say the pledge, considering that it was a form of idolatry. These facts influenced the rapid reversal of the *Gobitis* decision.\n\nOften an earlier decision is not directly overruled, but is ***distinguished***. That is, the earlier opinion is said to still hold for its particular facts, but a new and different ruling applies to the different circumstances of a later case. When a number of yet later decisions follow the later case, the original can become effectively overruled, as there are no longer any circumstances in which it will be applied.\n\nCourt opinions will often go into considerable detail on the legal reasoning which supports a decision that overrules a previous case. They do not commonly discuss the philosophy of the reasons for change.\n\nSome legal scholars and some Justices have used the [Living Constitution theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution) to support change on the ground that what was constitutional many years or decades ago is no longer permissible as the constitution \"evolves and adapts to new circumstances even if the document is not formally amended\". Others, particularly \"textualists\" and \"originalists\" strongly disapprove of this theory.\n\nThis theory was expressed by Justice Holmes in the case of [*Missouri v. Holland* 252 U.S. 416 (1920\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_v._Holland) with the words:\n\n> With regard to that we may add that when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago. The treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only question is whether it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment. We must consider what this country has become in deciding what that amendment has reserved.\n\nIn the Death Penalty cases the citation of \"evolving standards of decency\" from [*Trop v. Dulles*, 356 U.S. 86 (1958\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trop_v._Dulles) in [*Furman v. Georgia*, 408 U.S. 238 (1972\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia) was a version of Living Constitution theory. But it was not followed in later cases on he subject.\n\nUS Supreme Court rulings are not strictly binding on future Supreme Court majorities if they truly believe the previous decision was wrong for whatever reason. This has happened many times. Some Justices believe fairly strongly in *stare decisis*, the principle that settled rules of law should not be changed, but even so they will vote to overturn a precedent when it seems clearly and seriously wrong. Prior cases are overturned with significant frequency.\n\nJustices routinely do their own research, and decide cases on grounds not urged by the lawyers who argue the case. Moreover, for significant cases, there are almost always *amicus curiae* (friend of the court) briefs from major organizations. These are very likely to point out precedents or lines of reasoning that the parties have missed. The chance of a modern SC case being wrongly decided because of poor advocacy (as a comment suggests) seems slight to me. Poor judging, yes, that does happen. The *Barnette* decision. was an example. There have also been changes of judicial philosophy. The death of \"substantive due process\" and \"freedom of contract\" in the 1930s is an example of that.\n\nBut when consequences or legal theories are raised that were not previously considered, that can also be a reason to reverse a prior Supreme Court decision.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A state legislature passes a law requiring all public school students to recite a newly composed state pledge of allegiance daily.

It mentions that the most common cause of action is negligence, which requires proving a duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and resulting damage.\n3. The question scenario presents a situation where these elements could potentially be met if the developer's work was found to be negligent.\n4. The documentation also notes that such suits are rare and difficult to prove, which is reflected in the use of \"could potentially\" in the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because criminal liability would typically require proof of recklessness or malicious intent, which is not suggested in the scenario. Option B is incorrect because the documentation does not state that all liability falls solely on the company. Option D is incorrect because simply signing off on work does not exempt one from potential liability if negligence can be proven.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a realistic scenario in the software development field, and understand the nuances of potential liability in complex systems."}, "67": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18707/is-the-right-to-free-travel-somehow-covered-in-the-first-amendment", "docs_id": 18707, "title": "Is the right to free travel somehow covered in the First Amendment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Could travel be a way to express oneself? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It appears that the \"leading\" source of Freedom of Movement is the [Privileges and Immunities Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause) (Art.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Under US copyright law, works published in the US before 1978 without a copyright notice entered the public domain immediately. The 1924 report had no copyright notice, suggesting the photos are public domain in the US.\n\n2. However, the International Boundary Commission is a joint US-Canadian organization, so Canadian copyright law may also apply. Canadian copyright duration and requirements differ from US law, potentially offering protection even without notice.\n\n3. The Commission's current website statement offers permission for non-commercial use, but this doesn't necessarily mean the works are still under copyright protection. It could be a cautionary policy that doesn't reflect the actual legal status.\n\n4. The age of the photographs (from 1924) means they would be in the public domain in many jurisdictions, but not necessarily all, given different copyright term lengths globally.\n\n5.

Congress can remove (\"abrogate\") this immunity by law in some circumstances. They tried to do so for copyright infringement cases with the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990\\. However, in the present case of *Allen v. Cooper*, the Supreme Court held that this part of the CRCA is unconstitutional. \n\nThe idea is that under the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress can abrogate state immunity when it's necessary to ensure people's right to due process, but only in a \"congruent and proportional\" way. Now if a state unintentionally or negligently infringes someone's copyright, that does not violate the person's right to due process, but an intentional infringement might. At the time the CRCA was passed, when Congress went looking for instances where states infringed on copyrights, they found several cases of unintentional or negligent infringement, and just a couple where they may have infringed intentionally. SCOTUS argued that to respond to this by *completely* abrogating state immunity in *all* copyright cases was disproportionate, and therefore unconstitutional.\n\nBut the Court suggests in the opinion that Congress could pass a different law to abrogate immunity in copyright cases, if it were narrower. For instance, a law that only stripped immunity in cases of intentional infringement would likely be constitutional, especially if there were evidence that intentional infringement was happening enough to be a significant problem.\n\nSo I think the answer is that as of right now, a state could deliberately infringe someone's copyright (e.g. by pirating software) and be immune from suit. However, Congress has the power to \"fix\" this, and most likely will, especially if there seems to be egregious abuse.\n\n(By the way, the decision contains an impressive quantity of pirate jokes. I guess since it's not only about copyright infringement (aka \"piracy\"), but actually alleges infringement of a video about a sunken pirate ship, the justices just couldn't resist.)\n\n---\n\nYour \"eminent domain\" idea is separate from this. Seizing copies of the software wouldn't give the state the right to use them, as the software itself would still be copyrighted. The state would have to seize the copyright, and I don't know whether that is possible \\- it's not necessarily property in that sense. But if they did so, then they wouldn't be infringing the copyright at all (since the state itself would now own the copyright) and this case would be irrelevant. \n\nOn the other hand, when a state uses eminent domain to seize property, they must as you say pay fair market value for it, and that means the market value *before* they seized it. So the value of the copyright in such a case wouldn't be \"nothing\" \\- it would be more like the amount a competitor would have had to pay the software maker to buy all the rights to that product.

Cooper struck down the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990 as unconstitutional, but suggested that Congress could pass a narrower law to abrogate state immunity in copyright cases.\n\n2. The Court emphasized that such a law would likely be constitutional if it targeted intentional infringement, especially if there was evidence of significant abuse.\n\n3. Option C directly addresses this point by describing a scenario where Congress passes a law specifically targeting intentional copyright infringement by state entities, which aligns with the Court's suggestion for a constitutional approach to abrogating state immunity.\n\n4. Options A and D involve scenarios that are less likely to be considered intentional infringement, and thus would probably not be covered even under a new, narrower law.\n\n5. Option B, while describing intentional infringement, doesn't introduce any new legal framework that would overcome the state's sovereign immunity as established in the Allen v. Cooper decision.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the court's reasoning to a potential future scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and critical thinking about the implications of the ruling."}, "73": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46394/got-a-ticket-in-quebec-for-violating-pedestrian-red-light-name-spelled-wrong", "docs_id": 46394, "title": "Got a ticket in Quebec for violating pedestrian red light.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications and recommended course of action?\n\nA) The citation is invalid due to the name misspelling, and the person should ignore the court hearing notice.\nB) The person should attend the hearing but argue for dismissal based on the clerical error in their name.\nC) The citation remains valid despite the misspelling, and the person should attend the hearing to address the actual offense.\nD) The person should contact the court to have the citation reissued with the correct spelling before deciding whether to contest it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of legal principles to a real-world scenario, requiring analysis beyond mere facts. The correct answer is C because the documentation clearly states that the crime or infraction applies to the person regardless of how their name is spelled on the citation. The misspelling does not invalidate the ticket or provide grounds for dismissal. \n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially harmful, as ignoring a court summons can lead to additional legal consequences. Option B is a common misconception that the question addresses; arguing for dismissal based on the clerical error would \"hold zero water\" according to the expert. Option D, while seemingly reasonable, is unnecessary and not advised in the documentation; the citation remains valid despite the misspelling.\n\nThe question challenges test-takers to integrate multiple concepts: the validity of citations despite clerical errors, the importance of responding to court summons, and the irrelevance of name misspellings in legal proceedings.

So my questions are\n\n1. Am I right in thinking that a developer has a fiduciary duty to the user?\n2. If so, what does this mean for a lot of software development organisations with business models that depend on software that does not entirely respect the interests of its users. For instance, would the developer of an ad\\-blocker who takes money from advertisers for allowing their adverts to bypass his block be considered in breach of this duty?\n\nThe rest of this post will explain my reasoning that this fiduciary relationship exists. Suppose that Alice writes some software and sells it to Bob to use. I happen to live in the UK, but from what I have read the same legal framework exists in many countries.\n\nThe Wex legal dicationary [says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty):\n\n> Fiduciary duty is imposed whenever confidence is reposed on one side\n>  in a contractual relationship, so as to allow that side to exert\n>  influence and dominance over the other.\n\nBob is clearly reposing confidence in Alice here. Alice could have included hidden functionality in the program which would work to Bob's detriment. Bob has no practical way of finding out if Alice has done so. In effect Alice has been given control of a part of Bob's computer. In addition to the physical resources, Alice also has indirect access to information stored on the computer that Bob may wish to keep confidential. Alice has \"influence and dominance\" over those parts of the computer that her program can access.\n\nThe Free Dictionary [says](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fiduciary+duty):\n\n> Courts have neither defined the particular circumstances of fiduciary\n>  relationships nor set any limitations on circumstances from which such\n>  an alliance may arise. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> A fiduciary relationship extends to every possible case in which one\n>  side places confidence in the other and such confidence is accepted;\n>  this causes dependence by the one individual and influence by the\n>  other.\n\nI've seen lists of fiduciary relationships, but it is plain that all of these are illustrative rather than complete. It may be that a court has never found that a software developer has a fiduciary duty (Google hasn't turned up any), but there doesn't seem to be an obstacle to such a finding.\n\nLooking at the second paragraph, it is clear that Bob has placed confidence in Alice. It is not necessarily clear that Alice has accepted such a relationship with Bob in particular, but it seems to me that\n\n1. By offering her program for sale, Alice has accepted a duty to her customers, and\n2. That this duty is a fiduciary one by the nature of the trust placed in her by her customers.\n\nWhen Alice wrote the program she was unaware that Bob in particular was going to run it, so it would not be possible for Alice to know exactly what the interests of Bob are under all circumstances. However she will still have a clear understanding of the general interests of her users as a class, and she has a duty to act in those interests rather than her own.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You could certainly run the argument: it is unlikely to succeed.\n\nFiduciary duties are either specifically legislated (e.g. company directors) or involve a relationship of *confidence* (the obligation to keep secrets) as well as trust (e.g. lawyer, doctor). \n\nEngineers (including software engineers) do not have this and AFAIK a fiduciary duty between an engineer and their client has never been found, even where the work is a one\\-on\\-one commission. For example, an engineer designing a bridge has the duties imposed by their contract to their client and a general common law duty e.g. the bridge won't fall down. \n\nWhere the engineering is for a mass market commercial product finding a fiduciary duty seems a vanishingly small possibility.

Given the information provided, what is the most likely outcome of this case?\n\nA) The court will definitely rule in favor of the user, as the software company clearly breached its fiduciary duty.\nB) The court will likely dismiss the case, as software developers typically don't have a fiduciary relationship with users.\nC) The court will rule that a fiduciary duty exists but was not breached due to the perceived user benefit.\nD) The court will establish a new precedent, creating a limited fiduciary duty for software developers in certain circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While the question raises interesting points about the potential for fiduciary duty in software development, the most likely outcome based on the provided information is that the court would dismiss the case. The top answer in the documentation clearly states that finding a fiduciary duty in mass-market commercial products like software has a \"vanishingly small possibility.\" \n\nSeveral key points support this:\n\n1. Fiduciary duties typically involve relationships of confidence and trust, such as those between lawyers or doctors and their clients.\n2. Engineers, including software engineers, have not historically been found to have fiduciary duties to their clients, even in one-on-one commissions.\n3. The relationship between a software developer and a user lacks the intimacy required to create a fiduciary duty.\n4. Reliance on expertise alone is not sufficient to establish a fiduciary duty; it typically only creates normal contractual or common law duties.\n\nWhile the user might argue that they placed trust in the developer by installing the extension, this level of trust is not likely to meet the high bar required for establishing a fiduciary duty in a legal context. The mass-market nature of the software and the lack of a personal, confidential relationship between the developer and individual users further weakens the case for a fiduciary duty.\n\nOptions A and C are unlikely because they assume a fiduciary duty exists, which is not supported by current legal precedent.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Trademark, not copyright, is the primary concern here, as mentioned in the documentation.\n2. Character names from popular works are often protected as trademarks, regardless of whether they're officially registered.\n3.

In Australia this law is national, from my limited understanding incorporation of companies in the US is a state matter. This legislation will dictate what companies can and can't do.\n\nTypically, such laws require a company to have a constitution which is essentially a contract between all the shareholders with each other and with the company. The law will say what must, may and must not be addressed in the constitution. It is here that such things as issuing new shares and options and transferring existing shares will be addressed.\n\nYou say \"It has not issued any shares or stock options yet.\" This cannot be true; in order for there to *be* a company there *must be* at least one shareholder.\n\nSpecifics\n---------\n\nIssuing stock options or shares *may* be a power granted by the constitution to the CEO but is *usually* reserved to the board or *more rarely* to the members (shareholders). So Alison must determine if she, in fact, has the power to bind the company to such an agreement with Carol or if she needs board (or membership) authorisation.\n\nAs an aside, if Alison *does not* have the power and signs the agreement anyway, then Carol would probably have the legal right to force the Company to honour it; this is because third\\-parties are entitled to the presumption that an officer of the company does have the power. The company would have to issue the shares to Carol and seek redress from Alison for breaching her duty to the company.\n\nSuch an agreement would generally be considered a contract binding the company (not Alice) and Carol providing that it met the threshold requirements:\n\n* Intention to create legal relations (on the face of it \\- yes)\n* Agreement\n* Consideration (the company is giving shares to Alice \\- what is Alice giving the company?

Note that the regulation in UE (mainly GDPR) is quite different than that found in USA, itself different than that on many other countries on the American continent.\n\nThat said, when talking about privacy, we generally refer to Personally Identifying Information (PII). As such, your conversion of an IP address like 151\\.101\\.1\\.69 to a country, and storing only that, would generally anonymize the personal information (the IP address), what the GDPR calls pseudonymisation.\n\nDo note that this depends on the rest of information you store and the size of the population in which that user gets mixed.

While the documentation states that \"No minor can work unlimited hours,\" this refers to paid employment. For volunteer work, there are \"no further restrictions on volunteer labor\" beyond the nonprofit requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 15-year-olds fall into the more restricted age bracket and 10 hours per day would likely exceed legal limits.

For example, if a covert agent were murdered due to a wrongful disclosure of information, usually official disclosure of the fact of being a covert agent would be required to prove the case, and that evidence would be barred by the state secrets privilege, effectively barring the lawsuit entirely.\n\nConstitutional claims of privacy violations under the 4th Amendment generally relate to the wrongful acquisition of information and not its wrongful disclosure. The constitution bars unreasonable search and seizure, not unreasonable disclosure of information.\n\nThe only privacy tort that might be applicable is \"Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts.\" (A sister privacy tort, Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into privacy affairs, is directed at the collection of data phase and not the dissemination phase).\n\n*See* [Restatement of the Law (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 652B and 652D](https://cyber.harvard.edu/privacy/Privacy_R2d_Torts_Sections.htm).\n\nBut, this tort raises serious First Amendment concerns and has not been widely adopted. Realistically, this tort is unconstitutional in the absence of an affirmative contractual or quasi\\-contractual duty not to reveal facts that runs to the person making the disclosure, and in general, Manning would not have that kind of relationship. \n\nThe classic public disclosure of embarrassing private facts case would involve a lawyer's or psychotherapist's revelations about a client.\n\nAlso, in the case of the public disclosure tort the basis for damages is largely personal emotional distress and violation of trust, as opposed to damage to reputation, *per se*.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Defamation (option A) is not applicable if the leaked information is true or reasonably believed to be true by the whistleblower.\n\n2. The state secrets privilege (option B) is likely to be invoked in such a case, as a full defense might require disclosure of additional classified information. This would likely lead to the case being dismissed to prevent further disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n3. Constitutional privacy claims under the 4th Amendment (option C) generally relate to wrongful acquisition of information, not its disclosure, making this option incorrect.\n\n4.

As an example, New York continues to consider an individual to be domiciled in NY until and unless that individual establishes a permanent domicile elsewhere.\n\nAnd (with few exceptions) if New York considers you to be domiciled in NY, you are considered a resident and must pay state tax on your worldwide income. This is distinct from individuals who have to pay state tax on NY source income.\n\nBottom line: if New York considers you a resident, you must pay state taxes on worldwide income, even if you did not set foot in NY or in any way have a connection to NY during the tax year.\n\nExample: John Q.

We determine which state you're a citizen of based on domicile, so until a New York citizen sets up somewhere other than New York, he's stuck with New York citizenship.

To more clearly define the issue I have been collecting data from calibrated decibel loggers placed outside and inside homes along different neighborhood streets. I also launched a survey (peer\\-reviewed to ensure that it is unbiased) on SurveyMonkey. This was launched two weeks ago and to\\-date it has received 500 responses. An invitation to local Home Owners Associations to have members take the brief survey will go out next week.\n\nOur community of 15 square miles is allocated one officer from the County Sheriff's Department. Noise complaints made to the Sheriff's Office are pretty much ignored. \n\n**Noise Levels from Custom Exhaust Systems**\n\nIf the same noise events due to custom exhaust systems on some streets occurred at a work place, this would literally raise red flags with OSHA. For example, on a regular basis, noise levels registering 120 dB or higher are measured at distances of 140 feet or more for periods of 15 minutes or more. \n\n**Retaliatory Behavior**\n\nWarnings issued by apartment managers to drivers of loud vehicles often trigger retaliatory drive byes against the apartment complex. These typically start within one hour of the warning. Over the next five the seven days, the count of noise measurements higher than three sigma decibels higher than the average background noise for the street, more than doubles. (Typically 99\\.7% of all noise measurements for a given street will fall below the average plus three sigma decibels. The measure being used is the count of noise readings higher than 99\\.7% of typical noise measurements for a given street.)\n\n**Survey Results (thus far)**\n\nAfter approximately two weeks there have been 500 responses to the survey. Barking dogs are the number 1 source of noise with vehicles with custom exhaust systems and stereos as number 2\\. (Dogs were number 1 in surveys performed by the US EPA in the 70s and 80s). The top noise sources as of today are:\n\n1 Animals (barking dogs, cockerel)\n\n2 **Vehicular noise (custom exhausts, stereos)**\n\n3 Highway noise\n\n4 Aircraft\n\n5 DIY (power tools, hammering)\n\n6 Household activities (stereos, parties)\n\n7 Commercial/Utility/Emergency Vehicles\n\n8 Trains\n\nVehicular exhaust and custom stereo noise was lower in similar polls conducted by US EPA in the 70s and 80s (prior to the de\\-funding of ONAC).\n\n**Impact on Property Values and Ability to Sell Real\\-estate**\n\nAs one realtor put it, noise is a raw real\\-estate nerve. Data from sources such as Zillow\\-Research show that a single family home in a noisy neighborhood will take 3 to 4 months longer to sell than an equivalent home in a quiet neighborhood. Homes in noisy neighborhoods will typically sell for 10% to 15% less than homes in quiet neighborhoods. The same results have been reported by studies conducted by Booz\\-Allen\\-Hamiltor in the United States (1994 \\- homes near airports) and the Swedish Government. Recorded noise levels in some neighborhoods match noise levels reported near large airports. \n\n**Absence of Legal Recourse**\n\nOur County Law Director insists that probable cause can only be established by a law enforcement officer.

This was rejected due to concerns on workload.\n\nNeighborhoods that have genuine noise concerns essentially have no effective legal recourse. Fines imposed by a General Sessions court will only encourage retaliation.\n\n**Retaliation by Law Enforcement**\n\nOn more than one occasion, reports made to local law enforcement and local government have been met with retaliatory drive\\-byes by officers on motorcycles. This typically occurs between 1:30 AM and 2:30 AM following a complaint. The pattern (and this in on video) is an officer pulls close to the home and revs his bike as loud as he can under the nearest window of the person who filed the complaint. The officer then makes a very loud and high speed pass through the neighborhood, returns the spot under the window and revs his bike as loud as he can. This is typically repeated three or more times. Complaints and videos sent to our county law director generate no response what\\-so\\-ever.\n\nWho does one talk to when a law enforcement officer is the problem? Who does one talk to when local government does not respond to complaints about a law enforcement officer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need is a legal basis for a (legal) complaint. OSHA regulations are set by the federal government, which gets its regulatory power via an interaction between politics, Congress, and the Commerce Clause: OSHA regulations don't apply to your neighborhood. There are often local noise ordinances that restrict noise. I can look up the numbers for my county, which are in a 4x4 table (source vs. destination, 4 zoning classes), and the ordinance describes the required sampling details in engineering\\-grade detail. (Best to read the whole ordinance to be sure there aren't specific exceptions, such as the bell exception \\-\\- bells are apparently unregulated). The ordinance will probably say something about enforcement, e.g.\n\n> The sheriff may administer and enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  state law. The director may enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  K.C.C. Title 23 and state law. Upon request by the sheriff or\n>  director, any other county departments and divisions may assist in\n>  enforcing this chapter.\n\nI note that this says \"may\", not \"shall\". Assuming that you have such ordinances, that the noise unquestionably violates the ordinances, and the enforcer refuses to enforce, then you would need to either (a) vote the sheriff out of office or (b) file a suit to compel enforcement of the ordinance. You could sue seeking a writ of mandamus. At this point you would be hiring an attorney, where questions would arise such as whether you have the legal right to compel action, is the sheriff obligated to enforce the ordinance, and so on (can you show that? I don't mean, is there a good reason, I mean in a technical legal sense). The answers reside in your state's case law and ordinances.\n\nIt is possible that your state Attorney General would pursue the sheriff, since what you describe seems like a blatant violation of the law (retaliations especially).

The correct answer, C, is the most strategic legal approach for several reasons:\n\n1. It addresses the core issue of lack of enforcement, as mentioned in the documentation: \"Noise complaints made to the Sheriff's Office are pretty much ignored.\"\n\n2. It assumes the existence of local noise ordinances, which is likely given the community setting, and targets the enforcement aspect rather than creating new laws.\n\n3. Seeking a writ of mandamus is a legal mechanism to compel official action when there's a clear duty to act but officials are failing to do so. This aligns with the situation described where law enforcement is not responding to legitimate complaints.\n\n4. This approach minimizes the risk of retaliation, unlike option A which could provoke individual confrontations, or option D which might escalate tensions with law enforcement.\n\n5. It's a more systemic solution compared to option B, which doesn't address the underlying enforcement issues and potential conflicts of interest mentioned in the documentation.\n\nThe distractors represent common but less effective approaches:\n\nA) While based on data collection mentioned in the documentation, this approach could lead to increased retaliation and doesn't address the systemic enforcement issues.\n\nB) This doesn't address the core problem of enforcement willingness and potential conflicts of interest within law enforcement.\n\nD) While community action is mentioned, this approach risks further antagonizing law enforcement and doesn't provide a legal framework for resolution.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of legal concepts, community dynamics, and strategic problem-solving in a real-world scenario."}, "86": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25043/found-mis-delivered-parcel-after-receiving-refund-must-i-tell-the-store", "docs_id": 25043, "title": "Found mis-delivered parcel after receiving refund - must I tell the store?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A parcel ordered through a store was meant to be delivered to me on Saturday 30th.

The key issues are:\n\n1. California allows vehicles to be operated without license plates for a period of time after purchase, using temporary permits (Section 4156).\n2. However, license plates or temporary permits are required for operation on highways (Section 5202).\n3. Driving without proper registration is an infraction (Section 40000.1).\n\nThe most likely issue is C because:\n- The intern is driving out of state, where the California temporary permit may not be recognized.\n- The vehicle likely lacks proper license plates, as they're often not received within a 3-month period.\n- Operating a vehicle without license plates on highways is explicitly prohibited (Section 5202).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question doesn't address driver's licensing.

While an email technically constitutes a written request, the law provides specific protections for requests made by certified mail, return receipt requested. The key points are:\n\n1.

Option B is the most advantageous approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Legal considerations: As per the documentation, money received directly by the activist would likely be considered a gift rather than income, avoiding personal tax complications.

Practical considerations: The documentation mentions that sending money directly to the lawyer \"would increase the confidence of the donors that you are not diverting the funds for an improper purpose.\" This addresses a key practical concern in crowdfunding efforts.\n\n3. Tax reporting: The lawyer will appropriately handle the tax reporting as income when the funds are used, simplifying the process for both the activist and donors.\n\n4.

However, the overall plot, characters, and specific story elements are original. What legal considerations should the filmmaker be most concerned about?\n\nA) Obtaining explicit permission from Heinlein's estate to use the shared concepts\nB) Ensuring the film's marketing doesn't reference Heinlein's works to avoid confusion\nC) Focusing on the unique expression of ideas rather than the general concepts shared with Heinlein's works\nD) Limiting the number of shared elements to stay below a specific \"derivative work\" threshold\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of copyright law concepts to a complex scenario. The correct answer, C, reflects the key principle in copyright law that ideas and concepts are not protected, but their specific expression is. The filmmaker should focus on ensuring their work is an original expression, even if it shares some general concepts with Heinlein's novels.\n\nOption A is incorrect because permission is not required for using general ideas or concepts. Option B, while potentially good practice, is not a primary legal concern in this context. Option D is a distractor based on the misconception that there's a quantifiable threshold for derivative works.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts from copyright law, particularly the distinction between protected expression and unprotected ideas (17 U.S. Code \u00a7 102(b)).

Trespassing laws are state\\-specific, for example in Washington the law is [RCW 9A.52\\.080](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.52.080), and if you violate the law, it is a misdemeanor.

There are other indications, such as being behind a fence \u2013 also, being told that you are trespassing. If you reasonably believe that you have been told by the owner or person authorized by the owner, then the reasonable belief defense is not available. So the question is whether you have a reason to think that the person telling you this has authority.\n\nYou may be able to determine who owns the property by checking the assessor's office for the address, which may reveal a name and mailing address of the owner.

In particular, has any court ruled on the question?**\n\nI have not found any other part of the executive order that could be read as barring green card holders from entering the US, but I may have overlooked something. **Is there another part of the order that is relevant to the entry of permanent residents?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [The order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html) refers in sec. 3(c) to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12\\) of the INA, [8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187)\". That section specifically names Iraq and Syria, plus \"points to\" potential areas of concern, as identified by the Sec'y of State and Sec'y of Homeland Security. The full list extends to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and is set forth at [81 FR 39680](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-17/pdf/2016-14422.pdf). \n\nThe cited authority is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), a section about inadmissible aliens, which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nThus he has authority to exclude permanent residents from re\\-entry (they are aliens, and re\\-entry is a subcase of entry), and has done so for 90 days. In the case of Syrian nationals, under sec 5(c) of the order, they are excluded until the order is changed. Sec. 5(c) of the order specifically declares\n\n> Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby\n>  proclaim that **the entry of nationals of Syria** as refugees is\n>  detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any\n>  such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient\n>  changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian\n>  refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\nThe long\\-term ban on Syrians also specifies \"as refugees\", so \"such entry\" might not be interpreted to refer to entry of refugee or non\\-refugee Syrian nationals who are permanent residents. The 90\\-day ban in 3(c) (\"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\") does not include any further restrictors, apart from the various government\\-official visas that are exempted, so there would be no basis in the order for excluding permanent residents. Whether this will be strictly enforced is a separate question, though in the period when the order was active (a day), it was applied to permanent residents. Sec. 3(g) allows exceptions \"on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and when in the national interest\". A recent (Saturday the 28th) [White House briefing](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/legal-residents-with-green-cards-warned-not-to-leave-u-s/) says that green card holders \"will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States\".\n\nThe ban includes immigrants and non\\-immigrants, so it doesn't particularly matter how \"immigrant\" is defined \u2013 what matters is what an alien is. Still, \"immigrant\" is defined in [8 USC 1101 (15\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) as any alien, except a bunch of categories such as diplomats, tourists, business visitors, people in transit, students, and fashion models and similar, working temporarily here. Any permanent resident has an immigrant visa (but at any rate is an alien, and is either an immigrant or a non\\-immigrant).\n\nReturning to the words of the order, neither 3(c) nor 5(3\\) limit the ban to issuance of visas, it refers to entry. Not all entry by foreign national requires a visa. The word \"visa\" is mentioned, so it is possible to construe that mention as contextually restricting the ban to visas, however 3(a) which is entitled \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and **Other Immigration Benefits** to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern\" orders the review \"to adjudicate any visa, **admission,** or other benefit under the INA\" which indicates that there is no such limitation.\n\n[8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) does say that a permanent resident is not \"regarded as *seeking* an admission into the United States\". Admission itself is defined in 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(A), when applied to an alien, as \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer\". While a permanent resident is not *seeking* admission (and is not *applying* for admission), it would still be consistent with the law to forbid admission (legal entry). If you read 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C) as granting permanent residents widest latitude to enter without restriction, then that has the absurd consequence that permanent residents are subject to no scrutiny at all. The absurdity is avoided if \"seeing admission\" is a step prior to and is distinct from \"being admitted\" i.e. \"lawfully entering\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: The President has issued an executive order invoking 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) to suspend entry of certain aliens for 90 days.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The executive order, based on 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), allows the President to \"suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants.\" Permanent residents are still considered aliens under immigration law.\n\n2. While 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(C) states that a permanent resident is not \"regarded as seeking an admission,\" this doesn't prevent the government from denying actual entry. The distinction between \"seeking admission\" and \"being admitted\" is crucial here.\n\n3. The order applies to both \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry,\" which would include permanent residents returning from abroad.\n\n4. The White House briefing mentioned in the documentation states that green card holders \"will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States,\" aligning with Section 3(g) of the order allowing exceptions \"on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the order does not explicitly exclude permanent residents.

Consequently, no order will be made as to costs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Caveat: This analysis discusses typically and obvious reasons that there might be an agreement as to costs. But, we have know way of knowing the actual reason in particular cases.\n\nIn *Vancouver (City) v. Ward*, 2010 SCC 27, there were three claims in the underlying lawsuit. One was an award of $5,000 for wrongful imprisonment that was undisputed. One was an award of $5,000 for a wrongful strip search which was appealed but ultimately was affirmed. One was an award of $100 for claims related to seizure of a car, which was reversed on appeal.\n\nThe appeal decided by the Canadian Supreme Court was an appeal from a direct appeal to an intermediate appellate court. So, no further legal record had to be prepared at that stage of the litigation (with potentially expensive transcription fees), so the only issue as to costs that was outstanding were the costs for the final appeal, which would have been modest out of pocket, although, of course, attorneys were involved. And, even the legal arguments had already been made once by both sides in intermediate appellate court briefing.\n\nEven if the trial court plaintiff had lost both parts of the appeal brought by the government, he would have been a prevailing party in the litigation as a whole based upon his wrongful imprisonment damage award.\n\nBut, when you have several claims, some of which go for one party and some of which go for another, there is room for debate over who really prevailed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, given the comparatively small amount of dollars at stake, the parties may have simply agreed on a costs resolution (which probably awarded the trial court plaintiff all or most of his costs) to avoid spending more on litigation over how costs are awarded (and equally important, to avoid spending precious words in an Canadian Supreme Court appellate brief arguing that small dollar side issue).\n\nI've entered into similar agreements in appeals of complicated cases in the U.S. for the same reasons.\n\nI don't know if Canadian practice is to file a stipulation of record regarding costs in the trial court, or to simply note in the trial court record or an appellate brief that there is an agreement that has been reached, with a signed copy sitting in each side's files.\n\nAnother possibility is that at the outset of the case, or after an initial mediation, there was an agreement reached about costs (perhaps with both sides waiving a claim to costs) as part of a global agreement regarding procedural matters like limiting the scope of the claims to be pursued, dismissing secondary parties from the suit, or stipulating to key facts and/or to the admissibility of key documents to streamline a trial.\n\nVancouver may well have been motivated in part by appearances. Also, at least in U.S. practice, court filing fees are waived for governmental entities, and neither the lawyers nor the police witnesses give rise to any meaningful marginal cost particular to this lawsuit since the government lawyers and police are both salaried employees of the government, even though the legal fees of the government lawyers are probably recoverable in the proper case. So, waiving a right to collect costs may have been a very minor economic concession to it.\n\nVancouver also has a great strategic interest in having the case resolved in a precedent making case that can guide its future policies and practices going forward in a situation like is likely to recur, so they have some interest in having the trial court Plaintiff go the distance all of the way to the Canadian Supreme Court to resolve the legal issue the case presented. So, there are all sorts of reasons that Vancouver, in a case involving a recurring type issue presented to a governmental entity might want to reach an agreement on costs and would not merely be focused on maximizing its outcome in the particular case.\n\nAlso, while we don't know for sure, it is doubtful that the trial court Plaintiff was personally paying out of pocket to litigate to the Canadian Supreme Court over a $5,100 damages award. Probably some NGO or lawyer with a strategic interest in establishing the precedent financed most of the costs in practice. So, neither side economically felt much of the costs in this case making it an easier issue to negotiate.\n\nBut, in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, and *Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi* (Rev 3\\) \\[2015] UKSC 67, which don't involve governmental entities, concerns about public image or a paramount desire to make precedents to guide future transactions of one of the parties are not nearly so great.\n\nIn those cases, a cost\\-benefit analysis in the individual case about the amount of costs at issue v. the amount of money that could be spent fighting over costs is probably more likely to be the main factor, particularly if the cases are complex enough that the amount of work necessary to fully litigate the costs issue could be significant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A civil rights activist is suing a city government for wrongful imprisonment and an illegal strip search. The case reaches the Supreme Court of Canada, where the activist wins on the strip search claim but loses on the wrongful imprisonment claim. After the ruling, the parties announce they had a pre-existing agreement regarding costs. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this agreement?\n\nA) The city agreed to waive all costs to avoid negative publicity\nB) The activist agreed to cover all costs in exchange for the city admitting fault\nC) Both parties agreed to split costs equally regardless of the outcome\nD) The parties negotiated a nuanced agreement to streamline the litigation process and focus on the main legal issues\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation is D, as it best reflects the complex considerations involved in high-profile litigation, especially those reaching the Supreme Court. This answer demonstrates an understanding of strategic legal thinking and the practical aspects of managing complex cases.\n\nThe explanation provided in the documentation suggests several factors that could lead to such an agreement:\n\n1. The case involved multiple claims with mixed outcomes, making it difficult to determine a clear \"prevailing party\" for cost purposes.\n2. The relatively small damages at stake ($5,100) compared to the potential costs of litigating the cost issue itself.\n3. The government's interest in establishing precedent for future cases, which might make them more willing to negotiate on costs.\n4. The possibility that the plaintiff was supported by an NGO or pro bono counsel, changing the financial dynamics of the case.\n5. The potential for such an agreement to streamline the litigation process, allowing both parties to focus on the main legal issues rather than procedural matters.\n\nOptions A and B are overly simplistic and don't reflect the nuanced nature of such agreements in complex litigation. Option C is unlikely as it doesn't account for the strategic considerations involved.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about legal strategy rather than mere memorization of facts."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85485/what-legal-rights-do-i-have-after-paying-a-deposit-for-some-building-work", "docs_id": 85485, "title": "What legal rights do I have after paying a deposit for some building work?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently got some quotes in for refitting the garage door on my house. This obviously involves the builder making a substantial one\\-off purchase of a door to my specifications which he is going to find difficult to sell on should I withdraw from the work. As such, I was happy to pay a 25% deposit \\- about \u00a3600 \\- to him. We're both based in England.\n\nHowever, after doing so it was bought to my attention that builders do not generally ask for deposits for smaller jobs. To add to the concern, the builder in question is not currently responding to my calls or emails although it has only been 5 days since I paid the deposit and 24 hours since I reached out for clarification.\n\nThe builder in question is a local firm and was known to one of the other people who came to quote. The request for a deposit was issued via a formal invoice \\- sent via email \\- including reference numbers. I obviously have this email and also a bank record of the payment. Nothing has been physically signed. He confirmed receipt of the payment with a simple \"thank you\" and that's the last I've heard from him.\n\nIf this does turn out to be a dodgy tradesman who fails to get the work booked in and tries to walk off with my money, given the paper trail I have of the invoice and payment, will I have legal recourse to get the money back from him?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legally, yes\n------------\n\nAt this point you have a legally binding contract.

Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner in England pays a 25% deposit (\u00a3600) to a local builder for a garage door refit. After five days of no communication and growing concerns, the homeowner discovers that deposits for smaller jobs are uncommon. If the builder fails to complete the work and attempts to keep the deposit, which of the following factors would be most crucial in determining the homeowner's best course of action?\n\nA) The existence of a formal signed contract between the homeowner and builder\nB) The duration of time since the deposit was paid\nC) The paper trail of the invoice and payment, despite the lack of a physical signature\nD) The builder's reputation and references from other local tradesmen\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most crucial factor in this scenario is the paper trail of the invoice and payment (option C). Despite the lack of a physical signature, the documentation provides evidence of a legally binding contract. The question states that the homeowner has \"a bank record of the payment\" and \"email and also a bank record of the payment,\" which establishes a clear paper trail.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question explicitly states that \"Nothing has been physically signed,\" ruling out the existence of a formal signed contract. Option B is less relevant, as the duration since payment doesn't significantly impact the legal standing of the agreement. Option D, while potentially important for choosing a builder, is less crucial for legal recourse than tangible evidence of the transaction.\n\nThe top answer in the documentation supports this by stating, \"At this point you have a legally binding contract. If the builder does not finish in a reasonable time, you can sue.\" However, it also notes that practical considerations (such as the cost of legal action) might make pursuing legal recourse less advisable for small amounts.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (contract law, evidence, and practical considerations) and applies them to a real-world scenario, testing the ability to analyze the situation and identify the most legally significant factor."}}
