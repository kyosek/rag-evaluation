What does that say about the company?](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/a/129524/26185) I had yesterday an discussion where another user claimed by \u00a7670 BGB companys are in Germany legally required to reimburse any justified expenses the interviewee had to participate the interview. If this is not what \u00a7670 BGB says and the claim is wrong, that would answer my question, too. But for this post I first assume that it is true.\n\nSo given that, I am wondering, why the german \"Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\" (which is an government organization AFAIK) has the following procedure, I went trhoguh multiple times (This happened exclusively with small companys, where I could understand they might try to get around additional expanses, tho):\n\n* I applied for a position and got an invite for an job interview (No mention of reimbursement in any way)\n* I forwarded the invite via email to the \"Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\" what is an requirement for them reimbursing me my expenses\n* I had the interviews, and handed my proofs of expanses to the \"Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\"\n* They requested me to hand them a written statement of the company that the company is not going to reimburse me any expenses.\n* The company usually had already such a writing prepared and just sent it to me.\n* The \"Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\" reimburse my expenses\n\nSo my question is:\n\n**Why would the \"Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\" openly support this behavior and why the companys are willing to hand out without hesitation such a written statement, if it was contradicting with the requirement by \u00a7670 BGB?**\n\n---\n\n1 Comment transcript:\n\n> Also companies are legally required to reimburse travelexpenses for interviews in Germany. \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> @Nacorid: Definitely they are not! When I was supported by a social agency in Germany every time I wanted them (the agency) to reimburse my travel expanses, I had to hand in a written statement of the company that interviewed me, that they are not reimbursing any expanses I had. If they were legally required to, this whole process would be a farce. The only reason why most company's do it anyways, is cause they can hand in this reimbursement for their taxes. But they don't have to. \u2013 Zaibis\n\n> @Zaibis \u00a7670 BGB clearly states that they are required to if they invite you for an interview, even if you do not get or accept any job offer \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> Unless they clearly communicated, in writing for their safety, before the interview took place, that they are not going to reimburse travelexpenses \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> @Nacorid: But can we actually consider an job interview being a contract? As I understand \u00a7670 BGB refering to actions been taken within a contract. Not a lawyer, tho. \u2013 Zaibis\n\n> @Zaibis Not a lawyer either, however I\u2019m not sure that contract would be an appropriate translation, since the law is talking about \u201cAuftrag\u201d which in the case of an interview would be the interviewee (\u201cBeauftragter\u201d) traveling to (\u201cAuftrag\u201d) the interviewer (\u201cAuftraggeber\u201d) for the interview (\u201cAuftrag\u201d). There have been numerous cases of denying reimbursement which were almost all ruled in favor of the candidate as long as the travel costs were reasonable. By which they for example mean \u201cnot a 1\\. class plane/train ticket for the role of a project manager\u201d \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> @Nacorid: In that case I still wonder, why the \"Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\" is willing to reimburse, for the company, as long, as you get a written (after requesting it) statement of the company, that they aren't willing to pay the travel expanses, given they were required by law to do so. That would mean, I got last year by at least 5 company's a written statement in which they confirmed, they don't respect German law. That sounds weird to me. \u2013 Zaibis\n\n> @Zaibis That is because it is perfectly legal to declare beforehand that there will be no reimbursement and there might also be legal intricacies about \u201cArbeitslose\u201d which I am not aware of \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> @Nacorid I didnt say it was beforehand: The process was in at least 5 cases as following: I got an invite for an interview after applying (no mentioning of travel expanses) I accepted, informed the agency about the invite by forwarding the email. I had the interview, asked the agency for reimbursment and they asked me to provide a written statement by the company that they are not gonna reimburse me. I understand why the company would try getting around such a law. But not why a governor organisation would support the companys with it. Know what? I am gonna ask about this tomorrow on lawSE :) \u2013 Zaibis\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What \u00a7670 BGB basically says is that the default is that companies have to reimburse you for expenses that you incurred for interviewing with them. If they don't want to reimburse you, they have to tell you so in writing before you incur any costs. That way it's your decision if you still want to go if you have to pay for expenses yourself.\n\nIt does *not* mean your expenses have to be paid, it means you should *know beforehand* whether they *will* be paid.\n\nSo what I take from your story is that you never actually asked the company for reimbursement, expecting the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit to pay that for you. Well, no company is going to pay your expenses *if you don't ask for it*. And that's not a crime. You also never *told* the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit that you were not informed beforehand that your expenses would not be paid. They asked for proof, you delivered proof. It's not their job to find out how or when you got handed this written statement and if that constitutes a violation of \u00a7670\\. \n\nAnd as a little reality check: paying your expenses (probably something along the lines of a cab fare or bus ticket?) is way more cost effective for the AA than suing a small company for the same amount. Just the time of the lawyer filing the suit will probably cost more than your public transportation ticket for the next year.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to \u00a7670 BGB in Germany, regarding reimbursement of interview expenses, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Companies are always legally required to reimburse all interview expenses, regardless of prior communication.\n\nB) Companies never have to reimburse interview expenses, and it's always the responsibility of the job seeker or the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit.\n\nC) Companies must reimburse interview expenses unless they clearly communicate in writing, before the interview, that they will not do so.\n\nD) The Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit is legally obligated to reimburse all interview expenses on behalf of companies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to \u00a7670 BGB, the default expectation is that companies should reimburse candidates for reasonable interview expenses. However, companies can avoid this obligation if they clearly communicate in writing, prior to the interview, that they will not cover these expenses. This allows the candidate to make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the interview given this information. The other options are either too absolute (A and B) or misrepresent the role of the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit (D). The correct interpretation balances the general expectation of reimbursement with the company's ability to opt out if they inform the candidate in advance."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5419/holding-or-selling-a-laptop-due-to-unpaid-repairs", "docs_id": 5419, "title": "Holding or selling a laptop due to unpaid repairs", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the UK are the any laws which stipulate what can be done when a repair is carried out on an item but not paid for? \n\nI have been told that you can hold on to the item until payment is received but I don't know the law behind that. \n\nAlso, at any point, can you sell the item to reclaim costs? \n\nThe items I am interested in are laptops, Pcs, and other related electronic devices. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the USA, there's a concept known as a \"mechanic's lien.\" The lien applies to repairs done to a vehicle (an asset).

The shop likely has a right of lien, allowing them to retain possession of the laptop until payment is received. This is similar to the concept mentioned in the original question.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean face-to-face cross-examination in nearly all circumstances. While there are very limited exceptions for minors or unavoidably absent witnesses, these would not apply to Alice. Anonymous testimony is not permissible as it would prevent the defendant from effectively challenging the witness's credibility.

Or a term of a contract rather than a representation about the contract, depending on context.\n\nWarranty also has a common meaning that makes it a synonym of guarantee.\n\nIt can also mean a court order calling for the arrest of someone (an arrest warrant) or to search a premises (a search warrant).\n\nIt can also mean the authorization from the government to act as a high ranking NCO in a military service \\- NCOs hold warrants, officers have commissions.\n\nAmong others ...", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In contract law, which of the following best describes the legal definition of a \"warranty\"?\n\nA) A service agreement that covers repairs and maintenance of a product\nB) A term in a contract that, if breached, does not justify terminating the contract\nC) A court order authorizing the arrest of an individual\nD) An authorization from the government to act as a high-ranking NCO in military service\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nB is correct because in contract law, a warranty specifically refers to a term in a contract that, if breached, does not justify terminating the entire contract. This is distinct from a condition, which would allow for termination if breached.\n\nA is incorrect because this describes a service or maintenance contract, which is often colloquially called a \"warranty\" but does not align with the legal definition in contract law.\n\nC is incorrect as this describes an arrest warrant, which is a different legal concept unrelated to contract law.\n\nD is incorrect as this refers to a military warrant, which is also unrelated to the contract law definition of warranty.\n\nThis question tests the ability to distinguish between the legal definition of warranty in contract law and other common uses of the term in different contexts."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82501/what-are-the-laws-for-lunch-breaks-for-salaried-employees-in-alberta-canada", "docs_id": 82501, "title": "What are the laws for lunch breaks for salaried employees in Alberta, Canada?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Alberta Law: [https://www.alberta.ca/hours\\-work\\-rest.aspx](https://www.alberta.ca/hours-work-rest.aspx)\n\n> An employee is entitled to one 30\\-minute paid or unpaid break **after\n> the first 5 hours** of work for shifts that are between 5 and 10 hours\n> long.\n\nMy Contract:\n\n> The Employee shall be available to provide services **no later than 6:00am** or the time of day time required to support the technical requirements for that trading period.\n> The Employee is expected to work no less than 8 hours on all business days.

[Certain industries](https://www.alberta.ca/exceptions-for-specific-industries.aspx) have specific exemptions.\n\n> 2(1\\) This Act applies to all employers and employees, including\n> the Crown in right of Alberta and its employees, except as\n> otherwise provided in this Part. (*[Employment Standards Code](https://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/E09.pdf)*)\n\nYour exact situation does matter when the tribunal or courts decide if an agreement or employment contract is enforceable when it does not directly contradict an employment standard. For example, requiring a six\\-month notice period before an employee can resign is likely not enforceable for minimum wage employees, but for an executive officer it may be reasonable and hold up.\n\n---\n\n> Is this against the law\n\nAlberta does not require that the break to be within or immediately after the first five hours of work, **if you agree to it** (including by signing an employment contract).\n\nIf you do not, then\n\n> If the employer and the employee cannot agree on a break schedule:\n> \n> \n> * The employer must provide at least 30 minutes within or immediately following the first 5 hours of the shift (at a time chosen by the employer)\n> * For shifts 10 hours or longer, the employer must provide at least 30 minutes within or immediately following the first 5 hours of the shift (at a time chosen by the employer) and a second break of at least 30 minutes after the first 5 hours of the shift.\n\nUnfortunately, in this situation, the employer may terminate you if you do not agree to a schedule convenient to their business (just like they can fire you for refusing overtime).\n\nNot agreeing to rest periods however does not constitute a reasonable cause to dismiss an employee for cause. You are still entitled to notice periods and severances depending on your employment history and employment contract.\n\n---\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, an employee was entitled to a 30\\-minute break *within* each five hours of work under the legislation passed by the labour\\-friendly New Democratic government, however, this change was reversed by the United Conservatives in 2020\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An employee in Alberta starts work at 6:00 AM and is scheduled to work until 2:30 PM with a 30-minute unpaid lunch break.

In this scenario, the employee starts work at 6:00 AM, so the first 5 hours of work end at 11:00 AM. The law states that the break should be provided \"within or immediately following\" the first 5 hours. Therefore, the latest time the employer must provide the break is 12:00 PM (noon), which is at the end of the 6th hour of work.\n\nOption A (11:00 AM) is incorrect because while this marks the end of the first 5 hours, the law allows for the break to be provided after this time.\n\nOption B (11:30 AM) is incorrect because while this would be compliant with the law, it's not the latest possible time the employer could provide the break.\n\nOption D (1:00 PM) is incorrect because this would be 7 hours into the shift, which exceeds the \"within or immediately following the first 5 hours\" requirement.\n\nIt's worth noting that between 2017 and 2020, the correct answer would have been different due to the changes implemented by the New Democratic government, which required the break to be within each five hours of work.

The employee has a reasonable belief that working in a completely different asset class does not violate the non-compete clause, as it falls under the exception for \"services or activities with which you were not concerned to a material extent.\" However, the situation is not entirely clear-cut, and there is a risk that the current employer may disagree with this interpretation.\n\nOption A is too risky and potentially unethical. Option B is overly cautious and may unnecessarily delay the employee's career progression.

This may or may not be copyright infringement. This is important to YouTube channel operators because the [YouTube TOS](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms) states:\n\n> ... the Content you submit must not include third\\-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) **unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so**. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.\n\nYoutube \\[Copyright Policy]([https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/copyright/]](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/copyright/%5D) states:\n\n> Creators should only upload videos that they have made or that they're authorized to use. That means they should not upload videos they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations.\n\nYoutubne's [Fair Use policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9783148?hl=en) states:\n\n> Different countries have different rules about when it\u2019s OK to use material without the copyright owner\u2019s permission. For example, in the United States, works of commentary, criticism, research, teaching, or news reporting may be considered fair use. Some other countries have a similar concept called fair dealing that may work differently.\n> \n> \n> Courts look over potential fair use cases according to the facts of each specific case. **You\u2019ll probably want to get legal advice from an expert before uploading videos that contain copyright\\-protected material.**\n\nThere are several possibilities.\n\n1. All the other videos (source videos) have been released under a permissive license whch permits reuse, and the new video complies with any conditions specified in the license or licenses. (Such conditions probably include giving attribution, that is proper credit, to the source videos. This usually means displaying the author and title, as well as providign a link to the source.)\n\nIf this is true, the use is not copyright infringement. If this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids.\n2. If all the source videos are in the public domain. This is somewhat unlikely, but possible if they are copies of films from sufficiently long ago that their copyrights expired. Also, works created by an officer or employee of the US Federal Government in the course of that person's official duties are generally in the public domain (although not if the work was created by a contractor rather than an employee. For example, many NASA vids are in the public domain.\n\nIf **this** is true, the use is not copyright infringement. Again, if this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids. No attribution is legally required for public domain vids.\n3. If the creator of the new vid has asked for and received permission from the copyright owners of all source videos, and has complied with any conditions of those permissions. This may involve paying a fee to the source owners, and is very likely to involve proper attribution, but each owner can set whatever conditions that owner pleases.\n\nIf **this** is true, the use is not copyright infringement. Again, if this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids. However, all conditions must be carefully com,plied with.\n4. If the creator of the new video is located in or under the jurisdiction of the US (or the copyright owner of the source is under US jurisdiction), and the creator asserts that the use is a ***Fair Use***. Fair use is an intentionally vagus concept, and it is always decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis. Whether a use is a fair use is highly fact\\-based, that is the specific facts of the individual case matter a lot. Often important is whether the use will harm the market for the sourer, and whether the use is **transformative**. A Use is \"transformative\" if it is used for a significantly different purpose than the original was. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) and other threads tagged [fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\") on this site for more details on fair use.\n\nA fair use is not an infringement of copyright. But the only way to be **sure** that a ise is a fair use is to be sued in US Federal Court, raise a fair use defense, and win. A copyright lawyer can often give a reasonable opinion on whether a particular use will be considered a fair use.\n\nA compilation video, using only short snippets of each source, might well be considered to be a fair use, but that cannot be guaranteed in general.\n\nYouTube follows its own policies on copyright issues, including demonatization.

Using content released under Creative Commons licenses is generally permissible as long as the creator follows the terms of the license, which typically include providing proper attribution. This scenario doesn't rely on fair use arguments or partial permissions, which can be more uncertain and risky.\n\nOption A could potentially be considered fair use due to the added commentary, but it's not guaranteed and still uses copyrighted material without permission. Option C also relies on a fair use argument, which is always case-specific and not guaranteed to be accepted.

I'd prefer we limit the discussion to the US, but if clear\\-enough evidence (one way or the other) is only available from other common\\-law jurisdictions, I'd accept an answer based on a proxy jurisdiction.\n\nI'm not sure if this self\\-answers my Q (I would like more evidence) but LII Wex [says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/promissory_estoppel#:%7E:text=Within%20contract%20law%2C%20promissory%20estoppel,detrimentally%20relied%20on%20the%20promise.) in broad terms that:\n\n> An agreement made by promissory estoppel will typically have the same binding effects on parties that a valid contract would.\n\n(N.B. Another source [says](https://lawshelf.com/shortvideoscontentview/contract-law-promissory-estoppel-as-a-substitute-for-consideration/) that promissory estoppel \"was formally \u201cushered\u201d onto the stage of American contract law in 1932\". So I guess evidence has to be after that year...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've never seen that principle invoked in U.S. law. There are tax reasons not to make zero interest loans to related parties (unpaid interest at a low market rate is deemed income to the lender for income tax purposes, followed by a gift from the lender to the borrower for gift tax purposes), but no substantive contact law ones in U.S. jurisprudence.\n\nConsideration is a greatly degraded doctrine, but normally, the consideration in this transaction in a suit by a lender to enforce the contract would be obvious. The loan is made for the consideration that it must be repaid later.\n\nA promise to make an interest free loan in the future might face more consideration problems as a barrier to enforcement by someone seeking to now receive a zero rate interest loan from the person who promised to make one without getting anything in return for that promise.\n\nIndeed, there are standard commercial terms for such arrangements that are used routinely, such as \"thirty days net\" which means paid for with an interest free loan due thirty days after the day of the invoice. Similarly, there are examples of zero interest government bonds.\n\nThis said, promissory estoppel remains good law and is often pleaded in the alternative with breach of contract in any remotely atypical basically contractual transaction. Promissory estoppel is almost identical to breach of contract but substitutes detrimental reliance on a promise for consideration.\n\n**Footnote:**\n\n> (N.B. Another source says that promissory estoppel \"was formally\n> \u201cushered\u201d onto the stage of American contract law in 1932\". So I guess\n> evidence has to be after that year...)\n\nThis is probably a reference to the First Restatement of Contracts. Indeed, upon checking it, that is what it says. The First Restatement relied on prior caselaw to make its points, so the statement isn't truly accurate (and the Restatements aren't binding sources of law, there is nothing \"formal\" about it unlike the adoption of a statute or a precedent setting case decision, the Restatements are just a persuasive source of common law principles), but the First Restatement of Contracts certainly made Promissory Estoppel much more widely known and accepted in U.S. law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In U.S. contract law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding zero-interest loans?\n\nA) Zero-interest loans are always unenforceable in court due to lack of consideration.\n\nB) Zero-interest loans can only be enforced through promissory estoppel, not as regular contracts.\n\nC) Zero-interest loans are generally enforceable as regular contracts, with the loan itself serving as consideration.\n\nD) Zero-interest loans are only enforceable if they are government bonds or commercial arrangements like \"thirty days net\" terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, zero-interest loans are generally enforceable as regular contracts in U.S. law. The consideration in such a transaction is obvious: the loan is made with the consideration that it must be repaid later. The lack of interest does not invalidate the contract or require reliance on promissory estoppel for enforcement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because zero-interest loans are not automatically unenforceable due to lack of consideration.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because while promissory estoppel can be used, it's not the only way to enforce zero-interest loans. They can be enforced as regular contracts.\n\nAnswer D is too narrow. While these are examples of zero-interest arrangements, they are not the only enforceable forms of zero-interest loans.\n\nThe passage indicates that consideration is a \"greatly degraded doctrine\" in U.S. law, and the repayment obligation itself serves as sufficient consideration for the contract to be valid and enforceable."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4887/website-registration-terms-agreement-implicit-with-a-blurb-or-need-checkbox", "docs_id": 4887, "title": "Website Registration Terms Agreement - Implicit With a Blurb or Need Checkbox?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: During sign\\-up, the user must agree to the terms and conditions and privacy policy. \n\nIs it sufficient to state: \"by registering, you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy\" (where the words \"terms of service\" and \"privacy policy\" are hyperlinked to their respective documents, and where the blurb is placed directly above the \"Sign Up\" submit button)\n\nOr, does there need to be a check box so that the user must explicitly click it to indicate agreement?\n\nI see both of these scenarios all over the web.

In a civil fraud case, the plaintiff must prove that they relied on the fraudulent representation and suffered damages as a result. Since Jones immediately recognized the document as fake and did not rely on it, there is no basis for a civil fraud claim (eliminating options A and D). \n\nWhile forgery can be a criminal offense, private citizens cannot directly pursue criminal cases; only prosecutors can do so (eliminating option C). \n\nHowever, producing a forged document in court, even if not believed, can be considered an attempt to defraud the court.

The choice to seek enforcement is *entirely* at the discretion of the person whose right was violated \\- if they choose not to enforce their right then this is a [waiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiver).\n\n**The No part**\n\nWaivers happen all the time because contracts are breached in immaterial or inconsequential ways and people just move on. \n\nMany contracts contain a clause to the effect that a waiver does not amount to a permanent waiver and that they reserve their rights on future breaches. This is important because a contract is more than the written agreement; it involves the entire conduct of the parties.

But it might be possible if a single person made so many login attempts that it incurred you non\\-negligible bandwidth cost or even caused a denial\\-of\\-service.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, what is the legal status of unsuccessful attempts to log into someone else's computer system without permission, and what is the appropriate course of action for the system owner?\n\nA) It's a misdemeanor, and the system owner should immediately sue the ISP for the attacker's identity.\nB) It's not a crime, and the system owner has no legal recourse.\nC) It's not a misdemeanor, but the system owner can file a civil lawsuit if they can prove significant financial damages.\nD) It's a misdemeanor, and the system owner should report it to the police, who may then request the attacker's identity from the ISP.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, unsuccessful attempts to access someone else's computer system without permission are not considered a misdemeanor in Germany. The law (StGB 202a) only applies to successful unauthorized access. The system owner cannot immediately sue the ISP for the attacker's identity, as this is typically done in copyright infringement cases, which are civil matters. \n\nFor failed login attempts, there is no immediate criminal offense to report to the police. However, the system owner could potentially file a civil lawsuit if they can prove significant financial damages resulting from the attempts, such as substantial bandwidth costs or a denial-of-service situation. In such a case, they would need to explain to a judge the extent of the financial damage to justify forcing the ISP to disclose the attacker's identity.\n\nThe correct approach is not to immediately involve law enforcement or file a lawsuit, but to consider legal action only if there are provable, significant damages resulting from the failed login attempts."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/40576/how-to-judge-if-a-contract-is-detailed-enough", "docs_id": 40576, "title": "How to judge if a contract is detailed enough?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [What is a contract and what is required for them to be valid?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6263/what-is-a-contract-and-what-is-required-for-them-to-be-valid/6264#6264) explains the basics of a contract. However, any simple contract may potentially have ambiguities that would make it difficult or impossible to decide if the contract is being fulfilled. For example, if I make a contract for someone to fix my car, I should actually specify what exactly needs fixing and what would constitute being fixed. Otherwise the person could just top off the oil and call it a day.\n\nPresumably at some point, common sense is exercised to decide if some unexpected development follows this spirit and intent of the contract or not. After all, it's difficult if not impossible to state anything with perfect disambiguity. But [some contract authors still try](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement#Criticism). Since EULAs are probably written by some pretty good lawyers, does that mean that such overly detailed documents can be considered the standard of a very good contract? What *is* a reasonable standard for how much a contract should specify, and how much should be left to \"well, let's just hope we can all come to some agreement if and when that weird freak case happens\".\n\nWhen contract lawyers write a contract, how do they decide when it's \"detailed enough\"? Are there rules of thumb that a lay person could use?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary ideology in legal writing is \"use what has worked\". This is a millenium\\-old practice in the common law tradition (predating the development of what is known as \"the common law\"). This explains the substantial similarity between legal documents, and is responsible for the rise of \"legalese\" \u2013 legal writers do not start from scratch. If a given contract form works for one case, it's reasonable to expect that it will work for analogous cases (where \"works\" means \"has the expected outcome in case of legal dispute\"). Rental agreements are exemplars of recycling of contracts which has worked before.\n\nA recycled contract can fail for two main (and related) reasons. First, the legislature may change the law \u2013 for some political reason, it may be decided to forbid a certain condition in a tenancy agreement. Second, appeals courts may \"discover\" that a condition really has a different effect that was assumed (e.g. which words does \"knowingly\" refer to). This can motivate post hoc or preemptive rewriting of contract templates (where the lawyer sees a risk in using the old language but where the courts have not definitively handed down a ruling).\n\nThere are various [principles of legal interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation) which influence legal writing, generally summarized in a Latin expression such as Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius, meaning \"the mention of one thing is the exclusion of others\". The practical effect of that canon of interpretation is, the more explicit your list, the less likely a novel situation will be already covered. For instance, if your present a contract that forbids passengers from \"possessing weapons\" on the boat, you haven't defined \"weapon\", so that is left to common sense. If you define \"weapon\" as \"pistol, rifle, shotgun, explosive, poison gas, knife, flame thrower, sword, bayonet, brass knuckles, nunchuck\", you run a risk that your list failed to include death\\-ray (a new technology). The risk is that in adjudicating the contract, the court will decide (invoking *contra proferentem*) that as the author of the contract you did not intend to exclude the death ray, because you could have included it in your list but did not. (It's not guaranteed that the court will exclude a death ray, but there is a risk). In other words, too much explicitness can work against you, in case there is some slightly different scenario that you did not anticipate.\n\nThere is a distinction between an actual ambiguity which is a property of language, and vagueness. A clause that says \"drive a car or truck owned by a competitor\" can be interpreted by the rule of English as meaning \"drive a car owned by a competitor or a truck owned by a competitor\", or \"drive any car, or else a truck which is owned by a competitor\" \u2013 this is a linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity is more easily solved and correspondingly should be more vigorously eliminated. Trying to micro\\-define \"computer\" is more an exercise in imagination (does it include smart phones, smart watches, your car's ignition system?).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A contract lawyer is drafting a clause prohibiting the use of electronic devices during a confidential meeting.

While most states define a knife as a weapon by edge length, I can not find any legal definition of what constitutes an edge or what constitutes a knife as a weapon in regards to school zones.\n\nMany things that some people may call a knife are not weapons at all such as palette knives, butter knives, oyster knives, etc. Palette knives are even required school supplies for many schools that have an art program.\n\nThen there are things that look like knives, like nail files, letter openers, etc., which are not called knives, have no cutting edge, but which I've heard of people getting in trouble for purely on the grounds that they \"look like knives\".\n\nThere are also many tools that have an edge sharp enough to potentially cut or stab but not things that people would call a knife, like keys, chisels, box openers, saws, screwdrivers, etc. Many of these tools are allowed on school property by maintenance personnel and are required class materials in certain courses like wood\\-working, and keys are literally carried by everyone who drives into or through a school zone.\n\nThen there are also \"blunted weapons\". \"Wall\\-hangers\" are decorative swords, daggers, etc. that look like they could be real weapons, but are blunted for safety, and so have no effective cutting or stabbing edges. Similarly, a fencing rapier also looks like a full length sword, but has been blunted and is required equipment on school campuses that have fencing teams.\n\nOn top of all of this, a handful of states, such as Louisiana, don't even have edge length restrictions that differentiate a short\\-bladed \"tool\" from a long bladed \"weapon\".\n\nSo the question is: with all the ambiguity and exceptions, are there any rulings in place that would allow a reasonable person of at least average intelligence to determine what constitutes the crime, and if not, could knife restrictions in school zones be considered [void for vagueness](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2228) under the 14th Amendment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: School administrators have the right to try to express the law in seemingly simpler language, but they do not have the right to enforce their misstatements of the law. [The law of Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=78741) does not refer to knives at all\n\n> Carrying a firearm, or dangerous weapon as defined in [R.S. 14:2](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78337),\n> by a student or nonstudent on school property, at a school sponsored\n> function, or in a firearm\\-free zone is unlawful...\n\n\"Dangerous weapon\" is defined so that it \"includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm\". The law does not exhaustively list the things that count as firearms or dangerous weapons, so every individual is held responsible for knowing what the courts have held to constitute \"dangerous weapons\". A novice interpretation (not relying on case law) might lead to the conclusion that a speargun is not a \"dangerous weapon\" (perhaps on the theory that it is used underwater to spear fish), but a reasonable interpretation of \"dangerous weapon\" suggests that it is a dangerous weapon because it can be used to kill a person. The same is true of a pencil, as well as a dog.\n\nYou can turn to [this article](https://www.animallaw.info/article/jaws-bite-claws-snatch) for an example of the dangerous weapon status of a dog, a propos [Louisiana v. Michels](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-michels-1), where defendant was \"armed with a dangerous weapon\". That court recited previous case law to the effect that\n\n> \"the dangerousness of the instrumentality because of its use is a\n> factual question for the jury\" State v. Munoz, 575 So.2d 848, 850\n\nRX 14:3 also states that\n\n> The articles of this Code cannot be extended by analogy so as to\n> create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to promote\n> justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions\n> shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of\n> their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the\n> context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision\n\nwhich means that if faced with a novel application (dog, pencil, or speargun), the jury can decide based on \"context and purpose\", not just narrow words. The article points to a law review article by a lawyer involved in the 1942 codification of Louisiana criminal law that \"the code was to be read as a civilian document, not a mere compilation of common law rules\", thus the code is shorter and uses plain language.\n\nThe article then reviews a number of previous rulings on the scope of \"dangerous weapon\", starting with [Louisiana v. Calvin](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-calvin-4) where it was ruled that teeth and fists are not dangerous weapons, even though you can kill a person with your fists. It therefore turns out that a \"dangerous weapon\" must be an inanimate object, under Louisiana law.\n\nA knife *can* be found to be a dangerous weapon, as reported in [this opinion](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/12/12-41425-CR0.pdf) (deportation dependent on a prior criminal conviction for felony aggravated battery, specifically referring to R.S. 14\\.2(3\\) and deeming a knife to be a dangerous weapon). Since that conviction is no being appealed at the state level, details of the knife\\-usage are omitted, so all we know is that a knife was used.\n\nInsofar as box cutters were the essential weapons that brought about the airplane hijackings on 9/11, it is not unreasonable to at least consider that they are within the scope of \"dangerous weapon\" (I would not, but that's a matter for the jury). A butter knife or especially a pencil cannot reasonably be deemed to be \"dangerous weapons\". But there doesn't seem to be any case law specifically addressing these objects. If a pencil were actually used as a weapon, perhaps the jury might find that a pencil (so used) was a dangerous weapon.

The definition of a \"dangerous weapon\" is not exhaustively listed but includes any instrumentality which, in the manner used, is likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\n\n2.

In the emails, I specifically requested a month to month lease as I did not want to commit to a year, and she told me that I could do that with the penalty of an extra $100 per month. So if I signed the 1 year lease it would be $1050/month and for the month to month lease it would be $1150/month. I agreed that was exactly what I wanted, and we continued talking about when I would be moving in, etc. When I arrived in town, I met with her to sign the lease and get the keys, under the impression that everything we had discussed in the emails would be what was in the lease. I admit that it was my mistake that I should have read through the lease more thoroughly, but here is my current situation.\n\nAround April 20th, I emailed my landlord asking to give her 30 days notice as I am wanting to move. Her reply was that if I do that, I will be breaking my 1 year lease, and if I want to do that, we will have to discuss my options. To my shock I replied to her that I did not sign a 1 year lease, we had discussed and agreed that I only wanted month to month, and I am paying the $1150/month that she had clearly stated in our emails was the cost for the month to month lease. She then replied, the lease states it is for 1 year, if I want to come in and speak with her about options then I can. \n\nI then went to my lease, and sure enough, she had written the dates for 1 year rather than month to month. I understand that I should have more thoroughly looked through the lease and that is on me, but do the emails count as well? \n\nWhen I went in to speak with her, I tried to bring up what she had said in the emails, she kept interrupting me and and her only response was that in any sort of misunderstanding or dispute, we always refer back to the lease. I brought up how she clearly stated in the emails about the different amounts per month whether I signed a month to month lease or a year long lease, and all she had to say was how that is not stated in the lease so it is not relevant. I tried to say that according to the emails, I am overpaying $100 per month and she now owes me money ($600 now as I have paid for 6 months) and she repeated, that is not stated in the lease so its not relevant. She is also saying that I owe $250 for breaking the one year lease. \n\nI guess what I am asking is, can she do this, and is it true that the emails are not relevant? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The emails are not completely irrelevant, but the terms of the actual signed lease are vastly more relevant. You have some reason (based on emails) to believe that you would be getting a month to month lease for $1150 / mo., and you believed that the alternative was a year lease for $1050 / mo. But you were presented with and signed a lease for 1 year at $1150 / mo. The fact that the landlord accepted your payments at $1150 shows nothing about the presumed duration of the lease.\n\nThe emails are weak evidence about the agreement, and their exact wording would have to be scrutinized. If at the end of the email negotiations the landlord offered a month to month lease for $1150 per month (saying exactly that) and you then accepted, you have a bit of a leg to stand on. But if the landlord initially suggested a yearly lease for $1050 but eventually changed the terms in the course of the emails, you may have misunderstood her intent (perhaps she arbitrarily decided to up the rent).

If there is none, I'll just remove the logos.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I will note from the outset that journal editors might require things from you that go beyond what is legally necessary. A typical case is that they will require one to obtain permission before reusing a figure from another article/journal/author (even though in the vast majority of cases no such permission would be needed). The legal answer might allow you to push back on the editor\u2019s demands, but they still have the last word.\n\nThere are two kinds of intellectual property to consider. Unless otherwise noted, this answer is valid for [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\") and [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\").\n\nTrademark is almost certainly not an issue\n==========================================\n\nTrademark is a right to *branding*. A trademark holder can prevent others from using certain elements to promote their own products. The elements need not be complex, they just need to be recognizable by the public as related to the brand in question.\n\nFor instance, \"Tesla\" is the name of an 19th century Serbian\\-American inventor known among other things for discoveries related to radio transmission. You would probably be able to market a radio transmitter under a \"Tesla\" brand (assuming there are no existing trademarks, which I have not checked). If you try the same thing with electrical vehicles, [you will get sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.).\n\nFor a research paper, as long as you do not imply that Visa or MasterCard support your research or its results in any way, that should not be an issue.\n\nI assume, but cannot guarantee, that the above applies to most Western jurisdictions.\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright is a protection or creative elements. Whoever authors a creative work can forbid others from distributing it under certain conditions.\n\nAre the Visa and MasterCard logos copyrighted?\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe first question is whether the elements at hand are protected under copyright. In the case of the Visa and MasterCard logos, this might depend on the jurisdiction. The criterion for \"creativity\" varies a lot.\n\nSome jurisdiction have adopted (some version of) the [sweat of the brow doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow), according to which work suffices to produce a \"creative element\" with copyright protection. The typical example are databases of facts where each individual entry is unoriginal but the collection might take some time to collect, curate and maintain (such as a phone book).\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), the Supreme Court [rejected the sweat of the brow doctrine in 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.). Accordingly, a work needs to reach the [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality).\n\nDetermining whether the threshold is met for a given work is done on a case\\-by\\-case basis at trial. However, it seems very likely that both logos are not protected by copyright in the United States. The Visa logo is a simple font with no significant creative elements; the MasterCard logo contains two overlapping circles.\n\nI note that Wikimedia Commons hosts both logos on their website and claims they are public\\-domain under that rationale ([Visa](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Visa_2021.svg), [MasterCard](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mastercard_2019_logo.svg)). Wikimedia Commons usually follows copyright fairly closely, and they are a high\\-profile website hence a prime target for takedown requests by IP lawyers at Visa or MasterCard, so that is weak evidence that their claim is correct. But there is always the possibility that Visa / MasterCard just have not decided to sue yet.\n\nIn [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), the statute makes no explicit reference any threshold of originality: [(article L\\-112\\-1 of the code of intellectual property)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGISCTA000006161634/)\n\n> Les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code prot\u00e8gent les droits des auteurs sur toutes les oeuvres de l'esprit, quels qu'en soient le genre, la forme d'expression, le m\u00e9rite ou la destination.\n\n> The present code \\[containing all copyright statutes] protect copyrights for any works of mind, whatever their style, form of expression, artistic worth, or intended use.\n\nHowever, various court cases have tended to require \"works of mind\" to exhibit some amount of intellectual originality. For instance, [Civ. 1\u00e8re 22 janv. 2009, n\u00b008\\-11404](https://juricaf.org/arret/FRANCE-COURDECASSATION-20090122-0811404) held that a perfume cannot be copyrighted because\n\n> la fragrance d'un parfum, qui proc\u00e8de de la simple mise en oeuvre d'un savoir\\-faire, ne constitue pas la cr\u00e9ation d'une forme d'expression pouvant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection des oeuvres de l'esprit par le droit d'auteur\n\n> the smell of a perfume comes from the simple application of a know\\-how and does not constitute the creation of a form of expression subject to the protection of works of mind by copyright\n\nAfter a fifteen\\-minute look at various cases, I still do not have any strong idea of whether the Visa or MasterCard logo would be copyrighted in France. Let\u2019s assume for the sake of the argument that they are.\n\n\"Fair use\"\n----------\n\nEven copyrighted works can be used without the copyright holder\u2019s agreement under certain exceptions. Here again, any precise answer is jurisdiction\\-specific.\n\n\"Fair use\" is a US\\-specific doctrine, resulting from a string of court cases eventually codified into law ([Wikipedia has a decent history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)). It is a rather general doctrine (any use case can be analyzed under the four balancing factors) and results can be hard to predict. I believe research articles usually fall on the right side, but because the logos under discussion are not under copyright in the US (see above), I will not attempt to make any in\\-depth analysis.\n\n*Pedantic note: it is sloppy wording to use the term \"fair use\" for similar clauses in other jurisdictions. \"Fair use\" is a US doctrine.*\n\nIn [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), the corresponding doctrine is given by a rather strict but precise statute at [article L122\\-5 of the code of intellectual property](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000043975029):\n\n> Lorsque l'oeuvre a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e, l'auteur ne peut interdire :\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> 3\u00b0 Sous r\u00e9serve que soient indiqu\u00e9s clairement le nom de l'auteur et la source :\n> \n> \n> a) Les analyses et courtes citations justifi\u00e9es par le caract\u00e8re critique, pol\u00e9mique, p\u00e9dagogique, scientifique ou d'information de l'oeuvre \u00e0 laquelle elles sont incorpor\u00e9es ;\n\n> When the work has been published, the author cannot forbid:\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> 3\u00b0 As long as the name of the author and the source are clearly mentioned:\n> \n> \n> a) Analysis and short citations justified by the inclusion in a work with an aim of criticism, debate, pedagogy, science or information\n\nA research article is the typical case of a \"work of science\" (science means here \"scholarly research\", not STEM).

My guess is that they want:\n\n1. To avoid a jury that might be personally prejudiced against landlords or property management companies.\n2. An economic advantage in court. The Landlord presumably can afford better lawyers than the Tenant, so they want the Tenant to have no advantage.\n3. The jury might find the rental agreement confusing, so they might misunderstand the problem, whereas a judge would be better able to decide because of their legal background.\n\n**Is this a good intuition? Are there other reasons they would put that clause in a residential rental agreement?** \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None of the three factors you identify is correct.\n==================================================\n\nWith respect to reason (1\\):\n----------------------------\n\nThe belief that a judge is likely to be landlord friendly on the merits, while a factor favoring a bench trial is actually a pretty minor one. \n\nEmpirically, actual outcomes on the merits are far less different between jury trials and bench trials than you might expect. There aren't a lot of \"moving parts\" in a typical landlord\\-tenant case that afford the trier of fact much discretion. Usually there is evidence quantifying the amount of damage to the property in dollar terms and the amount of rent owed is usually just math. \n\nIt isn't like a personal injury case where pain and suffering damages are highly subjective and even liability which hinges on a common sense assessment of what constitutes \"reasonable case\" is very vague. \n\nThere may be some wiggle room in a landlord\\-tenant case to disagree on the credibility of witnesses and to differ in opinion regarding what constitutes \"reasonable wear and tear\", but the differences in litigation costs between a jury and bench trial will usually be greater in magnitude than the differences in outcomes on the merits between the two.\n\nOf course, in the rare case where the tenant is suing the landlord for a personal injury on the premises, the difference in outcome on the merits does matter quite a bit and a judge is much less likely to enter an extremely tenant favorable damages award than a jury is to do so. But, usually, lawyers for landlords aren't thinking about this scenario very much when they write a lease because it doesn't come up very often.\n\nWith respect to reason (2\\):\n----------------------------\n\nThe landlord actually probably has a procedural advantage over the tenant in a jury trial where having a lawyer is more important than a bench trial, but this is pretty irrelevant, because landlords are overwhelmingly more likely to win than the tenant anyway. It isn't hard to prove that somebody didn't pay all of the rent that was owed, or that they damaged the premises. Landlords care more about litigation costs than they do about their odds of winning on the merits.\n\nWith respect to reason (3\\):\n----------------------------\n\nAnd, the judge interprets of rental agreement for the jury \\- the jury only decides the factual issues that are disputed with regard to the rental agreement as the judge explains what it means to them. So, confusion isn't a major concern either.\n\nInstead, the biggest factors are timing and litigation costs.\n=============================================================\n\nA jury trial is longer, because it takes time to select a jury, to prepare jury instructions, to instruct the jury, and for the jury to deliberate. A landlord\\-tenant bench trial might be half a day or one day long, while a jury trial on the same matter might take two or three days. Selecting and charging a jury alone takes about half a day, and instructing a jury and having it deliberate takes another half\\-day at least.\n\nThe longer duration of a jury trial means that it takes longer for a case before a jury to be scheduled than a bench trial, because there in any given time frame, there will be more slots available for short trials than long ones. A half day bench trial might be possible to schedule two or three months out, while a two or three day jury trial might not fit into a judge's calendar for five or six months.\n\nAnd, a lawsuit involving a jury trial is more expensive to conduct. It probably takes something on the order of 32 more hours of lawyer time to litigate a case that goes to a jury trial than a case set for a bench trial, which is on the order of $8,000 at $250 per hour. Generally, a tenant who is being evicted or owes rent is either judgment\\-proof, or at least hard to collect from, so the landlord has an interest in keeping litigation costs low. \n\nThe out of pocket costs other than attorney's fees are also higher in a jury trial \\- there is typically a jury demand fee and a need to prepare a juror notebook for each juror.

The document explains that jury trials take longer due to jury selection, instruction, and deliberation processes.\n\nOption C is incorrect as decreasing litigation costs is a major factor. The information provided highlights that jury trials are more expensive, requiring more lawyer time and additional out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while this isn't explicitly stated as a primary reason, the document mentions that judges interpret rental agreements for juries, implying that having a judge decide complex legal issues is not a significant factor in including this clause."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74839/am-i-still-considered-to-have-entered-into-a-contract-if-i-dont-receive-the-oth", "docs_id": 74839, "title": "Am I still considered to have entered into a contract if I don&#39;t receive the other party&#39;s acceptance?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I sent a purchase order via email to a company to supply and invoice for around \u00a3200 worth of equipment on behalf of the organisation I volunteer for.\n\nI did not get a response after a few days, so sent a follow up email via a contact form on their website, and posted on their facebook page (also no response).

Educational institutions are required to maintain a discrimination\\-free environment, so if a student makes inappropriate remarks to another student, they have to address the matter (if they ignore it, saying \"Boys will be boys\", they can get sued). They will have previously spelled out procedures for addressing such accusations, which probably include giving a good talking\\-to to the guilty party, and maybe some harsher sanction like suspension.

Have also seen laws in some of the colonies that were almost verbatim taken from the Bible, however I can't find any mention of a particular state requiring (or even just highly encouraged) someone aspiring to practice law to know the Bible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is unlikely.\n\nKnowledge of the Bible was commonplace among literate people in the early U.S., and literacy rates in New England and the Mid\\-Atlantic States (and the colonies that preceded them, and later on in the Midwest) were among the highest in the world \\- with literacy being reserved for the merchant and higher classes in many parts of the \"Old World\".\n\nLiteracy was much less widespread, however, in the American South or Appalachia, which were also among the most secular parts of the United States prior to the Second Great Awakening around the 1830s to 1840s, when the American South transformed itself into the most religious part of the United States.\n\nParticularly in areas were literacy was lower, litigation was much more common than it is now over matters which we would consider petty, but most legal proceedings were similar to modern, lawyerless small claims court (and courts often ventured into activities that we would no longer consider to be legal as opposed to governmental administrative matters today like road improvements and welfare payments).\n\nThe privilege of representing someone else in legal proceedings was vested in individual courts or judges but granted liberally, to pretty much anyone who was literate and had some familiarity with legal texts.\n\nThe legal profession only began to be formally regulated as such in the late 1800s with the first law schools providing a significant share of the bar starting around the 1870s (before which most lawyers started out \"reading law\" as an apprentice in another lawyer's office).\n\nAdmission to the practice of law, which has handled separately by each particular court until then, not on a uniform statewide basis, did not require any particular formal education at the time although literacy and access to law books was a practical necessity. It was not very regularized or bureaucratic. Often a referral from an existing lawyer was the main qualification and admission to the federal court bars for lawyers already admitted to practice in state courts still works that way today.\n\nSo, it is highly unlikely that any particular state required (or even just highly encouraged) someone aspiring to practice law to know the Bible, to an extent more than this was encouraged for every literate adult.\n\nAs additional context, the primary qualification for admission to institutions of higher education up until the late 1800s was not knowledge of the Bible, but a sound foundation in reading, writing and speaking Latin and Ancient Greek, a skill set which had both religious and secular applications.\n\nIn the time period prior to the late 1800s, higher education mostly prepared young men for in the U.S. and in the North American colonies, either to be a member of the clergy (a track that naturally enough usually excluded most future lawyers), or to be a \"man of letters\" which primarily involved studying the classics, philosophy, rhetoric, history, and other humanities. Formal instruction in science, to the extent it happened, was taught as a subfield of philosophy (natural philosophy) or in connection to astronomy or math which were recognized as major academic disciplines in the early modern era in Europe.\n\nCollege educated \"men of letters\", who often went on to practice law (although as many or more sought other careers in fields such as politics, diplomacy, civil service, and business), were probably more knowledgeable of Greco\\-Roman mythology, and classical works of history, philosophy and rhetoric, than they were especially knowledgeable about the Bible or theology. As the term suggests, these avocations were not necessarily seen as completely distinct careers. Instead, they were more akin to different specialities within the Uber\\-category of work done by college educated men.\n\nNotwithstanding the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, there were parts of the United States, mostly in New England, where government established churches continued in existence after the adoption of the 1791 Bill of Rights (which initially applied only to the federal government). But this had ceased to be the case a decade or two before the U.S. Civil War. By the time that the legal profession began to be systemically regulated, the divide between church and state was well established. So it is unlikely that Biblical knowledge would have been a formal, or even highly encouraged, requirement for the practice of law.\n\nMy suspicion is that the statements you heard were the product of an educational movement, particularly common for religious home schooling, that has tried to claim, inaccurately, that the United States was a \"Christian nation\".

The legal profession was not formally regulated until the late 1800s, and admission to practice law was handled by individual courts without standardized educational requirements.

At trial, a human director of the defendant is called by the defendant party as a witness, but the defendant itself is represented now by a barrister. If one wishes to reference claims or points made (I suppose nonetheless by the defendant, even if through its human solicitor) in pre\\-trial correspondence, these challenges couldn't necessarily be posed to the human director of the defendant in cross\\-examination, because the human director of the defendant is not actually the defendant itself, while the barrister will also not have been the one who had written the letters of correspondence (it would have been the solicitor).\n\nIf one wishes to quiz or challenge the defendant, what opportunities in trial are there to do this?\n\nEven if we suppose momentarily that the legal representative of the defendant for the trial was the same one who had been writing all of the letters of pre\\-trial correspondence (ie the solicitor), as the legal representative is not a witness who can be subjective to cross\\-examination, are there any opportunities in a trial to enter into socratic, examination\\-style dialogue with the other side's representative?\n\nAnd which human entity in this scenario most corresponds to the defendant itself which is not a natural person? Is it true that the correspondence despite being humanly written by the instructed solicitor was legally with the defendant, so that they may be held responsible for everything that was written therein?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Evidence of pre\\-trial correspondence can be adduced if it is relevant to a fact in issue, and not excluded by another rule of evidence. Commonly, pre\\-trial correspondence is not relevant to a fact in issue, because it consists of legal argument and rhetoric. In other words, the letter is a solicitor's inadmissible [opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_evidence). And when pre\\-trial correspondence does set out the facts, it is often in inadmissible [hearsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay) form.\n\nPre\\-trial correspondence is also likely to attract [without prejudice privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_(legal_term)#Settlement_negotiations) (if sent to the other side in an attempt to negotiate a settlement) or [legal professional privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_professional_privilege) (if private between a party and their lawyer). For all of these reasons, pre\\-trial correspondence is not usually considered by a judge or jury at trial.\n\nHowever, in some circumstances pre\\-trial correspondence is admissible, typically as an [admission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_(law)), [prior consistent statement or prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements). Depending on the facts which make the correspondence relevant and admissible, it may also be appropriate to cross\\-examine the client, a director or other agent of the client who instructed the solicitor, or the solicitor, about it.\n\nIn some cases, a **client** may be cross\\-examined about a prior statement of their solicitor on the basis that the solicitor would not have made the statement without the client's authority, and would have relied on the client's instructions. If the court accepts that a prior inconsistent statement was made with the client's approval, this may damage their credibility.\n\nIf the client asserts legal professional privilege, or testifies that their lawyer acted without instructions, difficult questions arise. Some of these questions were explored by the High Court of Australia in *Hofer v The Queen* [\\[2021] HCA 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2021/36.html). Lawyers and judges will try to conduct cases in a way which avoids these procedural challenges, if at all possible.\n\nIn rare cases, a **lawyer** may be called to give evidence about whether a previous representation was actually made or authorised. This is, for example, the purpose of having a solicitor or other reputable professional *witness* formal documents. Barristers should [take special care not to place themselves at risk of becoming a witness](https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0243#sec.13), but in exceptional cases where the client waives legal professional privilege, they can also be required to give evidence about the client's previous instructions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this comes up more often in criminal law.\n\nThe decision in *Hofer* was an appeal from the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, which had received evidence from a barrister about the reasons for making decisions during the appellant's criminal trial. Conversely, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales dismissed an application for leave to cross\\-examine a solicitor, by applying the rules of evidence concerning prior consistent statements, in *Hall v The Queen* [\\[2015] EWCA Crim 581](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2015/581.html).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a trial against a corporate defendant, pre-trial correspondence from the defendant's solicitor is sought to be introduced as evidence.

In such cases, it may be appropriate to cross-examine a client, director, or other agent of the client who instructed the solicitor about the correspondence.

In [*Tilden*](https://canlii.ca/t/g1bxl) the hasty, informal way in which the contract was signed, the fact that the clause excluding liability was inconsistent with the overall purpose of the contract, and the absence of any real opportunity to read and understand the document **given its length and the amount of small print on its reverse side**, led the Court to conclude that the defendant should have known that the plaintiff had no intention of consenting to the onerous exclusion in question. In these **special circumstances**, there was a duty on Tilden to take reasonable measures to bring the exclusion clause to the attention of Mr. Clendenning.\n\n*Tilden Rent\\-A\\-Car Co. v. Clendenning*, [1978 CanLII 1446](https://canlii.ca/t/g1bxl) (Ont. C.A.) said:\n\n> In modern commercial practice, many standard form printed documents are signed without being read or understood. In many cases the parties seeking to rely on the terms of the contract know or ought to know that the signature of a party to the contract does not represent the true intention of the signer, and that the party signing is unaware of the stringent and onerous provisions which the standard form contains. Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the party seeking to rely on such terms should not be able to do so in the absence of first having taken reasonable measures to draw such terms to the attention of the other party, and, in the absence of such reasonable measures, it is not necessary for the party denying knowledge of such terms to prove either fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum.\n> \n> \n> In the case at bar, Tilden Rent\\-A\\-Car took no steps to alert Mr. Clendenning to the onerous provisions in the standard form of contract presented by it. **The clerk could not help but have known that Mr. Clendenning had not in fact read the contract before signing it. Indeed the form of the contract itself with the important provisions on the reverse side and in very small type would discourage even the most cautious customer from endeavouring to read and understand it.** Mr. Clendenning was in fact unaware of the exempting provisions. Under such circumstances, it was not open to Tilden Rent\\-A\\-Car to rely on those clauses, and it was not incumbent on Mr. Clendenning to establish fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum. Having paid the premium, he was not liable for any damage to the vehicle while being driven by him.\n> \n> \n> As Lord Denning stated in *Neuchatel Asphalte Co. Ltd. v.

Canadian law, as illustrated in cases like Karroll v. Silver Star Mountain Resorts Ltd. and Tilden Rent-A-Car Co. v. Clendenning, has established that exclusion-of-liability clauses may be unenforceable in certain circumstances. These circumstances include situations where the contract is unusually long, contains small print, and where important clauses are not brought to the user's attention. The courts have been wary of enforcing such clauses when they are inconsistent with the main purpose of the contract and executed in hasty circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the entire agreement wouldn't typically be unenforceable solely due to length and complexity. Option B is incorrect because merely clicking \"I agree\" doesn't guarantee enforceability if the circumstances suggest the user didn't intend to be bound by onerous terms. Option D is incorrect because while comprehension can be a factor, simply not understanding the language isn't grounds for rejecting the agreement after the fact."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80432/is-it-illegal-to-ride-a-drunk-horse", "docs_id": 80432, "title": "Is it illegal to ride a drunk horse?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tedd owns a riding horse.

The situation is as follows:\n\nI have lived in the flat I rent for a bit over 2 years. This started as a 1 year Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) and became periodic after.\n\nAt the two year mark (August), the landlord asked me to renew as a fixed\\-term again with a rent increase of about 9%. I agreed. I had moved in during covid when rents were very low and the new rate was reasonable.\n\nMy partner is a joint tenant in a rented flat. Her tenancy ends at the start of December.\n\nWhen my landlord reached out to me about resigning with the rent increase in August, I mentioned that we would like to move in together. I made it clear that this would not happen until Nov/Dec when her tenancy ended. They agreed and asked for a \u00a330 referencing fee, which I paid.\n\nThey immediately attempted referencing via their estate agents. This failed as what they tried to do was sign her as a co\\-tenant, which would have meant she was a tenant on 2 AST rentals at the same time. Apparently that's an issue (though I couldn't get a straight answer on this).\n\nHer landlords also refused to give a reference because she hadn't given notice, and refused to accept notice as she had more than two months left on her tenancy.\n\nI suggested they instead just make an amendment to give me permission to sub\\-let to her, as the intention was always that I would continue to pay the rent and be responsible for the flat. I was just told that the referencing had failed and we could try again once my partner was in the final two months of her tenancy and had given notice. I didn't receive a refund for the referencing fee, and didn't chase for one as I thought it would just cover the costs when we resumed the process.\n\nWe're now in the final months of my partners tenancy and she's put her notice in. A new tenant has been found to replace her, so it's too late to back out.\n\nI reached out to the landlord to let them know this and that we could therefore pick up the referencing again and amend the contract. Their response summarised is as follows:\n\nThe referencing is now \"\u00a350 plus VAT\" i.e. \u00a360\\. I've pointed out the original \u00a330 and received no acknowledgement. I've confirmed they do indeed mean \"plus VAT\".\n\nDue to an unexpected increase in the fee for the building shared boiler, they want to increase the rent by up to an additional 6% a month. I stress, they have not said this is because of an additional tenant and that I had already flagged a second tenant well in advance of agreeing the first rent increase. I've seen no proof of this increased cost to them.\n\nNeedless to say I'm unhappy as I would not have resigned knowing all this.\n\nWe're intending to move out next August anyway and at this point I'm past caring about maintaining a good relationship with the landlord. Looking for advice on the following:\n\nWhat could happen if we simply moved in together? I'm aware the landlord could pursue eviction, but how long would this take. If we're intending to move out anyway, I wouldn't be bothered if it meant leaving earlier. Could it affect our deposit? Could they sue? Would it have longer term implications to referencing for us when say, buying a home?\n\nAm I right to contest the referencing cost? My understanding is that they aren't allowed to charge for referencing, only a tenancy amendment which should not be withheld unreasonably. My contract does not state an amendment cost.\n\nIs there a means to complain about a landlord's behaviour to a third party? If so, what should the focus of my complaint be? Are there any grounds here?\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any help!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You won't get a reference from your landlord if you don't maintain a good relationship with them. I say just move her in and if you keep paying your rent they shouldn't care or maybe even know about it. If you're still living there she's basically your guest and they likely couldn't do anything and if she reimburses you for some of the rent that's none of LLs business. If they want to evict you on section 8 for breach of tenancy by unlawful subletting they would take a number of months and also they world accrue legal costs so might not even bother. You could then still argue that you aren't subletting as she is just your short term or indefinite guest and the eviction claim might even be thrown out by the court.

For example, in the case of video game app offerings for phones, whenever a new trend emerges, a multitude of copycat products seem to follow.\n\nInitially, I thought this was because the rate of ripoffs is so high that the original creators are unable to file claims as quickly as new copies appear. However, I have also observed that large corporate groups, such as Ketchapp and Voodoo, often have entire portfolios consisting of slightly modified versions of popular products created by competitors.\n\nIt is difficult to understand how this is feasible, and copyright law for digital services seems to be less effective than for physical products.

In some jurisdictions but by no means most, algorithms and business processes can be patented.\n\nSoftware, both the literary (code) and artistic (UIJ) work, is protected by copyright which prevents copying the expression but not the idea. So software writers can take inspiration from other *software* but can\u2019t *copy* it.\n\nSo, things that look like copyright infringement often aren\u2019t but things that look like patent infringement often are.\n\nPatents last for a short time (10\\-20 years) and take a lot of investment of time and money so their owners are incentivised to commercialise them quickly and on a large scale.\n\nCopyright lasts for a long time (life of the creator(s) \\+ 50 years minimum depending on jurisdiction) and come into existence automatically. In general, it is easier to create a literary or artistic work than a novel invention.\n\nSo, patent owners are more incentivised to protect their IP than copyright owners.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why online businesses are less likely to be sued for creating products similar to their competitors compared to physical product manufacturers?\n\nA) Online businesses are too numerous for effective legal action against copycats.\nB) Copyright law does not apply to digital products and services.\nC) Software is primarily protected by copyright, which guards against direct copying but not similar ideas.\nD) Large corporate groups have special legal exemptions for creating similar digital products.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Software is primarily protected by copyright, which guards against direct copying but not similar ideas. This explains why online businesses can create products that are similar to their competitors without facing legal consequences as frequently as physical product manufacturers might.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there may be many online businesses, this alone doesn't prevent legal action. Option B is false; copyright law does apply to digital products. Option D is also incorrect; large corporate groups don't have special exemptions for creating similar digital products.\n\nThe key difference is that software falls under copyright protection, which protects the expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves. This allows for the creation of similar products as long as they're not direct copies. In contrast, physical products are often protected by patents, which have stronger protections against similar implementations of an idea."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43556/what-remedy-when-a-judge-sets-an-impossible-standard-of-evidence", "docs_id": 43556, "title": "What Remedy When a judge sets an impossible standard of evidence?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a legal term or definition to use in an appeal when a lower court judge has set an impossible standard of evidence in his decision?

As stated in the documentation, \"a contract that is agreed to (written and agreed to (typically signed), or verbal and verbally agreed to) is legally binding; a contract not agreed to is little more than a wishlist.\" Therefore, the customer's proposed terms would only become legally binding if the manufacturer explicitly agrees to them. \n\nOption A is incorrect because merely proposing terms does not create a binding contract.
