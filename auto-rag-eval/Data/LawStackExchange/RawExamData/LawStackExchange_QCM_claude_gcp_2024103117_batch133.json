If so if a part of the statement for the arrest warrant is proven false what are the implications? In the case of a search warrant that would mean that an argument for removing any evidence obtained under the search warrant but what does it mean if a person is arrested to be charged but part of the justification was in fact incorrect. more than a clerical error but a statement of existing evidence showing something it clearly doesn't. For example the statement says there is evidence this person was at the place at the time of the crime but the actual evidence puts the person there weeks after the crime and not at the time of the crime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To get a warrant, there must be an affidavit. [Here](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/08-431-m-01.pdf) is an example of such affidavits, also [here](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/HP06-affidavit.pdf), and [here](https://media.nbcsandiego.com/documents/John-Jane+Doe+CP+production+-+complaint.pdf). Some general guidance on preparation of the affidavit is [here](https://nationalparalegal.edu/documentMovies/conLawCrimProc/Affid_Search_Warr/Main.pdf), which says you must \"Swear to the contents of the affidavit and sign it before the judge/magistrate\" (as we observe in the examples).\n\nIf a part of the statement for the arrest warrant is proven false, then the question would arise as to whether the person sweating knew that it was false. If he knew it was false, that constitutes perjury, which is a crime (and could invalidate the warrant, thus the evidence). If he is simply mistaken, that is not a crime, and does not invalidate the warrant.\n\nA statement that there is evidence this person was at the place at the time of the crime is not sufficient to yield a warrant, and would not be perjury (it is a conclusion based on fact: perjury pertains to statements of fact, not conclusions drawn from facts). The statement would need to say *how* it is known that the person was there. If the statement is that \"two eyewitnesses saw him\" and that is just a lie, that is perjury. If the eyewitnesses change their minds about who they saw, or if it is later found that the eyewitnesses were lying, reporting that is not a wrongful act by the officer.\n\nThe affidavit must be \"fully truthful\", and may not omit material facts. Suppose that two people claim to have seen the accused at the scene but the officer has credible evidence that they are lying, then the report must include that information (a Washington case [here](http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/055wnapp/055wnapp0343.htm), a California case [here](http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/57/521.html)).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An officer is preparing an affidavit for an arrest warrant.

CCTV footage shows the suspect near the crime scene, but the timestamp is unclear.\n\nWhat should the officer include in the affidavit?\n\nA) Only the eyewitness statements, as they directly place the suspect at the scene\nB) Only the CCTV footage information, as it's the most reliable evidence\nC) Both the eyewitness statements and the CCTV footage information, omitting doubts about the eyewitnesses\nD) The eyewitness statements, the officer's doubts about their credibility, and the CCTV footage information\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The affidavit must be \"fully truthful\" and may not omit material facts. The officer is obligated to include all relevant information, even if it may weaken the case for the warrant. This includes the eyewitness statements, the officer's credible evidence that casts doubt on these statements, and the CCTV footage information. Omitting any of these pieces of information could be considered a material omission, potentially invalidating the warrant and leading to legal complications.

If the government just bulldozed a sidewalk in someone's front yard without asking, and the owner sued the government for compensation, that would be an inverse condemnation case.\n\nThe short answer is that the government has every right to condemn property adjacent to a highway for use as a sidewalk. This is a classic public purpose. \n\nGenerally, the government must first attempt to acquire the property out of court by making an offer for the land, and, if it is unsuccessful in getting the owner to accept its offer, it will bring an eminent domain action to seize the land for public purposes.\n\nIn the eminent domain case, the government will win on its right to condemn the land and to take immediate possession of it pending a determination of its value, because the government has the right to seize land to build sidewalks.

Her conduct would also not provide a basis for a valid lawsuit for money damages against her.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nIn Colorado's state criminal code, the relevant statutory section, Colorado Revised Statutes, \u00a7 18\\-1\\-704, states, in the pertinent parts (emphasis mine):\n\n> **Use of physical force in defense of a person \\- definitions.**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) . . . a\n> person is justified *in using physical force* upon another person in\n> order to defend himself . . . and he may use a degree of force which he\n> reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) *Deadly physical force* may be used only if a person reasonably\n> believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate and: . . .\n> \n> \n> (b) The other person is using . . .\n> physical force against an occupant of a dwelling . . . while committing or attempting to commit burglary as\n> defined in sections 18\\-4\\-202 to 18\\-4\\-204; or\n> \n> \n> (c) The other person is committing or reasonably appears about to\n> commit . . . sexual assault as set forth in section 18\\-3\\-402, or in\n> section 18\\-3\\-403 as it existed prior to July 1, 2000\\.\n\nThe referenced definition of burglary as relevant to this fact pattern is that:\n\n> A person commits . . . burglary, if the person knowingly breaks an\n> entrance into, enters unlawfully in, or remains unlawfully after a\n> lawful or unlawful entry in a building or occupied structure with\n> intent to commit therein a crime against another person or property.\n\nNote also that it doesn't matter for purposes of the burglary statute, if this is her kitchen, or someone else's, so long as it is not his kitchen.\n\nAlso he need only be \"attempting to commit burglary\", so even if he was trying unsuccessfully to get into the house and assaulting her from just outside a door or window, her use of deadly force to prevent burglary would be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if he was lawfully present in the home (perhaps a husband or roommate), the burglary justification for the use of deadly force would no longer be present.\n\nThe referenced sexual assault statute states in the pertinent part that it is committed if:\n\n> Any actor who knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual\n> penetration on a victim commits sexual assault if: The actor causes\n> submission of the victim by means of sufficient consequence reasonably\n> calculated to cause submission against the victim's will . . . \\[which\n> includes any case in which:] The actor causes submission of the victim\n> through the actual application of physical force or physical\n> violence\\[.]\n\nEven if he does not \"reasonably appears about to commit\" sexual penetration or intrusion (which are necessary for the crime to be sexual assault for purposes of the use of deadly force law in Colorado), unlawful sexual contact is a crime against a person in an occupied dwelling, so it constitutes burglary that justifies the use of deadly force, even if it doesn't constitute sexual assault.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the woman may use deadly physical force if she reasonably believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate to cause the rapist to cease committing sexual assault, *and any other crime against person or property* in the home.\n\n**Application Of Law To Facts**\n\nThere is no reasonable doubt that the man is, at a minimum, in the process of committing burglary, and very likely sexual assault as well, although the language of the question is somewhat coy on this point as relevant to the Colorado definition of sexual assault.\n\nHe has proven himself capable of physically overpowering her efforts to resist him with non\\-deadly force without success. This demonstrates that non\\-deadly force was inadequate.\n\nShe used a knife to kill him for the legally authorized purpose of ending a burglary and probably also a sexual assault.\n\nTherefore, her use of a knife to kill him is almost certain be a use of deadly force for purposes of self\\-defense which is permitted by Colorado law. As a result, she would not be legally guilty of any crime for killing him with a knife in these circumstances.\n\nIncidentally, she would also have [no civil liability in tort for money damages in this situation in Colorado](https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/self-defense-and-stand-your-ground).\n\n**Application To Other U.S. States**\n\nThe exact wording of self\\-defense statutes differ from one U.S. state to another and I don't personally know every fine statutory detail of every one of them. But, Colorado's statute is quite typical. A state where her actions did not constitute legally justified in these circumstances would be an extreme outlier in U.S. law. I would be surprised if there was any U.S. state in which her actions would not constitute legally justified self\\-defense.\n\n**Historical Note**\n\nSuppose that the man in the question were the woman's husband in their own home where they were both lawfully present.\n\n> Prior to the 1970s, marital rape was legal in every US state. It was\n> partially outlawed in Michigan and Delaware in 1974, then wholly\n> outlawed in South Dakota and Nebraska in 1975\\. The court case *Oregon\n> v. Rideout* in 1978 was the first in which someone stood trial for\n> raping his spouse while they lived together. By 1993 marital rape was\n> a crime nationwide.\n\n([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_in_the_United_States))\n\nUnder current U.S. law in every U.S. state, the sexual assault justification analysis would be no different because there is no marital immunity for the crimes of sexual assault, although the burglary justification would no longer be present, so an intent to commit unlawful sexual contact without penetration or intrusion would not justify the use of deadly force.\n\nBut, when marital immunity to sexual assault was part of the law, as it was in every U.S. state prior to 1974, and as it was in some U.S. states until 1993, she would be guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.\n\nThe distinction between second degree murder and manslaughter in that case would hinge upon whether she had an intent to kill or only intended to harm (as in [a case cited by Jen in her answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92909/9517)). Also, she would have a good argument for manslaughter due to provocation by the victim that was not sufficient to justify the use of deadly force, even if jury concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that she did intent to kill him.\n\nColorado's self\\-defense statute (in a subsection omitted because it was not applicable to the facts in the question) also permits the grade of a criminal offense caused in the course of conduct intended as self\\-defense that does not meet the statutory standards for self\\-defense (e.g. because non\\-deadly force would have been sufficient) to downgrade the severity of the offense for which the person may be convicted, in a manner similar to the \"heat of passion\" defense.\n\nBut, these facts present no plausible justification for a first degree murder, which is often a charge punishable by death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole, since it was not premeditated or committed in connection with a crime by the perpetrator.\n\nRealistically, under the circumstances of the question, if he was her husband and they were in their own home, during a time frame when there was marital immunity from sexual assault charges, she would most likely be convicted of manslaughter under these circumstances.\n\n**Side Observation**\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held in *Kennedy v. Louisiana*, 554 U.S. 407 (2008\\) that the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution, directly and as incorporated against the states under the 14th Amendment, prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for a rape not resulting in death (even the rape of a child).\n\nThe death penalty has been unconstitutional in cases involving the rape of an adult woman in the U.S. since U.S. Supreme Court case of *Coker v. Georgia*, 433 U.S. 584 (1977\\).\n\nThere are many serious felonies (including some omitted from the Colorado statute above because they were not applicable to this fact pattern) for which the use of deadly force in self\\-defense is authorized even though the U.S. Constitution prohibits the use of the death penalty upon a conviction of that offense which does not result in someone dying.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, a woman is being sexually assaulted in her kitchen by a man who has unlawfully entered her home.

In this scenario, the man unlawfully entered the woman's home (burglary) and was sexually assaulting her.

The specific requirements are in [\u00a74902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4902). One of the triggers is the [\"cancellation date\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4901), which relates to the initial amortization schedule, basically the day when by making regular payments the loan is reduced to 80% of the initial value (not the loan amount). This completely ignores later appraisals, though the bank can require proof that the value of the property has not declined (and that evidence is \"of a type established in advance and made known to the mortgagor by the servicer promptly upon receipt of a request under paragraph (1\\))\"). The law excludes inflationary changes in equity, where e.g. one has an initial 5% interest that swells to a 20% interest over a few years because of inflation.

What typically tends to come up as the subject of dispute is rooted in the urban legend that one cannot obtain a patent (utility) on software. This is substantially incorrect, and any patent attorney asserting to the veracity of this makes a substantially false conclusory statement of law knowingly and willfully controverting the actual state of law in, at least, all Western jurisdictions as it omits to assert to the fact that one is not barred to obtain a patent on any system that comprises of non\\-obvious software, and hardware to run on is entitled to a patent \u2014 except in the U.S. where one must also comply with the *Alice* decision requiring that at least one hardware component in addition to the hardware of a generic computer be necessary for the utility of the system. However, in the U.S., one may obtain a software\\-centered patent through a (i) method or (ii) a computer program product in addition to (iii) systems or apparatuses which are available avenues for patents everywhere else.\n\nWhen disputes around IP and software come up, this is typically at the crux of the debate: May one obtain a software patent? The answer is: One is not barred merely because the non\\-obvious aspect of an invention is software. For example, if one uses hardware that are prior art, in fact, patented to someone else, but by the use of software a system, method and/or computer program product achieves a different objective (since utility patents, axiomatically, must have a utility objective) one may obtain a patent, and a layman may very well consider their invention of the system as that particular component that appears to them as having required any inventive steps, encompasses the inventive novelty (understandably) which, in many cases may be software.\n\nSo the advice from a patent attorney that \u201cyou can\u2019t patent software\u201d is simply malicious (or wide and far disbarringly incompetent).\n\nOne may patent software so long as it is an invention, and the administrative (or at times judicial) process requirements are complied with.\n\nNevertheless, since the question inquired about \u201cIP\u201d, below is the answer to other avenues of intellectual property.\n\n**Copyrights**\n\nThe software code written to make this operable could be the subject of copyright as long as it is not substantially identical with another solution (or such to give reasons to believe it to be a derivative thereof) that also put buttons in the four corners.\n\nThe visual design may possibly also enjoy copyright protection, but that is less plausible to imagine since not only the copyrighted work of art is protected, but anything that may objectively be deemed a derivative work (regardless of whether the \u201cre\\-author\u201d actually knew about the copyrighted material that it may be deemed the derivate of).\n\n**Design patents**\n\nIt is possible that one could get design patents for the actual graphical design of the layout provided there isn\u2019t something substantially similar already out there protected by a design patent.\n\n**Utility patents**\n\nThis would most certainly not overcome obviousness, that is, the requirement for one to obtain a patent which needs that a presented invention not be obvious for anyone \u201cwith ordinary skill in the art\u201d (an ordinarily knowledgable person in the field of the specific area of tech).\n\n**Trademark**\n\nI have a hard time stretching my imagination to see how this could be applicable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company has developed a user interface design that places four global utility links (Settings, Menu, Home, Back) at the corners of the screen to aid visually impaired users.

According to the information provided, while it may be legal for the neighbor to install a camera on their own property, California has civil stalking laws that could potentially be applied in this situation. The concerned resident may be able to seek a restraining order to prohibit the neighbor from monitoring their front door, which could be interpreted as a form of stalking or harassment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there isn't a blanket law making such camera installations illegal. Option B is too absolute, as there can be legal limitations on camera use even on private property.

I doubt the fact that the alterations are signage is really significant; unless they are stolen, or they cause someone to make a wrong turn into the corner of the building. :)\n\nIt's probably in the lease that a renter can't make significant changes to the property's appearance without permission from the property owner or management; i.e. many leases don't allow you to repaint rooms, put in new carpet, etc. without permission from the landlord.\n\nBut, it all depends on the lease. If you both have the same property management company, see what is in your lease about property alterations.\n\nEvery lease I have ever seen (and most of the free template lease forms on the web have) had a clause stating that making unauthorized changes to the property is not permitted, along with the possible penalties, like paying for the damages, losing a deposit, even eviction.\n\nThe fact that you're in CA really doesn't matter when it comes to the lease; damage clauses, though pretty much universal, are by choice of the landlord.

It states that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nThis might be read as immediately applying by its own force to render laws inconsistent with the *Charter* to be void. And language to this effect has been even used by the Court, saying that a provision inconsistent with the Constitution is \"invalid from the moment it is enacted\" (e.g. *Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Martin; Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Laseur*, [2003 SCC 54](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2088/index.do)).

Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do) at para. 54\\). That a law is inconsistent with the Constitution is \"revealed through litigation, specifically the judgment that declares the inoperability of the impugned law\" (*Sullivan* at para. 55\\). Section 52 has no practical effect aside from Courts or other decision\\-makers declining to apply law that is inconsistent with the Constitution. Whether a law was void as soon as the *Charter* was enacted is not really a meaningful question nor even detectable until a Court declares the law to be invalid.\n\nThe Court has also clarified that declarations of invalidity are not necessarily retroactive to the moment of enactment (internal citations removed):\n\n> \\[60] ...

In *Albashir*, my colleague Karakatsanis J. explained that declarations of unconstitutionality are generally retrospective, consistent with the notion that a law is unconstitutional from its enactment. However, other constitutional principles may require a purely prospective declaration of unconstitutionality or a suspended declaration. Similarly, the legal effect of a s. 52(1\\) declaration by a superior court must be defined with reference to constitutional supremacy, the rule of law, and federalism.\n\nI'll say this one more way: while it's true that some laws were immediately inconsistent with the *Charter*, s. 52(1\\) did not have any observable effect until a court declared such laws to be invalid.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution Act, 1982, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding laws that were inconsistent with the Charter upon its enactment?\n\nA) All laws inconsistent with the Charter became immediately void and unenforceable as soon as the Charter was enacted.\n\nB) Laws inconsistent with the Charter remained in effect until challenged and declared invalid by a court.\n\nC) Section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 automatically nullified all inconsistent laws without the need for judicial review.\n\nD) The Charter had no effect on existing laws until the Parliament of Canada reviewed and amended them to ensure compliance.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While Section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 states that any law inconsistent with the Constitution is \"of no force or effect,\" the Supreme Court of Canada has clarified that this requires \"the exercise of judicial power to declare the law to be unconstitutional.\" Laws that were inconsistent with the Charter upon its enactment did not immediately become void or unenforceable. Instead, they remained in effect until challenged in court and declared invalid by a judge. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, although some laws were immediately inconsistent with the Charter, they did not automatically become void without judicial intervention. \n\nOption C is incorrect because Section 52(1) does not automatically nullify inconsistent laws; it requires judicial declaration to have practical effect. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the Charter did have an immediate constitutional effect, but it required judicial interpretation and declaration to invalidate specific laws."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2134/is-viewing-pornographic-content-with-questionable-consent-of-depicted-person-ill", "docs_id": 2134, "title": "Is viewing pornographic content with questionable consent of depicted person illegal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many pornographic sites have a community that is uploading videos to the site.

According to Section 388 of the Companies Act 2006, private companies must keep accounting records for at least 3 years. This retention period aligns with both the legal requirements of the Companies Act and the GDPR principle of storage limitation, which allows for data to be kept as long as necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. In this case, the purpose is compliance with legal obligations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because 1 year is too short and does not comply with the Companies Act. It also misinterprets GDPR, which allows for longer retention periods when required by law.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect for private companies. While public companies must retain records for 6 years, the question specifies a private company scenario.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because indefinite retention would violate GDPR principles of storage limitation and data minimization.

I imagine that the bouncer probably didn't recognize what he was looking at and assumed it was a fake ID. \n\nFrom what I understand, the bar does not have the authority to confiscate such a real passport, but that got me to thinking, what if the Bouncer was right? Does he actually have the legal authority to confiscate the fake ID?\n\nThe reason I ask, is because if he does have that authority, it feels to me like an awkward law, because a simple gap in knowledge can be what makes the difference between legal and illegal. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of indications that a bouncer may not confiscate an ID. [This policy document](https://www.centerforalcoholpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FAKE-IDs-IN-AMERICA-2018.pdf) adopting licensing policies to\n\n> Require licensees with fake ID violations to temporarily or\n>  permanently hire on\\-site law enforcement or certified security guards\n>  who are properly trained to check IDs during regular or peak hours to\n>  deter the use of fake IDs and give gatekeepers the opportunity to pass\n>  suspected fakes to an officer or guard for a second opinion and\n>  potential confiscation. Where appropriate, jurisdictions could empower\n>  the gatekeeper to confiscate fake IDs so they are not returned to the\n>  underage drinker and sent back into circulation. To ensure compliance\n>  with legal issues (e.g., property rights, bailment issues), arrange\n>  for the on\\-call or on\\-site presence of local law enforcement. Local\n>  bar and restaurant associations, especially those in concentrated\n>  entertainment zones, can join together to share the expense of law\n>  enforcement resources.\n\nThat implies that the bouncer does not already have that authority, and also indicates that the confiscation should be performed by the police. This [bouncer training manual](https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmcCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=can%20a%20server%20confiscate%20suspected%20forged%20identification&source=bl&ots=wsTndTCG0u&sig=ACfU3U2xvL0nFKy-UvlrPmF_vnF7rVDQ-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjL_qb_xtDiAhXB7Z4KHQKECKAQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=can%20a%20server%20confiscate%20suspected%20forged%20identification&f=false) says that\n\n> Even though you may consider the ID to be fake, it is not considered\n>  the server's property.

Washington doesn't do that, so bouncers would need to call the police (not that they always do, since passing a fake ID is somewhere between a misdemeanor and a felony). The general principle is that you may not confiscate another person's property, but the police can seize property if it is reasonable to do so. A state may pass a law authorizing a licensee to do likewise (though it does raise questions about the bouncer's understanding of \"reasonable cause to believe\"). The Colorado statute is restricted to licensee and their employees, and does not apply to \"anyone who suspects an ID\", nor does it allow civilian confiscation of other property such as an automobile that is suspected of being stolen.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A bouncer at a bar in Washington state suspects a patron is using a fake ID.

This is because:\n\n1. Washington state does not grant servers or bouncers the legal authority to confiscate IDs they suspect to be fake.\n2. The general principle is that you may not confiscate another person's property without proper authority.\n3. Police have the authority to seize property if it is reasonable to do so, including suspected fake IDs.\n4. The bouncer training manual cited specifically advises to \"follow up with a call to the police to verify suspected false IDs\" rather than confiscating them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because destroying the ID would be illegal and exceed the bouncer's authority. Option C is insufficient as it doesn't address the potential legal issue at hand. Option D, while refusing entry is within the bouncer's rights, returning a suspected fake ID could allow its continued illegal use.

What would the concequences be?\n\n---\n\nNote: I am primarily interested in answers regarding the EU and the UK.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TLDR: it's illegal to BUY it. It's illegal to USE it. Know your suppliers.\n\nThat's certainly an interesting question, in light of how the market has changed in recent years, particularly due to Amazon/eBay, but even moreso due to Amazon Fulfillment and competitors.\n\nOver on diy.se, this is a constant vexation, because we see people buy crud like this all the time, and they need help installing it. And we find it's illegal to install, not even safe, and needs to be sent back in lieu of listed product.\n\nThe advanced nations do have a highly effective apparatus for screening and blocking dangerous goods. **However, these protections are geared toward bricks\\-and\\-mortar retail**. Can you count on something bought at Wickes, Redoute or Home Depot? By and large, yes.\n\nIs it legal to export it to you?\n--------------------------------\n\nYes, for all practical purposes. The people selling it are in an unreachable bastion in a foreign country that would not cooperate with their extradition, and would interfere with investigation. The government knows perfectly well that the stuff is complete crud, and doing so aligns with its national policies of raising hard currency and building industrial capacity, while [harming the capacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UOLlFm_P4g) of other nations.\n\nIs it legal for the item to be listed on Amazon or eBay?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon and eBay say \"Yes\". Their position is that they are **merely a platform** which connects buyers and sellers. They surely have excellent lawyers.\n\nAmazon is more like eBay than you might realize. Amazon opened their retail site to third party sellers. Third parties can sign up as additional sellers of a particular SKU, or write their own product listings.\n\nSince Amazon's behavior has been unchallenged, the answer seems to be \"yes\".\n\nIs it legal for Amazon to bring it into their warehousing systems?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon also opened their warehousing system to third party use. That can be for companies that don't sell on Amazon... or it can be for companies that do both Amazon and off\\-Amazon sales; in the latter case you order elsewhere but Amazon fulfills (ships) the item. When a company both sells the item on Amazon and it ships from an Amazon warehouse, it qualifies for \"Prime\" shipping where Amazon offers that.\n\nAmazon also offers \"Commingling\" for established SKUs. The idea is that if you have widgets in the Madrid warehouse, and I have widgets in a Warsaw warehouse... and a Madrid customer buys mine \\- why not ship them yours *since they are all the same*? I get credit for the sale and Amazon \"owes you one\". When you get a sale in Madrid, Amazon has one in Barcelona so they ship that one to your customer.\n\nCommingling is great, but what happens when I inject a pallet full of those SKUs \\- and they're counterfeits? Amazon doesn't know the difference, and your Warsaw customer gets my counterfeit. So do Amazon's Berlin and Wroclaw customers. Amazon ships them around the network to balance the warehouses, and now my counterfeit has contaminated the supply. I'm sitting in China. Whatcha gonna do about it?\n\nAgain, Amazon has top lawyers, who have surely done their diligence. Still, the program is ambitious, and e\\-commerce giants [break the law](https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xwxyv/uber-became-big-by-ignoring-laws-and-it-plans-to-keep-doing-that) all the time with their ambitions.\n\nIn the US, there's the [\"Express Shipment\"](https://www.prosperousamerica.org/the_problems_posed_by_e_commerce_without_borders) rule, which allows small orders ($800 or less) with no duty and an informal entry process. So they ship to Mexican warehouses, and then bring the items over by the truckload. Wait, how can a truckload be less than $800? Because they don't bring it over until there's an end\\-user customer order, and they argue \"these are for individual customers\". This qualifies them to breeze through customs, bypassing the quality and safety controls that prevent Home Depot from doing the exact same thing with a truckload that hasn't found customers yet.\n\nIs it legal for you (as the end consumer) to import it?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo. The rules for **Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne** are that the importer is responsible. When you as an end customer buy mail\\-order from China, **you are the importer**.\n\nUnder EU law, if you bring a CE\\-marked item into the EU, you are responsible for meeting the CE design standards, and doing in\\-house lab testing to affirm the performance of the product. By having the CE mark on the thing you imported, you are attesting to having done that.\n\nFurther, the various nations may require that a certified **independent** testing lab verify your testing and claims. This was historically done by national testing labs like BSI, TUV, CSA or UL. However by treaty they are largely cross\\-recognized: US OSHA keeps a canonical list of \"Nationally (by USA) Recognized Testing Labs\" (NRTLs) that every other agency and many other countries defer to.\n\nBig Clive is probably fine, since Clive's purpose is public ridicule, not usage.\n\nIs it legal for you to *install it in your house*?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n***Oh, heck no.***\n\nEvery nation has rules as to what certifications equipment must meet to legally be installed in a building's electrical system. For instance North America's *El NEC*, widely adopted or copied, has 110\\.2:\n\n> **110\\.2 Approval.** The conductors \\[wires] and equipment required or permitted by this *Code* shall be acceptable only if approved.\n\n\"Approved\" means by competent testing labs; i.e. OSHA's list of NRTLs.

Will this cause a problem since the reason I gave for them having to move out was my intention to sell the house? or am I free to change my mind at will?\n\nThank you all in advance for any wisdom/insight you may have to share.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Saying that you intend to sell the house (and offering an out for early termination) is not the same as providing written notice that the tenant must leave. The clause you cite says that you \"may terminate a month\\-to\\-month tenancy by providing 30 days\u2019 written notice to Tenant\", so the question is whether you did that. At the end of the lease period, the tenant may remain even if the lease is not renewed, and they become holdover tenants. You can subsequently boot them out, after 30 day's notice (plus legal processing time, if it comes to that). However regardless of what the lease says, you have to obey Colorado law, so note [Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a713\\-40\\-107(1\\)](http://www.landlord.com/statutes_colorado.htm) which says\n\n> (1\\) A tenancy may be terminated by notice in writing, served not less\n>  than the respective period fixed before the end of the applicable\n>  tenancy, as follows: (a) A tenancy for one year or longer, three\n>  months\n\n104(c\\-e) defines \"unlawful detention\" as applicable to tenants; you have to state your legal basis, sign it, and deliver it to the tenant.\n\nThe question then is whether you served them a proper demand per section 104, in writing per 106, served in a timely fashion per 107 and manner per 108\\. If so, they should leave when the lease is up, and if they don't, then there is the whole eviction process. Serving notice according to the law is quite important. \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nPursuant to \u00a713\\-40\\-107(4\\), if the lease terminates at a specific time (i.e. it actually says \"expires June 30, 2016\" or something like that), no notice to quit is required.\n\nHaving located a relevant case, [First Interstate Bank v. Tanktech, Inc., 864 P.2d 116](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1199743/first-interstate-bank-v-tanktech-inc/) says that \"The operation of the holdover tenancy doctrine in Colorado is well established. A holdover tenant is one who continues in possession of the premises beyond the term of the lease...Once a lease expires and the tenant remains in possession of the premises, the landlord may elect to treat the tenant as a trespasser, or may waive the wrong of holding over and continue the tenancy. In the latter case, and in the absence of a new agreement, the law implies a new contract between the parties based upon the same terms and conditions as the expired lease. It is also true that the **acceptance of rent by a landlord upon expiration of the lease is sufficient to create a holdover tenancy**.\" (emphasis added, citations omitted). The court also note in this case that the landlord failed to repudiate the prior lease, suggesting that explicit repudiation is a good idea.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Colorado law and the case First Interstate Bank v.

If the ticket really wins the $4 million is that binding?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, for those who 'liked' the business after reading the post, but less likely for those who had already liked the business.\n\nUnder contract law, the business's post is an offer to share the winnings with anyone who is a friend of the business on Facebook. A promise is enforceable if consideration is provided under a bargain; the consideration can be of nominal value (e.g. the act of 'liking' a page).\n\nIn the context of a business page, in a time when 'followers' and the like are regarded as valuable from a marketing perspective, it is entirely reasonable to interpret the post as offering an exchange of likes for a chance to win money. The commercial context and involvement of money would cause a court to presume that there was an intention to create a legally\\-binding contract (Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc (2002\\) 209 CLR 95; Banque Brussels Lambert SA v Australian National Industries Ltd (1989\\) 21 NSWLR 502\\).\n\nI am not entirely familiar with how the designation 'Friend' applies to businesses on Facebook. My understanding is that businesses have pages that are different to user pages. Businesses don't have 'friends'. They have people who 'like' the business. However, the word 'Friend' in the post has to be given content and therefore would be read as 'people who are listed as having liked this page'.\n\nPeople who had already liked the page are less likely to be able to enforce the promise to share the winnings, because they didn't do anything. They might be able to argue that they forwent the opportunity to un\\-like the business and that this forbearance is consideration. However, they would have to show that this was in consideration of the offer to share the winnings. \n\nContract law is based on objective manifestations of agreement, not subjective thoughts (Taylor v Johnson (1983\\) 151 CLR 422\\), so it isn't necessary to show that the individual did in fact have the offer in mind when they liked (or didn't un\\-like) the page. However, it is necessary that the promisee have knowledge of the offer and not be acting out of some completely separate purpose (R v Clarke (1927\\) 40 CLR 227\\); therefore if a user had liked the page some time ago and never knew about the offer until after the lottery was won, then they might have a hard time claiming a binding contract.\n\nAside from contract law, the other possible head of liability is equitable estoppel (I mention this particularly for the people who had already 'liked' the business page before the offer was posted). However, equitable estoppel usually requires some element of detrimental reliance. Leaving a pre\\-existing 'like' on a page in reliance on a promise to share lottery winnings is unlikely to stir a court to find an equitable estoppel, since the detriment is trivial. Contrast Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1988\\) 164 CLR 387, where the detrimental reliance was knocking down a building and starting to construct a replacement. Equitable remedies are discretionary, so the judge has plenty of leeway to not order compensation.\n\nThis answer is based on the common law.

According to the documentation, the business's post can be considered an offer to share the winnings with those who become \"friends\" (or in this case, like the page) after the post.

Specifically, I'm curious about admitting to past illegal activities (for example: underage drinking, or usage of illegal drugs \\- examples: pills, lsd, coke, etc etc., or just general shenanigans that are done in the privacy of one's own home, and none of the crimes committed were against anyone or anything, brought no harm to anyone, etc. Basically, no danger to the public or society.\n\nBefore anyone decides to respond with the obvious: \"That's admitting to a crime, it's illegal, don't do it, blah blah blah.\" But, if you go to any one of the multiple forums and websites where people talk about such things (drugs\\-forum.com, addforums.com, etc etc), everywhere you look, people are openly admitting to illegal drug usage, people share their experiences and such everywhere on there. And obviously no one is going to jail for it, the websites aren't being shut down. So, is there something that protects people from the legal consequences of these actions?\n\nMy question ultimately pertains to this: Can someone write a blog, or share (online, in some way) their personal experiences, life events etc, even if those experiences, and their 'life story' so to speak, includes past illegal activities of these kinds?\n\nThanks, to anyone who answers my question (answers without the 'troll\\-y' responses , which I expect I'll get.. Because who can resist, right?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, there are no laws against voluntary self\\-incrimination \u2013 that would violate the First Amendment. So anyone is free to say that they did some good act or some bad act, whether or not they actually did it. You can do this in a park, on the radio, in a book, a private journal, or a web page \\-\\- there is nothing legally special about online confession. The only legal restriction on self\\-incrimination is via the Fifth Amendment, where you cannot be forced to testify against yourself (you cannot even be forced to testify in favor of yourself). If you do elect to confess to some wrongdoing, whatever the venue may be, that statement can be used against you: examples are the [Steubenville rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case) and [Derek Medina's murder of his wife](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2548525/Derek-Medina-killed-wife-photo-body-Facebook-asks-judge-victims-remains-tested-BATH-SALTS-support-self-defense-claim.html). As to why the authorities don't bother to prosecute a kid who brags about getting (illegally) drunk over the weekend, they probably have less than the infinite amount of time needed to ferret out and pursue such cases, especially when there is no independent evidence that a crime was committed (which is kind of a necessary precondition for getting a conviction).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding voluntary self-incrimination on the internet?\n\nA) It is illegal to admit to past criminal activities online, but websites allowing such admissions are protected under the First Amendment.\n\nB) Admitting to past crimes online is legal, but such admissions cannot be used as evidence in court due to Fifth Amendment protections.\n\nC) Voluntary self-incrimination online is protected by the First Amendment, but these admissions can potentially be used as evidence in legal proceedings.\n\nD) Law enforcement is required to investigate and prosecute all online admissions of past criminal activities, regardless of their severity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, voluntary self-incrimination, including online admissions, is protected under the First Amendment in the United States.

However, it's important to note that these admissions can be used as evidence against the individual in legal proceedings if authorities choose to pursue the matter. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because admitting to past crimes online is not illegal in itself. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because while the Fifth Amendment protects against forced self-incrimination, it does not prevent voluntary admissions from being used as evidence. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect as law enforcement agencies are not obligated to investigate every online admission of past criminal activity, often due to resource limitations and lack of corroborating evidence."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50263/if-someone-lets-you-use-their-e-g-netflix-account-is-it-legal-to-let-others", "docs_id": 50263, "title": "If someone lets you use their (e.g. Netflix) account, is it legal to let others use it?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If someone gives me the credentials to login to a streaming site they have an account for, would it be illegal for me to share the credentials with someone else? \n\nFor example, if Joe tells me the username and password so I can watch Netflix on his account, would it be illegal for me to share it with Bob? Would it make a difference if I created a separate account for Bob (but still under Joe's subscription)? \n\n**Assume there is nothing in the terms of service prohibiting accounts from being shared**. To my understanding, this comes down to if the license Joe granted me is sub\\-licensable or transferable. I heard it often depends on if the license was paid for or free.

Perhaps Joe Schmoe gave you his debit card information so that you could make deposits for him and he said you could take $5 out for yourself for the trouble. This is a contract between you and Joe for a service. You can't extend Joe's offer to Jane Doe by saying \"here is some debit card information, take $2\\.50 out for yourself\". You have no right to extend your contract with Joe to somebody else.\n\nNow specifically for passwords it basically boils down to the same thing. Unless Joe gives you explicit permission to give that to somebody else, you can't just decide to unilaterally give what Joe gave you to somebody else. \n\nThis may be different if Joe said \"here, I'm buying you a subscription to service XYZ because you are a nice guy\", this may be construed as a gift which transfers ownership. At that point you have control over what is or isn't done with the account. \n\nAs another example let's say Joe let you borrow his car. You can't turn around and say to Jane, \"here's a car you can use\", Joe did not extend the offer to Jane, nor did Joe give you the right to extend the offer to another person. \n\nIt's a moot point though, in the original context of this question, Netflix does restrict you from sharing your passwords \"outside your household\". Almost every paid service has some restriction against sharing with others. \n\nIn the end Netflix may shut off Joe's account and Joe may sue you for damages, but you aren't going to be thrown in jail for this.

Even though Netflix's terms of service (in this hypothetical scenario) don't prohibit account sharing, Sarah's action of creating a profile for Alex without Joe's permission could be seen as a violation of the verbal agreement between Joe and Sarah. Joe gave Sarah permission to use his account, but not to extend that permission to others. This situation is similar to lending a car - if someone lends you their car, you can't then lend it to someone else without the owner's permission. While this isn't necessarily a criminal offense (ruling out option B), it could potentially expose Sarah to civil liability if Joe decides to pursue the matter.

Even though Adobe has discontinued Flash Player, they still hold the copyright to it. Distributing copyrighted software without permission is generally illegal, regardless of whether it's done for profit or with attribution to the original creator. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because non-profit distribution and crediting the creator don't override copyright protections. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because software doesn't automatically enter the public domain when support ends; it remains copyrighted for the duration specified by law. \n\nAnswer D is unlikely to be correct.

A hard to read seal or signature is even more common in legitimate cases due to low quality copying or a low quality printer. Printers and copiers are notoriously error prone as anyone who has worked in an office environment knows.\n\nOften a document is distributed in proof form, unsigned and sealed to the recipient, in order to allow proofreading of name spelling, etc., who may actually have earned the executed one but accidentally submit the unexecuted version to an employer.\n\nA document is only fabricated if the facts that it attests to are not true and it was made knowing that they were not true.\n\nUsually, a decent document fabricator will also include a fake signature or seal, so usually a lack of a signature or seal is an indication of either non\\-fabrication or an extremely amateur job of fabrication.\n\nIf you want to know if a document is fabricated, the surefire way to get to the truth is to contact the issuer of the document to determine if it is real thing.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the main effect of a lack of a signature or seal is that the document is likely to not be self\\-authenticating and may require more extrinsic proof to show that what it purports to demonstrate is really true.\n\n> Can the person be accused of falsifying documents, sued and so on?\n\nIf the document is actually false and was knowingly submitted as a false document, then the person who submitted the fabricated document has attempted to defraud the company and is not immunized from liability for that, necessarily, by the lack of a seal or signature.\n\nOf course, anyone can be accused of falsifying documents whether it is true or not.\n\nFraud in an application for employment is frequently a good cause ground for terminating someone's employment even if they could otherwise only be terminated for cause and not just at will.

Usually, individuals and companies with a history of \"bad behavior\", are denied licensure. Each industries regulations and laws define what that bad behavior is, but a felony conviction for a financial related crime certainly meets that definition. However, being denied a license or booted from the industry is not automatic. The agencies that enforce these regulations, have the ability to continue to license someone who has a felony conviction.\n\nI know I am speaking in general terms, but let us look at the securities industry for a specific example.\n\nUnder the [Investment Company Act of 1940](https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/ica40.pdf), companies that manage investments/mutual funds, like J.P. Morgan \\& Chase, Co. must be licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. To paraphrase, Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act, it says that individuals cannot control or manage an investment company if they had a felony conviction on the past 10 years. It goes on to state that those same requirements apply to companies meaning they are denied a license. \n\nBut, section 9(c) allows \u201cpeople\u201d (which includes companies) that are prohibited from being licensed to get an **exemption** from these rules through the SEC's administrative process.\n\nHere, JP Morgan and the other companies mentioned in the press release are big players in the securities industry. All of them manage mutual funds and buy/sell securities for clients. Therefore, they each applied and received this exemption at the same time or right before they pleaded guilty so it wouldn\u2019t disrupt their business. Here are the administrative orders from the SEC\u2019s website dealing with this exact issue.\n\n* [J.P.

Despite this conviction, the bank continues to operate in the securities industry. Which of the following best explains how this is legally possible?\n\nA) The bank's conviction was automatically expunged after paying a large fine, allowing it to continue operations without restrictions.\n\nB) Felony convictions do not apply to corporations, only to individuals, so the bank's legal status remains unaffected.\n\nC) The bank applied for and received an exemption from regulatory agencies, allowing it to retain its licenses despite the conviction.\n\nD) The bank transferred all its operations to a new subsidiary company with a clean record, effectively bypassing the conviction.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the documentation, banks that plead guilty to felony charges can continue operating in highly regulated industries like securities by applying for exemptions from regulatory agencies. In this case, the bank would have applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an exemption under Section 9(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. This exemption allows companies with felony convictions to retain their licenses and continue managing investments and mutual funds.\n\nOption A is incorrect because felony convictions are not automatically expunged, even after paying fines. Option B is false; corporations can indeed be convicted of felonies.

The nurse checking me in noticed my high blood pressure and sores on my face from psoriasis, both conditions documented in my medical history, and decided I must be high on meth.\n\nShe asked me to take a urine test for meth, which I refused. She then threatened to have be detained by the local sheriff and tested against my will if I did not comply. I took the test because I don't have time for to deal with their... uh, stuff...\n\nI have no history of drug use or criminal record. Is there any legal basis at all for what I was subjected to today? And what should I do the next time the medical community tries to extort money from me? Paying for the test, etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let us assume that you *were* high on meth at the time, that you were acting normally (that is, were not smashing windows or other such criminal things), but you had mouth sores and high blood pressure. Let's also assume that you are docile, but don't consent: so you stick around. Even with all of these assumptions working against you, the sheriff cannot force you to take a drug test without a warrant. When he goes to the judge, the judge will not issue a warrant to force you to take a test. Drug tests are forms of searches, which are protected by the 4th Amendment, and they basically require \"probable cause\" to the effect that you had committed a crime. Given your description of the circumstances, there is no such probable cause (i.e. \"most likely that it is true\"). The threat to call the sheriff was empty, though perhaps sincerely believed (many people sincerely believe lots of wrong things about the law).\n\nYou can consent (sounds like you did): as far as I know, if you give in to a suggestion from a nurse that the sheriff will make you take the test (an untruth), that would not invalidate evidence derived from a voluntary search. Every citizen is expected (unreasonably) to know and follow the law, and it is expected that you will know that you have the right to refuse, so you cannot say \"But I didn't know I could refuse\". \n\nYou always have the right to refuse any medical treatment or testing. This is true even if your insurance requires you to take a certain test. There could be contractual consequences to violating the contract with your insurance company, but again you cannot be compelled to take a test or undergo a procedure because an insurance company \"requires\" you to. If, for example, your insurance company requires you to take a meth\\-abuse screening test, then *if* such a contract condition is legal in California, refusing to take the test could lead to some insurance problems, like they would cancel your policy.\n\nAs for financial liability for the test that you didn't really want but agreed to, there is a chance that you could argue in court that you were [coerced](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=52.1.) into the test and thus your apparent consent was not real. You have the right to refuse the test; if the other party, \"whether or not acting under color of law, interferes by threat, intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threat, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured by the Constitution or laws of this state\", then they crossed a legal line and you can sue them, plus any \"agreement\" that is coerced is null in the courts, and the putative debt arising from the test is also null.

Option B is overly broad, as not all statutes automatically include all forms of communication in their definition of commerce. Option C is incorrect because the definition in 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1958 is specific to that statute and not necessarily applicable to others.\n\nOption D is the most accurate because it acknowledges the potential variability in interpretation based on the specific statute and context. Courts may consider the purpose of the law, legislative intent, and precedent when determining whether \"commerce\" in a particular statute includes only economic activities or extends to other forms of interstate or foreign interactions, including communication."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70981/using-instrumental-portion-of-copyrighted-song", "docs_id": 70981, "title": "Using instrumental portion of copyrighted song?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have [this](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/02VySrVYFTnAPmQYDj-h97twQ#Intro_song) portion of Monsoon Br.eakfast.\n\nI\u2019m planning to use it for an creepy intro animation\n\nI know that it is copyrighted, yet I have seen other people use it without the lyrics, and it seems like it isn\u2019t copyrighted if you don\u2019t use the lyrics.\n\nLike this[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qwxjR.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qwxjR.jpg)\n\nAccording to what I circled, apparently it\u2019s ok to mute the music and bypass copyright.\n\nBut is it really?

But just looking at the text, if you give someone money to encourage them to engage in a specific kind of criminal conduct (e.g. beating people up), then you've violated the law.

Sometimes the tape is left to decay to shreds in the weather, and what it is supposed to be defending is no longer clear.\n\nDoes \"Police Do Not Cross\" tape in England, not associated with an active police presence, have any legal status at all? Is there any crime committed in ignoring the injunction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a broad question about the [powers of the police in England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_the_police_in_England_and_Wales). I have been unable to find any UK legislation which directly addresses 'do not cross' tape (also known as police tape, crime scene tape or [barricade tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barricade_tape)). However, the police have broad statutory and common law powers, and ignoring 'do not cross' tape could be an offence in the same way as ignoring other police orders.\n\nIn *Director of Public Prosecutions v Morrison* [\\[2003] EWHC 683 (Admin)](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/683.html), the High Court decided that at common law, **the police have the power to cordon off a crime scene**. Police had cordoned off an area to preserve evidence using tape labelled \"Police: Do not Cross\" \\[9]. The prosecution's case against the respondent was that, having been told not to enter the cordoned area, he challenged the police right to prohibit him from entering the area \\[10]. There was a dispute as to whether the respondent did cross the tape and other issues, but police ultimately arrested him for disorderly conduct \\[29].\n\nThe respondent was convicted in the Magistrates' Court of **disorderly conduct** under [s 5 of the *Public Order Act 1986*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/5) and **wilful obstruction** of a police constable under [s 89(2\\) of the *Police Act 1996*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) \\[1]. His conviction was set aside on appeal to the Crown Court, which found that the only statutory authority for setting up a cordon is in the *Terrorism Act 2000*, and the cordon had been established without the consent of the land owner or a warrant \\[17]. The relevant question for the High Court was:\n\n> Was the Wood Green Crown Court wrong in law to hold that the Metropolitan Police on the evidence in this case had no **lawful power or authority to close the public right of way over private premises by a cordon** and forcibly prohibit the Defendant from using that right of way on foot against his will \\[4]?\n\nThe answer is yes. The police have the power to cordon off a crime scene, but they must act reasonably:\n\n> \\[W]hen seeking to investigate crime police officers do not have an unfettered right to restrict movements on private land ... but ... \\[a]s Lord Denning said \\[in *Ghani v Jones* \\[1970] 1 QB 693] \"the police should be able to do whatever is necessary and reasonable to preserve the evidence of the crime\" ... **provided \\[the police] do not go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances, routine scenes of crime searches may assume the owner's consent** ... In the present case the police were entitled to assume consent ... we believe that consent could not lawfully be withheld \\[22]\u2013\\[23].\n\nSo the police have the power to restrict movements on private land and can use this power to cordon off a crime scene. The police can arrest someone who unlawfully enters a crime scene, which may amount to the offence of wilful obstruction. It is harder to answer the hypothetical question where there is nobody around to enforce the cordon. This is a broader question about land rights; the answer would depend on who was trying to enforce the cordon and why.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Police have cordoned off an area in a public park using \"Do Not Cross\" tape following a crime.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of John's actions?\n\nA) John has committed no offense, as the tape has no legal status without an active police presence.\n\nB) John has definitely committed the offense of disorderly conduct under the Public Order Act 1986.\n\nC) John may potentially be committing an offense, such as wilful obstruction of a police constable, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\nD) John is only breaking the law if the local council has officially approved the continued presence of the police tape.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the case law presented in Director of Public Prosecutions v Morrison, the police have the common law power to cordon off a crime scene, and this power extends beyond their immediate presence. While the tape alone may not have explicit legal status, crossing it could potentially constitute an offense such as wilful obstruction of a police constable under section 89(2) of the Police Act 1996. \n\nThe police's authority to maintain a cordon is based on what is reasonable in the circumstances. Without knowing the full details of the crime and investigation, it's possible that maintaining the cordon for three days is still reasonable. Therefore, John's action of crossing the tape may be seen as obstructing the police in their duty to preserve evidence or secure a crime scene.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the tape can have legal implications even without an active police presence. Option B is too definitive, as disorderly conduct would depend on John's behavior, which is not specified in the scenario. Option D is incorrect because police powers to cordon off areas don't necessarily require local council approval."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11589/celebrity-images-for-non-commercial-purposes", "docs_id": 11589, "title": "Celebrity images for non commercial purposes", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can I source photos off of the web of celebrities for non\\-commercial purposes?
