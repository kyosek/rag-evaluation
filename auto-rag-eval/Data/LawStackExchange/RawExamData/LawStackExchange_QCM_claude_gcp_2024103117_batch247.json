On constitutional issues, and on issues of federal law (which do come up in state cases) , they are binding precedent, at least in that circuit for an appeals court opinion, and in the whole US for a Supreme court opinion. District court opinions are not generally binding unless upheld on appeal. On matters of state law, the state's own highest court is the final word, but a federal opinion could be at least as persuasive as one from a different state.\n\nto the best of my understanding one does not use the term \"estoppel\" to describe the effect of a previous judgement by a different court. If it is in the same case and not on appeal, the term is [*Res judicata*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/res_judicata) (\"A thing (already) judged\").

But, what if someone's personal opinion\n>  is that a company is bad in some way, and the company loses money as a\n>  result? Can they be sued?\n\nLibel is a statement that tends to damage someone's reputation that is made to someone other than the subject of the statement. Truth was historically a defense to liability for libel (although in many circumstances in the United States is has been made part of the prima facie case that must be proved by an accuser).\n\nOrdinarily a libel must be a statement of fact, and a mere opinion is not actionable. But, sometimes an opinion so clearly implies a closely related statement of fact in a particular context that the implied statement of fact arising from the statement of opinion, if false, is actionable.\n\nAnybody can be sued, but they will not have a viable cause of action and their suit will be dismissed, if the alleged statement is truly a statement of opinion, even if it has consequences for a person's reputation and causes them economic harm.\n\nFor example, if I say that Calvin Klein clothes look better than American Outfitter's clothes, and people care about my opinion and purchase fewer American Outfitter's clothes, I have not committed actionable libel (even if I don't sincerely believe what I said since it is an opinion either way), even though my statement harmed the company that makes American Outfitter clothes.

Option C is correct because:\n\n1. The statement about clothes falling apart is likely to be considered a pure opinion, which is generally not actionable as libel.\n\n2. However, the claim about unethical labor practices, even when prefaced with \"In my opinion,\" could be seen as implying a factual basis. If this implied fact is false and damaging, it could potentially be grounds for a libel case.\n\n3. The financial harm alone is not sufficient to make an opinion statement libel.\n\n4. Simply prefacing a statement with \"In my opinion\" does not automatically protect against all libel claims if the statement implies false facts.\n\n5.

The first commercially offered VM system was from IBM with their System/360 but it was based on idea from MIT that were funded by DARPA. My patent search skills are not that great but even if this was patented then, in the early 1960's, those patents have long since expired. So the basic idea of a virtual machine is now unencumbered.\n\nThat being said, VMs are an area of ongoing research and development today and many aspects of VM operation have been patented. If you are going to develop a new and improved VM system you will want to do your own research to ensure that the parts of your system that you believe are unique have not already been patented by someone else. If your ideas are novel you may want to consider patenting them.\n\nYour questions:\n\n> So, is the general software concept of creating, managing, and running\n> virtual machines legally\\-protected?\n\nThey are protected the same as any other invention. Through patents and/or trade secrets. There are any number of companies today that hold various patents on various aspects of VM systems.\n\n> How come there are a lot of virtual machine software out there that\n> basically do the same thing but are not in legal trouble?\n\nThe same way as any other invention. They either license the patented technologies or they find a non\\-infringing alternative and probably patent that themselves. In many cases the leading companies in theses area may have cross\\-licensing agreements.\n\n> Also, how can I know if the feature I am planning to include will not\n> lead me to legal trouble?\n\nYou do your homework and determine if your ideas are already covered by someone else's patents.

(In my opinion at least.) So its terms bind you regardless. But what is a \"derivative work\"? Just because it's something that works similarly to another application doesn't make it a \"derivative\".

In addition, owners of LLCs taxed as partnerships must report their share of California income from the LLC on California state income tax returns, and LLCs taxed as corporations must pay California state corporate income taxes.\n\nThe California tax filings are confidential. But California tax officials have a right to disclosure of an LLCs owners from the LLC.\n\nThere is (or recently was) litigation in California seeking to obtain disclosure of LLC ownership in a freedom of information act request (or the state equivalent).

According to the information provided, both New Mexico and California maintain confidentiality of LLC ownership information. While the LLC must disclose ownership information to tax authorities in both states, this information is kept confidential and is not made public. The LLC does not lose its anonymity by registering as a foreign LLC in California, as the registration process does not require disclosure of ownership. Both states have similar privacy protections for LLC owners, and neither state makes LLC ownership a matter of public record.

This principle, known as \"contra proferentem,\" would likely lead a court to interpret the contradictory terms in favor of the customer, Jane.

In other jurisdictions laws are, of course, different (though usually not drastically so.)]\n\nIn the US there are (at least) three different bodies of law that might apply to code: copyright, patents, trade secrets.\n\nCopyright covers original *expression*. Anything you write is automatically, immediately protected under copyright. The copyright applies to the code itself, and anything \"derived\" from that code. It's up to the courts to decide exactly what \"derived\" means. One case that's long been viewed as a landmark in this area is Gates Rubber v. Bando Chemicals. The [Court of Appeals for the tenth Circuit decision](http://digital-law-online.info/cases/28PQ2D1503.htm) includes a section titled: \"The Test for Determining Whether the Copyright of a Computer Program Has Been Infringed.\" Note that you can register a copyright, and that can be worthwhile, such as helping recover some damages you can't otherwise.\n\nPatents are quite different from copyrights. Where a copyright covers expression of an idea, a patent covers a specific invention. Rather than being awarded automatically, a patent has to be applied for, and awarded only after the patent office has determined that there's no relevant prior art to prevent it from being awarded. A patent, however, covers things like somebody else independently discovering/inventing what's covered by the patent.\n\nA trade secret could (at least theoretically) apply to some process or procedure embodied in the code. A trade secret mostly applies to a situation where (for example) you're trying to form an alliance with some other company, and in the process tell them things you don't tell the general public. If you've identified the fact that what you're telling them is a trade secret, and they then tell a competitor (or the general public, etc.) or more generally use that information in any way other than the originally intended purpose, it could constitute a trade secret violation. As a side\\-note: patents and copyright fall under federal law, so they're basically uniform nation\\-wide. Trade secrets mostly fall under state law, so the exact details vary by state.\n\nAbsent a reason to believe otherwise, I'd guess your interest here is primarily in copyright infringement. The key here would be showing that one piece of code was derived from the other. That is, it specifically would *not* apply in a case where there were only a limited number of ways of doing something, so anybody who wanted to do that had to use one of those ways.

Lead says no and specifically clarifies that the conversation was really only about her concern for my wife's well being with raising her children.\n* Lead asks direct reports to video tape themselves working with the idea that they will receive constructive criticism.\n* At the same time Lead shared constructive criticism with my wife, criticisms were also emailed to their Supervisor, before any opportunity was given to make improvements based on criticisms.\n* Lead met privately with Supervisor and scheduled performance meeting with my wife.\n\nDuring meeting\n==============\n\n* Lead's Supervisor asks if my wife had since shown improvement. Lead responds yes.\n* One a prior day Lead instructed my wife to observe Lead as Lead worked and take notes. In the meeting, Supervisor berates my wife for taking notes instead of working. Lead fails to speak up and share that my wife was following direct instructions.\n* Lead and Supervisor give criticism over petty points found in work video my wife was asked to make. Imagine reprimanding an Algebra teacher for not stopping to teach students basic addition every time they made an adding mistake (and imagine that many of same teacher's students from prior years generally qualified for advanced classes). It was something that, if my wife had stopped to do it, they could have just as easily accused her of not accomplishing the thing which she was actively working on. Basically, it feels very much like the whole thing was a planned attempt to contrive evidence against her rather than a genuine attempt to provide constructive criticism.\n* Other points of criticism were points that both Lead and other coworkers have struggled with at various times.\n* Lead and Supervisor asked wife what she will do to improve her performance, but did not provide any guidance as to what steps she should take. Instead they will continue to monitor her more in order to provide further guidance (or fabricate more \"evidence\", depending on your point of view).\n\nAfter meeting\n=============\n\n* Wife asks lead if she wants her there next year. Lead responds that she does not.\n* Wife says it would be hard to find another job while pregnant. Lead encourages her not to share that she is pregnant.\n* Lead says she is tired of holding my wife's hand for past 3 years, despite having told her very recently she was doing fine and having repeatedly told her she was doing a good job over the past years.\n\nOther notes:\n============\n\n* In addition to Lead's own repeated approval of my wife's performance up until now, my wife has a great work history at same job at other workplaces, consistently performing better than her predecessors everywhere she has worked.\n* Even her current performance is better than that of those who came before her at this workplace.\n* Lead has at times given conflicting advice. One day says \"Don't do X\" and another day says \"You need to be doing X\".\n\nAnd there are other points I could make as well, but not without being more specific than I would like.\n\nEdit\n----\n\nTo be clear, my question about what further actions we can take is in the same line as if someone had a car accident then there are certain steps you take such as getting the other person's information, taking pictures, contacting insurance, possibly filing police report, etc. None of these things are specific legal advice, and though they may be considered \"common sense\" many people fail to do these things until it is too late. So I am just trying to ensure there are no obvious steps I am overlooking to do now that I will regret not doing later. It sounds like there aren't since no one has offered any, but that's where my question was going.\n\nI also would have thought my question about whether it's illegal to encourage and/or pressure someone to quit their job after becoming pregnant would be simple yes/no answer after knowing some basic context such as type of business and location. But perhaps I'm wrong about that? And perhaps I should be clear and state that I am not asking whether I might be able to meet the burden of proof to succeed in court on such an issue; I know that a question like that can't be answered here. I'm just wondering whether any laws exist prohibiting it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't stress this enough: Document everything as it seems like the management are building a case against her by \"Moving the Goal Posts\" i.e. the don't do this thing/do the thing we told you not to do.\n\nYour wife needs to get copies of every e\\-mail exchanged with her and the bosses, as well as any e\\-mails between co\\-workers that are relevant as well as any print outs of performance documents. Keep these in a place where they can be filed and looked at on your own... you want them out of office to the greatest extent possible. If you can't remove them, make sure she has pertinent information about who's addresses were sent the e\\-mail and the date it was sent, with a note of possible importance.\n\nIn addition, if you are not already doing this, your wife should find someone in the company who she trusts and ask them if she can BCC them on any e\\-mails she sends to management (including replies to e\\-mails they sent). BCC (or blind carbon copy) sends a copy of the e\\-mail to the address listed in the BCC line, but will hide that person from being seen by other recipients of the email (including if you have multiple addresses in the BCC line). This allows further copies of documentation that is preserved incase an \"accident\" happens to her account. The best people to ask should be people who your wife trusts, who are out of her management chain (their supervisor isn't her supervisor) and has some experience with the company. Be sure she asks for permission to do this first, as the goal of this is not just evidence preservation but also witness creation. Her bosses might not turn over any response e\\-mails she sent to them and won't turn over anything that makes them look bad.\n\nI would also get copies of company policies with respect to termination of employment and the process that needs to be gone through, as well as their harassment policy and equal opportunity employment policy. You also want to get copies of her employment contracts and any benefits listings she signed for and compare those with Texas laws on discrimination. As always, if you're not sure if it's something that could be helpful, err on the side that it is, and save it.\n\nHere's a link to the Texas Workforce Commission's brief list of \"To Dos\" regarding [pregnancies](https://twc.texas.gov/news/efte/pregnancy_rights.html) and I'm sure taking a look at the sight for other related matters will help.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following actions would be most appropriate and beneficial for the employee to take in this situation?\n\nA) Immediately file a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) without gathering any additional evidence.\n\nB) Confront the Lead and Supervisor directly about their behavior and demand fair treatment without involving HR or collecting documentation.\n\nC) Document all interactions, collect relevant emails and performance reviews, and seek a trusted colleague to BCC on future communication with management.\n\nD) Resign from the position to avoid further conflict and potential stress during pregnancy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action is to document everything and collect evidence, as suggested in the top answer. This includes gathering emails, performance reviews, and company policies related to termination and equal opportunity employment. Additionally, finding a trusted colleague to BCC on future communications with management creates both evidence preservation and potential witnesses.

The likelihood that you would be prosecuted or sued for this conduct if you did it on a very systemic basis for profit, without doing any further due diligence into whether the cards are actually stolen, is considerable higher.\n\nIf you believe that the gift card codes are probably stolen, it would be best for you to refrain from purchasing them in the future.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John purchases a $50 restaurant gift card code online for $20 from a third-party vendor.

John's legal liability in this situation primarily depends on his level of knowledge or suspicion about the gift card's origins when he purchased and used it. If John had no reason to believe the gift card was stolen at the time, he likely wouldn't be guilty of a crime. However, if he knew or had strong suspicion that the gift card was stolen, he could be liable for receiving stolen property or using stolen information to acquire goods or services. The law considers the intent and state of mind of the individual in such cases. Additionally, even without criminal liability, John might face civil liability for restitution if the gift card turns out to be stolen.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because using a stolen gift card is not automatically a crime if the user had no knowledge or reason to suspect it was stolen. Answer B is overly broad and incorrect, as one can be liable for knowingly receiving and using stolen property even if they didn't steal it themselves.

How would the value of ABCcoin in dollars be determined with no market to determine a market value?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that you are distorting the legal situation by describing it as a debt denominated in XYZcoins.

A similar remedy may be available on a contract to sell a painting or other object that is unique, and cannot be replaced easily by a different object of the same type.

What is excluded is evidence derived from that illegal search, regardless of what crime they were searching for. It would include later evidence for an unrelated crime where the probable cause was uncovered by the illegal search. The doctrine is not absolute, so a grand jury can inquire about a matter brought to their attention via an illegal search (\"the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons\", US v.

'Enemy\" is a term of art that means a country that the United States is actually at war with, militarily, by providing aid and comfort to the other side that aides them in waging war with the U.S.\n\nCooperating with Russian election interference isn't treason. Inaction isn't treason. The President probably has an absolute legal right to disclose information that is classified for national security purposes. The President is immune from civil and criminal liability for his official acts while he is President.\n\nIf the President, from his private funds, and not as part of his officially duties, personally paid Taliban soldiers bounties to shoot and kill American soldiers, that might be treason (since the U.S. is at war, within the meaning of the treason statute, with the Taliban). Cooperating with Russia, despite the fact that it has done so is not treason.\n\nEven then, federal prosecutors would not press these federal charges against the President while the President was in office. And, the President would be immune, in all probability, to state treason charges for conduct while in office. So the President would have to be prosecuted after leaving office. On the other hand, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not require a criminal conviction to be effective.\n\nThe intent of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was to deny civil rights in the post\\-Civil War governments of the United States by Confederate officials and military officers.

There is a massive banking catastrophe and most banks fail.\n\nCompanies do not cease to exist because they are in bankruptcy. Typically a caretaker management is set in place (elected either by the borrowers or the judge overseeing the bankruptcy) to avoid the loss of value during those proceedings.\n\nUsually a company in bankruptcy has to reduce its operations because it will find it difficult to get resources to continue its usual operations. But it could continue those operations that are still expected to provide a profit. It would not be unusual for the caretaker manager to ask more funds from the borrowers in order to ensure that they do not lose even more of the value of the company.\n\nI would say that debt collection is profitable enough to keep it running, at very least to cover the minimal legal requirements so that the debt does not expire.\n\nAnd at the very least, **the debt can be sold** to a debt collection agency or another bank, outside of the bankruptcy proceedings (then the net value of this sell is what will be passed on to the borrowers). It will give a small profit for the original company, but at almost no cost or risk for them.\n\n> Also, the debt holder would have no incentive to collect if it was in bankruptcy proceedings and didnt own anything.\n\nYou are confusing managers with owners. The people deciding what to do are the managers, and even in bankruptcy managers still owe fiduciary duty to their business. In fact, in general there is no need for the manager of the company to \"own anything\" of the company they manage, yet they have to work to improve its situation.\n\nIf a manager negligently caused the company to cause value, he could be sued for it. Even if he is not sued, it would look very bad for him when looking for a new job.\n\nIn any case, this is not different than the shop across the street going out of business.

When a bank fails and enters bankruptcy, the debts it holds do not simply disappear or become uncollectible. The bankruptcy process typically involves a caretaker management that continues to manage the bank's assets, including outstanding debts. These debts remain valid obligations and can be sold to other entities, such as debt collection agencies or other banks, as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. This allows the bankrupt institution to recover some value from its assets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because debt is not automatically forgiven when a bank fails.

Simply being a stockholder \\-\\- even a major one \\-\\- gives a person no rights of access, nor rights to do anything with company property.\n\nThe management of a company could permit a person access to that company's property. The company's board of directors could instruct management to grant such access. Stockholders normally select board members.\n\nIn practice if a major stockholder asked management for access it would quite likely be granted.\n\nHowever, one should note that companies with a stock value under $2 million are unlikely to **own** a building with a parking lot. Such a company is much more likely to **lease** space in such a building, and that lease will have conditions. It is likely that one condition is that the property is not to be used for residential purposes.\n\nEven if the company owns the building and the land, zoning rules or other local laws may well make it unlawful for anyone to live on the premises or sleep in the parking lot.

Your proposed restriction of only showing data of blood relatives seems excessively strict.\n\nBut assuming that this exemption wouldn't apply, there'd probably still be no problem. The GDPR does not require you to always obtain consent. It requires that the purposes for which you process personal data are covered by some legal basis.

For example, contact information could be used for stalking.\n* The balance of the legitimate interest check can be changed if you adopt suitable safeguards. Your idea of only sharing data with close relatives would be such a safeguard, but it might not be necessary.\n* When you rely on legitimate interest, the affected person can object to further processing, furthermore they can request to be erased from your records.\n\t+ A request for erasure can be denied if there are overriding grounds to keep the data. E.g maybe only contact information has to be deleted but names, dates, and relations might be kept.\n* You should notify persons when they are included into your records.\n* It is your obligation as the data controller to make these decisions.

The policy should be fair, proportionate, and justified in order to enable the employer to discharge their duty of care under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Employees cannot be forced to take a drug test, but refusing when there are good grounds for testing may lead to disciplinary action. The correct answer is not A (as testing must be justified), not B (as testing can be required under certain conditions), and not D (as it's not limited only to high-risk industries, but depends on the specific job requirements and contractual terms)."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1541/use-of-tv-show-names-on-drop-shipping-website", "docs_id": 1541, "title": "Use of TV show names on drop shipping website", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm setting up my own drop shipping business.

There is also generally a requirement to affirmatively state in adoption proceeding if the father is, or might be, a member of a Native American tribe, as that goes to the jurisdictional issue of the applicability of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, which requires notice, at a minimum, to the father's Indian tribe, even if notice cannot be given to the father.\n\nThere is a presumption that a child born to a woman married to a husband is the child of the husband and after a certain number of years, for certain purposes (such as child support). This presumption is usually conclusive and cannot be rebutted even by DNA evidence to the contrary, on the theory that the husband is the psychological parent of the child and has assumed that responsibility, and in order to discourage after the fact denials of paternity simply to avoid child support when paternity was never disputed.\n\nThere is also a presumption that a birth certificate's statement of paternity is correct, although this is in often not a conclusive presumption. And, birth certificates are a matter of public record, so a man can search the vital statistics records of a state to see if anyone has identified him as a father even if he has not been told of that fact, arguably giving him constructive knowledge of his paternity in that case.\n\nBut, the identity of the person who is the child's father, or of persons who could be the child's father, is not privileged (other than under the 5th Amendment right against self\\-incrimination where applicable), and so, a woman can generally be legally compelled to disclose this information by subpoena or in response to discovery in litigation. \n\nFor example, a woman under the age of consent at the time her child was conceived can be incarcerated for contempt of court for failing to disclose the name of the father in connection with a criminal prosecution of a suspected father of the child for statutory rape.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, under which of the following circumstances is a mother legally required to inform the biological father about the existence of their child?\n\nA) When she applies for certain welfare benefits\nB) When she files her taxes\nC) When she registers the child for school\nD) When she moves to a different state\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, there is generally no affirmative duty for a mother to inform a father about the existence of their child.

One of these exceptions is when applying for certain kinds of welfare benefits, where identification of the father is required for some programs.\n\nOption B is incorrect because filing taxes does not typically require disclosure of paternity information.\n\nOption C is incorrect because registering a child for school does not generally require informing the biological father if he is not already aware of the child's existence.\n\nOption D is incorrect because moving to a different state does not create a legal obligation to inform the biological father about the child.\n\nIt's important to note that while option A is correct, it's not the only circumstance where a mother might be required to provide information about the father.

If all incomes are distributed to Founders, (rather than being held by the company *per se*,) how is the company to maintain its own bank accounts for the purpose of paying expenses, just for starters?

This is a \"flow though regime\".\n\nThe main exceptions for business companies are corporations taxed as \"C\\-corporations\" which are taxed as separate entities, corporations which are S\\-corporations which have a modified and more rigid partnership tax regime that is likewise a flow through regimes, eligible entities that elect to be taxed as C\\-corporations or S\\-corporations, and eligible entities with a single member that a disregarded as separate from their owner for income tax purposes.\n\nIn a flow though partnership tax regime, all items of income, revenue, and expense, and all tax credits of the company are allocated to the owners of the company, and the company itself doesn't actually pay taxes even though it fills out an information tax return on Form 1065 that reports income, revenue, expense and tax credits and then allocates 100% of these items to owners of the company on a Schedule K\\-1 for each owner to whom any tax item is allocated in that year.\n\n**The Novelty Or Lack Thereof Of The Clause Itself**\n\nIt isn't that unusual an approach, although it is a minority approach. The purpose of having that term is to make sure that the allocation is legally valid because it has \"substantial economic effect\" which means that there are circumstances in which the allocation of tax items related to real world distributions from the company in some circumstance or other.\n\nThe most unusual part of the referenced language is that is uses \"assets sold at their fair market value\" rather than [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-are-book-value-and-market-value-different/), which is called a \"mark to market\" system.\n\nThis is almost unheard of outside the financial industry, and is uncommon even in the commercial banking part of the financial industry. Instead, using book value for assets in accounting and tax allocations is much more common. Normally, this would only be found in a company invested in marketable securities with readily quotable fair market value prices.\n\nBook value is more common than mark to market systems in most cases because otherwise the assets of the company have to be appraised each year in order to complete the company's tax returns and this can be a costly and inexact way to value assets, contrary to the certainty, clarity and much lower cost associated with using book value for assets that don't have a readily determined market value because they are fungible and frequently traded.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A partnership agreement contains the following clause: \"The Company will allocate items of income and losses as if the Company were liquidated, its assets sold at their fair market value, and the resulting proceeds (net of liabilities) distributed to the Founders in accordance with this agreement.\" What is the primary purpose of this clause?\n\nA) To ensure that all income is immediately distributed to the founders\nB) To prevent the company from maintaining its own bank accounts\nC) To establish a method for tax allocation that has \"substantial economic effect\"\nD) To require annual liquidation of the company's assets\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The primary purpose of this clause is to establish a method for tax allocation that has \"substantial economic effect.\" This is important for U.S. tax law compliance in partnership taxation.\n\nA is incorrect because the clause doesn't actually require immediate distribution of income.

In the US and other common law jurisdictions, courts will also follow decisions by other courts at the same level of the hierarchy (not just superior courts), but in Argentina, there is no horizontal *stare decisis*.\n\nUnder the inquisitorial system, the court is part of the investigation, so you can discuss with them analogous facts. Apparently, however, that is the old system, since 3 years ago Argentina switched to an [adversarial system](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/argentina-reform-of-code-of-criminal-procedure/), and I think this is the new [Code of Criminal Procedure](http://www.saij.gob.ar/docs-f/codigo/Codigo_Procesal_Penal_de_la_Nacion.pdf).

This system allows for some flexibility, as courts can diverge from precedents if they have new arguments or good reasons. However, completely ignoring precedents runs the risk of decisions being struck down. It's important to note that Argentina does not practice horizontal stare decisis, meaning courts are not bound by decisions from other courts at the same level.

If the contract specified that violating the code could result in withheld transcripts, this would likely be enforceable under contract law. The law generally upholds such agreements unless they are illegal or unconscionable. A coffee prohibition, while perhaps unusual, is unlikely to be considered unconscionable. Religious freedom is not directly relevant here as the student voluntarily agreed to the terms.

I am not aware of any special laws about merely owning a halftrack that (say) you keep on a farm as decoration, but in any case I think you are more interested in whether the vehicle in question can be registered.\n\nVehicle registration standards are (mostly) dealt with under State and territory law. I can give you an answer for Victoria, to at least illustrate the issues and where to look for answers. However, (at least some of) the relevant standards appear to be uniform across Australia.\n\nThe starting point is that it is an offence to operate a vehicle on a public road without registering said vehicle: Road Safety Act 1986 (Vic), s 7\\.\n\nThe Act provides that:\n\n* the Regulations may prescribe how registration is applied for and granted or refused: s 9; and\n* the Minister may prescribe standards for registration by notice in the Gazette: s 10\\.\n\nThe standards cover \"the construction, efficiency, performance, safety, design and equipment of, and the method of identifying\" vehicles.\n\nI'm not good at searching Gazettes so I'm going to wave my hand over a gap and skip straight to things like:\n\n* 'Guide to Modifications for Motor Vehicles' on the VicRoads website (VicRoads being the road traffic authority in Victoria, the government agency in charge of registering vehicles): [https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/\\~/media/files/documents/safety\\-and\\-road\\-rules/vsinumber8guidetomodificationsformotorvehicles.ashx?la\\=en](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/~/media/files/documents/safety-and-road-rules/vsinumber8guidetomodificationsformotorvehicles.ashx?la=en)\n* 'National Code of Practice for Light Vehicle Construction and Modification (NCOP)', which is an Australia\\-wide document: <https://infrastructure.gov.au/roads/vehicle_regulation/bulletin/vsb_ncop.aspx>\n\nThis is one of those areas where you probably need a mechanic more than a lawyer.\n\nOnce you have satisfied yourself that your halftrack meets the applicable standards, you need to go and get a 'VASS Approval Certificate' ('Vehicle Assessment Signatory Scheme') from a certified tester and then register the vehicle with VicRoads.\n\nHappy driving!", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Australian vehicle registration laws, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential road-legal status of a World War II era half-track vehicle?\n\nA) Half-tracks are automatically road legal in Australia due to their historical significance.\n\nB) A half-track could potentially be registered for road use if it meets all current vehicle standards and passes necessary inspections.\n\nC) Half-tracks are explicitly prohibited from registration in all Australian states and territories.\n\nD) Half-tracks can be registered without any modifications as long as they can achieve suburban speed limits.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation suggests that while unusual vehicles like half-tracks are not automatically road legal, they could potentially be registered if they meet all current vehicle standards and pass necessary inspections.

Option A could inadvertently reveal the existence of a national security letter. Option B would violate the nondisclosure requirement. Option D would constitute perjury.

I just heard that it is illegal for me to drive in Texas because I don't have insurance and that if they stop me they can seize my car. Is this true?\n\nI thought the Constitution said that states had to respect the laws of other states?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As Mark's answer indicates, you are evidently thinking of the [Full Faith and Credit Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Faith_and_Credit_Clause). \"Public acts\" being laws, it may seem at first glance that states must fully respect the laws of other states. But the interpretation of this clause by the courts is rather different, and has evolved a bit over time.\n\nThe short of the (modern) matter is that it mostly applies to matters concerning the judiciary. SCOTUS has recognized a \"[public policy exception](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/306/493)\" to the clause, which limits the ability of the clause to force a state to abide by laws which are in conflict with their own (for the most part: they don't have to). Driving privileges, and more generally who is licensed to do what (doctors, hunting, concealed carry, etc.), within a state falls under that public policy exception. So Texas does not have to obey New Hampshire's laws concerning the legal privilege to drive.\n\nAs a basic sanity test, if this were not the case, then why wouldn't everybody in Texas not simply bounce off to New Hampshire for a summer to get their license there and then return to Texas and never bother with insurance? It entirely undercuts the state's sovereignty and ability to set their own laws if any other state can so easily create loopholes around them.\n\nMoreover, despite what the name might suggest, a \"driver's license\" is more a certification that you have the requisite skills, physical performance (passing an eye test), and knowledge to drive safely and in accordance with that state's traffic laws. It certainly makes sense for a state to require you to demonstrate at least that much, but they may also impose additional requirements. A requirement for insurance demonstrates your ability to handle financial liabilities that may reasonably result from your driving. \n\nAll states currently accept a valid out\\-of\\-state license in the above sense: that you are certified to have the requisite skills, that it is valid proof of age, etc. Though if you become a permanent resident there they may require you to take new tests. However to legally drive in any particular state you must not only have such certification (a driver's license) but also satisfy any other conditions, such as age requirements and insurance requirements.\n\nAs an aside, such state\\-by\\-state variations as to who is licensed to do what are in fact quite common, especially across history, even on very prominent issues. But even nationwide resolutions of those issues via SCOTUS have never, to my knowledge, utilized the Full Faith and Credit clause to do so. And, really, how could they? By saying since some state could force all other states to do X via the clause, then X must be a constitutional requirement? Or that any one state could unilaterally dictate laws in all other states? Madness! \n\nFor one example, anti\\-miscegenation laws, which outlawed (certain) interracial marriages, were quite common until 1967, when SCOTUS struck them all down using the 14th amendment. More recently, gay marriage was forced to be recognized in all states, also via the 14th amendment. In both cases, before those SCOTUS rulings, the courts had generally recognized that the Full Faith and Credit clause did not compel the state to recognize (out\\-of\\-state) marriages it did not want to recognize. These both fell under the public policy exception.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause by courts, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding state laws and interstate recognition?\n\nA) States must fully respect and enforce all laws of other states without exception.\n\nB) States have complete discretion to ignore any laws from other states that conflict with their own.\n\nC) States must recognize judicial decisions from other states, but can apply a \"public policy exception\" to certain laws.\n\nD) The Full Faith and Credit Clause requires states to recognize all out-of-state licenses and certifications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that the modern interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause by courts primarily applies to judicial matters. While states generally must recognize court decisions from other states, there is a \"public policy exception\" that allows states to not enforce laws from other states that significantly conflict with their own public policy. This exception applies to areas like driving privileges, professional licensing, and marriage laws. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate the reach of the clause.

PadMapper used the services of 3Taps to bypass this block with a proxy. Craigslist sued and won. The court held that under the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Cease and Desist order and the IP block were sufficient notice of denial of access, and that further access was unauthorized and a violation of the act. The individual notice was considered essential to this holding.\n\nThe case of *Ryanair vs PR Aviation* was brought in the European Court of Justice. There, Ryanair had argued that continued scraping was a violation of its TOS and a copyright infringement. The court held that the owners of publicly available databases were entitled to impose access restrictions.

While campaign mailers can be copyrighted, reproducing them for the purpose of political commentary is likely to be considered fair use. The court would consider four factors: the purpose of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work. In this case, the purpose (political commentary) and the nature of the work (campaign material) favor fair use. The use of the full mailer might be justified if necessary for the commentary.

Essentially it sounds like manufacturers either knew/should have known of product fire risks (or at least in some cases they knew/known about them over time long before they were used), and companies that used those products to assemble cladding systems also knew or should have known of the risks in many cases,but chose to turn a blind eye to it.

Or in practice as a second resort, their insurers or product indemnity providers, which most companies would have in place for product liability claims over a certain sum.\n\nAlso would it matter in law, if any of these knew of the risk before use, or only after deployment of the products?

(Although I'm unsure if that's a good comparison for legal rights and duties since apparently this was knowable before deployment.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maybe\n-----\n\nEach case needs to be resolved on its merits.\n\nIn [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\"), they were in [*Taylor Construction Group Pty Ltd v Strata Plan 92888 t/as The Owners Strata Plan 92888* \\[2021] NSWSC 1315](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79ba6e9a-7ddd-447f-b863-555dd8166cc9&utm_source=Lexology%20Daily%20Newsfeed&utm_medium=HTML%20email%20-%20Body%20-%20General%20section&utm_campaign=Australian%20IHL%20subscriber%20daily%20feed&utm_content=Lexology%20Daily%20Newsfeed%202021-11-09&utm_term=) but that turned on the facts of the case. Other building owners might lose on the facts of their particular case.\n\nIn the above case, the owner's successfully argued that the product *as installed* failed to comply with the Building Code of Australia by creating an \"undue risk\" of fire spread and that the builder and developer, therefore, breached their statutory warranty under the Home Building Act. Importantly:\n\n> Her Honour found that a multi\\-factorial approach is to be taken when considering the risk assessment of fire spread (such as the extent of the use of materials, their relationship to other parts of the building such as windows and balconies, as well as their combustibility, ignitability and rate of flame spread) and one cannot look at sole factors in isolation (or be too literal or narrow when construing the term).\n\nThe same product installed in a different way on a different building might not create an *undue risk* \\- each building owner would have to prove in their case that it did.\n\nIn addition, older buildings do not have the benefit of the statutory warranty \\- it only runs for 3 years (since extended to 10 years). Potentially combustible cladding has been in use worldwide for several decades.\n\nA building that did not have the benefit of a statutory (or contractual warranty) would have to prove negligence. This could be difficult if the builder supplied the product specified by the architect or engineer \\- the builder has probably not been negligent. The architect/engineer has no contractual relationship with the owner so they would also have to be proved negligent and proved that they owed future owners a duty of care \\- that is something the courts have been traditionally reluctant to do.\n\nNotwithstanding, given the current state of the law, and the knowledge at the time it is possible that builders/architects/engineers have been negligent but it is equally possible that they have discharged their duty of care satisfactorily even though the practical outcome is less than satisfactory.\n\n> So why are they apparently not in any way liable under UK civil law, for manufacture of potentially dangerous products?\n\nPeople make dynamite, automobiles and drugs \\- all potentially dangerous products. Indeed the UK has a thriving export market in military ordinance and that is definitively a dangerous product; the entire purpose of weapons systems is to kill or maim people.\n\nIt's not enough that something is potentially dangerous. The manufacturers will doubtless say that the product is entirely safe if used properly, and they're right. The specifiers will say that the manufacturers should have done a better job of explaining how to use it correctly, no doubt they're right too. The installers will say that neither party told them how to use the product safely, they're probably right too.\n\nAnd this is why we have the problem.\n\n> Why can leaseholders and freeholders apparently not litigate in UK law for the cost of remedy, leaving the political question as \"should the govt pay\" and people unable to easily sell their homes?\n\nThey can.\n\nAll they have to do is find \u00a3500,000 to fund the case and hope they win. Lawyers and experts to prepare reports and testify don't work for free. Of course, if they lose then they have to pay the other side's costs too.\n\nThe *legal* solutions are straightforward. They're just not very attractive.\n\nSo, a lot of people are asking not \"Who f\\#@ked up my home?\" but \"Who was responsible for enforcing the regulations put in place so that people couldn't f\\#@k up my home?\"\n\nWell, that would be governments who, for the last 40\\-years or so have been damndest to get out of the business of government. I can't speak for the [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\") but in [australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\"), building regulation and compliance used to be a core responsibility of government, now we have private certifiers, paid for by the developer or builder, who rely on self\\-certification by the trades that install stuff.\n\nOwners understandably believe that they will have better outcomes by pursuing a *political* rather than *legal* fix.\n\n> Also would it matter in law, if any of these knew of the risk before use, or only after deployment of the products?\n\nYes, it does matter. Actual knowledge in advance that your acts or omissions can harm others would make your actions negligent at best and reckless at worst.

I know this can be done in alimony cases but not sure about debt.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. You can not impute income when collecting on a judgment.\n\nImputation of income in alimony cases is done to determine the amount of the debt owed, and not with regard to the collection of an already determined debt.\n\nIn a debt collection case, the debt is already determined.\n\nThis said, wage garnishment is not the only way to collect a debt. \n\nA writ of execution issued based upon a money judgment can authorize the sheriff to seize any tangible personal property not subject to an exemption from creditors (which cash earned in self\\-employment would generally be). A writ of execution might also be used to seize motor vehicles, jewelry or other property.\n\nThe club is only subject to garnishment of cash earned by an independent contractor at the club if it is in the club's possession, which I understand, is not the customary practice.\n\nDebtor's interrogatories can be served upon a debtor asking the debtor where the debtor's assets are located which can facilitate collection of those debts.\n\nDebts transferred to third\\-parties (e.g. family and friends) without substantially equivalent value can be recovered from the transferees in a fraudulent transfer action.\n\nBut, if the sheriff is not nimble enough to seize significant cash from the person of the debtor, the money isn't put in financial accounts, and all of the money is spent on exempt or instantly consumed assets, it may be impracticable to collect the money judgment. Many people are \"judgment proof.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A creditor has obtained a money judgment against a self-employed individual who primarily receives income in cash. Which of the following strategies is NOT a valid method for collecting on this judgment?\n\nA) Obtaining a writ of execution to authorize the sheriff to seize tangible personal property not subject to exemption\nB) Serving debtor's interrogatories to gather information about the debtor's assets\nC) Requesting the judge to impute the debtor's actual income and order the seizure of cash earnings\nD) Pursuing a fraudulent transfer action if the debtor has transferred assets to third parties without equivalent value\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is not a valid method for collecting on an existing money judgment. Imputation of income is typically used in alimony cases to determine the amount of debt owed, not for collecting on an already determined debt. In this scenario, the judgment amount has already been established.\n\nOption A is valid, as a writ of execution can be used to seize tangible personal property not exempt from creditors.\n\nOption B is a legitimate strategy, as debtor's interrogatories can be used to gather information about the debtor's assets to facilitate collection.\n\nOption D is also valid, as fraudulent transfers to third parties can be pursued to recover assets transferred without substantially equivalent value.\n\nThe question tests understanding of debt collection methods and the limitations on imputing income in judgment collection cases."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55750/is-sending-the-complains-to-the-whole-community-instead-of-the-title-ix-office-l", "docs_id": 55750, "title": "Is sending the complains to the whole community instead of the Title IX office legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A woman received an unwanted \"offensive\" text message during an official college event from a man: \"I am not sure if you are dressing like in a night\\-club\".

The man's daily research and study was severely harmed because many are no longer willing to work with him.
