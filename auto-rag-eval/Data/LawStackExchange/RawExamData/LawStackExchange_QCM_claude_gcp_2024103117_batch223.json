This classification allows for more flexibility in the screening process. While certain questions might be considered discriminatory in a traditional employment context, they can be justified for focus groups as bona fide occupational qualifications. The purpose of these questions is to gather a representative sample of public opinion, which may require information about participants' demographics, beliefs, or voting history. This approach allows focus group organizers to create diverse and targeted groups for specific research purposes, even if the questions touch on potentially sensitive topics."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37268/what-are-the-implications-of-us-llc-state-and-foreign-entities", "docs_id": 37268, "title": "What are the implications of US LLC state and foreign entities?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say I'm a confetti enthusiast.

What if I were to design and build one myself to use in my own rig for profit?\n\nMy understanding of the purpose of patents is to prevent the loss of revenue caused by someone else undercutting the inventor, probably because the someone else doesn't have to make up the expense of inventing it.\nIn that framework, and given either of the situations above, it would certainly be a violation to sell it, because that customer might have bought it from the owner instead if there wasn't a cheaper option.\n\nBut if the available budget clearly does not allow purchasing from the owner, and thus the owner would not have had a sale anyway (we'd use a different design that is available more cheaply), is it okay to make one (or several) personally or in\\-house for personal or in\\-house use, with the caveat that it is illegal to sell until the patent runs out?\n\nOf course, we can't outsource the work because it would mean that *they* would be selling to *us* and thus violate the patent themselves.

What are the potential pitfalls of an external company being given confidential CVs that include private information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, candidates must receive transparent information about this.\n\nYour exact obligations depend on whether your company is acting as a data controller, or as a data processor on behalf of another data controller.\n\nData controller is whoever determines the purposes and means of processing. If you're working on behalf of candidates, you're likely a controller. If you're working on behalf of companies, you may be a controller or processor depending on further context.\n\nA **controller** is responsible for the compliance of all processing activities for which they determine the purposes, even if the activities are outsourced to another company.\n\nAs the controller, you are responsible for fulfilling data subject rights, in particular the right to transparent information under [Art 13 UK GDPR](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/13). Per Art 13(1\\)(e), this information must include \u201cthe recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any\u201d. Data processors working on your behalf are recipients. Information is typically provided via a privacy notice.\n\nAs a data controller, you are also responsible for ensuring the security and compliance of your processing activities, by determining and implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs). See Art 24 and 32\\. Such measures might include encryption, backup strategies, access controls, training and screening for staff, confidentiality agreements, and anything else. What is appropriate depends on the specific risks you face, the costs of implementing these measures, and on the state of the art. See also the [ICO guidance on security](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/).\n\nPer [Art 28(1\\) UK GDPR](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/28), if you engage an external company to process personal data on behalf of you, you will ensure that this external company provides \u201csufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures\u201d. Per Art 28(3\\), these sufficient guarantees must be based on an enforceable contract with the data processor (commonly called a Data Processing Agreement, DPA).\n\nA **processor** is primarily responsible for following the instructions of their controller, as laid down in the DPA pursuant to Art 28(3\\). Processors are not directly responsible for handling data subject rights, so they need not (and must not) provide their own privacy notice to data subjects. However, they must assist their controller as appropriate, for example by providing necessary information so that the controller can satisfy their responsibilities.\n\nWhen a processor wants to engage a sub\\-processor to further delegate processing activities, this must be done in accordance with Art 28\\. Specifically, the sub\\-processor must be bound by the same data protection obligations as you are, see Art 28(4\\). So you'd need to enter a processor\\-to\\-processor DPA.

As a data controller, the recruitment company has several key responsibilities under UK GDPR:\n\n1. They must provide transparent information to candidates (data subjects) about the recipients of their personal data, which includes the external CV formatting company (Art 13 UK GDPR).\n\n2. They need to have a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in place with the external company, as required by Art 28(3) UK GDPR.\n\n3.

They must ensure the external company provides \"sufficient guarantees\" to implement appropriate TOMs (Art 28(1) UK GDPR).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the obligation to inform is not dependent on the external company's location.

It ensures \"source\\-code\" level compatibility between operating systems and applications. It receives triple designation and its full text can be obtained from IEEE, ISO, and OpenGroup.\n\nFor logical reasons, many programming languages (Python for example) include modules whose name is \"posix\" (lower\\-case per identifier naming convention of respective languages). Even though these modules provide functionalities that are specified in the POSIX standard and claim obvious relationship to it, these modules and languages that provide them nonetheless don't infringe the POSIX trademark. So how is this possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A caveat to begin with: It's not definitive whether this particular use is or is not infringing, given that the circumstances haven't been tested in court.\n\nThe usual scope for this kind of thing is called \"nominative use\" or \"nominative fair use\" in the U.S. context. The Python developers are offering a software module so that Python programs, when run on POSIX systems, can make use of capabilities of those systems covered by the POSIX standard. They have named their module `posix` so that Python programmers will have a fighting chance of guessing what it does. (The official documentation does say you ought to prefer use of `os` instead, but let's ignore that wrinkle.) Likewise, other parts of the standard library contain trademarks of other companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, in relation to Python code which interacts with those companies' products. These are all internal to the Python codebase and documentation, are not distributed separately, and \"POSIX\" is not part of the name of any product or service offered by the Python Software Foundation. Python is using that word \"nominatively\", describing some aspect of Python which relates to POSIX but is not POSIX.\n\nThe module authors might consider it sensible to use the word \"POSIX\" in its name and documentation, for the reason that compatibility with POSIX is essential to its functionality. But the rightsholders might also object to its appearance as a bare word (as opposed to `posixinterface` or something), because they want to preserve the meaning of \"POSIX\" as referring to their specific standard, the commercial value of which depends on restricting which operating systems can describe themselves as POSIX\\-compatible.\n\nIn the U.S., circuit courts have taken slightly different directions in trying to carve out whether trademark use like this is OK. In the Second Circuit, there is a recent case about nominative fair use of a certification mark, [Int'l Info. Sys. Sec. Certification Consortium v. Sec. Univ., LLC, 823 F.3d 153 (2d Cir. 2016\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1735354.html). The plaintiff, (ISC)2, offers the mark \"CISSP\" for security professionals who have passed certain examinations that they administer. The defendant, SU, offered training classes where the instructor was described as a \"Master CISSP\", to which the plaintiff objected because consumers could be misled into thinking that (ISC)2 endorsed the classes, and their trademark was being diluted because \"Master CISSP\" is not a term they use. On appeal, the upper court found that for assessing consumer confusion, courts must consider the eight \"*Polaroid* factors\" (named for [Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1961\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&hl=en&as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&case=2293827617926067028&scilh=0) and rephrased in the judgement):\n\n> The eight factors are: (1\\) strength of the trademark; (2\\) similarity of the marks; (3\\) proximity of the products and their competitiveness with one another; (4\\) evidence that the senior user may \u201cbridge the gap\u201d by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged infringer's product; (5\\) evidence of actual consumer confusion; (6\\) evidence that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith; (7\\) respective quality of the products; and (8\\) sophistication of consumers in the relevant market.\n\nand also:\n\n> (1\\) whether the use of the plaintiff's mark is necessary to describe both the plaintiff's product or service and the defendant's product or service, that is, whether the product or service is not readily identifiable without use of the mark; (2\\) whether the defendant uses only so much of the plaintiff's mark as is necessary to identify the product or service; and (3\\) whether the defendant did anything that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the plaintiff holder, that is, whether the defendant's conduct or language reflects the true or accurate relationship between plaintiff's and defendant's products or services.\n\nOther circuit courts have adopted subtly different phrasings and this divergence has yet to be resolved by the Supreme Court or by Congress. Whether this standard is met in the example of this question is a matter for argument on the detailed facts.\n\nIn the EU, there is an explicit protection for this specific kind of use, by virtue of Article 14 of the latest trademark directive, [Directive 2015/2436 of 16 December 2015](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2436):\n\n> 1. A trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade:\n>   \n> ...  \n> \n> (c) the trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular, where the use of the trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts.\n> 2. Paragraph 1 shall only apply where the use made by the third party is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.\n\nThe `posix` library could be regarded as an \"accessory\" to a POSIX\\-compatible operating system, in this sense, but is nonetheless within scope if the word \"POSIX\" is essential to identify what the module does. A key case in the CJEU, concerning a previous version of the Directive but with the same provision, was [BMW Nederland BV v Deenik \\[1999] C\\-63/97](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-63/97), where a garage owner advertised himself as able to repair BMW cars, with \"BMW\" being a trademark of the complainants since 1930\\. The court held that so long as Deenik didn't imply that he had any commercial relationship or endorsement by BMW, he could reasonably use the term \"BMW\" as part of describing his services.\n\nAs with the U.S. system, whether there is actual infringement would depend on the precise situation, and the relevant factors end up being pretty similar.

I assume that this is actually a US bank, and not a Nigerian bank that you access from the US. However, there is no regulation that requires a bank to be able to handle mobile deposits. If the problem is just that you can't make online deposits, that is legally allowed. For example, my own bank did not have the facility for processing mobile deposits until a few years ago, and even now I have to use a smart phone to make such deposits (it is a traditional bank). The only way in which your situation would be legally problematic would be if your contract with the bank promises that you can make mobile deposits. You could reasonably argue that an 8 month delay in solving the problem was unreasonable.\n\nPresumably there is some benefit to maintaining this bank, one which you'd like to keep rather than closing the account and moving on.

Sorry, but that's just the way it is.\n\nFirst of all, it depends on whether there actually was a contract. Under the law, a contract does not need to be something written down and signed. If you have this conversation with someone:\n\n\"Hey, can you do \\[this job] for me?\"\n\n\"Sure, it'll run you about \\[cost].\"\n\n\"Great.\"\n\nYou have a contract, which may well be legally binding and enforceable in court.\n\nEven if, for whatever reason, there was no contract\\-\\-for instance, the person you talked to didn't actually work for the company s/he said s/he did\\-\\-there are legal doctrines that could give you some rights. They have names, depending on the jurisdiction and the facts, like \"quantum meruit,\" \"unjust enrichment,\" and \"implied contract.\"\n\nThese doctrines all say, basically, the same thing: if you didn't have a contract for some reason, but you still gave someone something of value, reasonably expecting to be paid, then they have to pay you.\n\nWhether these doctrines apply is going to depend on the facts of the specific case. For example, you can't paint someone's house secretly in the middle of the night without being asked, then demand payment. But if you're a painting contractor, he asks you to paint it, and he sees you painting it every day for a week, at the end of the week he can't say, \"I never signed anything, so I don't have to pay you anything.\"\n\nIf this situation applies to you, your best bet is to discuss it with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development company, CodeCrafters, was verbally asked by a client to develop a custom application. They discussed general requirements and a rough cost estimate, but no formal contract was signed. CodeCrafters completed the work over two months, with the client regularly checking in on progress. Upon completion, the client refuses to pay, citing the lack of a written contract. Which legal doctrine would most likely support CodeCrafters' claim for compensation?\n\nA) Statute of frauds\nB) Quantum meruit\nC) Res judicata\nD) Stare decisis\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B) Quantum meruit. This legal doctrine, along with similar concepts like \"unjust enrichment\" and \"implied contract,\" applies when services are provided without a formal contract, but there's a reasonable expectation of payment. In this scenario, although there was no written contract, there was a verbal agreement and ongoing communication, suggesting an implied contract. The client's regular check-ins also indicate awareness and tacit approval of the work being done. Quantum meruit allows for fair compensation based on the value of services provided, even in the absence of a formal contract.\n\nA) Statute of frauds is incorrect because it typically requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, which is not the issue here.\n\nC) Res judicata refers to a matter that has been adjudicated by a competent court and may not be pursued further by the same parties, which is not relevant to this scenario.\n\nD) Stare decisis is the principle of following precedents in legal cases, which, while important in law, doesn't directly address the issue of compensation for services rendered without a formal contract."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18157/have-there-ever-been-examples-of-public-schools-restriction-of-community-servic", "docs_id": 18157, "title": "Have there ever been examples of public school&#39;s restriction of community service being unlawful?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My school's community service policy (while ambiguous throughout the whole thing) Seems to me to discriminate against not only religions, but my religion specifically. The particular clause I'm referring to states:\n\n> Your community service project must benefit a *group, organization, or person* ***outside* of your household, immediate and extended family.** *Eagle Scout, Church\\-related or court\\-ordered* community service hours may **not** be used for this Project.   \n>   \n>  (Emphasis **not** mine)\n\nThe particular portion of this clause, the last part; \"*Eagle Scout, Church\\-related or court\\-ordered* community service hours may **not** be used for this Project.\" is what I'm at ends with. The project makes a specific statement to disallow all service associated with \"Churches\", in the same clause it refuses to accept projects being used for other purposes.\n\nAnd to add confusion to the mess, the phrase, IMHO is unnecessarily ambiguous, stating \"Church\\-Related\" instead of being specific as to what is and isn't allowed. I've asked my guidance counselors as to what is and isn't allowed in terms of this, and they said to ask my PE teacher, as they (as per stated) are in charge of the Volunteer Community Service Project (VCSP). My PE teacher told me they can clarify questions during a pre\\-approval phase for the project. As I understand it, that phase goes like this:\n\n* The student signs up for service or alerts the organization and receives permission to perform it.\n* The student goes to their PE teacher and asks if the project can be used for the VCSP\n* The student can ask questions about the VCSP (For some reason, only if they've already prepared a project)\n* The PE teacher either approves or denies the project, citing a reason if denied.\n\nThis whole process makes no sense to me and seems completely illogical, so I figured that before I schedule any more projects that I find out if there are cases of similar organizations to my school losing similar cases to this.\n\nSome Details\n------------\n\n* The school is a public school, Located in Rhode Island (United States)\n* The Project is required to graduate\n* To my knowledge, the school has never had problems with policies before\n* I am a minor\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Freedom of Religion Concerns**\n\nI doubt that this policy would be held to be unlawful on First Amendment freedom of religion grounds. Indeed, such requirements [usually exclude church\\-related service](http://www.coyotecommunications.com/stuff/community.html).\n\nAlso, I don't see how this policy discriminates against your religion specifically. It seems on its face to apply to all religions equally.\n\nEven if \"Church\\-related\" is read broadly to include both service that benefits a church, and also service that is organized by a church, that doesn't preclude you from coming up with some other kind of service that is neither of these things.\n\nWhy would you be prevented from coming up with service that is neither of these things when other students do not? \n\nUnless you have also undertaken Holy Orders or something, in which case 100% of your time away from school would be devoted to your church, it is hard to see what the problem would be with this requirement for you as opposed to someone else. And, it would probably be improper for a public school to allow you to use religious activities to satisfy a graduation requirement \\- that would sound like an establishment clause violation.\n\n[Some of the relevant U.S. Supreme Court cases](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/10-important-supreme-court-cases-about-education) are:\n\n> *Engel v.

The [opinion in this 2015 case](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2013/13SC233.pdf) reviews some of the relevant law. \n\nA critical portion of the analysis is that aid to religious institutions must be limited to institutions that do not discriminate on the basis of religion and that supporting religious institutions at the K\\-12 level is more of a concern than doing so at the higher educational level. A Church, however, would (and should) discriminate on the basis of religion. \n\n**In General**\n\nThere has been consideration of whether community service requirements, in general, are constitutional. Generally, [courts have upheld the programs](http://www.wright-house.com/ac/papers97/Parr-ac1.html). See also [here](http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/centers/childlaw/childed/pdfs/2011studentpapers/byrne_reading_writing.pdf).\n\nIn particular, Rhode Island is in the 1st Circuit of the federal courts, which has expressly ruled that community service requirements are constitutional.\n\nA [1999 law review article in the Duke Law Journal](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=lcp) considers the issue from several perspectives. So does a [1997 Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2033&context=llr) article. A 1916 case called *Butler v. Perry* is [a particularly strong precedent in favor of the proposition that mandatory service is constitutional](http://volokh.com/posts/1216846359.shtml), despite arguments to the contrary under the 13th Amendment.

Courts have generally upheld community service requirements for graduation. Excluding church-related activities applies equally to all religions and helps avoid potential Establishment Clause violations. The policy doesn't prevent students from participating in religious activities; it simply doesn't count them towards the school's service requirement. This approach aligns with legal precedents that aim to maintain separation of church and state in public education. Additionally, the policy allows for numerous non-religious service opportunities, making it non-discriminatory in practice."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22649/can-i-start-work-whilst-still-being-employed-by-another-company", "docs_id": 22649, "title": "Can I start work whilst still being employed by another company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently employed to Company A for 20 years in Texas.

The new company will not know I am doing this.\n\nCan I get in trouble legally or from the new company if I take the new job?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg890.pdf) is a **Federal law** requiring certain types of employers (e.g. those with more than 100 employees) to notify workers at least sixty days in advance of mass layoffs and plant closures. These terms are defined in the law. Since Texas does not provide supplementary protections in these circumstances, workers are protected only by the WARN Act.\n\n***The WARN Act does not prevent you from finding new employment since it does not contain provisions for compensation of workers***. If you continue to work for your company during the period of notification then you will continue to be paid for your work. Additionally, and as mentioned by Tim, a new employer will likewise pay you for time worked.\n\nSince it seems that you may be interested in concurrently holding the two positions, you will likely have to consider the following outside the scope of this question:\n\n1. **Do you intend to collect a severance?** The issue of severance is not governed by the federal WARN ACT. Employer policies and state law may be worth looking at here. The U.S. Federal Government makes no requirement that employers pay severance. By agreeing/signing to the terms of severance, you make your severance compensation conditional upon the terms of that agreement. These conditions might include a prohibition against concurrent employment elsewhere or, more narrowly, that you must meet basic attendance requirements. However, you are always entitled to payment for work performed, and your employer is required to provide you with your last paycheck. **Your union is a great resource.** If you have one a union steward, talk to him or her about the language in your company's severance agreement; they may have already paid a lawyer to examine various employer documents.\n2. **Will you be seeking [unemployment benefits](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/collecting-unemployment-benefits-texas-32500.html)?** Generally, you must be unemployed and seeking work to qualify for these benefits. Forms for application for unemployment benefits have strict language, making an easy perjury case in the event someone attempts to both collect wages and unemployment benefits.\n3. **Will you work both jobs for the duration of the WARN Act notice?** It does not appear that there would be any federal restriction on doing so. Again, your employer may have policies that restrict you from being concurrently employed elsewhere, and ***violating company policy could be grounds for termination outside WARN Act protection***. But this might not be worrisome for you, since you will already have another job. Remember that the WARN Act exists in part because employers know that by notifying workers, they invite the workers to leave in droves. You may find that your employer is happy to work with your new work schedule, while they struggle to keep their facility staffed. It is unclear what, if any, ramifications there would be for a facility that had too sparse a work force to continue safe operations, and whether this would re\\-classify the employer under the WARN Act exceptions for a faltering company.\n\nConsider getting the advice of a lawyer, and know that it's usually a good idea to keep records of agreements. **Document everything of concern.**", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee in Texas is notified of a mass layoff under the WARN Act.

As the sole copyright holder you would be able to license it however you want (*re*\\-licensing probably isn't the best term here).\n\nBut: are you sure that you are the sole copyright holder, and that your modified version is not a derivative work of the original in the sense of copyright law? It's not possible to answer that in a general way, as derivativeness is ultimately for a court to decide. I think you would have to completely rewrite every file of the project from scratch to effectively remove other people's code.\n\nAny edits you make do give you a copyright to your edits (assuming they rise to the level of copyrightability).

Having a small part of the copyright in the software is practically useless, and does not allow you to claim total ownership.\n\nSince the Apache license is a permissive open source license, software under this license can generally be used without having to relicense it.

When a developer modifies an existing open-source project under the Apache License, they gain copyright over their specific modifications, but this does not grant them full ownership or the right to relicense the entire project. The Apache License requires that modified files carry prominent notices stating the changes made. The developer's rights are limited to their own contributions, and they are still bound by the original license terms for the pre-existing code. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because making significant changes doesn't automatically grant full ownership or relicensing rights. \n\nAnswer B is partially correct about including notices, but too restrictive about relicensing possibilities.\n\nAnswer D is misleading because even a complete rewrite might still be considered a derivative work if the functionality closely mirrors the original, which could be subject to legal interpretation."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48642/is-it-lawful-to-charge-two-prices-based-on-customers-sex", "docs_id": 48642, "title": "Is it lawful to charge two prices based on customers&#39; sex?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a gym advertises fees for female customers as 7000/\\- LKR, but 12,000/\\-LKR for male customers.\n\nIs it okay to make advertisements like that under Sri Lankan law or is it sex discrimination?\n\nIf it is okay, then what laws apply?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As of 2017, Sri Lanka was a party to a treaty related to discrimination based upon sex, and the UN body charged to monitoring compliance with the treaty was in discussions with the Sri Lankan government regarding multiple issues related to this treaty, although apparently not the one identified in the question (at least, not obviously, although since the treaty is designed to prevent discrimination against women, in particular, it may not regulated isolated instances of discrimination in favor of women).\n\n> Sri Lanka\u2019s record on women\u2019s rights will be examined by the UN\n> Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)\n> on 22 February.

But that copyright can be sold or otherwise transferred. If the creator was a contractor, it is likely that the copyright was transferred to the client. If a business owns the copyright, and it is bought by another business, that copyright will most likely be transferred along with the rest of the business.\n\nThe copyright owner may also chose to grant permission to others to use the image in various ways. This is known as a *license*. The terms of the license can be pretty much anything that the copyright owner chooses to make them.\n\nWhen an image appears on a merchant website, it may be that the merchant owns the copyright, or that the manufacturer of the item pictured owns the copyright, and has licensed the image to the merchant for use in the catalog. It may even be that a third party owns the copyright, and has licensed the image to the merchant, directly or via the manufacturer. \n\nIn any case, by displaying the image on the catalog site, the merchant has given visitors permission to view the image, and probably to download copies for personal use. But unless there is an explicit grant of additional permissions, a user may not re\\-use the image in any other way. This would include distributing it to others, creating modified versions of the image, or combining it with other images.\n\nIn addition to being protected by copyright, the image may possibly be a trademark, used to identify the product it represents. This is more likely for product or business logos, and less likely for simple pictures of a product, but it is possible in either case.\n\nIf an image is also a trademark, it may not be used to advertise or indicate the source of goods or services without permission from the trademark holder, and it may not be used to indicate or imply any endorsement or association between the trademark holder or the maker of the product and the person using the image, without permission.\n\nThere are limited exceptions to copyright. In the US *Fair use* applies. This is for comment on or reference to the copyrighted work, or for limited use of it, particularly for \"transformative use\" this is different from the original use. It is more likely to apply for non\\-commercial use, but can apply to some commercial uses.

They didn't mention to the client verbally once that there might be no change and assured the client that the procedure they were recommending would definitely help with addressing the areas the client was concerned with. They did however say that the client would need a 're\\-treat' 4 weeks after initial procedure to touch up. This would cost a minimum of \u00a3500 although likely more and would have involved more of the same treatment. The client however didn't attend this as the client had seen zero impact from the first round of treatment and did not want to spend more on a treatment that had already cost so much and resulted in no change. The client also saw a review somebody had left for the clinic, who had had the same treatment, seen no results, paid more at the clinic's recommendation of more of the same treatment, still seen no results, paid more, still not results etc. The client did not want to have same experience.\n\nHowever, the clinic is now saying that, because the full treatment was not completed (the post 4 week 're\\-treat'), the results will have been affected and they cannot judge the treatment effectively. However, after just 2\\-3 weeks, once the swelling subsided, it was already clear there had been no improvement. They are also saying that 'there is a considered understanding, that there will be a 40% drop after the first treatment and this has been communicated with you.' The procedure was a 'thread lift' wherein temporary sutures are used to produce a subtle but visible \"lift\" in the skin. This is supposed to last up to 2 years. This '40% drop' was not communicated to the client during the consultation or procedure, or anywhere in the consent form. Furthermore, any 'lift' that was seen beyond the immediate swelling was gone within 3 weeks.\n\nThey offered the treatment within an hour of the client's initial consultation, really not giving time to think it through or research the producedure. The client rather based the decision on what they were saying about the procedure (which was that it would definitely address the client's concerns).\n\nSo my question is \\- with these clauses being present in the consent form, is there any point in pursuing a claim? As mentioned above, I've been told that it is 'arguable that those warranties are legally enforceable for the clinic, especially as this is a business to consumer contract.' The client is wary of adding more legal costs to the already large amount spent at the clinic if it is likely the claim has no weight in court due to the consent form.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Would a claim be worth pursuing when the client has signed these clauses?\n\nAltogether it appears that the client (you) would prevail.\n\n[Section 57 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/57) largely renders null and void the no\\-warranty clause. The absolute lack of improvement from the procedure makes it quite a stretch for the clinic to allege that its qualified representations trigger section 50(2\\)(a). To avail itself of [section 50](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/50)(2\\)(b), the no\\-warranty clause ought to be clear enough about the possibility that the procedure might bring no improvement *at all*. That is because no reasonable person would enter a contract and spend \u00a34,000 without expecting at least some improvement. It was the clinic's responsibility to make a disclaimer of that sort, and instead the clinic \"*assured the client that the procedure they were recommending would **definitely** help with addressing the areas the client was concerned with*\" (emphasis added).\n\n> They offered the treatment within an hour of the client's initial consultation, really not giving time to think it through or research\n\nThat argument would be unavailing. Your description gives no indication that the clinic indulged in *harassment, coercion or undue influence*. See [Part 2 of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1277/part/2).

The consent form included clauses stating \"no warranty or guarantee of specific results\" and that the desired improvement may not be achieved. The clinic verbally assured the client of definite improvement during consultation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the client's potential claim against the clinic?\n\nA) The client has no basis for a claim due to the disclaimers in the consent form.\nB) The client can only claim if they completed the full treatment, including the \"re-treat\" session.\nC) The client likely has a strong case based on the Consumer Rights Act 2015, despite the consent form clauses.\nD) The client's claim is weakened because they didn't take time to research the procedure before agreeing to it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Despite the disclaimers in the consent form, the client likely has a strong case based on the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Section 57 of this Act largely nullifies the no-warranty clause in consumer contracts. The complete lack of improvement, combined with the clinic's verbal assurances of definite results, strengthens the client's position. The Act places responsibility on the business to make clear disclaimers, especially for outcomes as drastic as no improvement at all for a \u00a34,000 procedure. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Consumer Rights Act 2015 often overrides such disclaimers in consumer contracts. \nOption B is incorrect as the client saw no results even before the \"re-treat\" session was due, and shouldn't be required to spend more money on an ineffective treatment. \nOption D is incorrect because while the client's quick decision might not have been ideal, it doesn't legally weaken their claim, as the clinic didn't engage in harassment or coercion."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38827/right-to-be-forgotten-denied-due-to-insufficient-identification", "docs_id": 38827, "title": "&#39;Right to be forgotten&#39; denied due to insufficient identification", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I registered for a free online service with fake data while being underage.\nYears later I request to have the account deleted, using the e\\-mail address I registered with.

That sentence has caused a lot of confusion:\n\n* \u201call reasonable\u201d: does this mean all measures the controller can be reasonably burdened with, or all measures that are necessary for identifying the data subject with reasonable certainty?\n* \u201cidentity\u201d: does that mean the identity of a natural person, or just a check that the person exercising their data subjects rights is identical with the data subject?\n\nSo depending on how the company interprets this, there is a lot of leeway regarding which info may be requested from you. In general, being able to log in to the service should be all that is necessary (compare also Recital 57\\).\n\nNote that the company doesn't just have to satisfy your data subject rights, they also have to protect your data against unauthorized access. Giving an attacker access just because they control a particular email address might not be secure enough (but is in practice because the attacker could use a password\\-reset functionality to get the full credentials anyway).\n\nYou do not lose your data subject rights if you used pseudonymous/fake data: the service may still contain other personal data regarding you, for example usage profiles. You are still a data subject. Pseudonyms can also be identifying data, e.g. Art 4(1\\) calls online handles out as a kind of personal data. However, this does lead to complications with companies that interpret identity verification as ensuring that the person making a request is a particular natural person.\n\nIf the controller isn't sure about your identity, they can request additional information (Art 12(6\\)). If the data subject cannot be identified, the data subject rights do not apply (Art 11(2\\)). However, that describes a subtly different scenario: that the data held by the controller lacks identifying data.\n\nYou do have a right to access and a right to rectification (correcting the data they hold about you). However, they require the exact same identity verification as the right to erasure.\n\nThat you were underage at the time of account creation is likely irrelevant now, if the data in the account doesn't indicate your true age. Unless the subject matter of the online service makes an age restriction necessary, the relevant age limits are 13\\-16 years (Art 8 GDPR, subject to EU member state laws) or 13 years (COPPA, U.S.).\n\nIf you believe you have provided all data that is reasonably necessary to verify your identity and your data subject rights are denied to you, you can issue a complaint with your local data protection authority. In Germany, each Bundesland has their own Datenschutzbeauftragte agency.\n\nBelow, relevant GDPR excerpts used in this answer. \u201cErasure\u201d is Art 17 but Art 12 covers modalities for exercise of data subject rights.

According to Pennsylvania law, trespass occurs when someone remains in a place after being asked to leave.

In this case, whether the men were trespassing hinges on whether the condition for staying (i.e., making a purchase) was lawful and applied equally to all customers regardless of race. If the condition was \"buy something or leave\" and this was applied to all customers, it could be considered lawful.

Different rules apply to private practices than public clinics and hospitals. I will assume that the clinic on campus is private. This is a summary of the summary about who your information can be shared with:\n\n1. Health care professionals can share information within your \"circle of care\". Specifically, they are allowed to assume your consent to this but you can explicitly withdraw that consent. This would include doctors within the same practice.\n2. Admin staff can access your information for administrative purposes.\n3. Anyone you have authorised them to share it with e.g. relatives, friends etc.\n4. The Medical Services Plan for billing and admin\n5. If you are unable to drive\n6. If there is suspected of child abuse\n7. If you are wounded by a gun or a knife\n8.

Notwithstanding, councillors are not doctors and are governed by the everyday laws related to confidentiality i.e. information given in confidence is confidential and everything else isn't. If you are *told* the limits of the confidentiality i.e. they tell the doctor, then those are the limits unless you renegotiate them.\n\n> he would know I only have one kidney?\n\nWell you said \"the counselling department can share information with the doctors\" and this would require the information going the other way i.e. the doctor sharing with the councillor. Even if this type of sharing was OK in general (and I'm not sure it is, see above); the information shared should only be what is required for the councillor to do their job \\- the number of kidneys you have is probably irrelevant to this.\n\n> What laws apply to situations like this where confidential information in one entity (medical office) decides to share it without the consent of the patients to another entity (the counselling dept.)?\n\nWell, we are not sure there are 2 entities: legally there may only be 1 \\- the university.

The counseling department's role in course selection does not necessarily place it within the student's \"circle of care\" for medical purposes. Additionally, sharing medical information (such as having one kidney) is not relevant or necessary for course selection advice.

In the US, copyright is generally not allowed to stop you from doing something. If I were to write a Java program that can be expected to use existing Java libraries, or a library that can be expected to be used by existing Java programs, the API copyright would not matter because that would prevent anyone from writing Java programs or libraries without Oracle's permission.\n\nGoogle was at least alleged to be doing something different on Android, so Android Java programs would not be expected to use standard Java APIs, and Android libraries would not be expected to be used by standard Java programs, and in that case Google would be infringing on Oracle's copyright. The allegation was that Google just took the language and API because they were already familiar to programmers, who wouldn't have to learn something new in order to program for Android. The language is free to implement, but the APIs aren't necessarily. (I don't know how the case turned out, since I stopped following after the appeals court ruled on the law.)\n\nYou appear to be writing a library so you have the same functionality with additional language bindings, but using the same API.

The key point is that in the US, copyright law generally doesn't prevent the creation of compatible implementations. If existing programs that use the original API can also use the reimplemented version, it's likely to be considered legal. This is because preventing such implementations would effectively prevent anyone from creating compatible software without the original copyright holder's permission.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply changing the programming language doesn't determine legality. Option B is incorrect because the impact or scale of the project doesn't affect the copyright implications.

By \"enforceable\", I mean that appropriate law boards in a state have the power to penalize (including officially reprimand) an attorney for violation of rules. I don't want to limit this to just formal demand letters (unless there's a rule against communication with third parties not via formal demand).\n\nI presume that if a claim has legal merit, the attorney can represent to the third party that a lawsuit may arise if the situation is not remedied. My interest is the situation where this is not true, and I am specifically interested in established legal principles. [ABA Model Rule 3\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_1_meritorious_claims_contentions.html) is related:\n\n> A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or\n>  controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact\n>  for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith\n>  argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A\n>  lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent\n>  in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless\n>  so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case\n>  be established\n\nHere is a hypothetical example. A sells widget X; B has some belief of a property interest in widget X (by patent, contract, or whatever); B's attorney \"knows\" that B's claimed interest is not going to succeed in court, because (if the basis is a contract) there is actually no contract between A and B. The attorney might run into legal problems if he files a meritless suit against A, but could sanctions be imposed for simply implying in a letter that the client may pursue a (meritless) lawsuit?\n\nOne part of the rule (which isn't clearly applicable to letters, anyhow) is where it says \"includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law\". This strikes me as a large escape clause allowing attorneys to contradict established law, if they think they can make a case for the contradiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main limitations on sending demand letters against the bona fide target of the demand (one can imagine sending a demand letter to someone who isn't a true target of the demand as a sneaky way to engage in defamation or to violate privacy laws but that doesn't seem to be the context here), do not arise from the professional ethics of an attorney, although attorneys are ethically forbidden in communications with third parties from [making statements of fact that are actually false](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_1_truthfulness_in_statements_to_others.html) (Rule of Professional Conduct 4\\.1\\) or [misleading someone into thinking that they are their attorney](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_3_dealing_with_unrepresented_person.html) (Rule of Professional Conduct 4\\.3\\). Actually, the model rule 4\\.1, is broad enough to cover your scenario: \n\n> In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:\n>  (a) make a false statement of material fact or law to a third\n>  person\\[.]\n\nBut, not all states adopt the false statement of law standard at all, and those that do often apply it leniently. The official comments to that rule doesn't add any clarity regarding the question of what constitutes a false statement of law. This is observed in an extended analysis of how Rule 4\\.1 has played out in practice [here](https://law.yale.edu/system/files/documents/pdf/Intellectual_Life/Hinshaw_AttorneyNegEethics.pdf).\n\n> Misrepresentation\n> \n> \n> [1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_1_truthfulness_in_statements_to_others.html) A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n>  client\u2019s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n>  opposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if the\n>  lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that the\n>  lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by partially\n>  true but misleading statements or omissions that are the equivalent of\n>  affirmative false statements. For dishonest conduct that does not\n>  amount to a false statement or for misrepresentations by a lawyer\n>  other than in the course of representing a client, see Rule 8\\.4\\.\n> \n> \n> Statements of Fact\n> \n> \n> [2](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_3_dealing_with_unrepresented_person.html) This Rule refers to statements of fact. Whether a particular\n>  statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the\n>  circumstances. Under generally accepted conventions in negotiation,\n>  certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of\n>  material fact. Estimates of price or value placed on the subject of a\n>  transaction and a party\u2019s intentions as to an acceptable settlement of\n>  a claim are ordinarily in this category, and so is the existence of an\n>  undisclosed principal except where nondisclosure of the principal\n>  would constitute fraud. Lawyers should be mindful of their obligations\n>  under applicable law to avoid criminal and tortious misrepresentation.\n\nRule of Professional Conduct 3\\.1 which is referenced in your question, does not apply to demand letters.\n\nInstead, the main limitations arise from the [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Debt_Collection_Practices_Act), which prohibits debt collectors (a term of art that includes most attorneys) from making false or misleading statements to collect a debt, or attempting to collect a debt that is not due, and also imposes other restrictions related to demand letters.\n\nA recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving a zombie debt claim in bankruptcy ([Midland Funding v. Johnson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-348_h315.pdf)), which held that it was not wrongful to make a claim for a debt that the creditor knew was long ago barred by the statute of limitations in a bankruptcy case (since that is only an affirmative defense to the debt that might be otherwise owed) somewhat limits the application of what would be false, however. But, the fact that Midland Funding was decided on a 5\\-3 basis by the U.S. Supreme Court illustrates how controversial the legal limitations on making claims that are arguably false statements of law can be.\n\nThere are also some state deceptive trade practices laws (and the mail fraud statute combined with RICO) that have been used to punish attorneys he make unjustified demand letters in support of invalid patent claims. This approach has not had consistent success, however, with [a 2014 case on that theory dismissed](https://www.law360.com/articles/539450/judge-dismisses-rico-claims-against-patent-troll-lumen), for example, although the complaining company [later won their case on a different theory](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/graphiq-finally-beats-patent-troll-will-get-100k-payment/). Some states have specifically amended their laws to make sending a demand letter related to an invalid patent an actionable deceptive trade practices.

It can and does happen on a regular basis, although a seven year old is at the very lower end of the range at which children are called to testify as witnesses with any regularity.\n\nAny witness which a court determines is competent to testify, which includes many, but not all, minors, testifies under oath.\n\nSome jurisdictions have a hard and fast minimum age at which someone can be competent to testify (often age seven is the minimum), while other states make it a rule of reason for the court to evaluate on a case by case basis.\n\nChild testimony can be used in any kind of case, not just sex offenses against children or child abuse and neglect cases, although those cases are the kind of cases where child testimony is most common.\n\n### Special Arrangements Sometimes Made For Child Testimony\n\nWhile special arrangements for the form and circumstances of that testimony can sometimes be ordered by a court (sometimes raising constitutional issues regarding whether the \"[confrontation clause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4212261/)\" right of a criminal defendant is violated in a criminal case under U.S. Constitutional law), the default rule is that a minor testifies in the same manner as anyone else.\n\nOften the exact wording of the oath is changed when a child can't reasonable be expected to understand the normal wording.\n\n### Perjury In Cases Of Child Testimony Under Oath\n\nIf the person testifying under oath is a minor, a perjury offense would be presumptively tried in juvenile court rather than an adult criminal court.\n\nAlso, it is possible that even if a child is sworn and testifying under oath, that a child will not be old enough to prosecute for the crime of perjury, even in juvenile court, if the child intentionally commits perjury.\n\nAn oath has symbolic value and is believed by many people to have an effect, even when there is no credible threat of a perjury prosecution for lying under oath.\n\nIn practice, perjury prosecutions, even for adults, for court testimony, are vanishingly rare even in pretty clear cases, even though the crime is committed basically every day that courts are open for business.\n\nFor example, there are dozens of such prosecutions a year in Colorado including both in court and out of court sworn statements, and there are tens of thousands of evidentiary hearings and evidentiary trials each year in Colorado, or which perjury is actually committed in perhaps 5%\\-10% of such hearings and trials.\n\nAlternatives To Child Testimony Under Oath\n==========================================\n\n### Evidence Of Unsworn Out Of Court Statements Made By Children\n\nIt is also possible for things that a minor says to be recounted by someone who heard them said or a transcript of a conversation with someone that was not under oath (in which case it is hearsay, but may come within an exception to the hearsay rule), or via a videotape of a child saying something (which is a record to be authenticated prior to its admission). But, in both of those cases, what the child says that the court considers as evidence is not testimony.\n\n### Interviews In Chambers Of Children\n\nAnother process by which courts obtain information from children, often in child custody cases, is for the judge to personally interview the children, not under oath and not with testimony taken down by a court reporter, either in or outside the presence of counsel for the parties (and almost always not in the presence of parents or any audience present at a hearing) in the judges chambers.\n\nThis is primarily done not to elicit evidence of facts, per se, so much as to discern the preferences, desires and concerns of the children themselves as expressed directly. Statements of preferences, desires and opinions of children, because they are not statements of fact and are instead statements of opinion, are by definition not capable of being prosecuted for perjury, since their truth or falsity is not objectively determinable.\n\nThese interviews are given more weight in the case of older children than in the case of younger children and this process would not be used at all for infants or pre\\-schoolers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about child testimony in American courts is NOT correct?\n\nA) Children as young as seven years old can sometimes testify under oath in court.\nB) Special arrangements, such as modified oath wording, can be made for child witnesses.\nC) Perjury prosecutions for child witnesses are common and routinely pursued in juvenile court.\nD) Judges may interview children in chambers without putting them under oath in some cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is correct.

This is within the U.S. and the organization is events and adventures.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Trademarks are all about customer confusion. The ruling factor is: is a reasonable person likely to confuse the thing with the trademark holder's thing?\n\nHowever, you're allowed to be *referential* \\- for instance say you have a group for former Microsoft employees. You aren't prohibited from using the term Microsoft. You have a practical reason since it defines what your group is. Calling themselves \"Angry Microsoft Expats\" isn't likely to be confused with official Microsoft (even if Microsoft may not be amused), but calling themselves \"Microsoft Exit\" \\- *see, that kind of sounds like a product*.\n\nBut here's the thing. A lot of people get confused by free speech. If the site **stores** content (words, sounds, images, video, haptics) *free speech does not exist*. What exists is **freedom of the press**, which is enjoyed by **them who own a press**. It's like that. You have no rights. Facebook can put up or delete anything they please, for any reason or no reason at all (e.g. sales rep says \"customer will do an ad buy if we delete it\").\\*\n\nIf you don't like that, you can get your own press for $17\\.99 at GoDaddy.\n\n\\* Except for a very narrow list of reasons such as \"you are black\", but even this has constraints.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Facebook group for former employees of a company called \"TechInnovate\" is considering changing its name due to trademark concerns.

This name is least likely to face trademark infringement issues because:\n\n1. It clearly indicates that the group is for former employees, reducing the likelihood of confusion with the official company.\n2. It uses the company name in a referential manner, which is generally allowed when describing the nature of the group.\n3. It doesn't imply any official association or endorsement from TechInnovate.\n4. The term \"Professionals\" is generic and doesn't suggest a specific product or service offered by TechInnovate.\n\nOption A could be mistaken for an official alumni network run by the company. Option C might be confused with an official career service provided by TechInnovate. Option D, similar to the example in the documentation, could sound like a product or service offered by the company.\n\nIt's important to note that while this name is less likely to face trademark issues, Facebook as a platform retains the right to moderate content and group names as they see fit, regardless of trademark law."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19579/hoa-and-trampoline-safety-net", "docs_id": 19579, "title": "HOA and trampoline safety net", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live (rent) a condo where every back yard is approx. 14 x 20 feet. Each back yard has a fence that's 6 feet high or so. I put up a trampoline in the back yard but the safety net is over the height of the fence. The HOA has a rule that I can not have anything taller than the fence. \n\nThere are some exceptions to the rule of having something taller than the fence (e.g umbrella, trees). I asked for an exception for the safety net and was denied and was instructed to take it down. I was told that the trampoline itself is not a violation. The safety net is 95% see through. \n\nIt's clearly an attempt to persuade me to remove the trampoline all together. Again the trampoline itself is not considered a violation.\n\nThere have been noise complaints. The kids get loud sometimes. This is not a violation of any rules either.\n\nIt is possible for me to take the net down and put it back up when the kids want to jump. It's a bit of a pain in the butt though. Each time I put it back when the kids want to jump. I get a message from the HOA to take it down\u2026 which I do.\n\nMy girlfriend doesn't want me to remove it completely for safety. I'm at a point where I want to remove it completely though.\n\n1. If I remove the net and someone gets hurt, can I sue the HOA?\n2. Can I fight the HOA as a renter? Can I be evicted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer depends in part on your relationship to the HOA, and your lease. Normally, you would have no direct relationship to the HOA, instead your legal relationship is with the owner (who has a relationship to the HOA). The owner of the condo has a legal obligation to follow certain rules, the violation of which will result in a penalty (imposed on him). You presumably are leasing the place from an owner, so the HOA won't impose any penalty on you, since you have no direct connection with the HOA. You then have to look at your rental agreement, to see what obligations were stated, whereby you have to follow the HOA rules. If there is a clause that says \"You must follow the rules\", then if you don't, it's possible you can be evicted by the owner. If there isn't such a clause, the owner would suffer the consequences of your rule\\-breaking.\n\nYou can try to sue the HOA if someone gets hurt, but that would be a waste of your time and money since the suit would be dismissed (the HOA is not responsible for injuries that you are legally responsible for). Whether or not you *should* try such a lawsuit is between you and your attorney. You can try to fight the HOA (politically), within limits, e.g. by writing letters, or speaking to the HOA or board of directors, as long as they allow it (since you aren't a homeowner, they don't have to listen to you). Again, whether you should do this is between you and your attorney, and anyhow that's not a legal question. You could not, however, sue the HOA to force them to change the rules.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A renter in a condo complex has installed a trampoline with a safety net that exceeds the height limit set by the HOA. The HOA has denied an exception request and instructed the renter to remove the net. If the renter complies but a child is subsequently injured while using the trampoline without the safety net, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal action?\n\nA) The renter can successfully sue the HOA for damages, as their denial of the safety net directly led to the injury.\n\nB) The HOA can be held liable for the injury because they enforced a rule that compromised safety.\n\nC) The renter cannot sue the HOA successfully, as the HOA is not responsible for injuries the renter is legally responsible for.\n\nD) The renter can sue the HOA, but only if they can prove the HOA acted in bad faith when denying the exception request.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the HOA is not responsible for injuries that the renter is legally responsible for. The renter's attempt to sue the HOA in this situation would likely be dismissed, as the HOA's enforcement of its rules does not transfer liability for injuries occurring on private property to the HOA. The renter remains responsible for ensuring the safety of those using the trampoline, regardless of the HOA's rules. Options A and B incorrectly assume the HOA can be held liable for the injury, which is not supported by the given information. Option D suggests a possible avenue for legal action, but this is also not supported by the provided information and would likely not change the fundamental lack of HOA liability for injuries on private property."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51335/online-version-of-the-risk-board-game", "docs_id": 51335, "title": "Online version of the &quot;Risk&quot; board game", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in the process of creating an online version of a popular board game.

What are the risks I would incur if I decide to make it publicly available?\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This question si diffent from \"[Does reproducing a board game as a video game violate copyright?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8687/does-reproducing-a-board-game-as-a-video-game-violate-copyright?noredirect=1&lq=1)\" since it is specific to the game of Risk.\nMoreover, it explicitely asks about the legal consequences arising from distributing such an online game.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Intellectual property law varies considerably by jurisdiction, and doesn't just involve copyright, but also trademarks, and patents. \n\nThe first problem you are going to run into is that \"Risko!\" is probably protected as a commercial trademark rather than copyright. In the US at least, making [minor changes to a trademark generally doesn't get you off the hook for unlicensed use](http://seattletrademarklawyer.com/blog/2018/8/16/minor-changes-to-a-trademark-usually-dont-avoid-a-likelihood.html). The owner of the \"Risko!\" trademark could bring suit against you for trademark infringement and it would be up to a judge or possibly a jury to decide whether \"Risko\" is different enough from \"Risko!\" that confusion would be unlikely. If they won the suit they could collect damages and their legal costs.\n\n[There was a protracted and important trademark lawsuit in the US over the names \"Monopoly\" and \"Anti\\-Monopoly\" for board games](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2014-15/march-april/not-playing-around-board-games-intellectual-property-law/). An economist, [Ralph Anspach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Anspach), had introduced a game he called \"Anti\\-monopoly\". He was sued by the Parker Brothers company for infringing on their trademark for \"Monopoly\". After 10 years the US Supreme Court ruled in Anspach's favor, finding that \"Monopoly\" had become a generic term for a type of board game and was no longer a valid trademark.\n\nYou can't necessarily count on being \"small potatoes\" so that they'll simply ignore your possible infringement. In US law, [failure to enforce their trademark rights can lead to the loss of trademark rights and remedies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverherzfeld/2013/02/28/failure-to-enforce-trademarks-if-you-snooze-do-you-lose/#3545351d6c22), so companies are less likely to let minor infringements slide. The situation in Italy may be different.\n\nYour artwork and graphical components are another potential problem. Those probably are covered by copyright. Again, the holder of the copyright for the \"Risko!\" artwork could sue you for violating their copyright on the artwork. A judge or jury would then evaluate whether your artwork was \"derivative\" of the \"Risko!\" artwork. If the court finds that your artwork is derivative, you might have to pay damages and legal costs.\n\nThere are actually a ton of Risk inspired games already available online, but they seem to stay away from names that sounds anything like \"Risk\" and anything that looks like the Risk artwork.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer creates an online version of a popular board game, changing the name slightly and creating similar but independently produced graphics. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal risks?\n\nA) The developer is safe from legal action as long as the game is free to play.\nB) The developer only needs to worry about copyright infringement for the game rules.\nC) The developer faces potential legal risks related to trademark infringement, copyright infringement of artwork, and possibly patent infringement.\nD) The developer can avoid all legal risks by making minor changes to the game's name and artwork.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The developer faces multiple potential legal risks:\n\n1. Trademark infringement: Even with slight changes to the game's name, the trademark owner could sue for infringement if the names are deemed too similar and likely to cause confusion.\n\n2. Copyright infringement of artwork: Although the graphics were independently produced, if they are very similar to the original game's artwork, they could be considered derivative works and infringe on the original copyright.\n\n3. Patent infringement: While not explicitly mentioned in the passage, board games can sometimes be patented, adding another potential area of legal risk.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because being free to play does not protect against intellectual property infringement.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it overlooks the significant risks related to trademark and artwork copyright.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because minor changes do not guarantee protection from legal action, especially in trademark cases where likelihood of confusion is a key factor."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25536/why-arent-foreign-vpn-companies-forced-to-keep-logs", "docs_id": 25536, "title": "Why aren&#39;t foreign VPN companies forced to keep logs?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [This](https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-logs-lies/) link explains the inconsistency with what VPN services consider **'logging'**. Certainly, there is no way for us to verify their claims without an extremely rigorous independent audit. But even that can be sabotaged.\n\nRegardless though, many VPN service providers vehemently claim that they do not keep logs. An example is NordVPN, which is based in Panama and so there is no domestic legislation that forces it to keep logs:\n\n[NordVPN Privacy Policy:](https://nordvpn.com/privacy-policy/)\n\n> \"Our top priority is customer data security. Operating under the\n>  jurisdiction of Panama allows us to guarantee our no logs policy,\n>  which means that your activities while using the privacy solutions\n>  created by NordVPN.com are not monitored, recorded, logged, stored or\n>  passed to any third party.\"\n\nWhat I do not understand is companies like NordVPN have hundreds of servers around the world, most of which are not in the country that they are originally based in. Surely, no\\-logging is impossible for most of their servers? Or are companies compelled to log depending on where they are based? So US legislation would not apply to a VPN server in the US which is run by a company based in Hong Kong \\- but this doesn't make sense \\- wouldn't US legislation apply to them regardless of where they are based? \n\n[This link](https://www.bestvpn.com/best-hong-kong-vpn/) says, again, that one of the pros of VPN servers being based in Hong Kong is that companies are not compelled to keep logs (I assume this is in contrast with servers in the US and other countries):\n\n> \"There are no mandatory data retention laws in Hong Kong. Most Hong\n>  Kong\\-based providers offer a \u201cno logs\u201d service, and international\n>  companies are not required to keep logs relating to their Hong Kong\n>  servers (although some companies, notably US based ones, choose to do\n>  so).\"\n\nSurely legislation does not discriminate based on where a company is based? Eg. all companies that operate in the UK are forced to abide by the Data Protection Act (DPA). Whether or not they are based in the UK does not matter. As long as the data that that company possesses remains in the UK, it has to be treated in compliance with UK law.\n\nAlso, why would US companies with servers in Hong Kong willingly keep logs if the law is not forcing them to? Sounds like a great marketing tool if they were able to claim they intentionally choose not to log. \n\nMy assumption here is that any legislation regarding mass surveillance of private citizens is followed by companies the same as legislation regarding anything else (DPA, legislation about the treatment of employees, etc.). Chinese companies with offices in the UK cannot treat their employees according to Chinese law, so why does are they allowed to treat legislation pertaining to internet traffic differently?\n\nAs for who would do the forcing, the local governments. Eg. the US government, that passes mass\\-surveillance legislation. If the US government argues they need logs to keep track of the movements of criminals and especially terrorists, wouldn't a company saying \"we do not keep logs by choice\" be condemned as impeding government counter\\-terrorism efforts? If the law requires all VPN servers in the US to keep logs, wouldn't a company not keeping logs be in violation of the law and hence 'criminal'?\n\nIf it's a legal loophole, it sounds like a dumb loophole if politicians are trying to claim they need logs to track down criminals (including terrorists), while allowing VPN providers to not keep logs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is tied up in the concept of [sovereignty](http://nationalunitygovernment.org/pdf/Sovereignty-Guidelines-Alessandro-Pelizzon.pdf) \\- nation states have control over their territories and citizens and they recognise the right of other nation states to do likewise. \n\nThe USA, China (Hong Kong) and Panama are all sovereign states, they each decide what the law is within their own territory and they can\u2019t tell each other what to do; they can *ask*, however, that\u2019s what diplomats *do*.\n\nIf a HK domiciled company provides HK based servers then they have to comply with HK law irrespective of where their customers are located. The USA could pass a law requiring US companies (like ISPs) to keep logs of traffic to and from HK servers but they cannot force a HK company to do *anything*, unless and until it operates in a place where the US has jurisdiction which means both the right *and* the ability to enforce their law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A VPN company based in Panama operates servers in multiple countries, including the United States.

A VPN company based in Panama would need to comply with the laws of each country where it operates servers. For servers located in the US, US laws would apply, regardless of where the company is headquartered. The company's Panama registration doesn't exempt it from following local laws in other countries where it has physical infrastructure. Similarly, Panama's laws wouldn't extend to servers located in other sovereign nations."}}
