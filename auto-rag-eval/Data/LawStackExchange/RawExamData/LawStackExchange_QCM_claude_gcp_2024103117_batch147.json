So your slide example is not theft. However, they specifically excluded such a requirement from the motor vehicle theft statute.\n\nIf you drove it on a public road, then you may have committed a few traffic violations as well:\n\n* The vehicle's registration is presumably expired, so you violated [CRS 42\\-3\\-121(1\\)(a)](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2022/title-42/article-3/part-1/section-42-3-121/).\n* If any of its required safety equipment is not working (all lights and signals, brakes, mirrors, horn, seat belts, etc, as well as a muffler) then you are in violation of [CRS 42\\-4\\-202(1\\)](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2022/title-42/article-4/part-2/section-42-4-202/).\n* The vehicle is presumably not insured, so you violated [42\\-4\\-1409(2\\)](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2022/title-42/article-4/part-14/section-42-4-1409/). You might think your own auto insurance policy covers you when you drive another vehicle, but if it's like my policy, this clause only applies when you drive it \"with the express or implied permission of the owner, and within the scope of that permission\".\n* If the dump truck has a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) over 26,000 pounds, then it is a commercial motor vehicle under [CRS 42\\-2\\-402(4\\)(a)(I)](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2022/title-42/article-2/part-4/section-42-2-402/), and under [42\\-2\\-404(1\\)](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2022/title-42/article-2/part-4/section-42-2-402/) you need a commercial driver's license to operate it, which you presumably don't have.

The truck's starter solenoid is easily accessible, and John starts it using a screwdriver. He drives it around for a few minutes and then adds some diesel to the tank before leaving it where he found it. Which combination of charges would John most likely face under Colorado law?\n\nA) Aggravated motor vehicle theft in the second degree and driving without insurance\nB) General theft and driving an unregistered vehicle\nC) Aggravated motor vehicle theft in the second degree, driving an unregistered vehicle, driving without insurance, and potentially operating a commercial vehicle without a proper license\nD) Trespassing and vandalism\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most comprehensive and accurate based on the information provided. \n\nAggravated motor vehicle theft in the second degree applies because John knowingly obtained control over the motor vehicle without authorization, even if he didn't intend to permanently deprive the owner of it (CRS 18-4-409(4)).\n\nDriving an unregistered vehicle is likely, as the abandoned dumper truck's registration is presumably expired (CRS 42-3-121(1)(a)).\n\nDriving without insurance is applicable because John doesn't have the owner's permission, so his personal insurance (if any) wouldn't cover this vehicle (CRS 42-4-1409(2)).\n\nOperating a commercial vehicle without a proper license could apply if the dumper truck's GVWR exceeds 26,000 pounds, requiring a commercial driver's license (CRS 42-2-404(1)).\n\nOption A is incomplete, missing key violations.

Some company's members reported that the man fell down by himself. Other clients say that they were far away from the man and did not see anything. The police quickly concluded that no violence has occurred and the man fell down by himself. The man claims otherwise, asking several times that the police need to check the camera.

If the police officers are satisfied by the witness accounts, or have some reason to think viewing surveillance recording wouldn't be useful they don't have to, either by law or policy.\n\nNote that ordinarily, police won't consider a physical altercation between two grown men a serious enough crime to warrant charges. If there was no serious injury and there wasn't a large discrepancy between the strength of the two men, police will often decline to lay charges even when they believe the evidence would sustain them. In this case the police may have decided it wasn't worth investigating further because it wasn't worth wasting the time of an already overloaded court system.\n\nThe victim here still has legal options despite the lack action by the police.

Police officers have discretion in how they conduct their investigations. If they are satisfied with witness accounts, they are not legally obligated to view surveillance footage, even if requested by the alleged victim. The police can choose to rely on witness testimony alone if they believe it is sufficient. Additionally, there's no requirement that unviewed evidence must be included in the final report.

The one thing I can imagine affecting this is whether the company continued to provide the service in question (e.g. in the case of Netflix they will block your account when the payment fails), but I can't think of any legal basis how that would make a difference (as you still have a legal agreement to pay).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You owe money if there is a contract obliging you to pay. Whether you receive what you pay for (e.g. services) only affects your stance when suing for non\\-performance/damages; your obligation to pay still stands until the court decides it does not (or there is a mutual agreement to discharge the contract).\n\nIt is irrelevant whether the original payment method still works or not. If it does not but you still owe money \u2014 you have to pay.\n\nThe ability to turn the credit card off is just a handy feature.

John's legal obligation is based on the contract he agreed to when signing up for the service, not on the status of his payment method. Disabling the credit card does not negate the contractual agreement. Even if John doesn't use the service or if the service provider cuts off access due to non-payment, John is still legally bound by the terms of the 12-month contract he agreed to. The ability to disable the credit card is merely a convenience feature and does not affect the underlying legal obligation to pay.

Roth, 333 F.2d 450, 453 (2d Cir.1964\\) \\[...]. It recommended that common sense should inform determinations of whether an improper benefit has been conferred.\n\n(quotation marks in original, emphasis added)\n\nIn the context of your question, Netanyahu's alleged offer to Elovitch reflects Netanhayu's *desire* to have the positive news coverage. That *desire* is precisely what gives that \"positive news coverage\" the status of *thing of value*, at least under the circumstances you describe. Consequently, in light of the *Mulhall* opinion, it seems inaccurate and unavailing for Netanyahu's government to portray as \"impossible\" that the positive news coverage be treated as *thing of value* in the alleged offer.\n\nAdditionally, see [*People v. Campos*, 351 P.3d 553, 556 (2016\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/incoco20150423066) (\"*The primary purpose of obtaining employment is to receive the financial benefit of payment for labor performed*\"). It is clear that a politician's purpose of positive news coverage is to be elected for, appointed to, or remain in, public office. Thus, the motive for procuring positive news coverage \\[in exchange for lucrative regulatory concessions] easily translates to that politician's pursuit of a financial benefit that results from being in public office.\n\nNetanyahu's alleged offer fits the meaning of *quid pro quo*, which in turn is material for a finding of bribery. [*U.S. v. Kemp*, 500 F.3d 257, 281 (2007\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/2007757500f3d2571753) reads:\n\n> The Supreme Court has explained, in interpreting the federal bribery and gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, that bribery requires a quid pro quo, which includes an \"intent `to influence' an official act or`to be influenced' in an official act.\"\n\nAnd the [*U.S. v.v Jennings*, 160 F.3d 1006, 1014 (4th.

According to the case law cited, particularly Mulhall v. Unite Here Local 355, the concept of \"thing of value\" is broadly defined. The key element is the desire to have the \"thing\" in question, which can vary based on the individual and the circumstances. This interpretation allows for intangible benefits, such as positive news coverage, to be considered a \"thing of value\" if it is desired by the recipient.\n\nOption A is incorrect because bribery does not require a direct monetary exchange. Option B is too narrow, as it excludes intangible benefits that could still be valuable. Option D is also too limited, as bribery can involve various forms of value beyond government contracts or regulatory concessions.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how U.S. courts have interpreted \"thing of value\" in bribery cases, which is crucial for analyzing complex situations like the Netanyahu case mentioned in the original text."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24492/how-much-of-a-songs-audio-can-i-include-in-teaching-materials-without-copyright", "docs_id": 24492, "title": "How much of a song&#39;s audio can I include in teaching materials without copyright violation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to build some educational material that would incorporate music. \n\nIs it possible to include short sections of musical works without violating copyright?

The company operates in various European countries.\n\nIt works like so: the company sources some audio content, mostly through online platforms like iTunes, buying the content, according to my understanding with a normal user account. Then they distribute the audio files to their customers premises (they can be stored locally on various platforms like a computer or a mobile phone). And then the customer plays that audio content on their premises, to the public. The service is very similar to a radio or Spotify being played in a store for the customers to enjoy.\n\nThe company assures me they are in their full right and have been operating like that for some time now. They argue that the store that is diffusing music is the one legally responsible before their respective country's copyright collection society.\n\nCan the company really put all the legal burden on the ones diffusing the copyrighted content?\nI thought the distribution was also subjected to licensing. For instance, I thought platforms like Spotify need to get the license from the record companies before they start distributing copyrighted content. I thought commercial radios also needed that. \n\nWhat makes me wonder is also the fact that the Apple store refuses to allow the application in their store due to legal issues. They assume that the company does not have the authorization from the third parties to let users download their content. I have no idea how Apple knows that Spotify has the rights from the third parties to allow the download of audio files and not the company since they did not ask to see the licenses first. But anyway, it makes me think some legal work must be done before distributing the content.\n\nI would like to understand the legal aspect of each step (getting the content, distributing it and diffusing it). \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, copyright includes the right to make copies of protected content, the right to distribute those copies, and also the right to publicly perform. Those rights are all initially vested in the creator of the copyrighted content, but may be contractually assigned, sold, or licensed separately. \n\nWhen physical copies, such as books or CDs or DVDs, are lawfully sold, the purchaser has the right to resell or rent those copies without further permission. This is know as the *First Sale Doctrine* that the copyright owner has the right to control the copies only until their first sale. \n\nHowever, electronic copies are generally not **sold** at all, but rather are licensed. This avoids the First sale rule, and allows the copyright owner to control the entire distribution sequence, usually though a chain of contracts each granting appropriate license rights. \n\nSo the publisher would be authorized by the copyright holder to create copies, and the publisher would license distributors, and the retail customers would be licensed in turn by the distributors, or perhaps directly by the copyright holder. \n\nI suspect that the companies you describe actually have some sort of license agreement with the copyright holder, possibly through the publisher. The retail stores license the right to perform through the performance societies (aka collection societies) or possibly directly with the copyright holders. If in fact the companies described in the question have no license agreement with the original copyright holder (or an authorized agent), then it seems to me that they would be infringing copyright. But given how much money is involved at that level of the distribution chain, I would think that a suit would already have been filed on such grounds if there was not a valid agreement. I cannot, however, know what agreements any particular company has or has not made.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to create a B2B music streaming service for stores to play music for their customers. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal considerations for such a service?\n\nA) The company can purchase music from iTunes and redistribute it to stores without any additional licensing, as long as the stores pay performance rights fees.\n\nB) The company needs licenses from copyright holders to distribute the music, but stores don't need additional licenses to play it publicly.\n\nC) The company needs distribution licenses, and stores need separate public performance licenses, to operate this service legally.\n\nD) As long as the stores pay performance rights fees, neither the company nor the stores need any additional licenses.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because copyright law generally includes separate rights for distribution and public performance. The company creating the streaming service would need licenses from copyright holders or their authorized agents to distribute the music electronically, as digital content is typically licensed rather than sold outright. This avoids the First Sale Doctrine, which applies to physical copies. Additionally, the stores playing the music publicly would need separate licenses for public performance, typically obtained through performance rights organizations. Answer A is incorrect because purchasing from iTunes doesn't grant redistribution rights. B is wrong because stores do need public performance licenses. D is incorrect because it ignores the company's need for distribution licenses."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91387/tenant-moves-out-of-townhouse-early-in-florida-on-2-year-lease", "docs_id": 91387, "title": "Tenant moves out of townhouse early in Florida on 2 year lease", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking for a path forward given the following **residential lease terms in Florida**:\n\n1.

Is sending the screenshot FRAUD given that the payment was never received?\n3. What are the next steps available to a Landlord?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Eviction is the legal process of removing a tenant from a premise, which can be necessary because the landlord cannot legally throw the tenant out. (The sheriff does it, under orders from a court.) When the tenant has quit the premise, the landlord's remaining concern is (potentially) a lawsuit for breach of contract \u2013 if the landlord wants money, they will need to get a court order.\n\nThe landlord can sue for the entire amount, the remainder of 2 years' rent minus whatever has been paid, but obviously the tenant has available the option of paying less than that to be in compliance with their lease obligation. Still, unless the tenant simply had a technical glitch and did intend to pay the remaining month's rent, it may be necessary to take the matter to court. The tenant might be motivated by the fact that [\u00a783\\.48 of the landlord\\-tenant law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0083/0083.html) awards costs to the winner in the legal proceeding. \u00a783\\.56 states the formal process of terminating the agreement, in particular para 3 regarding non\\-payment and the notice that has to be given. This also reminds you of the obligation under \u00a783\\.49(3\\) regarding the return of the deposit.\n\nFinally, \u00a783\\.595 is specifically about how the landlord gets the rent owed. Theoretically, the added extra month rent could be subsumed under the concept of \"liquidated damages\", but there has to be certain wording in the agreement, so the landlord will have to go to court if he wants the full three months.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Florida residential lease dispute, a tenant signed a 2-year lease but moved out after 8 months, agreeing to an addendum that required an additional month's rent payment to be released from the original lease.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's next steps?\n\nA) The landlord can immediately evict the tenant without going to court, as the tenant has breached the lease agreement.\n\nB) The landlord must file for eviction before pursuing any legal action for unpaid rent.\n\nC) The landlord can sue for the entire remaining rent for the 2-year lease period, regardless of the addendum agreement.\n\nD) The landlord should follow the formal process of terminating the agreement as per Florida Statute \u00a783.56 and may need to go to court to recover the agreed-upon damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate. The landlord should follow the formal process outlined in Florida Statute \u00a783.56 for terminating the agreement, especially regarding non-payment and required notices. Since the tenant has already moved out, eviction (options A and B) is not necessary or applicable. While the landlord can potentially sue for unpaid rent, they cannot automatically claim the entire 2-year lease amount (option C) due to the signed addendum. The landlord will likely need to go to court to recover the agreed-upon damages (security deposit, last month's rent, and additional month's rent) as per the addendum, especially since the final payment was not received despite the screenshot.

Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198 (3rd Cir. 2000\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/237/198/564897/):\n\n> \\[L]ikelihood of confusion for both competing and noncompeting goods should be tested with reference to the following:\n> \n> \n> 1. the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged infringing mark;\n> 2. the strength of the owner's mark;\n> 3. the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase;\n> 4. the length of time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising;\n> 5. the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark;\n> 6. the evidence of actual confusion;\n> 7. whether the goods, competing or not competing, are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media;\n> 8. the extent to which the targets of the parties' sales efforts are the same;\n> 9. the relationship of the goods in the minds of consumers, whether because of the near\\-identity of the products, the similarity of function, or other factors;\n> 10. other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the prior owner to manufacture both products, or expect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant's market, or expect that the prior owner is likely to expand into the defendant's market.\n\nLet's take a few of these.\n\n> 1. the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged infringing mark\n\nLow, but non\\-zero. They're facially completely dissimilar: the words sound and look nothing alike, and their logos are completely different as well in both design and color. The only similarity is that they are both parts of Nikola Tesla's name. The USPTO gives as an [example](https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/additional-guidance-and-resources/possible-grounds-refusal-mark) \"LUPO\" and \"WOLF\" being similar, \"because, when the Italian word 'LUPO' is translated into English, it means 'WOLF.'\" However, in that example, the words have identical meaning in different languages. Overall, this seems to weigh against infringement, as neither company is associated with the actual person, and [Nikola is a common given name](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=nikola).\n\n> 2. the strength of the owner's mark\n\nTesla's is quite strong: they're quite prominent. Nikola probably less so. Would weigh in favor of Tesla in a suit.\n\n> 3. the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase\n\nExtremely high: the Tesla and Nikola trucks start at \\~$40k and $60k, respectively. This weighs against infringement, as consumers are unlikely to make such an expensive purchase hastily.\n\n> 5. the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark\n\nBoth chose the mark to pay homage to Nikola Tesla. Per the same case, \"defendant's intent will indicate a likelihood of confusion only if an intent to confuse consumers is demonstrated via purposeful manipulation of the junior mark to resemble the senior's.\" None appears clear here, which does not support infringment.\n\n> 6. the evidence of actual confusion\n\nI couldn't quickly find any. I'm sure a lawyer would search more thoroughly, but this seems to weigh against infringement.\n\n> 7. whether the goods, competing or not competing, are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media\n> 8. the extent to which the targets of the parties' sales efforts are the same\n\nThese are probably pretty similar. Would weigh in favor of infringement.\n\n---\n\nAs with any balancing test, it's a bit of a guessing game how a court would weigh the factors, but given the low similarity, high price, and lack of evidence of actual confusion, I find it unlikely that a court would find either party has infringed the other's trademark.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A new electric vehicle company, \"Volta Motors,\" is considering entering the market.

While the company name and logo are different (addressing factor 1), there are several other strong indicators of potential infringement:\n\n1. Intentional similarity in product design (factor 5 - intent of the defendant)\n2. Use of similar marketing channels (factor 7)\n3. Evidence of actual consumer confusion (factor 6)\n\nThese elements combined would likely outweigh the dissimilarity in name and logo. \n\nOption A lacks evidence of actual confusion and intentional similarity. Option C targets a different market segment and has no evidence of confusion. Option D, while having a similar name, lacks other strong indicators of infringement and has minimal evidence of confusion.

Does the player still get paid if he is injured, or otherwise cannot play?\n\nFor example, in 2001 Drew Bledsoe, quarterback for the Patriots had just signed a $100 million 10\\-year contract before he was sidelined by a life\\-threatening injury. Did he still receive the $100 million over the next 10 years, even though he never again served as starting quarterback?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I did some more research on this question. A contract that pays the player no matter what, whether they play or not, is called a *guaranteed contract*. Guaranteed contracts are rare in the NFL because injuries are so frequent. Only a small number of superstars get them.\n\nThe norm for NFL players are provisions that allow a team to cut a player at the beginning of the next year. So, the usual rule is that a player will always get paid for the current season, even if they do not play at all, but if they are unable to play due to an injury then the team can release them and terminate the contract the next year, as long as they decide to do so by a particular date, which is usually in March. Note that if a player cannot play due to injury, usually they get paid injury pay which is less than their full pay, but is still a substantial.\n\nFor star players, the amount of guaranteed pay is larger, often several years of the contract. So, for example, a $100 million contract might have $25 million guaranteed. Also, many star contracts have an \"injury bonus\" clause that pays additional money if the player suffers a career\\-ending injury. So, in that case, the player would receive the guaranteed money plus the injury bonus.\n\nLonger\\-term contracts for super stars are not usually fully guaranteed. Usually, the team has several options to extend the contract. So, for example, a contract may have a 3\\-year guaranteed phase, plus a 3\\-year option which allows the team to automatically retain the quarterback for another 3\\-years at the same rate if they pay an additional sum of money as a bonus.\n\nContracts are also affected by the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the player union. This prevents certain types of contracts from being binding for long\\-periods of time. When the collective bargaining agreement lapses, then it resets many of the conditions of individual contracts.\n\nDrew Bledsoe's record $103 million dollar contract in 2001 featured an $8 million signing bonus and a $6 million injury guarantee. Only 3 years or so of Bledsoe's contract was guaranteed, so after he was traded to the Bills in 2002 (who assumed his contract), it was easy for the Bills to cut him in 2004, because relatively little guaranteed money remained on his contract. Bledsoe then signed a 3\\-year deal with the Cowboys, but it was an ordinary deal, only guaranteed for the current season, not a superstar deal.

The court decided that if it's not possible to distinguish between a copy and an original work, it's not copyright infringement. This suggests that the key factor is recognizability. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a single pixel changing colors is unlikely to be recognizable as any specific work. \n\nOption B is likely too low resolution to be recognizable, as the example in the image shows a 3x4 Mona Lisa as unrecognizable. \n\nOption C is correct because once the reproduction becomes recognizable as the original work, it would likely be considered copyright infringement. This aligns with the court's principle of distinguishability.\n\nOption D is too specific. While a 60x60 pixel image might be infringing, the exact pixel count isn't the determining factor - it's whether the content is recognizable.\n\nThe 45x60 Mona Lisa example in the image supports this, as it's clearly recognizable despite low resolution, and would likely be considered infringing if used without permission."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/40940/country-specific-customs-duties", "docs_id": 40940, "title": "Country specific customs duties", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How are Trump's recently imposed customs duties on China legal?

That way, the exchange is legally enforceable and is not just a cancellable promise. This is all written up clearly, and you become a creditor. One thing to bear in mind is that you may have to wait in line so that others are paid first. For example, taxes have to be paid, also secured creditors have to be paid. Nearly at the end of the list, unsecured creditors such as you are paid, and finally heirs can receive shares of what is left.\n\nI don't know what you mean by \"recognizing\" a debt, but what a financial institution could do is treat a debt as an asset, for the purposes of a loan. For instance, a bank might lend you $10,000 where you pledge your home as a thing of value that they can take in case you default on repayment. You cannot force a bank to accept a particular asset as collateral, so the answer to the \"how\" question is \"by persuasion\". Since your asset has an indefinite value between $0 and let's say $10,000, you would have to persuade the bank that there is negligible risk to them. In the case of property used as collateral, when you default the creditor can use the courts to seize your property and sell it, but they can't seize the property of a third party who owes you something, they would have to wait possibly for years for the third party to die and see what's left.

Alcoa*, 148 F.2d 416, Learned Hand considered three possible market share numbers. He wrote that market share of more than 90% \"is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty\\-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty\\-three per cent is not.\"\n\nWorldwide, iOS has about 15% of the smartphone OS market. In the US, it's about 40%. According to Judge Hand, that's well below \"doubtful\" and awfully close to \"certainly not\" a monopoly.\n\nNo monopoly equals no monopoly power equals no Sherman Act Section 2 violation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In antitrust law, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between market share and the potential for a Sherman Act Section 2 violation?\n\nA) A company with 33% market share could be found to have monopoly power and thus be liable for a Sherman Act Section 2 violation.\n\nB) Market share is irrelevant in determining monopoly power; only the company's behavior matters.\n\nC) A market share of 60-64% is definitively enough to constitute a monopoly and potential Sherman Act Section 2 violation.\n\nD) A market share above 90% is likely sufficient to constitute a monopoly, while a share between 60-64% is questionable, and 33% is likely insufficient for a finding of monopoly power.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the relationship between market share and monopoly power in antitrust law. Option D is correct based on Judge Learned Hand's opinion in United States v. Alcoa, where he stated that a market share above 90% is enough to constitute a monopoly, 60-64% is doubtful, and 33% is certainly not enough. Option A is incorrect because 33% was explicitly stated as insufficient. Option B is wrong because market share is a primary measure used by courts to determine monopoly power. Option C is incorrect because 60-64% was described as \"doubtful\" rather than definitive for constituting a monopoly."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37017/what-can-a-city-do-for-parking-tickets", "docs_id": 37017, "title": "What can a city do for parking tickets", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read the question and answer here: [Are parking tickets enforcable](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4507/are-parking-tickets-enforcable)\n\nBut I would like to know that if a person got a parking ticket in Pennsylvania for a street sweeper violation and didn't know until they got a registered letter from the city.\n\nIn that letter, they state that a person can plead not guilty (and send in a bond amount) or guilty.

I know accompanied children who are not legally allowed to enter the United States can be detained or deported if they are caught, but my question is: ***Are those children themselves determined to be committing an illegal act in the eyes of the law?***\n\nIn other words, are the children considered responsible for their illegal entry, or are they seen as being \"brought\" into the country illegally by their parents/family?\n\nThis question is in reference to a first\\-offense entry, not the crime of re\\-entry after deportation.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nAfter some more research, it looks like the way *[unlawful presence](http://www.usimmigrationlawyers.com/resources/immigration-law/deportation/can-a-minor-accrue-unlawful-presence-us)* is determined is different for children than adults, but I still haven't found any definitive answer to the question above, though it *seems* to be \"yes.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Illegal\" and \"breaking the law\" are rhetorically powerful, but less impressive than they seem. There are lots of people who are \"violating the law\" and subject to consequences for doing so, despite having never committed a crime, never having committed a tort, never having interfered with or trespassed on someone else's property, and never having breached a contract.\n\nA minor present in the U.S. who is not a citizen and not subject to a valid visa and has no valid claim to asylum is \"deportable\" because the minor doesn't have legal authorization to be in the U.S. Being \"deportable\" authorizes a legal consequence as a result of one's legal status, but it doesn't mean that you personally did anything wrong.\n\nSomeone who is deportable can be detained in an immigration jail pending deportation for a limited period of time. But, this is civil detention and not based upon personal wrongful conduct, it is based upon your legal status. It is analogous legally, to being placed in a Japanese internment camp during WWII due to your Japanese descent even if you are lawfully present in the U.S., when war powers authorized the detention notwithstanding a lack of any personal or particularize fault of those detained.\n\nIn the same vein, being born causes you to acquire multiple forms of legal status. You are the child of at least one person, usually two people, and sometimes more. You acquire citizenship and nationality which has certain legal consequences. You currently reside somewhere and being a resident of a place often has legal consequences (e.g. frequently, government benefits and rights to use public property). You gain intestate inheritance rights from lots of people. Through no fault of your own you gained various legal statuses and that had legal consequences. When you legal status changes, the consequences of your status changes, and this can happen entirely without fault. Children in particular often have legal rights in an immigration context that is mostly derivative of the legal status of their parents.\n\nBut, this legal status of the minor doesn't have to arise from any affirmative law breaking act of the minor. For example, the minor could (and often did) enter the U.S. in the custody of a parent pursuant to a valid temporary visa or a valid permanent visa subject to revocation, that is then revoked due to an action of a parent (e.g. committing a deportable crime) or inaction of a parent (e.g. failing to leave the U.S. when the visa expires) that the minor did not participate in at all and had no personal legal duty or ability to address.\n\nSimilarly, criminal liability for an immigration offense (which is the exception and not the rule) requires a certain amount of *mens rea* (i.e. intent) which a young children who accompanied a parent into the U.S. could totally lack. The child may not even know what a national boundary is, which country he is currently in, or what citizenship or lawful presence means under the law. \n\nFurther, a child has to have the ability to not break the law to have criminal liability in most cases, but is subject to the custody and control of their parent or guardian and has no choice regarding where the child travels or where the child resides.

The child in this scenario is \"deportable\" because they lack legal authorization to be in the U.S. after their visa expired. However, they have not committed a personal wrongful act. Their status is a result of their parents' actions, not their own. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the child lacks the necessary mens rea (intent) for criminal liability, especially at such a young age.\n\nAnswer B is misleading.

Option D, while mentioned as a possibility in the documentation, is not advised due to potential liability issues and is not the most appropriate approach for handling payments in this scenario.\n\nThe correct answer also implies the need for proper legal consultation and documentation, which is strongly emphasized in the original text to ensure compliance with employment laws and to protect the developer from potential claims."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36717/united-states-can-an-insurance-company-sell-a-policy-that-pays-fines-and-costs", "docs_id": 36717, "title": "United States: Can an insurance company sell a policy that pays fines and costs incurred by the policyholder knowingly breaking the law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legal in the United States for an insurance company to sell a policy that pays fines imposed on a person or corporation as a result of the policyholder knowingly breaking the law?\n\nAn example of such a policy for individuals is DWI insurance: A motorist buys a policy that will pay fines, fees, a motor vehicle interlock, alcohol education classes, attorney costs in the event that the motorist is charged or convicted with driving while intoxicated?\n\nAn example of such a policy for corporations is a policy that pays fines imposed on a company for violating environmental regulations in the event that they get caught. A factory is knowingly discharging emissions of a controlled pollutant at a level over the legal limit. They (and the insurer's underwriters) know they probably won't get caught, but if they do, the policy makes the softens the blow of getting caught.\n\nAre there laws in place in the United States that forbid this type of insurance policy, either at the federal level or at the state/local level?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Insurance is regulated at the state rather than the federal level in the United States, and the terms of individual insurance contracts also matter.\n\nMost states prohibit insurance of intentional unlawful acts as a matter of public policy, either under common law doctrines or under express statutes or regulations. The public policy is that no one should be insulated from liability for their own intentional acts. And, in insurance policies for individuals who are not employers, this is typically accomplished with an intentional acts exclusion in the language of the policy.\n\n(Negligent acts are almost always insurable. The status of acts that constitute gross negligence, willful and wanton conduct, reckless conduct, or bad faith conduct, varies somewhat from state to state.)\n\nBut, the situation is muddier when the insured is an employer or an entity. It frequently is possible for an employer or entity to insure itself against unauthorized misconduct by employees or officers or directors who are breaching their duties to the employer or company, rather than carrying out the official policies of the company.\n\nFactories don't knowingly do anything. People in or connected to factories do things and know things. And, if a factory employee is cutting corners in violation of his job responsibilities and that hurts the company, that could be an insurable risk. But, if a factory employee is acting in accordance with the directions of the CEO and Board of Directors in causing the factory to emit waste violating the law, and if the people giving him orders known that this violates the law, then this is probably not an insurable loss of the company as a matter of public policy.\n\nAnother complication involves the question of who is insured. The Town of Greenfield may be able to legally buy insurance that compensates it for the costs of having to deal with intentional environmental law violations by factories undertaken as a matter of corporate policy in the town, even though the corporation couldn't buy this insurance. Indeed, the Town could even impose a tax on the corporation that requires it to pay the premium on the Town's insurance policy. But, this wouldn't relieve the corporation of liability or violate public policy because the insurance company would have a right of \"subrogation\" to sue to owner of the factory to reimburse it for the full amount of any claims that it had to pay to the Town. This is true even if the corporation and the responsible individuals in the corporation are, in fact, judgment proof or bankrupt, so that the subrogation right is actually meaningless in fact.\n\nIt is also probably legal for a company to \"self\\-insure\", i.e. to set aside reserves of its own money to pay for it violations of the law in the future without regard to intent, and to have administrators employed to process payment in those situations, because then it is not actually insulated from harm for its own wrongdoing. But, this is risky because a policy of condoning illegal conduct could subject the company to punitive damages and sanctions in addition to compensatory damages.\n\nIt also matters what kind of harm the insurance policy pays for. It would not be illegal, in almost any state, to issue an insurance policy that pays for a criminal defense lawyer for someone who is accused of a crime. But, it would be illegal in almost every state to issue an insurance policy that pays for fines and court costs and restitution imposed as punishment for committing a crime. Paying for a criminal defense lawyer, or a bail bond, at a time when you are presumed innocent, is not a form of punishment and hence is an insurable expense.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large manufacturing corporation, XYZ Inc., is considering purchasing an insurance policy to cover potential fines and penalties resulting from environmental regulation violations.

There are occasions where people\u2019s circumstances change which results in them leaving Ireland, for example due to offers of employment or family circumstances. Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended, the Minister for Justice has the power to revoke a certificate of naturalisation where an individual has been ordinarily resident outside of the State for seven years unless they have registered their intention to retain their Irish citizenship. This is done by submitting a Form 5 (Form CTZ2\\) Declaration of Intention to retain Irish citizenship by a naturalised Irish citizen residing outside of Ireland. The [Form 5 (Form CTZ2\\) Declaration of Intention, Version 6 Jan 20](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/form-CTZ2.pdf)\n> must be lodged with the INIS, or with the nearest Irish Embassy or Consular Office to a person\u2019s location. We strongly advise all naturalised Irish citizens to file the Form 5 if ordinary resident outside of Ireland to ensure that they retain their Irish citizenship.\n\nIt is about the \"intention to retain Irish citizenship\" if a naturalized person has resided abroad (outside Ireland) for 7 years. If they still want to keep their naturalized Irish status, they have to fill this form so that Ireland does not assume that they no longer wish to retain it.\n\nMost countries require residence beforehand. Some require it afterwards. The US used to require this, but that is no longer the case now. Germany does not. Ireland does, but here it **seems** that a naturalized person can anyway live abroad for periods longer than 7 years just by filling that form (that basically declares the intention to RETAIN citizenship).\n\nBased on Irish law, specifically the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, can I live abroad after naturalizing as an Irish citizen and retain my citizenship just by filling that form? Will Ireland revoke my citizenship on the basis that I left Ireland after I naturalized (while \"intention to live in Ireland\" was a requirement for naturalization)? If it were a country like UK or New Zealand, it would straightaway revoke citizenship by claiming misrepresentation of the intention to reside. Does Irish law require me to reside compulsorily in Ireland after naturalization?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Based on Irish law, specifically the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, can I live abroad after naturalizing as an Irish citizen and retain my citizenship just by filling that form?\n\nYes, subject of course to factual disputes. The [statute (as amended)](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/INCA%20Dec2014.pdf/Files/INCA%20Dec2014.pdf) provides that this revocation is not possible when the citizen has \"registered annually in the prescribed manner his name and a declaration of his intention to retain Irish citizenship with an Irish diplomatic mission or consular office or with the Minister\":\n\n> Revocation of certificates of naturalisation.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.\u2014(1\\) The Minister may revoke a certificate of naturalisation if he is satisfied\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) that the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances, or\n> \n> \n> (b) that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, or\n> \n> \n> (c) that (except in the case of a certificate of naturalisation which is issued to a person of Irish descent or associations) the person to whom it is granted has been ordinarily resident outside the State or, in the case of an application for a certificate of naturalisation granted under section 15A, resident outside the island of Ireland (otherwise than in the public service) for a continuous period of seven years and without reasonable excuse has not during that period registered annually in the prescribed manner his name and a declaration of his intention to retain Irish citizenship with an Irish diplomatic mission or consular office or with the Minister, or\n> \n> \n> (d) that the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country, or\n> \n> \n> (e) that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership, acquired another citizenship.\n\nTo be precise, filing this declaration does not protect the citizen from revocation of naturalization under another subsection of section 19(1\\). But if we assume that the annual declarations were all filed promptly (or that there is a reasonable excuse for any failure to file promptly), and that there is no dispute about this, then it is plain from the statutory text that the minister has no discretion to revoke the certificate of naturalization under 19(1\\)(c).\n\n> If it were a country like UK or New Zealand, it would straightaway revoke citizenship by claiming misrepresentation of the intention to reside.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. If there is a reason for the decision to leave, the naturalized citizen could seek to rebut any presumption that there had been misrepresentation.\n\nIn the case of Ireland, filing the annual declaration does not protect the naturalized citizen from denaturalization under 19(1\\)(a), so even if the declarations are filed, it could be necessary to show evidence that there was a genuine intention to reside in Ireland at the time of naturalization, and that the intention changed subsequently. If that intention did not in fact exist, then the minister could assert that the certificate had been obtained by fraud, and if the naturalized citizen is unable to rebut that assertion, the minister could revoke the certificate under 19(1\\)(a).\n\nAlso see Part IV of the statute for other ways in which Irish citizenship may be lost.\n\nIn practice, I don't think it is presently very common for countries that generally tolerate (or explicitly permit) multiple nationalities, such as Ireland, the UK, and New Zealand, to seek to denaturalize their naturalized citizens who move abroad. Denaturalization seems to be largely confined to politically sensational cases such as those of terrorists.\n\nSince Ireland is a party to the [Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Reduction_of_Statelessness), one way to protect your Irish citizenship may be to renounce your other citizenship(s), if that is possible.

The police officer who stopped Mr. Hiibel had reasonable suspicion that a crime had occurred and Mr. Hiibel could have satisfied Nevada's statute by simply stating his name; there was no requirement to turn over any papers or other documentation.\n\nThe final paragraph of the opinion speaks of the importance of the narrow scope of the disclosure requirement and then goes on and states:\n\n> ...Answering a request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant in the scheme of things as to be incriminating only in unusual circumstances...Even witnesses who plan to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege answer when their names are called to take the stand. **Still, a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense.

I know that running a DDOS attack on someone who is okay with it is legal, but this is using a public server to amplify the attack. The attack doesn't do any damage to the public server and only uses it as a middleman, but it doesn't use the server for what it's designed to do. \n\nTo be totally clear, this is for educational and not malicious purposes only. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Public\" DNS servers are public in the sense that they are available for the public to use by the adminstrator of each server. But each DNS server is run by either a government entity (or semi\\-government, such as a university or a government run corporation) or a private telecom company. And as such, each entity that runs a DNS server will have TOS (terms of service) that dictates the use of that server.\n\nAnd each \\- I'd assume \\- forbids DNS access in for form of high\\-volume, repeated accesses such as would be used in a DDOS attack test. You should find the administrative domain and website of the DNS server you want to use from public\\-dns.info and read their TOS to determine their policies about access to their DNS services.\n\nBut there are many other factors involved in a DDOS attack test other than the one DNS service: you need to consider each ISP, each upstream provider, each network between the DNS service and the target server, in each country, as a DDOS attack \\- even a controlled stress test \\- creates huge amounts of traffic all across each network and as such costs time and money to each. And each services' TOS may very well forbid such use for a DDOS stress test.\n\nYou don't think a DDOS test will inflict \"damage.\" It will: \"damage\" outlined in a TOS will be defined as CPU and network loads that cause slowness and network latency to other customers, time spent by admins to mitigate the issues, and more.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you are educational and not malicious.\n\nDon't think that a DNS server administrator, the ISP, upstream providers, etc. can't track you down.\n\nIn the US at least, DDOS attacks are illegal: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030\\#a\\_5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030#a_5)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A cybersecurity student wants to conduct an educational DDoS attack test using a public DNS server as an amplifier.

If so what crime would it be?\n\nIt seems to me that I would not be stealing anything since it's my own property that I'm taking. I might even have a reason to suspect that if I did not take the package from the truck, then the driver would leave it sitting out in the open where it would likely be stolen (or that the driver himself might steal it), in which case I'd actually be preventing a crime by taking it from the truck directly.\n\nI don't think this would be burglary either, since that would tend to require that I was breaking into a restricted area *with the intent to commit a crime.* Especially if the delivery truck had no doors or I acted while they'd been left open, then I wouldn't even be \"breaking and entering.\"\n\nI can't see this as being \"trespass\" if the truck was on a public street, unless trespass applies to the interior of vehicles. Even then, as long as I'd leave before anyone noticed me, I could just say I only went in to retrieve what's mine and prevent it from being damaged or stolen.\n\nSo I'm guessing there must be some kind of arcane laws that only the US Postal Marshalls deal with. Yes, there are special guys called \"US Postal Marshalls,\" who investigate mail\\-related crimes. So I'm curious what crime this would be?\n\nNote: I did review [this post about \"stealing your own property back\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31510/stealing-my-own-property-back) but it does not really seem to apply here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, it's illegal\n-----------------\n\nYou are missing something terribly important:\n\n**The package might not be your property \\[yet]. In any way, it is not in your possession, while it is in the hands of the postal service!**\n\nThe *contents* of the package started fully owned by the sender and were entrusted to the postal service to deliver it. This entrustment is (contractually) defined as the time it is handed to the postal service, but the postal service does not gain any ownership. They do however have insurance on the parcel (to some degree), as they are liable for the loss of it. In many cases, the transfer of ownership happens upon delivery (for example, in the UK), so that you can't even be sure you own the contents while the box is still on the truck. At least in the eye of many postal services I know, it is the basic presumption, that they hold the item as entrusted. So to be on the safe side, it's best to presume that the package only becomes *your* package the moment you sign for the receipt of the package or it is dropped into your mailbox or at your dedicated dropoff point (you can specify that with many postal carriers btw). Otherwise, your actions might interfere with the contract of the mail service \\[to bring it to your door] and might incur liability upon them as their insurance presumes the parcel was lost and it has to be replaced. By the way, it is customary that any message of *the parcel is damaged* go to the sender, not the receiver so that in the case of commercial mail they can send/fund a replacement, as the sender needs to ensure that a non\\-defect item is delivered under their own contract with the recipient.\n\nCriminal lawsuits\n-----------------\n\nBut, you want to know which specific law you'd be sued under [18 USC \u00a71708 (2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1708) not only for taking the box, but also for taking the item from the box (emphasis mine)!\n\n> **Whoever** steals, **takes**, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains, or attempts so to obtain, **from** or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle, or **any mail route** or other authorized depository for mail matter, or from a letter or mail carrier, **any** letter, postal card, **package**, bag, or mail, or abstracts **or removes from any such** letter, **package**, bag, or mail, **any article or thing contained therein**, or secretes, embezzles, or destroys any such letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein \\[...] Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nThe act of *taking* is relevant. It is irrelevant that you would receive the parcel later. You take it from the car on the delivery route. You also do trespass under whatever jurisdiction applies where the car is parked. For example, Criminal Trespass on Indian country is defined under [25\\.CFR \u00a7 11\\.411 (b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/11.411). The rules in other jurisdictions are very similar: you are not allowed to enter the car, as it is clearly off\\-limits to the general public. The car is btw. supposed to be closed to prevent such, so you have to actually break property of the postal service (which is an extra charge to just the normal B\\&E).\n\n> (b) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he or she is not licensed or privileged to do so, he or she enters or remains in any place as to which notice against trespass is given by: (3\\) Fencing or other enclosure manifestly designed to exclude intruders.\n\nA car door, even if not locked and left ajar, is an enclosure manifestly designed to exclude intruders, and the inside of a car is \"any place\". So, in the correct jurisdiction, this statute of criminal trespass does apply. And as pointed out above, taking the mail without the driver knowing is illegal. In some fashion, taking your own mail is also a strange case of [obstructing the correspondence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1702), which specifically calls out that the parcel has to be given by the mailman to the recipient (emphasis mine).\n\n> **Whoever takes any** letter, postal card, or **package** out of any post office or any authorized depository for mail matter, or from any letter or mail carrier, or **which has been** in any post office or authorized depository, or **in the custody of any** letter or **mail carrier, before it has been delivered to the person to whom it was directed**, with design to obstruct the correspondence, or to pry into the business or secrets of another, or opens, secretes, embezzles, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nIf it is discovered by the driver while still on route, they will have to call the base and investigate the missing parcel, which takes time from the delivery, so might constitute [retarding the passage of mail](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1701). If you break the lock to the car, you'd be charged as [Injury to mail bags](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1706):\n\n> **Whoever** tears, cuts, or otherwise **injures any** mail bag, pouch, or other **thing used or designed for use in the conveyance of the mail**, or draws or breaks any staple or loosens any part of any lock, chain, or strap attached thereto, with intent to rob or steal any such mail, or to render the same insecure, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\nA Postal car, especially with a lock on the door, is such a device. And if you somehow had the key to the car, you'd break [18 USC \u00a7\u202f1704](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1704) instead. Plus, your taking does possibly incur monetary damages to the postal carrier, so civil charges for that money and expenses in investigating would also accrue against the taking person.\n\ncivil lawsuits?\n---------------\n\nIf you'd take the parcel, you make the postal driver accountable for the loss of the parcel and the worth of the package, as the internal system of the postal service does recognize that they did not deliver the parcel, did not scan it out at the home base, but they did scan it onto their route. So unless they can point the finger at you or a known thief, they might need to admit that they did not lock the car or committed some other misconduct that allowed someone to steal the parcel. This can lead to the financial loss of the delivery driver or them being fired. Should the mail carrier or the postal service discover it was you, the mail carrier can now sue you for the injury the lost parcel meant to them as you interfered with their work contract. The tort is [Tortious interference](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tortious_interference).\n\nThen, the mail service can sue you for intentionally interfering with the delivery contract the service had with the one ordering the delivery done: they were required to bring the parcel to the target and got paid for that. Only your action of taking did prevent this. Would you not have taken the parcel, they would have delivered, so you interfered with their contract.\n\n---\n\nLife Advice:\n------------\n\nApproach the driver, get out a photo\\-ID (Drivers license, passport, ID\\-card etc) and ask them something akin to this \"The website told me you might have a parcel for me. Can you look? I am this person, and this ID proves I live at the target address, as indicated on this ID.\" With those credentials in hand, the postal driver can check and give it to you but isn't technically obligated to. But as it often means they can save a few valuable minutes getting to your house, they might, especially if you know your mail carrier and are friendly.\n\nOn the other hand, it's extremely unlikely for letter mail to be given this way, as searching for a parcel on a truck is much easier than looking for the letter mails in the bags.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: John sees a delivery truck parked on his street.

John could also be charged with obstructing correspondence (18 USC \u00a71702) and potentially damaging mail equipment if he forced entry into the truck (18 USC \u00a71706). The fact that the package is addressed to John does not make these actions legal. Option A is incorrect because ownership doesn't transfer until delivery.

Do I have the right to pay for just 2 weeks considering that he breached the terms requested in the contract? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My take on this problem is that it is a classic tension between unjust enrichment and contract terms. You contracted for only 2 mows and he delivered 4 mows accidently. If you pay only for two mows, you got the benefit of two extra mows (the unjust enrichment), but are paying for something that you didn't ask for (the contract terms). If you pay for all 4, you are paying for a service you didn't want. In my opinion, you would probably end up winning in a small claims type of action because you specifically requested a less frequent mowing, and the lawn service accepted your terms. But this is far from a done deal, for instance if you knew about the extra mowings, but didn't stop them, (or they can paint that picture regardless of your real state of mind) it looks like you tried to get free mowings without paying for it, which might lower your chances of winning.\n\nPractically, I would concentrate on the negotiations rather than the legal stance because no amount of legal correctness will probably convince the business owner, and it probably isn't a worth his time to sue you to recover. You could send a check with a letter explaining that you had only requested two mowings, and that you are only willing to pay for 2\\. Write \"Paid in Full\" on the check in the memo area, and hope they cash it. If so, you are probably done because you had a legitimate dispute about the amount owed, and you offered to settle for the amount of the check. Cashing the check probably counts as acceptance of your offer. The other choice the business owner has is to send you to collections, where they will probably recover less than your 50% payment, so the dollar\\-wise move on their part is to just cash the check.\n\nYou can see more about \"paid in full\" checks here: [http://www.weisslawstl.com/2005/12/01/accord\\-satisfaction\\-how\\-notation\\-check\\-sometimes\\-unwittingly\\-resolve\\-payment\\-dispute](http://www.weisslawstl.com/2005/12/01/accord-satisfaction-how-notation-check-sometimes-unwittingly-resolve-payment-dispute)\n\nIt may vary according to the jurisdiction you live in.\n\nI had a similar dispute with an electrician.

It's worth mentioning that I'm confident that users of the project are using it for commercial uses (e.g. to sell their services).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally you can only use logos (i.e., symbolic trademarks) if you have the trademark owners' permission. You may certainly use the names Cisco and Microsoft nominatively, although they might ask you to provide a disclaimer of any affiliation including sponsorhip or approval, if it gets to them. \"Not making any money\" is also not the sole determinative factor in proving your defense of \"fair use\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates an open-source project that uses logos from major tech companies without permission. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this use?\n\nA) The use of the logos is permissible under fair use because the project is open-source and not generating revenue.\nB) The developer can use the logos freely as long as they provide a disclaimer stating no affiliation with the companies.\nC) The use of the logos is likely infringing on trademark rights, regardless of the project's non-commercial nature.\nD) The developer can use the company names but not their logos without permission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to the information provided, using logos (symbolic trademarks) generally requires permission from the trademark owners, regardless of whether the project is commercial or non-commercial. The fact that the project is open-source and not generating revenue is not sufficient to qualify for fair use protection.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because \"not making any money\" is not the sole determinant of fair use, and open-source status does not automatically grant permission to use trademarked logos.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because providing a disclaimer alone does not make unauthorized use of logos permissible. While disclaimers may be requested for use of company names, they do not grant rights to use logos without permission.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct but not the best answer. While the developer can use company names nominatively (with potential need for disclaimers), this does not extend to the use of logos without permission.\n\nThe key point is that trademark protection for logos is generally strict, and fair use for logos is more limited compared to textual references, even in non-commercial contexts."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45558/tow-truck-company-claim-they-towed-my-tractor-trailer-but-i-have-a-video-of-them", "docs_id": 45558, "title": "Tow truck company claim they towed my tractor trailer but I have a video of them getting into truck and driving it, what are my options?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background story,\nAfter making my last delivery on friday night I parked my truck with trailer on a plaza lot where my friend has a decent size restaurant,\nI was parked right behind his unit.\n\nOn Sunday 1pm I went go to get some stuff from the truck and it was gone. After looking around I found small label with towing company information.\n\nAt 3pm on Sunday I was at their lot getting my vehicle, I got into the vehicle and saw that it wasnt the same as I left and the dash cam that is attached to windshield was ripped off and swinging on the power cable.\n\nI asked the guy why they got into my vehicle and his response was that they need to disconnect the trailer from truck and tow the two pieces separately and then connect them back again at the lot.\n\nThey billed me 1500 for the towing and service which they only wanted cash and didn't accept any card.\n\nI got the truck paid full amount in cash and have a receipt from them with all the info and charges.\n\nThe owner (friend) of the restaurant showed me a video of them getting to my vehicle and driving off the plaza lot making a left turn into the main road at 2am Sunday morning. There is no tow truck in the video or someone disconnecting the trailer. \nYou can clearly see a guy with something in his hand opening a door and 10 minutes later backing up and driving away and then a red pickup following him.\n\nWhat are my options here?\nCan tow company drive my vehicle to their lot themselves?\nWhat laws are they breaking?\nWhat should I do? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a comment on the question:\n\n> They did damage the trailer door and headlight is smashed\n\nThis seems like the best thing to focus on, especially if you can show that it was not damaged before they towed it. The unusual method of towing (with video evidence) may be a factor in whether they are considered negligent. If the damage to the door looks like they caused it directly by breaking in, that would also help your case.\n\nYou also asked in your comment if you should go to the police or to a lawyer first. Might as well go to the lawyer and see what they tell you to do. I'm not sure what the police would do if there is no clear crime that has been committed. (The lawyer should have better advice about whether/why to go to the police.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: Based on the situation described, which of the following actions would be the most appropriate first step for the truck owner to take?\n\nA) File a police report immediately for vehicle theft\nB) Contact the towing company and demand a full refund\nC) Consult with a lawyer to discuss legal options and next steps\nD) File a complaint with the local business licensing board\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Consulting with a lawyer is the most prudent first step in this complex situation. A lawyer can provide expert guidance on how to proceed, considering the various legal issues involved:\n\n1. The potentially unauthorized towing\n2. The damage to the vehicle (dash cam, trailer door, headlight)\n3. The discrepancy between the towing company's account and the video evidence\n4. The high cash-only fee\n\nWhile filing a police report or complaining to authorities might eventually be necessary, a lawyer can advise on the best course of action and help gather and preserve evidence properly. They can also assess the strength of the case and potential legal remedies.\n\nOption A is premature without legal advice, as it's unclear if this qualifies as theft given the towing company's involvement. Option B is unlikely to be effective without legal backing. Option D might be relevant later, but it's not the most pressing or potentially effective first step."}}
