I imagine that the bouncer probably didn't recognize what he was looking at and assumed it was a fake ID. \n\nFrom what I understand, the bar does not have the authority to confiscate such a real passport, but that got me to thinking, what if the Bouncer was right? Does he actually have the legal authority to confiscate the fake ID?\n\nThe reason I ask, is because if he does have that authority, it feels to me like an awkward law, because a simple gap in knowledge can be what makes the difference between legal and illegal. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of indications that a bouncer may not confiscate an ID. [This policy document](https://www.centerforalcoholpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FAKE-IDs-IN-AMERICA-2018.pdf) adopting licensing policies to\n\n> Require licensees with fake ID violations to temporarily or\n>  permanently hire on\\-site law enforcement or certified security guards\n>  who are properly trained to check IDs during regular or peak hours to\n>  deter the use of fake IDs and give gatekeepers the opportunity to pass\n>  suspected fakes to an officer or guard for a second opinion and\n>  potential confiscation. Where appropriate, jurisdictions could empower\n>  the gatekeeper to confiscate fake IDs so they are not returned to the\n>  underage drinker and sent back into circulation. To ensure compliance\n>  with legal issues (e.g., property rights, bailment issues), arrange\n>  for the on\\-call or on\\-site presence of local law enforcement. Local\n>  bar and restaurant associations, especially those in concentrated\n>  entertainment zones, can join together to share the expense of law\n>  enforcement resources.\n\nThat implies that the bouncer does not already have that authority, and also indicates that the confiscation should be performed by the police. This [bouncer training manual](https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmcCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=can%20a%20server%20confiscate%20suspected%20forged%20identification&source=bl&ots=wsTndTCG0u&sig=ACfU3U2xvL0nFKy-UvlrPmF_vnF7rVDQ-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjL_qb_xtDiAhXB7Z4KHQKECKAQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=can%20a%20server%20confiscate%20suspected%20forged%20identification&f=false) says that\n\n> Even though you may consider the ID to be fake, it is not considered\n>  the server's property. Therefore servers and sellers should not\n>  confiscate IDs they suspect to be fake. Rather... follow up with a\n>  call to the police to verify suspected false IDs.\n\nHowever, a jurisdiction may grant servers that power, as in the case of [Colorado](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Recodified%20Liquor%20Code%2010.1.18_Final.pdf). Washington doesn't do that, so bouncers would need to call the police (not that they always do, since passing a fake ID is somewhere between a misdemeanor and a felony). The general principle is that you may not confiscate another person's property, but the police can seize property if it is reasonable to do so. A state may pass a law authorizing a licensee to do likewise (though it does raise questions about the bouncer's understanding of \"reasonable cause to believe\"). The Colorado statute is restricted to licensee and their employees, and does not apply to \"anyone who suspects an ID\", nor does it allow civilian confiscation of other property such as an automobile that is suspected of being stolen."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of ID verification at bars, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the confiscation of suspected fake IDs by bouncers?\n\nA) Bouncers have universal authority to confiscate any ID they suspect to be fake, as it's considered part of their job duties.\n\nB) Bouncers can never confiscate IDs under any circumstances, as it would always be considered theft of personal property.\n\nC) The authority of bouncers to confiscate suspected fake IDs varies by jurisdiction, with some states explicitly granting this power while others prohibit it.\n\nD) Bouncers can only confiscate IDs if they have received specific training and certification from local law enforcement agencies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The authority of bouncers to confiscate suspected fake IDs is not universal and varies depending on the jurisdiction. As mentioned in the provided information, some states like Colorado have laws that grant this power to licensed establishments and their employees, while others do not. In many cases, bouncers are advised to call the police rather than confiscate IDs themselves. This variation in legal authority makes C the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because bouncers do not have universal authority to confiscate IDs; it depends on local laws.\n\nOption B is too absolute; while it's generally true that bouncers shouldn't confiscate IDs, some jurisdictions do allow it under certain circumstances.\n\nOption D introduces a specific requirement (training and certification from law enforcement) that isn't mentioned in the provided information and isn't universally applicable."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28504/indemnification-clauses-and-liability-regarding-use-of-information", "docs_id": 28504, "title": "Indemnification clauses and liability regarding use of information?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've seen a lot of clauses like this, \n\n> **You will indemnify and hold Evil Corp, its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultant, contractors, partners, vendors and service providers (including, without limitation, hosting and telecommunications providers) harmless, including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of your access to the public Network**, use of Evil Corp products or services made available on the public Network, your violation of this Agreement, or your infringement or any third party using your account, of any intellectual property right.\n\nAnd also this,\n\n> **You agree to indemnify and hold the Evil Corp, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with (i) your use of and access to the Service;** (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right or any third party agreement; or (iv) any of Your Content or information in your Account or any other information you post or share on or through the Service.

This applies even if those actions were corrupt, malicious, or illegal. The only exceptions to a judge's immunity to a lawsuit is if the conduct alleged was not a judicial action, or if the judge was acting in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.

What would the concequences be?\n\n---\n\nNote: I am primarily interested in answers regarding the EU and the UK.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TLDR: it's illegal to BUY it. It's illegal to USE it. Know your suppliers.\n\nThat's certainly an interesting question, in light of how the market has changed in recent years, particularly due to Amazon/eBay, but even moreso due to Amazon Fulfillment and competitors.\n\nOver on diy.se, this is a constant vexation, because we see people buy crud like this all the time, and they need help installing it. And we find it's illegal to install, not even safe, and needs to be sent back in lieu of listed product.\n\nThe advanced nations do have a highly effective apparatus for screening and blocking dangerous goods. **However, these protections are geared toward bricks\\-and\\-mortar retail**. Can you count on something bought at Wickes, Redoute or Home Depot? By and large, yes.\n\nIs it legal to export it to you?\n--------------------------------\n\nYes, for all practical purposes. The people selling it are in an unreachable bastion in a foreign country that would not cooperate with their extradition, and would interfere with investigation. The government knows perfectly well that the stuff is complete crud, and doing so aligns with its national policies of raising hard currency and building industrial capacity, while [harming the capacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UOLlFm_P4g) of other nations.\n\nIs it legal for the item to be listed on Amazon or eBay?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon and eBay say \"Yes\". Their position is that they are **merely a platform** which connects buyers and sellers. They surely have excellent lawyers.\n\nAmazon is more like eBay than you might realize. Amazon opened their retail site to third party sellers. Third parties can sign up as additional sellers of a particular SKU, or write their own product listings.\n\nSince Amazon's behavior has been unchallenged, the answer seems to be \"yes\".\n\nIs it legal for Amazon to bring it into their warehousing systems?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon also opened their warehousing system to third party use. That can be for companies that don't sell on Amazon... or it can be for companies that do both Amazon and off\\-Amazon sales; in the latter case you order elsewhere but Amazon fulfills (ships) the item. When a company both sells the item on Amazon and it ships from an Amazon warehouse, it qualifies for \"Prime\" shipping where Amazon offers that.\n\nAmazon also offers \"Commingling\" for established SKUs. The idea is that if you have widgets in the Madrid warehouse, and I have widgets in a Warsaw warehouse... and a Madrid customer buys mine \\- why not ship them yours *since they are all the same*? I get credit for the sale and Amazon \"owes you one\". When you get a sale in Madrid, Amazon has one in Barcelona so they ship that one to your customer.\n\nCommingling is great, but what happens when I inject a pallet full of those SKUs \\- and they're counterfeits? Amazon doesn't know the difference, and your Warsaw customer gets my counterfeit. So do Amazon's Berlin and Wroclaw customers. Amazon ships them around the network to balance the warehouses, and now my counterfeit has contaminated the supply. I'm sitting in China. Whatcha gonna do about it?\n\nAgain, Amazon has top lawyers, who have surely done their diligence. Still, the program is ambitious, and e\\-commerce giants [break the law](https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xwxyv/uber-became-big-by-ignoring-laws-and-it-plans-to-keep-doing-that) all the time with their ambitions.\n\nIn the US, there's the [\"Express Shipment\"](https://www.prosperousamerica.org/the_problems_posed_by_e_commerce_without_borders) rule, which allows small orders ($800 or less) with no duty and an informal entry process. So they ship to Mexican warehouses, and then bring the items over by the truckload. Wait, how can a truckload be less than $800? Because they don't bring it over until there's an end\\-user customer order, and they argue \"these are for individual customers\". This qualifies them to breeze through customs, bypassing the quality and safety controls that prevent Home Depot from doing the exact same thing with a truckload that hasn't found customers yet.\n\nIs it legal for you (as the end consumer) to import it?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo. The rules for **Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne** are that the importer is responsible. When you as an end customer buy mail\\-order from China, **you are the importer**.\n\nUnder EU law, if you bring a CE\\-marked item into the EU, you are responsible for meeting the CE design standards, and doing in\\-house lab testing to affirm the performance of the product. By having the CE mark on the thing you imported, you are attesting to having done that.\n\nFurther, the various nations may require that a certified **independent** testing lab verify your testing and claims. This was historically done by national testing labs like BSI, TUV, CSA or UL. However by treaty they are largely cross\\-recognized: US OSHA keeps a canonical list of \"Nationally (by USA) Recognized Testing Labs\" (NRTLs) that every other agency and many other countries defer to.\n\nBig Clive is probably fine, since Clive's purpose is public ridicule, not usage.\n\nIs it legal for you to *install it in your house*?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n***Oh, heck no.***\n\nEvery nation has rules as to what certifications equipment must meet to legally be installed in a building's electrical system. For instance North America's *El NEC*, widely adopted or copied, has 110\\.2:\n\n> **110\\.2 Approval.** The conductors \\[wires] and equipment required or permitted by this *Code* shall be acceptable only if approved.\n\n\"Approved\" means by competent testing labs; i.e. OSHA's list of NRTLs. So no, you can't install non\\-approved equipment in any jurisdiction with a similar rule (and you pretty much need such a rule for inspections to have any teeth)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is true regarding the legality of importing and using a non-functional \"circuit breaker\" in the EU?\n\nA) It is legal to import and install such a device in your home as long as it has a CE mark.\n\nB) It is illegal to import the device, but legal to install it if you perform your own safety testing.\n\nC) It is legal to import the device, but illegal to install it in your home's electrical system.\n\nD) It is illegal both to import the device as an end consumer and to install it in your home.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe documentation clearly states that as an end consumer, you are considered the importer when buying items from abroad, and you are responsible for meeting CE design standards and conducting lab testing. This makes importing such a device illegal. Additionally, the information explicitly states that it is \"Oh, heck no\" illegal to install non-approved equipment in your house's electrical system. Therefore, both importing and installing the non-functional \"circuit breaker\" would be illegal in the EU.\n\nOption A is incorrect because having a CE mark doesn't make it legal if the product doesn't meet standards.\nOption B is incorrect because importing is illegal, and personal safety testing doesn't make installation legal.\nOption C is incorrect because importing as an end consumer is also illegal, not just the installation."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11270/are-my-tenants-entitled-to-stay-beyond-their-lease-period-on-a-month-to-month-ba", "docs_id": 11270, "title": "Are my tenants entitled to stay beyond their lease period on a month-to-month basis or are they required to leave by the last day in their lease term?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is for the state of Colorado.\n\nMy current tenants' lease expires on 6/30/2016\\.

Will this cause a problem since the reason I gave for them having to move out was my intention to sell the house? or am I free to change my mind at will?\n\nThank you all in advance for any wisdom/insight you may have to share.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Saying that you intend to sell the house (and offering an out for early termination) is not the same as providing written notice that the tenant must leave. The clause you cite says that you \"may terminate a month\\-to\\-month tenancy by providing 30 days\u2019 written notice to Tenant\", so the question is whether you did that. At the end of the lease period, the tenant may remain even if the lease is not renewed, and they become holdover tenants. You can subsequently boot them out, after 30 day's notice (plus legal processing time, if it comes to that). However regardless of what the lease says, you have to obey Colorado law, so note [Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a713\\-40\\-107(1\\)](http://www.landlord.com/statutes_colorado.htm) which says\n\n> (1\\) A tenancy may be terminated by notice in writing, served not less\n>  than the respective period fixed before the end of the applicable\n>  tenancy, as follows: (a) A tenancy for one year or longer, three\n>  months\n\n104(c\\-e) defines \"unlawful detention\" as applicable to tenants; you have to state your legal basis, sign it, and deliver it to the tenant.\n\nThe question then is whether you served them a proper demand per section 104, in writing per 106, served in a timely fashion per 107 and manner per 108\\. If so, they should leave when the lease is up, and if they don't, then there is the whole eviction process. Serving notice according to the law is quite important. \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nPursuant to \u00a713\\-40\\-107(4\\), if the lease terminates at a specific time (i.e. it actually says \"expires June 30, 2016\" or something like that), no notice to quit is required.\n\nHaving located a relevant case, [First Interstate Bank v. Tanktech, Inc., 864 P.2d 116](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1199743/first-interstate-bank-v-tanktech-inc/) says that \"The operation of the holdover tenancy doctrine in Colorado is well established. A holdover tenant is one who continues in possession of the premises beyond the term of the lease...Once a lease expires and the tenant remains in possession of the premises, the landlord may elect to treat the tenant as a trespasser, or may waive the wrong of holding over and continue the tenancy. In the latter case, and in the absence of a new agreement, the law implies a new contract between the parties based upon the same terms and conditions as the expired lease. It is also true that the **acceptance of rent by a landlord upon expiration of the lease is sufficient to create a holdover tenancy**.\" (emphasis added, citations omitted). The court also note in this case that the landlord failed to repudiate the prior lease, suggesting that explicit repudiation is a good idea."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Colorado informs tenants on April 20th that they plan to sell the property when the lease expires on June 30th.

Tanktech, Inc., when a tenant remains in possession after a lease expires and the landlord accepts rent, this creates a holdover tenancy. The terms of the original lease, including the month-to-month provision, would likely continue. The landlord's earlier statement about selling doesn't constitute proper notice to terminate, especially since rent was accepted after the lease expired. Options A and C are incorrect as they don't align with holdover tenancy principles. Option D is incorrect because proper 30-day notice wasn't given before the lease expired, and accepting rent typically waives the right to immediate termination."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9723/can-only-lawyers-write-dmca-takedown-letters-or-can-anybody", "docs_id": 9723, "title": "Can only lawyers write DMCA takedown letters, or can anybody?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend and I have been debating whether a DMCA takedown request technically counts as a legal document, therefore requiring a lawyer to provide legal counsel for it.

If the ticket really wins the $4 million is that binding?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, for those who 'liked' the business after reading the post, but less likely for those who had already liked the business.\n\nUnder contract law, the business's post is an offer to share the winnings with anyone who is a friend of the business on Facebook. A promise is enforceable if consideration is provided under a bargain; the consideration can be of nominal value (e.g. the act of 'liking' a page).\n\nIn the context of a business page, in a time when 'followers' and the like are regarded as valuable from a marketing perspective, it is entirely reasonable to interpret the post as offering an exchange of likes for a chance to win money. The commercial context and involvement of money would cause a court to presume that there was an intention to create a legally\\-binding contract (Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc (2002\\) 209 CLR 95; Banque Brussels Lambert SA v Australian National Industries Ltd (1989\\) 21 NSWLR 502\\).\n\nI am not entirely familiar with how the designation 'Friend' applies to businesses on Facebook. My understanding is that businesses have pages that are different to user pages. Businesses don't have 'friends'. They have people who 'like' the business. However, the word 'Friend' in the post has to be given content and therefore would be read as 'people who are listed as having liked this page'.\n\nPeople who had already liked the page are less likely to be able to enforce the promise to share the winnings, because they didn't do anything. They might be able to argue that they forwent the opportunity to un\\-like the business and that this forbearance is consideration. However, they would have to show that this was in consideration of the offer to share the winnings. \n\nContract law is based on objective manifestations of agreement, not subjective thoughts (Taylor v Johnson (1983\\) 151 CLR 422\\), so it isn't necessary to show that the individual did in fact have the offer in mind when they liked (or didn't un\\-like) the page. However, it is necessary that the promisee have knowledge of the offer and not be acting out of some completely separate purpose (R v Clarke (1927\\) 40 CLR 227\\); therefore if a user had liked the page some time ago and never knew about the offer until after the lottery was won, then they might have a hard time claiming a binding contract.\n\nAside from contract law, the other possible head of liability is equitable estoppel (I mention this particularly for the people who had already 'liked' the business page before the offer was posted). However, equitable estoppel usually requires some element of detrimental reliance. Leaving a pre\\-existing 'like' on a page in reliance on a promise to share lottery winnings is unlikely to stir a court to find an equitable estoppel, since the detriment is trivial. Contrast Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1988\\) 164 CLR 387, where the detrimental reliance was knocking down a building and starting to construct a replacement. Equitable remedies are discretionary, so the judge has plenty of leeway to not order compensation.\n\nThis answer is based on the common law. There is nothing in Texas law which would make the outcome any different to the outcome in any other common law jurisdiction."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A local bakery posts on their Facebook page: \"We just bought a lottery ticket for tonight's $10 million draw.

By liking the page immediately after seeing the post, she provided consideration (the act of liking) in direct response to the offer, creating a binding contract.\n\nB) Tom's claim is weaker. While he saw the post, he took no action. He might argue forbearance (not unliking), but this is a weaker position as he didn't actively do anything in response to the offer.\n\nC) Emma has no claim. She liked the page after the draw and without knowledge of the offer, so there was no contract formed.\n\nD) Mike has no claim. He didn't accept the offer by liking the page, regardless of his reasons. In contract law, subjective thoughts don't matter; only objective actions count.\n\nThe correct answer is A because Sarah's action most clearly meets the requirements for a binding contract: offer, acceptance (by liking), and consideration (the act of liking, which has value in a marketing context)."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24088/if-i-obfuscate-someone-elses-source-code-can-i-avoid-copyright-infringement", "docs_id": 24088, "title": "If I obfuscate someone else&#39;s source code, can I avoid copyright infringement?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know the answer is probably no, but I'm confused about something.

So anyone is free to say that they did some good act or some bad act, whether or not they actually did it. You can do this in a park, on the radio, in a book, a private journal, or a web page \\-\\- there is nothing legally special about online confession. The only legal restriction on self\\-incrimination is via the Fifth Amendment, where you cannot be forced to testify against yourself (you cannot even be forced to testify in favor of yourself). If you do elect to confess to some wrongdoing, whatever the venue may be, that statement can be used against you: examples are the [Steubenville rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case) and [Derek Medina's murder of his wife](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2548525/Derek-Medina-killed-wife-photo-body-Facebook-asks-judge-victims-remains-tested-BATH-SALTS-support-self-defense-claim.html). As to why the authorities don't bother to prosecute a kid who brags about getting (illegally) drunk over the weekend, they probably have less than the infinite amount of time needed to ferret out and pursue such cases, especially when there is no independent evidence that a crime was committed (which is kind of a necessary precondition for getting a conviction)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to U.S. law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding voluntary self-incrimination on the internet?\n\nA) It is illegal to admit to past crimes online, and websites allowing such admissions can be shut down.\n\nB) Self-incrimination online is protected by the Fifth Amendment and cannot be used as evidence in court.\n\nC) Admitting to past illegal activities online is legal, but authorities are required to investigate all such claims.\n\nD) Voluntary self-incrimination online is protected by the First Amendment, but such statements can potentially be used as evidence.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

Unless Joe gives you explicit permission to give that to somebody else, you can't just decide to unilaterally give what Joe gave you to somebody else. \n\nThis may be different if Joe said \"here, I'm buying you a subscription to service XYZ because you are a nice guy\", this may be construed as a gift which transfers ownership. At that point you have control over what is or isn't done with the account. \n\nAs another example let's say Joe let you borrow his car.

A hard to read seal or signature is even more common in legitimate cases due to low quality copying or a low quality printer. Printers and copiers are notoriously error prone as anyone who has worked in an office environment knows.\n\nOften a document is distributed in proof form, unsigned and sealed to the recipient, in order to allow proofreading of name spelling, etc., who may actually have earned the executed one but accidentally submit the unexecuted version to an employer.\n\nA document is only fabricated if the facts that it attests to are not true and it was made knowing that they were not true.\n\nUsually, a decent document fabricator will also include a fake signature or seal, so usually a lack of a signature or seal is an indication of either non\\-fabrication or an extremely amateur job of fabrication.\n\nIf you want to know if a document is fabricated, the surefire way to get to the truth is to contact the issuer of the document to determine if it is real thing.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the main effect of a lack of a signature or seal is that the document is likely to not be self\\-authenticating and may require more extrinsic proof to show that what it purports to demonstrate is really true.\n\n> Can the person be accused of falsifying documents, sued and so on?\n\nIf the document is actually false and was knowingly submitted as a false document, then the person who submitted the fabricated document has attempted to defraud the company and is not immunized from liability for that, necessarily, by the lack of a seal or signature.\n\nOf course, anyone can be accused of falsifying documents whether it is true or not.\n\nFraud in an application for employment is frequently a good cause ground for terminating someone's employment even if they could otherwise only be terminated for cause and not just at will. Indeed, when incidents of application fraud surface, such as a false statement made on a resume, the employee routinely is fired no matter who competent their performance on the job was. \n\nFor example, I recall a case of a university president who was fired for claiming to have a degree that wasn't actually earned, despite serving more or less competently.\n\nTo sue someone for fabricating a document the party to whom it was provided would have to show that the fraud caused them economic harm, which is something that would frequently be difficult or impossible to prove. And, in the absence of proof of harm, the question of whether the employer was justified in relying upon the fabricated document because it had no stamp or signature would never come up.\n\nUltimately the question of whether their reliance was justified would be a question of fact to be decided on a case by case basis, but for the reasons set forth in the first part of this answer, it is likely that the lack of a seal or signature would not make their reliance on the fabricated document, which was intended by the applicant, unjustified."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company discovers that an employee submitted an electronic version of a diploma during the hiring process that lacks a visible signature or stamp.

Usually, individuals and companies with a history of \"bad behavior\", are denied licensure. Each industries regulations and laws define what that bad behavior is, but a felony conviction for a financial related crime certainly meets that definition. However, being denied a license or booted from the industry is not automatic. The agencies that enforce these regulations, have the ability to continue to license someone who has a felony conviction.\n\nI know I am speaking in general terms, but let us look at the securities industry for a specific example.\n\nUnder the [Investment Company Act of 1940](https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/ica40.pdf), companies that manage investments/mutual funds, like J.P. Morgan \\& Chase, Co. must be licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. To paraphrase, Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act, it says that individuals cannot control or manage an investment company if they had a felony conviction on the past 10 years. It goes on to state that those same requirements apply to companies meaning they are denied a license. \n\nBut, section 9(c) allows \u201cpeople\u201d (which includes companies) that are prohibited from being licensed to get an **exemption** from these rules through the SEC's administrative process.\n\nHere, JP Morgan and the other companies mentioned in the press release are big players in the securities industry. All of them manage mutual funds and buy/sell securities for clients. Therefore, they each applied and received this exemption at the same time or right before they pleaded guilty so it wouldn\u2019t disrupt their business. Here are the administrative orders from the SEC\u2019s website dealing with this exact issue.\n\n* [J.P. Morgan Chase \\& Co., et al. \\- Notice of Application and Temporary Order Release No. IC 31613; File No. 812\\-14466](https://www.sec.gov/rules/ic/2015/ic-31613.pdf)\n* The permanent order: [SEC Release No. IC \\- 31674](https://www.sec.gov/rules/ic/2015/ic-31674.pdf)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the law that applies, these orders are a good place to start.\n\nAlso, here is a less detailed article on this issue in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/business/dealbook/5-big-banks-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-felony-charges-but-punishments-may-be-tempered.html?action=click&contentCollection=DealBook&module=RelatedCoverage)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, companies with felony convictions are generally prohibited from managing investments or mutual funds.

Let's also assume that you are docile, but don't consent: so you stick around. Even with all of these assumptions working against you, the sheriff cannot force you to take a drug test without a warrant. When he goes to the judge, the judge will not issue a warrant to force you to take a test. Drug tests are forms of searches, which are protected by the 4th Amendment, and they basically require \"probable cause\" to the effect that you had committed a crime. Given your description of the circumstances, there is no such probable cause (i.e. \"most likely that it is true\"). The threat to call the sheriff was empty, though perhaps sincerely believed (many people sincerely believe lots of wrong things about the law).\n\nYou can consent (sounds like you did): as far as I know, if you give in to a suggestion from a nurse that the sheriff will make you take the test (an untruth), that would not invalidate evidence derived from a voluntary search. Every citizen is expected (unreasonably) to know and follow the law, and it is expected that you will know that you have the right to refuse, so you cannot say \"But I didn't know I could refuse\". \n\nYou always have the right to refuse any medical treatment or testing. This is true even if your insurance requires you to take a certain test. There could be contractual consequences to violating the contract with your insurance company, but again you cannot be compelled to take a test or undergo a procedure because an insurance company \"requires\" you to. If, for example, your insurance company requires you to take a meth\\-abuse screening test, then *if* such a contract condition is legal in California, refusing to take the test could lead to some insurance problems, like they would cancel your policy.\n\nAs for financial liability for the test that you didn't really want but agreed to, there is a chance that you could argue in court that you were [coerced](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=52.1.) into the test and thus your apparent consent was not real. You have the right to refuse the test; if the other party, \"whether or not acting under color of law, interferes by threat, intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threat, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured by the Constitution or laws of this state\", then they crossed a legal line and you can sue them, plus any \"agreement\" that is coerced is null in the courts, and the putative debt arising from the test is also null. You simply have to establish that you were coerced, and not convinced."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In California, a patient with high blood pressure and facial sores is asked by a nurse to take a urine test for methamphetamine.

Patients have the right to refuse any medical treatment or testing, including drug tests. The nurse's threat to involve law enforcement is empty and unenforceable without a warrant. Even if the sheriff were called, they would need probable cause and a warrant to force a drug test, which this situation doesn't provide. \n\nA is incorrect because the sheriff cannot force a drug test without a warrant, even with the nurse's statement.\n\nB is incorrect because if the patient consents to the test, even under false pretenses, the evidence would likely still be admissible.

After that time, as mentioned in Andy's answer, they are required to turn it over to the state's unclaimed property office, who will hold it in the employee's name, indefinitely.

I have been unable to find any UK legislation which directly addresses 'do not cross' tape (also known as police tape, crime scene tape or [barricade tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barricade_tape)). However, the police have broad statutory and common law powers, and ignoring 'do not cross' tape could be an offence in the same way as ignoring other police orders.\n\nIn *Director of Public Prosecutions v Morrison* [\\[2003] EWHC 683 (Admin)](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/683.html), the High Court decided that at common law, **the police have the power to cordon off a crime scene**. Police had cordoned off an area to preserve evidence using tape labelled \"Police: Do not Cross\" \\[9]. The prosecution's case against the respondent was that, having been told not to enter the cordoned area, he challenged the police right to prohibit him from entering the area \\[10]. There was a dispute as to whether the respondent did cross the tape and other issues, but police ultimately arrested him for disorderly conduct \\[29].\n\nThe respondent was convicted in the Magistrates' Court of **disorderly conduct** under [s 5 of the *Public Order Act 1986*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/5) and **wilful obstruction** of a police constable under [s 89(2\\) of the *Police Act 1996*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) \\[1]. His conviction was set aside on appeal to the Crown Court, which found that the only statutory authority for setting up a cordon is in the *Terrorism Act 2000*, and the cordon had been established without the consent of the land owner or a warrant \\[17]. The relevant question for the High Court was:\n\n> Was the Wood Green Crown Court wrong in law to hold that the Metropolitan Police on the evidence in this case had no **lawful power or authority to close the public right of way over private premises by a cordon** and forcibly prohibit the Defendant from using that right of way on foot against his will \\[4]?\n\nThe answer is yes. The police have the power to cordon off a crime scene, but they must act reasonably:\n\n> \\[W]hen seeking to investigate crime police officers do not have an unfettered right to restrict movements on private land ... but ... \\[a]s Lord Denning said \\[in *Ghani v Jones* \\[1970] 1 QB 693] \"the police should be able to do whatever is necessary and reasonable to preserve the evidence of the crime\" ... **provided \\[the police] do not go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances, routine scenes of crime searches may assume the owner's consent** ... In the present case the police were entitled to assume consent ... we believe that consent could not lawfully be withheld \\[22]\u2013\\[23].\n\nSo the police have the power to restrict movements on private land and can use this power to cordon off a crime scene. The police can arrest someone who unlawfully enters a crime scene, which may amount to the offence of wilful obstruction. It is harder to answer the hypothetical question where there is nobody around to enforce the cordon. This is a broader question about land rights; the answer would depend on who was trying to enforce the cordon and why."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In England and Wales, police have cordoned off an area with \"Do Not Cross\" tape to preserve evidence at a potential crime scene on private property.

The key is that their actions must be reasonable and necessary for preserving evidence. The police can assume consent for routine crime scene searches, and in such cases, consent could not lawfully be withheld by the property owner. While the police don't have unfettered rights to restrict movement on private land, they can take necessary and reasonable steps to preserve evidence of a crime.

Still, on paper are any laws being violated by twitter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Federal laws prohibit false, deceptive, unfair etc. advertising, and there simply exists no federal law prohibiting advertising marijuana. Because of the First Amendment, there is no law prohibiting the advocacy of an illegal act. Because of the Commerce Clause, Congress could pass laws restricting commercial speech, as long as it passes strict scrutiny, see [Central Hudson Gas \\& Electric v Public Service Commission of New York](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/557/). However, \"For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading\". So Congress *could* pass a federal advertising ban. A state where marijuana is illegal can do likewise, but as you noted Twitter does not cross that line. [Washington allows](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-55-155) marijuana sales and advertising, however \"A cannabis licensee may not engage in advertising or marketing that specifically targets persons residing out of the state of Washington\" (not even Oregon where the herb is also legal). Still, the state attempted to limit advertising which resulted in [Plausible Products, LLC d/b/a Hashtag Cannabis v Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board](https://www.gleamlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FINALORDER.pdf). The ruling observes that\n\n> The State argues that, \u201c\\[f]or purposes of the first Central Hudson\n> test, marijuana activity cannot be considered to be \u2018lawful activity\u201d\n> where its use, possession, manufacture, and distribution remains\n> illegal under federal criminal law.\u201d\n\n\u00a72(B) analyses this rationale, quoting from New England\nAccessories Trade Ass\u2019n v. City of Nashua, 679 F.2d 1, where the New England\nAccessories court also considers that\n\u201cIf New York, or some\nother state, decided to legalize the sale and use of marijuana, New Hampshire would have\ngreater difficulty . . . prohibiting an advertisement suggesting that the Big Apple was the\nplace to get high on marijuana.\u201d The Plausible Products court then concluded\n\n> It follows that, where one state could not avoid Central Hudson\n> scrutiny for banning advertisement of Washington recreational\n> marijuana, neither can the State here avoid Central Hudson scrutiny on\n> the basis that recreational marijuana is still illegal under federal\n> law\n\nThere are other relevant tests applicable to restrictions on commercial speech \u2013  \n\nis the government's interest substantial, does the regulation directly advance that interest, and is it narrowly tailored. Presumably, the state interest would be in preventing underage consumption (accepted by the court). Another possible interest, rejected by the court, was \"not tipping off the feds\", with reference to the \"federal government\u2019s expectation of a strong and effective marijuana regulatory system\". But as the court noted, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded, and states cannot rely on it, thus the \"asserted interest in avoiding federal\nintervention is too elusive to amount to a substantial interest under Central Hudson\".\n\nThe Twitter restrictions on cannabis ads are very similar to the Washington state regulations on such advertising.

While cannabis remains federally illegal, there is no specific federal law prohibiting its advertising. The First Amendment provides some protection for commercial speech, but it can be restricted if it concerns unlawful activity.

The explanation states that the Constitution does not provide an explicit right to self-determination or bodily integrity. Instead, Roe v.

For example, in one case I read of man being prosecuted for \"rape of a child\", however the the alleged \"child\" was 16 years old: clearly past the age of puberty.\n\nSo, normally in the English language, a \"child\" is a pre\\-pubescent person\\-\\-in other words someone not sexually capable of procreating, which would mean 13 years old at the latest. However, apparently in legal sphere and the press there is a tendency to describe teenagers who are clearly sexually capable as \"children\" and this is obviously being done to demonize those who commit sex crimes against teenagers and increase the severity of the crime.\n\nI searched for the legal definition of a \"child\" under Massachusetts law and could not find any definition. So, is it just ambiguous what the word \"child\" means in Massachusetts? What about US Federal law. Is there a legal standard of what constitutes a \"child\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [canada](/questions/tagged/canada \"show questions tagged 'canada'\")\n\nThe term \"child\" is expressly defined for various offences. For example, for [s. 172](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-172-20190919.html):\n\n> child means a person who is or appears to be under the age of eighteen years.\n\nThe offence of \"[child pornography](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-163.1.html)\" is expressly defined to relate to \"a person who is or is depicted as being under the age of eighteen years.\"\n\nThe offence of \"[child luring](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-172.1-20150717.html#wb-cont)\" has several variants, for luring those who are or who the accused believes to be under the age of 18, 16, or 14\\. They are all called \"child luring.\"\n\nOther sections criminalize conduct in relation to a child without defining the term. See e.g. [s. 243](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-243.html):\n\n> Every person who in any manner disposes of the dead body of a child, with intent to conceal the fact that its mother has been delivered of it, whether the child died before, during or after birth, is guilty...\n\nFor s. 243, courts had to conduct statutory interpretation in order to determine the meaning of the word \"child.\" The Supreme Court of Canada held that \"child\" in this offence includes children born alive and fetuses that were likely to have been born alive. See *R. v. Levkovic*, [2013 SCC 25](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13031/index.do).\n\nI know this is Canadian law, rather than Massachusetts law, but one thing you can take away from this is that terms can take on distinct legal meanings from one provision to another. And where a term is not expressly defined in statute, its meaning will be enunciated by a court. These meanings need not line up with the definitions you find in a dictionary.\n\nBut, for a general description from a specialized dictionary, see *Black's Law Dictionary*, 10th ed. (2014\\):\n\n> **child**. **1**. An unemancipated person under the age of majority. **2**. *Hist*. At common law, a person who has not reached the age of 14\\. **3**. A boy or girl; a young person. **4**. A son or daughter. **5**. A baby or fetus."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In legal terminology, which of the following statements about the definition of \"child\" is most accurate?\n\nA) The term \"child\" always refers to a person under 13 years old in all legal contexts.\nB) \"Child\" has a consistent definition across all legal statutes and jurisdictions.\nC) The legal definition of \"child\" can vary depending on the specific statute or context.\nD) Courts never need to interpret the meaning of \"child\" as it's always explicitly defined in law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As demonstrated in the information provided, the legal definition of \"child\" can vary depending on the specific statute or context. For example, in Canadian law, different sections define \"child\" differently:\n\n- Some statutes explicitly define a child as a person under 18 years old.\n- The definition can change based on the nature of the offense (e.g., child pornography, child luring).\n- In some cases, courts have had to interpret the meaning of \"child\" when it's not explicitly defined in the statute.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the age of 13 is not a universal legal definition of a child. Answer B is incorrect because the definition is not consistent across all statutes and jurisdictions. Answer D is incorrect because, as shown in the example of Section 243 in Canadian law, courts sometimes need to interpret the meaning of \"child\" when it's not explicitly defined.\n\nThis question tests the understanding that legal definitions can be context-dependent and may require judicial interpretation, rather than assuming a single, universal definition applies in all cases."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52954/how-do-will-holders-discover-the-will-maker-has-died", "docs_id": 52954, "title": "How do will holders discover the will maker has died?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My question relates to the UK, though the question could apply to other locales.\n\nSay I lodge a will with a legal representative in one part of the country (or even in another country) and years later in another part of the country or world I pass away; how does / should / will the legal representative know that I am deceased and that the will should be executed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the UK, there is no requirement for a will to be registered anywhere, and it does not have to be drawn up by a legal practitioner. The deceased might have downloaded a form from the Internet, filled it in as best they could, then stuffed it in a drawer. Many people also do not have a will at all.\n\nIf there is a will, then it ought to name an \"executor\" (someone who can take charge of the deceased's affairs according to their wishes), who ideally would be someone who is still alive and willing to do it. If those conditions fail then an estate administrator can be appointed, and if there's no will then the administrator must follow the default rules for \"intestacy\". Often, the executor is someone within the circle of the deceased's family and friends who would find out about the death fairly quickly, and is already armed with some knowledge about where to find the will itself. People may also choose their bank (who would also soon be in the loop in the event of death) or their solicitor, either of whom might be looking after the original will.\n\nIf the will and executor do not emerge organically as news spreads, then someone will have to take responsibility for finding the deceased's will, or confirming that they don't have one. Helpful hints will include \\-\n\n* remembering things the deceased said during their lifetime, such as \"my will is in the shoebox in the spare room wardrobe\" or \"I've named cousin Alfred as my executor\" or \"Flybynight LLP was really helpful\"\n* going through their papers to find a will, a solicitor's invoice, or anything like that\n* calling around local legal firms to see if any of them have acted for the deceased\n* searching the \"[National Will Register](https://www.nationalwillregister.co.uk/)\" in case the will happens to be there (despite what the name might suggest, registration there is entirely optional).\n\nIt often happens that firms close down, change names, are bought by others, etc., and so the relevant solicitors may be completely different from the ones who were involved in originally writing the will. Practice rules mean that the documents still ought to be retained, but many things can happen over a long period of time.\n\nThere is no automatic system for notifying others in the event of a death. The government in Great Britain operates a scheme called \"Tell Us Once\" for updating all government departments, but the private sector does not hook in to this. Sometimes, people place notices in the [Gazette](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/): see the category \"missing wills\", as well as \"next of kin\" for finding relatives of the deceased. (The reason for this is that notices of probate are also placed in the Gazette, to identify creditors of the deceased who might have a claim on the estate, and so relevant parties nationwide could have their eyes on the Gazette already.)\n\nSomething else to note is that when following the practices above, there may be several wills found, as well as \"codicils\" (which are amendments to wills), and any documents found might not actually be valid. Perhaps the form downloaded from the Internet did not get witnessed before it was stuffed in a drawer. It can be a bit of work to identify the last valid will.\n\nThe reader may well feel that the situation described above is not optimal..."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a UK citizen, passed away unexpectedly while on vacation in Spain.

If it is unlawful, is the offending (discriminatory) license clause invalidated (i.e. it is not part of the license), or does the clause remain valid but subject the licensor to liability for a discrimination lawsuit?\n\nFor example, any of the following hypothetical license clauses could be considered discriminatory under my definition above:\n\n* Persons with epilepsy must purchase an additional $50 Epilepsy License Rider in order to use this software. Purchasing this rider does not grant you access to epilepsy\\-related services, but only allows you to use this software despite having a medical diagnosis that would otherwise disqualify you from holding a license. If you hold a valid license to use this software and receive a new diagnosis of epilepsy, you shall have 30 days to purchase a Rider before your license to use the software terminates as a result of your disability.

Similarly, why someone would want to use software whose owner wants to forbid them from using it for discriminatory reasons is also out of scope.\n\nI am aware that some software might represent niche areas of interest that would appeal primarily to members of certain protected groups. For example, an app for Talmud study would probably appeal primarily to Jewish users and not, for example, to Muslims, Buddhists, or Scientologists. My question could be whether I could lawfully publish a Talmud study app that only Jews are licensed to use or whether doing this would either invalidate the restrictive license clause (allowing non\\-Jewish people to license the app for the same price or under the same conditions as anyone else) or subject me to liability for discrimination.\n\nIn response to Neil Meyer, I am not asking whether there is a distinction in law between lawful discrimination like choosing who to date or whose products to buy for personal use and unlawful discrimination like deciding not to hire people from a certain racial group for my business. I know that such a distinction is made and that it is not illegal for me to refuse a date on racial grounds or decide to quit my job because I discovered that the company was affiliated with a religion I disapprove of. I am not asking about what discrimination means, I am asking if what is commonly considered unlawful discrimination in public accommodation, employment, etc. is legal *if it relates only to software licenses*. For example, if I publish a \"Standard Edition\" of my software for $50 and then a \"Special Low\\-Cost Edition for White People Only\" at $20 with an EULA that specifies that the license is void if purchased by a non\\-white person, is that legal as long as I disclose what I am doing (e.g. on the box or on my website)?\n\nIn response to a comment by gnasher729, this question has nothing to do with Scientology per se. I am simply using it as an example of a religion. In the USA, Scientology is considered a bona\\-fide religion under law and it is unlawful to discriminate against Scientologists in the same way that it is unlawful to discriminate against Russian Orthodox believers, Wiccans, or members of the Holy Family Temple of Pentecostal Righteousness under God Sabaoth.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generally held (see [this article](https://nonprofitlawblog.com/anti-discrimination-laws-section-1981/)) that contracts are subject to [42 USC 1981](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1981)\n\n> All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have\n> the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce\n> contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and\n> equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons\n> and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to\n> like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of\n> every kind, and to no other\n\nand the wording of the license conditions clearly shows a the \"but\\-for\" discrimination cited in the primary holding of [Comcast v.

Insurance companies charge you differently based on what and how many vehicles you want covered, so wouldn't borrowing someone's Lamborghini suddenly open your insurance company to a massive risk without their knowledge again?\n\n---\n\nMy guess would be that only my own insurance should matter for this regardless of what car I use, but I don't know how insurance companies do their risk modeling.\n\nIf they think people might be riskier with different cars (e.g. maybe I'm riskier with stick\\-shift than with automatic transmission, I don't know...) then I could see this not automatically being the case, since suddenly I have a higher chance of having an accident and harming someone else, and they might demand more to protect against that. Or maybe the other driver's insurance comes into play too, maybe because, who knows, insurance companies might think risky people are more likely to lend to risky people. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Let's say one of us borrows the other one's car (with permission) and\n>  has an accident.\n> \n> \n> Whose coverage is responsible at that point to satisfy the legally\n>  mandated insurance coverage?\n> \n> \n> I assume that's only coverage against damage to others (which should\n>  go under liability insurance?) but if I'm wrong please correct me.\n\nThere are different types of insurance that may be required:\n\n* **liability insurance** \\- pays damage to others (usually including your own passengers) which you are responsible for. This is legally required almost everywhere (both in the USA, where this depends on the state, and elsewhere). Rules vary on the required minimum amount, and the exact coverage (e.g. whether lost wages are covered in case of injury).\n* **uninsured motorist coverage** \\- pays damages you or others suffered, which are the responsibility of another driver who is not insured. This is mandatory in some states of the USA. In some other countries, these damages are covered by a public insurance or trust (such as the [Verkehrsopferhilfe](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsopferhilfe) in Germany).\n* **personal injury protection** \\- pays your own medical costs, no matter who is at fault. Required in some states of the USA.\n\n> Is the lender's insurance supposed to cover it?\n\nThis depends on the insurance policy, but in almost all cases **the policy is for the vehicle** (and often has to be, under the laws requiring insurance). So if yes, if you lend your car to someone else, your insurance will cover them. Note, however, that some insurance policies restrict your right to lend your car \\- read the fine print!\n\nThere is one situation where your own policy may be relevant:\nIf the damages exceed the limit of the vehicle's insurance policy, your own policy *may* pay the rest \\- again, this will depend on the policy.\n\n> If so, wouldn't this not make sense? Insurance companies look at your \n>  driving history (\\& risk) when they offer you a plan, and if the borrower\n>  has a poor history, you've increased the company's risk without their\n>  knowledge, right? It would seem to open insurance rates to abuse.\n\nYes, exactly. That is why many (if not most) insurance policies place limits on lending your car. You may only be allowed to lend it to people over 21 years of age, or only to people who you have registered as car users with the insurance company.\n\n> Is the borrower's insurance supposed to cover it?\n>  If so, wouldn't this not make sense?\n>  Insurance companies charge you differently based on what and how many\n>  vehicles you want covered, so wouldn't borrowing someone's Lamborghini \n>  suddenly open your insurance company to a massive risk without their \n>  knowledge again?\n\nNo, the borrower's insurance does not usually apply.\n\nMaking the borrower's insurance apply would be problematic because the risk is based on the vehicle (type), too.\n\nAlso, the borrower may not have insurance (e.g. may not own a car). In particular, enforcing the mandatory liability insurance is easier in practice if it is per vehicle, because you can check the insurance at vehicle registration (which practically all countries already require). If the liability insurance were per driver, it would be difficult to prevent a person w/o insurance to borrow a car (as in your example).\n\nFinally, sometimes after an accident there is a dispute about who was driving the car (especially with hit\\-and\\-run accidents), but there is usually clear evidence (collision damage) what vehicle was involved. If insurance applies to the vehicle, a dispute over who was driving will not interfere with the victim's restitution.Thanks to supercat for pointing this out."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John borrows his friend Sarah's car for a day trip.

In most cases, car insurance follows the car, not the driver. This means that Sarah's insurance policy for the borrowed vehicle would be primarily responsible for covering the damages caused by John while driving her car. This is because insurance policies are typically tied to the vehicle rather than the individual driver.\n\nOption A is incorrect because John's personal car insurance policy typically wouldn't be the primary coverage when he's driving someone else's vehicle.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that there might be situations where John's policy could come into play (e.g., if the damages exceed Sarah's policy limits), but Sarah's policy would be the primary coverage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, assuming Sarah has valid insurance on her vehicle, it should cover permitted drivers even if they're not listed on the policy (unless there are specific restrictions in the policy against lending the car).\n\nThis question tests understanding of how car insurance typically works when borrowing vehicles, which is an important concept in personal liability and insurance law."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11941/when-is-a-subtenant-entitled-to-have-their-security-deposit-returned", "docs_id": 11941, "title": "When is a subtenant entitled to have their security deposit returned?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Halfway through last year, I subleased my apartment unit and moved to a new location.

It is the State's attorney's job to turn over all evidence in discovery to the defense; to only prosecute people they believe are guilty or likely guilty; and to remedy clear and convincing false prosecutions as outlined in [ABA rule 3\\.8](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_8_special_responsibilities_of_a_prosecutor.html) which is echoed in many state laws.\n\n> Rule 3\\.8: The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:  \n> \n>  (a) refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause;...\n> \n> \n> ...(d) make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal;...\n> \n> \n> ..(h) When a prosecutor knows of clear and convincing evidence establishing that a defendant in the prosecutor\u2019s jurisdiction was convicted of an offense that the defendant did not commit, the prosecutor shall seek to remedy the conviction.\n\nIf this new exonerating evidence is turned over to the prosecutor they would be required to submit it to the defense and the trial would likely be postponed for both sides to evaluate the new evidence. If they suppress the evidence it would be grounds for appeal and disbarment of the prosecuting attorney. \n\nIt is not the officer's job to direct the trial, just supply evidence that supports the truth. But it also wouldn't help if the State's own witness suddenly started offering testimony contrary to supporting guilt and in light of new evidence the prosecution may reevaluate to not have this happen.\n\nThe Ethical Answer:\n===================\n\nKind of sticky going into ethics and the exact right response to this situation, but it sounds like the answer you want.\n\nAssuming an ethical prosecutor the this would be the same as the legal answer.

Clearly it can't take forever, but there must be some limit, especially in the case of shares, whose value will fluctuate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Clearly it can't take forever, but there must be some limit,\n> especially in the case of shares, whose value will fluctuate.\n\nWhen a publicly held company declares a dividend or distribution, it does so with an effective date and the owner of shares on the effective date receives the dividend.\n\nWhen shares are transferred at a later date by person who owned the shares on the effective of the dividend, those shares are call \"ex dividend\" and the sale does not include a right to receive that distribution which is paid to the owner as of the effective date of the dividend.\n\nDistributions on account of shares of stock are also always denominated on a \"per share\" basis, not as a percentage of value, so the fluctuating value of shares is irrelevant.\n\nWhen the distribution has to be distributed after the effective date of the dividend is a matter of state law and of the governing documents of the corporation. In the absence of an express direction, the distribution must be made within a \"reasonable time\". If it is not, the shareholder could sue to corporation to compel it to make the dividend declared and could also be awarded interest at a statutory rate or a rate set forth in the governing documents of the corporation from the effective date of the dividend, and court costs (but in all likelihood not attorney fees).\n\nIn practice, the mechanics is distributing dividends from publicly held companies is a bit more involved than this simple scenario, however. Ownership of the vast majority of publicly held stock is not held in the name of the true owner in the books and records of the corporation.\n\nInstead, most shares are held by an intermediary institution in the institution's name called a \"street name\" and then the intermediary institution handles ownership registration of the shares either to the true owners, or to brokerage firms or mutual funds, which in turn hold the shares for the benefit of their customers.\n\nTypically, the publicly held corporation will wire transfer the total amount of the dividend payable to the 90%\\-99% of the corporation held in a street name to the street name intermediary firm on the effective date of the dividend. Then, the task of breaking up that sum of money to particular registered owners of the shares as of the effective date of the dividend, and of issuing 1099s to the recipients of the dividends, is handled by the intermediary firm.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, like a power grid failure affecting the relevant banks, or a natural disaster, or \"bank holiday\", the dividend is wired to the intermediary and a handful of direct owners of the shares in the company listed on the books and records of the company, typically within a few business days and as soon as is reasonably practicable. There is almost never a hitch in the distribution timing at this level in a publicly held corporation.\n\nThe intermediary firm's duties to distribute the dividends received from the corporation itself to the registered owners (some of whom may be brokerage firms holding shares for their customers) is governed by a contract of adhesion entered into between the corporation that hires the intermediary firm to handle this for it on an outsourced basis, and the intermediary firm, which binds the shareholders of the corporation.\n\nIn cases where the street name intermediary lists the owner of the shares as a brokerage account or mutual fund, the obligations of the brokerage account or mutual fund once the dividend of shares or money is received by it from the intermediary is governed by a contract of adhesion between the brokerage company and the customer in the case of shares held in a brokerage account, and between the fund and the members of the fund in a mutual fund.\n\nIn these cases, dividends are credited to the beneficial owner's account *nunc pro tunc* the date that the stock is received by the brokerage company or fund (or even to the effective date of the dividend in some cases), and the transfer from a brokerage account or fund to the actual customer, for example, in a check or wire transfer of a cash dividend, is sometimes only actually executed upon the request of the customer and is otherwise held in a money market account created for the customer until that transfer is effected in accordance with the contract between the customer and the brokerage or fund.\n\nThe default in all of these cases (distributions from intermediaries, from brokerages, and from funds) is \"reasonable time\", but the contracts with the customers are generally much more specific.\n\nAlso, while, in theory, this issue can be litigated in court, in practices, all \"back office\" functions involved in administering securities of publicly held companies are subject to securities industry arbitration agreements and so the disputes are actually handled in a specialized securities industry arbitration forum that is for all practical purposes, impossible to appeal and based upon an arbitrator's analysis that is not necessarily publicly disclosed to anyone but the parties to the dispute."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A publicly traded company declares a dividend with an effective date of March 1st.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The shareholder can immediately sue the publicly traded company for failing to distribute the dividend in a timely manner.\n\nB) The brokerage firm is in violation of securities law for not transferring the dividend to the shareholder's account within 30 days.\n\nC) The shareholder's recourse depends on the terms of their agreement with the brokerage firm and may involve securities industry arbitration rather than a court case.\n\nD) The intermediary firm is solely responsible for the delay and must pay interest to the shareholder from March 1st until the dividend is received.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The distribution process involves multiple steps and entities. The public company has fulfilled its immediate obligation by transferring funds to the intermediary firm. The intermediary then distributes to registered owners, including brokerage firms. The brokerage firm's obligations to its customers are governed by their contract of adhesion. The timing and method of transferring dividends to individual accounts can vary based on this agreement. If there's a dispute, it would likely be handled through securities industry arbitration as specified in most brokerage agreements, rather than in court.
