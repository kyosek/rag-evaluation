        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential liability for sharing observations that inadvertently lead to criminal activity?\n\nA) A person can be held criminally liable for sharing any information that results in a crime, regardless of their intent.\n\nB) Sharing observations about security vulnerabilities is always considered conspiracy and is punishable by law.\n\nC) An individual is generally not criminally liable for sharing public observations without criminal intent, due to the lack of mens rea.\n\nD) Posting information about potential criminal opportunities online automatically makes one an accessory to any resulting crimes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In UK law, criminal liability typically requires both the actus reus (guilty act) and mens rea (guilty mind or intent). Sharing observations made from public information, without the intent to facilitate a crime, generally lacks the necessary mens rea for criminal liability. The prosecution must prove criminal intent, which is absent in the scenario described. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate liability without considering intent. Option B is incorrect as it mischaracterizes the nature of conspiracy and ignores the element of intent. While caution is advisable when sharing sensitive information, merely making an observation without criminal intent is unlikely to result in criminal liability."

B did not lie about his identity.\n\nLater A find out that B is actually not her boyfriend. Does A has reasonable ground to claim it a sexual assault (or rape, or other similar offense)?\n\nAnswer from US, Canada, Europe, or any other countries is welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [canada](/questions/tagged/canada \"show questions tagged 'canada'\")\n\n### Avoiding an overly literal reading of your assertion that \"both sides consent\"\n\nThe *actus reus* of sexual assault is sexual touching without the consent of the complainant.\n\nIn your scenario, you say that \"both sides\" consented. If this is truly the case, then there is no sexual assault.\n\nBut I don't think you meant to say this. As I explain below, in order to consent, A must not have been mistaken about the identity of B: A could not have thought that B was C. If she was mistaken, as you assert in the title and in the second paragraph, then she was not consenting at law in Canada.\n\nThus, I will assume you have used \"consent\" more colloquially, and move on to assess the scenario in which A merely \"consented\" in the sense that she was not physically or otherwise coerced into the physical acts.\n\n### Can mistaken identity result in sexual assault? Yes\n\nIn your scenario, where A thought B was C, the *actus reus* of sexual assault has occured: sexual touching without A's subjective consent. This is because consent is linked to the identity of the partner (see *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17800/index.do) at para. 88\\).\n\nSee also *R. v. Hutchinson*, [2014 SCC 19 at para. 57\\-58, 63](https://canlii.ca/t/g62cv#par57):\n\n> **a complainant\u2019s mistaken belief about the identity of the partner** or the sexual nature of the act \u2014 whether or not that mistake is the result of a deception \u2014 **will result in no consent** under s. 273\\.1(1\\) of the Criminal Code.\"\n\n> ... if a complainant agrees to sexual activity with A, who is a specific individual known personally to her, she is not agreeing to sexual activity with B\n\n> ... the Ontario Court of Appeal in *R. v. G.C.*, [2010 ONCA 451](https://canlii.ca/t/2b6nr), 266 O.A.C. 299, leave to appeal refused, \\[2010] 3 S.C.R. v, adopted this approach and held that the complainant\u2019s belief that the partner was her boyfriend when it was in fact his identical twin resulted in no consent to the \u201csexual activity in question\u201d under s. 273\\.1 of the Criminal Code. (See also *R. v. O.A.*, [2013 ONCA 581](https://canlii.ca/t/g0qcv), 310 O.A.C. 305\\.)\n\nSince A was mistaken about the identity of the partner, there was no consent.\n\nB may very well have a defence available: mistaken belief in communicated consent (*R. v. Barton*). This defence asserts that the accused did not possess the *mens rea* of sexual assault (which is knowing of the lack of consent, or being reckless as to the lack of consent). This defence asserts that, despite A not consenting, B believed that A did consent. This was the attempted defence in *G.C.* and *O.A.*, cited above.\n\nFor this defence to be successful, B's belief in A's communicated consent must be based on reasonable steps taken by B to ascertain consent. Whether the steps taken by B were reasonable depends on what was known to B at the time.\n\n> the accused must take steps that are objectively reasonable, and the reasonableness of those steps must be assessed in light of the circumstances known to the accused at the time\n\nIn your scenario, you have not asserted that there is anything *known to B* about \"similar facial characteristics \\[he shares] with A's boyfriend.\" However\n\n* if it is well\\-known to B that he looks like C, and\n* depending on how similar the features are, and\n* depending on what B knew about A's ability to discern the difference between B and C\n\nthis might put an obligation on B to affirmatively confirm with crystal clear language that A knows that B is not C, failing which, he would not have the defence of mistaken belief in communicated consent. For example, in *G.C.* (the identical\\-twin case), \"\\[t]he trial judge recited the relevant facts of that night known to the appellant and concluded that without doing more than he did to make his identity perfectly clear to the complainant, the appellant could not be said to have taken reasonable steps necessary to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.\"\n\n---\n\nAnticipating comments that will always come up about evidence: this answer intentionally skips over questions like \"how would you prove X in court.\" This answer only says what the law is and what would have to be proven. If you would like to read about evidence and how to prove facts in court, please see [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86825/how-do-you-prove-a-fact-at-issue-in-litigation) to the question [How do you prove a fact at issue in litigation?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86825/how-do-you-prove-a-fact-at-issue-in-litigation)",

B did not actively deceive A about his identity. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Since both A and B physically consented to the act, no sexual assault has occurred.\n\nB) B is guilty of sexual assault, as A's mistaken belief about his identity negates her consent, and B has no possible legal defense.\n\nC) While the actus reus of sexual assault may be present due to A's lack of subjective consent, B may have a defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent if he took reasonable steps to ascertain consent given the circumstances.\n\nD) A's mistaken belief about B's identity is irrelevant to the question of consent as long as B did not actively lie about who he was.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex issues of consent and mistaken identity in Canadian sexual assault law. Option C is correct because:\n\n1. According to Canadian law, A's mistaken belief about B's identity means there was no valid consent, satisfying the actus reus of sexual assault.\n\n2. However, B may have a defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent if he can show he took reasonable steps to ascertain consent given what he knew at the time.\n\n3. The reasonableness of B's actions would depend on factors like whether he knew he resembled C, how similar they actually looked, and what B knew about A's ability to distinguish between them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because consent in law requires more than just physical willingness - it must be informed consent to the specific person. Option B is too absolute, as B may have a possible defense. Option D is incorrect because Canadian law explicitly states that mistaken identity can negate consent, even without active deception."

So they can leave early and still get paid the full 8 hours. I think management is trying to say it's an error in on boarding but it's been a month. Further, when doing the closing shift we are told to finish the closing duties as quick as possible and clock out as quick as possible (probably so the company saves money).

You can tell the police you want a lawyer before answering questions. Generally speaking, this should result in the police leaving you alone, giving you time to reach out to an attorney on your own timeline.\n\nThis is of course a bit more complicated if you've already been arrested, but in most cases, you'll still be able to make calls out of jail to try to find a lawyer. If you have serious concerns about this kind of situation, having an attorney on retainer would be a good idea.\n\nThe business end of the transaction is fairly simple. You would likely sign an engagement agreement with the lawyer in which you agree to pay a modest sum \\-\\- $500 or $1,000, imagine, and the lawyer would agree to take your calls when they come in and swoop in to deal with the police as necessary.

It suggests that for those with serious concerns, having an attorney on a modest retainer is a good idea.

The apartment was in a good state, pretty much the same as when it was visited. I'm asking the landlord to refund this.\n\nThe lease says \"(iii) clean Premises, if necessary, upon termination of the tenancy;\". It doesn't mention professional cleaning.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Santa Clara, California, is moving out of an apartment. The lease states that the tenant must \"clean Premises, if necessary, upon termination of the tenancy\" but does not specify professional cleaning. The tenant cleans the apartment themselves, leaving it in a similar condition to when they first viewed it. The landlord charges $450 for professional cleaning from the security deposit without prior discussion. What is the most appropriate course of action for the tenant?\n\nA) Accept the charge as the landlord has the right to ensure professional cleaning.\nB) Negotiate with the landlord to split the cleaning costs.\nC) File a complaint with the local housing authority.\nD) Request a full refund of the cleaning charge and, if refused, consider small claims court.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Based on the information provided, the landlord's actions are not justified. The lease only requires cleaning \"if necessary\" and doesn't specify professional cleaning. The tenant cleaned the apartment themselves, leaving it in good condition. The landlord should have discussed any concerns before deducting from the security deposit. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the landlord doesn't have the right to charge for professional cleaning without prior agreement, especially when the lease doesn't specify it. \n\nOption B is not appropriate because the tenant shouldn't have to pay for unnecessary cleaning that wasn't agreed upon. \n\nOption C might be an option, but it's not the most direct or efficient approach. \n\nOption D is the best course of action. The tenant should first request a refund of the cleaning charge. If the landlord refuses, the tenant can then pursue the matter in small claims court, as suggested in the documentation. This approach follows the proper legal channels for resolving security deposit disputes in California."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to [this article](http://evonomics.com/maximizing-shareholder-value-dumbest-idea/) corporations prior to the 1970s were run differently; until the idea that Milton Freidman put forth that a corporation's job was to maximize shareholder value; before that bondholders, suppliers, and employees had equal limited legal rights with the shareholders; quoting from the article:\n\n> \"In this regard, shareholders stand on equal footing with the\n>  corporation\u2019s bondholders, suppliers, and employees, all of whom also\n>  enter contracts with the firm that give them limited legal rights.\"\n\nWhat were these limited legal rights, and how was this different from the way corporations worked post Milton Friedman?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, there was no material change in the law, this is a misunderstanding (to some extent a misunderstanding intended by the author) of what is being explained. The change being discussed is actually a change in how economists and corporate law theorists think about corporations. \n\nThe basics of corporate law did not change significantly in the 1970s. There were some minor changes starting to take place then in law and practice, however. \n\nThe most notable of these were the rise of insider trading laws with real bite, the innovation in financial practice of the leveraged buy\\-out which precipitated \"poison pill\" defense from board of directors, and the surge in CEO pay often in the form of stock options. \n\nThere has been a shift in perspective and framing of the issues, but these changes are not huge changes in corporate law *per se*. Legal decisions allowing \"poison pills\" were minor anti\\-shareholder rights innovations. Tax laws encouraging stock option compensation were minor shareholder value oriented innovations. The theoretical basis of insider trading laws is a doctrinal muddle. No one conception of the corporation is completely dominant today and drives all legal theory and policy decisions.\n\nSecondly, Lynn Stout is engaged in a misleading bit of ret\\-con in her article and is presenting a misleading history of the evolution of corporate law scholarship. \n\nThis history, by the way, isn't terribly old. The right to form a corporation without a specific piece of authorizing legislation of the kind that creates a government agency, for example, is only about 150 years old or so, and both internationally and until quite recently, was much harder to form (e.g. many countries, such as South Korea, require proof that a corporation has insurance in place and sufficient capital to pay its debts before it is allowed to incorporate \\- corporate law firms still face some of these restrictions in the U.S.) Before then, each corporation was an individual legislative concept to some extent.\n\nThe notion that corporations should maximize shareholder well being, because they own the corporation, is the older and traditional view. Milton Friedman and the authors of \"The Theory of The Firm\" were simply restating the consensus view in a more focused and economically defined manner, not innovating. These pieces were published as apologies for that traditional view once it started to be challenged.\n\nThe view of a corporation as a web of contractual relationship with bondholders, suppliers, employees, customers and shareholders is the more modern view that started to gain currency sometime around the 1960s and 1970s, which is why people like Milton Friedman felt the need to articulate a defense of the traditional view that had previously merely been assumed and gone unchallenged. \n\nThe web of contracts theory was articulated initially to a great extent by corporate law theorists seeking to provide a theoretical justification for corporations to act in a responsible manner that treats its employees well, behaves honestly, goes above and beyond its legal obligations to honor the spirit as well as the letter of the law, etc.\n\nSome of the most notable corporate law responses to that theory are the law of publicly held companies in Germany, which requires that employees have a minority number of seats on the board of directors of a company, and the laws in some Scandinavian countries that call for rough gender parity on corporate boards of directors. There have also been a smattering of laws passed at least authorizing corporations to consider factors other than profit maximization.\n\nAnother related version of corporate theory to the web of contract theory is the \"director primacy\" conception of the corporation that sees a corporate board of directors as the hub of that web of contracts and the body which corporate law should protect the power of. [Professor Stephen Bainbridge](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/about.html) at UCLA Law is one of the leading proponents of this minority view of corporate law which was starting to emerge in the 1980s to justify efforts by corporate boards to defend themselves from the emerging threats of leveraged buyouts and proxy fights.\n\nBainbridge's view is nonetheless significant because it is an overarching theory that explains a variety of major corporate law doctrines, particularly in Delaware, whose law is dominant in the governance of publicly held corporations, that seem to be at odds with a shareholder primacy view of corporate law. It can explain the legitimacy of both \"poison pills\" and large CEO pay packages, the Delaware court's hostility to derivative suits, and its hostility to shareholder activism. To some extent, the \"director primacy\" view of corporate law is the web of contracts theory twisted and seen through a conservative lens that uses the theory to urge the law to crush the kind of shareholder activism for social good and employee rights that the original web of contracts sought to advance.\n\nThe rights of everyone other than a shareholder in a corporation are simply contract law rights \\- bond contracts, purchase and sale contracts, employment contracts, etc. \n\nThe web of contracts theory argues that the legal rights of shareholders vis\\-a\\-vis a corporation really aren't that different and that this relationship is really more like any other contract right rather than really being a genuine ownership relationship like the kind of ownership someone has over their other property that should be entitled to special consideration. \n\nThis view has a lot to do with the fact that in publicly held companies, in reality, shareholders have no meaningful role in the governance of the corporation or selection of members of the board of directors via the occasional Soviet style ballots for directors that they complete. Instead, in this context, shareholders apply the \"Wall Street Rule\" and sell stocks of companies that they feel are ill governed and don't worry too much about their practical inability to compel dividend distributions since they can take profits from retained earns by selling their stocks. This makes them look more like people with any other commodity to trade with purely contract and not political/ownership rights. This view doesn't translate well to closely held corporations where shareholder governance rights, in practice, are much more meaningful.\n\nAlso, for completeness, it is worth noting yet another emerging view of corporate law theory, developed mostly by liberals who favor campaign finance restrictions for corporations and want to restrain what they see as abuses of power by big business. This is the anti\\-corporate personhood movement that questions the assumption of all previous theorists that corporations should be treated in most respects as a \"person\" under the law. \n\nFor what it is worth, in my opinion, this movement improperly conflates abuses and power divisions that arise from businesses being very large and those attributable to the corporate form of business organization itself which actually can be very helpful in regulating businesses and redressing the harms that individuals suffer from corporate activities, by making it unnecessary to identify who within the corporation in particular causes a harm attributable to the corporation in litigation and regulatory contexts.",

The documentation explains that the \"web of contracts\" theory, which views a corporation as a network of relationships between various stakeholders, emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a challenge to the traditional shareholder primacy view. This theory was initially developed to justify more socially responsible corporate behavior.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the legal rights were not fundamentally altered; the change was more in economic theory and corporate governance philosophy.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the documentation states that there was no material change in corporate law in the 1970s, only minor changes and shifts in perspective.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the director primacy view, as explained in the text, actually emerged as a way to justify corporate board defenses against shareholder activism and leveraged buyouts, not to promote them."

But the Senate can, by vote, change its rules at any time. This could include a change back to a previous rule.\n\nI should mention that the previous rule did not strictly **require** a super\\-majority vote.

Holding things up in this way is known as a \"filibuster\" for historical reasons.\n\nThe Senate rules do not permit some measures to be filibustered. A few years ago, a then Republican majority changed the rules so that Supreme Court nominations could not be filibustered.

The Senate has the ability to change its rules at any time through a vote, not just when it re-adopts rules every two years. This includes the possibility of reverting to previous rules, such as reinstating a supermajority requirement for Supreme Court confirmations if they choose to do so. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Senate does typically re-adopt its rules every two years, it's not limited to changing rules only at that time. \n\nOption C is false because there are no constitutional restrictions preventing the Senate from reinstating the supermajority requirement if they vote to do so.\n\nOption D is incorrect because changes to Senate rules, including those regarding Supreme Court confirmations, typically require only a simple majority vote, not a two-thirds majority.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the Senate's procedural flexibility and its authority over its own rules, particularly in the context of Supreme Court confirmations."

The law only requires that the property belongs to \"another,\" not necessarily the rightful owner. Tom's action meets all the elements of theft:\n1. He dishonestly appropriated the painting\n2.

She stated that the accused \"squeezed\" her \"bum\".\n\nMy question is, what is a valid reason to not arrest the accused?

Accusations are easy; convictions are hard.\n* they are exercising the discretion they have under the law to not prosecute a crime where it would not be in the public interest. Factors at play include the seriousness of the crime, the availability and strength of the evidence, the police and court resources available, other matters they have before them etc.\n* they do not have sufficient evidence now but will pursue investigations to get more.

They consider factors such as the seriousness of the crime, the strength of available evidence, resource constraints, and whether prosecution would be in the public interest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because police are not legally required to make an arrest every time a crime is reported. They have discretion in their decision-making.\n\nOption B is false because police can make arrests in circumstances other than personally witnessing a crime, such as when they have reason to believe a crime has been committed or when they have a warrant.\n\nOption D is incorrect because police do not always need a warrant to make an arrest. They can arrest without a warrant if they witness a crime or have reasonable grounds to believe a crime has been committed."

What actions can he do?\n\nMind you, all the company's software are pirated, so these employees assumed it's ok to suggest another pirated software.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I suppose that by \"pirated\" is meant \"infringing copyright\". Also, a private person cannot \"fine\" anyone. A copyright owner can sue for damages, or settle such a suit for an agreed sum of money. A court could fine a person or a company if the infringement was held to be criminal, as some infringements are, or if some other law was broken.\n\n\"Mind you, all the company's software are pirated, so these employees assumed it's ok to suggest another pirated software.\" This amounts to \"we are already breaking the law, so we can safely break it further.\" Not an effective defense if someone decides to sue.\n\nIf someone copies and installs software without a proper license, that is copyright infringement. Either the employee, or the company, or both would be liable for damages if the copyright holder sued and won. (Which would be liable depends on the detailed facts, and on local law, and I do not know the law of the various European countries as well as I do that of the US.)\n\nSuch an employee probably has the choice of paying or contesting the payment. Details would matter, and so would local laws. If the employee thinks of contesting consulting a knowledgeable lawyer would be a very good idea. Contesting might also cause the employer to take action against the employee. That woudl depend on the company's policies, on the employment contract, if any, and on local law.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employee is not liable because they only suggested the software and didn't install it themselves.\nB) The company is solely responsible for the damages as they made the decision to use the pirated software.\nC) Both the employee and the company could potentially be held liable for copyright infringement, depending on specific circumstances and local laws.\nD) The employee can avoid liability by arguing that they assumed it was acceptable to use pirated software since the company was already using other unlicensed software.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, either the employee, the company, or both could be liable for damages in a copyright infringement case, depending on the specific facts and local laws. The employee's suggestion and the company's implementation both contribute to the infringement. Answer A is incorrect because suggesting infringing software can still lead to liability. Answer B oversimplifies by placing all responsibility on the company, ignoring the employee's role. Answer D is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, the argument that \"we are already breaking the law, so we can safely break it further\" is not an effective defense."

To give just one example, in Denmark I have been told that it is illegal to grow and possess cannabis but not to buy or sell cannabis seeds. One could imagine that the intention in general is to make cannabis a forbidden substance, particularly consumption of it as a drug. But for various reasons, perhaps unrelated to cannabis specifically, they decided it may be excessive, or unjust, or undesirable, to ban.. some associated plant structure or something that is not itself psychoactive.\n\nBut this slightly forced, arbitrary division between allowed and not allowed only invites weird ways of toying with or working around the law. You cannot hold a marijuana leaf in your hand, or something, but you may legally be able to unload a dump truck of cannabis seeds on a farm or in a forest, provided you did not tend to them, so as to not be guilty of having \u201cgrown\u201d them.\n\nThe key point is that the intention of the law is not actually present in the law; it may be that lack of clarity, in which the law is not so straightforward, does not really say what it wants to, says it in an indirect, and hence slightly inaccurate way, which makes it less that optimally effective.\n\nI was just thinking about functional programming vs declarative. I am not sure I understand it totally, but I feel like functional programming is based on a much higher level of abstraction where it becomes much more possible to state abstract intentions in an exactly precise, non\\-circumlocutory way.\n\nIt made me wonder if there is a more modern legal philosophy in which laws are not slightly antique dictations sort of like a literal reading of Moses\u2019s 10 commandments but rather attempt to make the actual purpose the clear part and eliminate pedantic misinterpretations or legal backfiring.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes \\- its called [purposive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purposive_approach) interpretation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is the most common approach in most jurisdictions.\n\nThat said, if a statute is clear and unambiguous in what it means or provides a specific definition of a term then that is what the court will apply. However, for your example of whether dumping seeds and then returning later to see if any had germinated counts as \"grown\" they would look to the intention of the legislature including any objective explicitly stated in the Act, committee reports, speeches in the chamber, law reform commission reports etc. to determine if the activity ios caught by the law.",

It aims to understand and apply laws based on their intended purpose or rationale, rather than strictly adhering to literal wording.

It seems to me that this must be against the law *somehow*, but I don't know exactly how it's handled. This possibility was not addressed in the discussion.\n\nConcretely:\n\n1. I own a valuable physical object.\n2. I make a contract to sell this object to each of several different people, in exchange for money. To avoid detection, the deal is that they send me the money now, and then they pick up the item from an agreed\\-upon location on a specific date in the future.\n3. On the specified date, all of the buyers arrive at the specified location and discover that the object is present and nobody's stopping them from taking it ... except each other.\n4. I have pocketed the money and left town.\n\nWhat is the name of the crime and/or tort I have committed? Who gets to keep the object? How have the courts handled this type of scam in the past? Is it handled differently if the \"valuable physical object\" is real estate? (It seems to me that this scam might be easier to execute with land, since nobody expects land to be delivered to them.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What is the name of the crime and/or tort I have committed?\n\nYou are guilty of the crime of fraud, the crime of theft of the money and the item (I can't point you to the precise statute).\n\nYou have breached your contract of sale.\n\nYou are probably liable for fraud civilly (i.e. you could be sued for fraud).\n\nBut, if one was really creative, I imagine that one could find more grounds for civil and/or criminal liability, although they would probably be unnecessary since the victims have plenty of remedies to secure all possible relief already.\n\n> Who gets to keep the object?\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, in the United States, the general rule is delivery of possession by the seller (which didn't really happen here to one distinct person), but for unique goods, title passes when the unique good is identified to a contract with a buyer, so first in time to contract, first in right to the car, would probably prevail.\n\nBut, I don't know what the rule would be in England and Wales.\n\n> Is it handled differently if the \"valuable physical object\" is real\n> estate?\n\nLand is harder to defraud someone with, because a reasonable person knows that in England and Wales real estate title is ([usually](https://unregistered.anna.ps/), but not always) represented by a certificate of ownership maintained by a public official in the Land Registry, and is easily checked (about 15% of land in England and Wales show in the link is not registered so the possibility for deception is somewhat greater in that context).\n\nAlso, generally, you don't pay for real property until you simultaneously receive payment in good funds, while brief extensions of credit for a non\\-perfectly contemporaneous sale transaction are more common in cases involving tangible personal property.",

The seller is indeed guilty of fraud and theft for deceiving multiple buyers and taking their money without intending to deliver the car to all of them. Additionally, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States, for unique goods like a specific car, the title generally passes when the good is identified to a contract. This means the first person to enter into a contract for the car would likely have the strongest claim to keep it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the crime goes beyond just breach of contract and includes fraud and theft. The resolution is not based on who paid the most.\n\nOption C is wrong because the seller has committed crimes regardless of delivering the car to one buyer, and fraud charges would apply in addition to breach of contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because real estate fraud is handled differently. Land transactions typically involve public records and more safeguards, making this type of fraud more difficult with real estate."

The clause that has my concern reads as below\n\n> The lessor shall have, in the event of the lessee's breach of or default under this agreement and/or the lessor being of the view that the lessee is not cooperating and/or not complying with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a right to terminate this Agreement and the licence granted hereunder, after issuing to the lessee a prior written notice of not less than 3(three) months by registered post, or speed post (and also by (i) email where email id of the lessee is available; and (ii) SMS and/or whatsapp where the mobile phone number of the lessee is available)\n\nThe last bit ( SMS and/or whatsapp ... ) is what I'm curious about. To the best of my understanding (unlike Whatsapp which is built upon the TCP/IP stack) SMS is not a connection\\-oriented protocol i.e. Message Sent does not equate to Message Received. Although TSP do endeavour to provide a receipt, delivery of an SMS may fail silently. It may even transpire that an SMS is delivered only partially. Ergo, whilst the lessor may have sent the message (and have proof of dispatch) it does not follow that the message was received and received in the form intended.\n\nIs there a precedent elsewhere (outside India) for an intimation sent by SMS to be deemed a legal summons? What, if any, is the defence against this clause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While I am not sure about an SMS precedent, it is not uncommon in US contracts for a contract to specify that a notice is deemed delivered when it is placed in ordinary First Class US mail, properly addressed, although such mail makes no attempt to assure a receipt, and is in no way guaranteed delivery. Indeed I suspect that SMS is rather more reliable, although I have no statistics at hand.\n\nNote that in this case the language specifies that notice is to be sent by registered post **and also by** email, SMS, or Whatsapp. Thus there should always be proof via the registered letter, and normally quick delivery by electronic means.\n\nIn any case the parties to the contract may specify whatever methods of delivery they choose.

The documentation indicates that parties to a contract have the freedom to specify their preferred methods of notice delivery, even if some methods (like SMS) may not be foolproof. In the given example, SMS is used as an additional method alongside registered post, which provides a more reliable proof of delivery.

What legal principle are the German authorities invoking?\n\nA) Diplomatic immunity\nB) Extraterritorial jurisdiction\nC) Sovereign immunity\nD) Reciprocal enforcement\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) Diplomatic immunity is incorrect. This principle protects diplomats from prosecution under the host country's laws. It does not apply to ordinary citizens or to a country extending its laws to its citizens' actions abroad.\n\nB) Extraterritorial jurisdiction is correct. This principle allows a country to extend its legal authority beyond its territorial borders, often applying to its citizens' actions abroad, especially in cases involving sexual offenses against minors.\n\nC) Sovereign immunity is incorrect. This principle protects a sovereign state from being sued in foreign courts without its consent. It does not relate to a country's ability to prosecute its citizens for actions abroad.\n\nD) Reciprocal enforcement is incorrect.

Implement of husbandry includes a farm tractor, self\\-propelled application\\-type vehicle, farm wagon, farm trailer, a vehicle or trailer adapted for lifting or carrying another implement of husbandry being used in agricultural production, or any substantially similar equipment used to transport products necessary for agricultural production.\n\nSo is a dump truck transporting product considered an implement of husbandry?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's a stretch. It would have to be plainly clear that the truck is *only* used as farm equipment on a farm.\n\n\"for the exclusive function of\" means \"only\".\n\nWhat will be relevant at a traffic stop will be whether the facts on the ground paint a picture that matches up to that usage. You claim it's only used for farm use. You claim you're using it for farm use right now. *It's full of grain*. You can recite from memory the name of the grain elevator and the location of the farm. You are in fact on an appropriate road between your farm and the grain elevator.\n\nKeep in mind you may be dealing with the Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Division of the Michigan State Police. They deal with commercial vehicles (like that dump truck is the rest of the time) and they get to ask a lot of pointed questions and you have to answer them. CVED is looking for civil infractions whose penalty is fines or impoundment, and the 5th Amendment only works on *incrimination* whose penalty is jail or death.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Michigan law, which of the following vehicles would most likely be considered an \"implement of husbandry\"?\n\nA) A dump truck used exclusively on a farm to transport grain from fields to storage silos, never leaving the farm property\nB) A pickup truck used primarily for personal transportation but occasionally to haul hay for a small hobby farm\nC) A tractor-trailer combination used to transport produce from multiple farms to various markets across the state\nD) A rented moving truck temporarily used to transport farm equipment from one field to another during harvest season\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is the correct answer. The dump truck's exclusive use on the farm for agricultural purposes aligns with the definition of \"implement of husbandry\" in MCL 257.21, which specifies \"exclusive function of serving agricultural... operations.\"\n\nB) This is incorrect because the pickup truck is not used exclusively for agricultural purposes. The law requires the vehicle to be \"in use for the exclusive function\" of agricultural operations.\n\nC) This is incorrect because the tractor-trailer is used for commercial transportation across multiple farms and to various markets. It's not exclusively used for a single agricultural operation.\n\nD) While this use is agricultural in nature, the rented moving truck is not exclusively dedicated to farm use. Its primary purpose is not agricultural, making it fall short of the \"implement of husbandry\" definition.\n\nThe key factors in determining an \"implement of husbandry\" are exclusivity of use for agricultural purposes and the nature of the vehicle's primary function in agricultural operations."

According to contract law, the opportunity to be considered for a job can be viewed as valid consideration (compensation). This means that even though the applicants are not being paid directly for completing the coding challenge, they are receiving a form of compensation through the opportunity for potential employment. This consideration can make the NDA potentially enforceable, even if the applicants are referred to as \"contractors\" in the document. Options A and B are incorrect because they assume that unpaid work or challenges cannot be part of a valid contractual agreement in an interview process.

This can have dire business consequences and completely wreck a project's timeline, or budget, or sink it altogether. I understand that this is known as \"judicial insecurity\", and it's tangibly damaging.\n\nIt would be nice if lawgivers were kind enough to decree airtight laws that, though one might argue they are more or less just or good, at least are formally consistent with each other, telling citizens and legal persons clearly what we can and cannot do. However, it's often up to lay citizens to notice these discrepancies and take them to court for appeal. Even when the cases are very clear\\-cut, it can take months or years, and by the time it's done, a whole new set of quick\\-and\\-dirty executive regulations may have come out.\n\nI'd like to know if, given the at least attempted \"formal algorithm\" method of the law, there wouldn't be an automated method of parsing the laws for contradictions, formal inconsistencies, endless loops, or undesirable end\\-states. I'd likewise appreciate an automated system for parsing out the control flows in the laws and turning them into easily\\-readable, standardized diagrams and charts.\n\nNow, However, I don't know enough about programming, particularly as applied to linguistics, to figure out what the best approach would be. If y'all got any insights, I'd strongly appreciate them.\n\nThe DEFINITIONS part is particularly tricky for me, as we've got, off the top of my head:\n\n1. Agents\n\t* Public ones: Courts, Legislative Assemblies, Administrations, Department, Position (distinct to the person of the civil servant in it), \"Organ\", etc. (it's quite a tangled web of affiliations and dependencies, and liable to change quickly, too).\n\t* Private citizens, with the attributes thereof that are deemed relevant (nationals/EU citizens/foreign, major/minor, etc.)\n\t* Private associations: Privately or Publicly owned, For Profit or Non Profit, different types of corporation...\n2. Actions: For example, for a person to be \\[appointed to an Positon],\n\\-Organ A \\[nominates],\n\\-Organ B \\[introduces in the agenda],\n\\-Organ C \\[votes],\n\\-Organ D \\[vetoes or not],\n\\-Organ E \\[signs the appointment],\n\\-Organ F \\[publishes] in the official bulletin, etc.\n3. Documents: just in the example above, each action or lack thereof is recorded (actively or by default) in a document (Nomination, Minutes, Appointment, the Bulletin, etc.). Then you have stuff like Registries and Records, which are compilations of documents, and need to be distinguished from the Organs named after them that are in charge of running them. You have Contracts, which are a whole Thing themselves. You have your specific Administrative Acts and your General Decrees. And, well, I can't help but think of the myriad types of documents, both formal and not, that are introduced in \\- discovery, was it? \\- as Evidence.\n4. Dates and timestamps are very important, as are the specific windows and deadlines to perform this or that action.\n5. Principles: they're very annoying because they're unevenly applied and usually not self explanatory, but they're supposed to inform all legislation and, when they're in the Consitution, they're meant to be very binding indeed. Legality, Rule of Law, State of Law, Non\\-Arbitrariness, Objectivity, Impartiality, Transparency, Non\\-Retroactiveness, General Interest, Cooperation, Coordination...\n\t* It's possible to go to the Doctrine (i.e., the opinions of Respected Legal Scholars) or to Case Law (which tend to rule on ambiguities of this type) to construct something resembling a useful formal definition, but it's usually very difficult to avoid a degree of \"fuzziness\" and \"gradient\" in the concept.\n\t* As such, my impression is that any formal tests that one could devise to make sure the laws apply those principles would fall under the header of operationalization, i.e. answering a difficult question with a similar, much simpler one.\n\t\t+ The example I was given in Philosophy of Science class at Uni was: \"How much do you love your wife?\" vs. \"How high a voltage are you willing to be shocked with in order to guarantee that she herself does not get shocked?\"\n\t\t+ Likewise, \"is this law impartial\" could be turned into \"in practice, what demographics are disproportionately favored by it and what aren't\", although that requires going outside of the formal confines of the law. There's likely a way to formally test if, in theory, the law is impartial, but I can't think of one right now.\n\t\t+ Similarly, the concept of \"General Interest\" is quite problematic\n\t\t\\- a huge collection of subjective interests that seems incredibly hard to even *know* objectively, let alone turn into a set of quantitative criteria, or legislate for without biases or hidden assumptions,\n\t\t\\- and yet \"the Administration serves the General Interest Objectively and Impartially\" is an actual article of Law that is in effect and which you could refer to in court when appealing an administrative regulation or act that you have evidence serves Special Interests, is Subjective, or favors certain parties over others.\n\nI've been circling the problem, reading some law, attempting a chart and a pseudo\\-code, going to practical cases, reading some theory on the background thereof, learning about different coding languages and practicing simple exercises just to get the hang of them, etc. I'm slowly growing familiar with declarative, imperative, object\\-oriented, etc languages, as well as Controlled Natural Languages and attempts to make programming easy to parse for people and human language easy to parse for machine. I'm finding out about programs and AIs that are designed to parse language, and about statistical methods to hermeneutics and data analysis.\n\nIt's been quite haphazard and unstructured, and I feel like I may be wasting my time blindly touching an elephant's trunk and trying to figure out what sort of snake it is. But I'm afraid to raise my voice, explaining what I'm doing and ask, \"am I doing this right\" and of either being ignored or being told to ask a more specific and well\\-researched question. I'd really appreciate some guidance, though.\n\nI guess, for now, I'd be content with tips on how to approach the following problems, in order of priority:\n\n* automating the representation of laws as control flow charts\n* automating the discovery of\n\t+ undesirable loops and end\\-states in said flow charts\n\t+ fringe cases that are pedagogically optimal for explaining the nuts and bolts of the law to people learning it\n\t+ ambiguous language: when a word means different things depending on which \"semantic field\" of law we're in \\- for example, \"convention\" can mean very different kinds of agreements in Civil Law, Administrative Law dealing with private entities, Administrative law dealing with different tiers of the Administration, and International Law, just to name a few.\n\t+ formal contradictions between laws of equal and different tiers\n\nThat would be a good start \\- just a formal comprehension and testing of the law.\n\nOther than that, I'm aware that LawTech firms [are developing some truly interesting applications](https://www.legalgeek.co/startup-map/) on a number of subjects, with particular attention paid to contract drafting and enforcement, and the automation thereof, as well as to the prediction of outcomes in lawsuits based on case analytics. I'm not, however, aware of the theoretical and skillset edifice upon which this kind of work is build \\- but it interests me a great deal. In fact, I'm finding Law so fascinating and vitally important that I'm actually considering getting a Law degree myself \\- I understand that STEM\\-trained folks are actually rather welcome in Law Schools? I'd strongly appreciate any guidance on how to build my knowledge and skills base to begin to be able to grapple with such problems \\- and, eventually, if I'm any good at it, offer useful billable expertise that clients would purchase, of course.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can\u2019t have complete mathematics; you have no chance of a complete legal system\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) tell us that mathematics has no complete, consistent and finite set of axioms that can prove every correct statement.

In all of those channels, one would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, in contrast to using CB radio or a megaphone. However the context of using the instrument affects that expectation, for example if your phone is on speaker you do not have a reasonable expectation that those around you cannot hear your conversation, when there are others around you. Also, there is no expectation of privacy surrounding employers monitoring employee emails for valid business purposes \u2013 but the federal government can't intercept your emails (without a warrant) just because you are using business email. The expectation of privacy is really about the surrounding circumstance, not the instrument you use.",

The documentation states that \"there is no expectation of privacy surrounding employers monitoring employee emails for valid business purposes.\" Using a work email account for personal matters would fall under this category.\n\nB) This is incorrect. The information suggests that making a cell phone call generally has a reasonable expectation of privacy, especially when done in a private setting like a car.\n\nC) This is incorrect. Listening to one's own voicemail is typically considered to have a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly when done in a private space.\n\nD) This is incorrect. Sending traditional mail through the U.S. Postal Service is generally considered to have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThe key to this question is understanding that the context of use affects the expectation of privacy, and that work-related communications on employer-provided systems have less privacy protection than personal communications through other means."

There is [Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/visa-waiver-program-improvement-and-terrorist-travel-prevention-act-faq) (VWPITTPA), which enforces (among everything else) the following,\n\n> travelers in the following categories are no longer eligible to travel or be admitted to the United States, without a waiver, under the VWP:  \n> \n> Nationals of VWP countries **who have traveled to or been present in Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen at any time on or after March 1, 2011** (with limited exceptions)...\n\nI noticed that VWPITTPA Act was passed in **2015**, whereas it applies to travelers from **2011** onwards.

The act does not make it illegal to visit these places. Law abiding people do not need to avoid doing so. People who have traveled to those places are not prohibited from traveling to the US altogether; they are only disqualified from using the VWP. They are expected to apply for a B\\-1 or B\\-2 visa, as appropriate, to visit the US. With that in mind:\n\n1. There is no expectation that people eligible for the visa waiver program should have known not to travel to those places between 2011 and 2015, and\n2.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their ability to enter the US?\n\nA) They are prohibited from entering the United States due to their past travel to Iran.\nB) They can enter the US using the Visa Waiver Program as their travel to Iran occurred before the VWPITTPA was enacted.\nC) They must apply for a B1/B2 visa to enter the US, as they are no longer eligible for the Visa Waiver Program.\nD) They can enter the US using the Visa Waiver Program but must undergo additional screening at the port of entry.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (VWPITTPA) applies retroactively to travel dating back to March 1, 2011. While the act doesn't prohibit entry to the US for individuals who have visited countries like Iran, it does disqualify them from using the Visa Waiver Program. Instead, they must apply for a B1 (business) or B2 (tourism) visa to visit the United States. The act doesn't make it illegal to have visited these countries, nor does it ban entry to the US altogether. It simply changes the process by which these individuals must apply for entry."

The availability of similar clips on YouTube doesn't legalize the use, as those may also be unauthorized.

Using the name \"YouTrack\" for the new app is likely to infringe on an existing registered trademark and violate trademark laws. The existing \"YouTrack\" software is a registered trademark that has been in use for 14 years, which establishes priority. Even though the new app is for a different industry (motorsports), using an identical name for a software application could still be considered trademark infringement. Trademark laws, such as the German MarkenG, prohibit the use of identical signs for goods or services that are similar to those protected by the registered trademark without the consent of the trademark owner.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When you start an online business, or even just create a website, there is a lot of confusion on what needs to be done to comply with GDPR. As many online resources ([including StackExchange](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77282/under-the-gdpr-in-germany-is-a-privacy-policy-required-when-not-tracking-any-pe)) suggest, it is next to impossible to have a website and not fall under GDPR rules. Furthermore, there seems to be some confusion and back\\-and\\-forth on what is deemed compliant, and what's not.\n\nIf you want to clarify how GDPR rules apply in your case, the usual advice is to \"get a lawyer\". However, this is not practical for many small starting online businesses that have no resources to pay for a full time legal advisor. So I am hoping to gather some practical tips about doing this without employing a lawyer.\n\nFirst, let me lay out some assumptions on the nature of the business:\n\n* It is new and small in every sense of the word: a few dozen customers, $1k\\-2k monthly turnover\n* It is based in UK\n* It is not dealing with extra\\-sensitive data like bank account numbers or identity documents\n\nAnd now some specific questions:\n\n1. What would be the best strategy in terms of \"cost vs reliability\" to ensure GDPR compliance? Would it be practical to follow one of the many GDPR tutorials online to choose a proper hosting, security measures, etc?\n2. If I unintentionally use a non\\-compliant hosting configuration or a 3rd\\-party service like Google Analytics that transfers customers' data to a \"unsafe\" jurisdiction, what consequences is it likely to bring about? Are there any examples of this happening?\n3. How severe should data processing faults be for the business to be facing serious fines and lawsuits (vs. just fixing the fault and issuing an official apology)?\n4. What would be a sensible time to actually employ a GDPR advisor? Is this based on the kind of data that the company handles? On the number of customers? On the turnover?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is entirely possible to reach a reasonable level of compliance in a DIY approach, provided that you familiarize yourself with the relevant legal framework. The UK ICO has produced in\\-depth guidance to help here, which is significantly more digestible than the laws themselves:\n\n[ICO Guide to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)\n\nFor a first reading, it is probably appropriate to focus on the summaries and checklists at the top of each section.\n\nYou will however notice that GDPR is a lot about *principles*, and requirements like selecting *appropriate* compliance measures yourself. On one hand, this means that you have some flexibility in your compliance approach, but it also means also that you can never be sure whether you're actually compliant. But this is also precisely why professional help can be valuable, since compliance professionals probably have a better overview of best practices, state of the art measures, and also potential pitfalls.\n\nIn some [other](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83897) [answers](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83565), I have written basic overviews/checklists to get started with a GDPR compliance effort.\n\nOn to your concrete questions:\n\n1. What is the best strategy to get started with GDPR compliance?\n\nThis is ultimately a business decision that you have to make. You have to consider how much compliance is worth to you, both in terms of time and money. Maybe you can DIY it, maybe you'll want to get professional help, maybe you'll just hope that no one ever sues you or lodges a complaint. There is no objective optimum, and only you know your particular situation.\n2. What are the consequences for unintentional infringement?\n\nNot being aware of the rules is not a valid defense (*ignorantia juris non excusat*).\n3. How are fines calculated?\n\nThe GDPR has two separate enforcement mechanisms: data subjects can sue you for compliance and damages, and the ICO can fine you.\n\nDamages are typically small compared to the cost of a lawsuit.\n\nWhen issuing fines, the ICO must consider a variety of factor per [Article 83](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/83), for example whether the infringement was willful or negligent. The ICO is not required to impose damages, and anecdotally many small problems can be resolved informally before it comes to a full investigation.\n\nIn particular, the [ICO's Regulatory Action Policy 2018](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf) explains that \u201cwe will reserve our powers \\[to issue fines] for the most serious cases, representing the most severe breaches of information rights obligations. These will typically involve wilful, deliberate or negligent acts, or repeated breaches of information rights obligations, causing harm or damage to individuals.\u201d The policy also provides a 5\\-step process for arriving at fines: removing financial gain, accounting for scale and severity of the breach, considering aggravating factors, ensuring a deterrent for others, and considering mitigating factors.\n\nThis suggests that a good\\-faith effort to ensure compliance already goes a long way.\n4. When to get professional help?\n\nUnder some circumstances, the GDPR *requires* that you appoint a data protection officer, who doesn't have to be an employee. You mention that you do not process sensitive data, so that it is currently unlikely you'd be required to appoint a DPO (compare Art 37, but note that the list of sensitive categories of data in Art 9(1\\) does not match your examples). The requirement to appoint a DPO depends entirely on the kind and scale of your data processing activities, not on number of employees or revenue thresholds. However, some GDPR compliance obligations like Art 30 Records of Processing Activities can also trigger when you reach 250 employees.\n\nAside from that, it is a business decision whether and when to invest in compliance.\n\nNote that if your business offers goods or services to people in the EU/EEA, you may be required to appoint an EU representative. Some law firms offer package deals for DPOs \\+ EU/UK representatives.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the GDPR information provided:\n\nQuestion: A small UK-based online business with a monthly turnover of \u00a31,500 is concerned about GDPR compliance. Which of the following strategies would be most appropriate for them to pursue initially?\n\nA) Immediately hire a full-time GDPR compliance officer\nB) Ignore GDPR requirements until they reach 250 employees\nC) Study the ICO's guidance and attempt a DIY approach to compliance\nD) Transfer all customer data to a non-EU country to avoid GDPR rules\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: For a small business with limited resources, studying the ICO's guidance and attempting a DIY approach to compliance is the most practical initial strategy. The UK ICO provides comprehensive, digestible guidance that can help small businesses understand and implement GDPR requirements. While professional help can be valuable, it may not be necessary or financially feasible for a business of this size. \n\nOption A is excessive for a small business at this stage. Option B is incorrect, as GDPR applies regardless of company size, and waiting until 250 employees is reached could result in significant non-compliance issues. Option D is not only incorrect but would likely violate GDPR rules rather than avoid them.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows the business to begin working towards compliance in a cost-effective manner, while still taking GDPR seriously. As the business grows or its data processing becomes more complex, it can then consider seeking professional advice."

The defendant has been put through an unreasonable amount of trouble. (Appealed through online system and confirmed in email, but the court lost the record. Had to make repeated requests in person for the case to be put in the system. Repeated requests for an interpreter, also confirmed by the court. However, when the defendant showed up, there was no interpreter and the judge reset the court date, multiple times. The prosecutors insisted on talking to the defendant prior to the trial and attacked the defendant with insults.)\n\nHaving done my homework, I am not sure: all I have found is that representation by a public defender is a possibility in criminal cases but not civil infraction. But in view of all this, because the defendant doesn't have the means to hire an attorney, is it possible for the defendant to ask the judge for a public defender so that they will not be harassed by the prosecution any more and that unnecessary clerical errors will hopefully reduce?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can call the public defender's office and ask for advise on the matter. They have phones for that purpose (among others). However, if the defendant accepts the invitation of the prosecutor or law enforcement to chat or agrees to the Prosecutor's request without understanding what he's agreeing too, that's not the failure of the process. You have a right to remain silent... but the prosecution has a right to keep on asking you questions and offering you deals anyway.\n\nHis attempts to get you to talk are not violations of your rights, cause you can always just shut up and you do not have to agree to any of his terms. There may be a problem with the stuff discussed prior to the courts assigning a translator, but once that is on the table, it's on the defendant if he/she wants to talk to the Prosecutor without the translator and again the word \"No\" means the same thing in 5 different languages.",

I am a software engineer, not a lawyer. Which is probably a good thing, otherwise I'd be confused out of my mind. Law is definitely not a science, because there are so many conditions in written legislation that conflict with one another! So if a software engineer tried to develop software to make a decision for any situation based on written law, the computer would start smoking from confusion.\n\nIs it safer to assume something is not allowed until you find enough evidence that it's allowed? Or is it safer to assume something is allowed until you find enough evidence that it's not allowed? \n\nOr do you look at the beginning sentences of a given piece of written legislation, and use the rest of the written law as exceptions to the rule stated in the beginning?\n\n---\n\nComparison:\n===========\n\nIn software, whatever condition is met first, that's the path chosen! So you can think of an order of precedence happening. Conditions/Laws at the top of the source code should be most specific, if they are identical conditions/laws found lower in the source code. But the order in which you read written law probably doesn't work that way?\n\n> condition 1: dog is black, dog is friendly \\=\\=\\> pet the dog\n> \n> \n> condition 2: dog is black, dog is mean \\=\\=\\> don't pet the dog\n> \n> \n> condition 3: dog is black, dog is friendly, dog is quiet \\=\\=\\> condition\n>  never met, because it's more specific than conditions above with same\n>  criteria, plus extra criteria\n> \n> \n> condition 4: dog is black, dog it friendly, dog is quiet, dog has fluffy hair \\=\\=\\> condition never met\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is, anything is allowed unless it is forbidden (and not that you can only do things that are expressly permitted).\n\nThe logical structure of law may be a bit more challenging than procedural programming logic, since it may require a global knowledge and evaluation of the entire code (typically but not absolutely, the scope of the search for \"unless otherwise\" conditions is restricted to \"in this chapter\"). In other words, the law is a set of propositions which must *all* be true, and unlike actual execution of instructions in a sequence, law is to be interpreted simultaneously but hierarchically (that is: the order in which clauses are written is not significant). The appearance that the law is self\\-contradictory is largely illusory, though the resolution of the conflict may require a careful reading of the law and knowledge of jurisdictional hierarchy (federal law is superior to state law, which entails a particular resolution of the apparent conflict). Sometimes there are real conflicts, which usually result from using words in conflicting ways (note the practice of re\\-defining words \"in this chapter/section/title\").\n\nThe reason why law is not a science is that law is normative, not descriptive: it dictates what is allowed (a determination made through the political process), and does not attempt to discover what independently is. The reason why the legal process cannot be implemented in software is that software does not yet correctly interpret natural language, and law is written in natural language following interpretations based on judgments of what choices a reasonable would make.\n\nPerhaps if you propose a piece of law that you think is contradictory, it would be possible to show how the contradiction is illusory.",

It should be more cut and dry, but in actual practice it seems to be a little confusing.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Can one of the 18 identifiers be PHI by itself, without having any medical information attached to it? For example an first and last name from an EHR system. I have always thought you need some sort of medical information attached with the 18 identifiers to make it PHI, otherwise without the health information, it's PII. So a first and last name with the diagnosis of diabetes is PHI, but my first and last name is not PHI, only PII.\n2. Does it matter where the information originated from? For example if a person inputs their health information into a healthcare website, say weight and medical condition, is that different from a doctor inputting that same data into their EHR?\n3. The definition states that it's protected if the covered entity receives the information \\- but what if the patient gives health information (let's say weight and medical conditions) to a downstream business associate (with a signed BAA)? I thought HITECH extended liability to downstream associates as if they were the covered entity.\n\nIt's worth posting the definition of protected health information for reference.\n\n*Under HIPAA, protected health information is considered to be individually identifiable information relating to the past, present, or future health status of an individual that is created, collected, or transmitted, or maintained by a HIPAA\\-covered entity in relation to the provision of healthcare, payment for healthcare services, or use in healthcare operations (PHI healthcare business uses).\nHealth information such as diagnoses, treatment information, medical test results, and prescription information are considered protected health information under HIPAA, as are national identification numbers and demographic information such as birth dates, gender, ethnicity, and contact and emergency contact information. PHI relates to physical records, while ePHI is any PHI that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically.\nPHI only relates to information on patients or health plan members. It does not include information contained in educational and employment records, that includes health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in its capacity as an employer.\nPHI is only considered PHI when an individual could be identified from the information. If all identifiers are stripped from health data, it ceases to be protected health information and the HIPAA Privacy Rule\u2019s restrictions on uses and disclosures no longer apply.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Response to point 1:**\n\n1. Yes, it\u2019s true that for information to be classified as PHI, PII must be attached to the health information. If there is no health\\-related information that could be past, present or, future with the PII, it is only Personally Identifiable Information. E.g. if there is a web page with details like First Name, Last Name, Mobile No and health report attached, then the system is considered and PHI/ePHI. Secondly, all the health records have PII for traceability purposes.\n2. Secondly, First and Last Name also does not qualify to be PII, as it\u2019s generic information. I can\u2019t identify an individual basis First Name and Last Name; a 3rd attribute will be required.\n\n**Response to point 2:\\-** \n1\\. Not at all.\n2\\. PHI is classified based on the kind of information irrespective of who is entering the data, whether its Data Subject, Covered Entity or Data Processor/Business Associate.\n\n**Response to Point 3:\\-** \n1\\. Even if the PHI is being collected by the Business Associate or downstream actors, it will still be classified as PHI. It is Covered Entities' responsibility to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the Business Associate. The agreement should have the definition of the PHI for the understanding of all the affected parties.",

The combination of PII (1, 2, 3) with either piece of health information (4 or 5) would create PHI. Option C correctly captures this requirement, as it includes the necessary PII elements along with at least one health-related element. Option A lacks health information, B lacks PII, and D is incorrect because not all elements are necessary to create PHI - only a combination of PII and health information is required."

At the end of it they suggest two law firms they are used to working with from what they told me. They also say that they will reimburse up to \u00a3500 in lawyers' fees. From my perspective, it looks a bit suspicious that they give me the name of these two law firms.\n\nIs this normal or usual, and is it legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an increasingly common practice in the UK for dismissals, especially for reasons of redundancy.\n\nWhat is going on here is that they are attempting to enter into what until recently was known as a **compromise agreement**, and is now termed **settlement agreement**.\n\nNormally, when you are made redundant, you are entitled to statutory redundancy pay (amount depends on age and length of service; see [https://www.gov.uk/redundant\\-your\\-rights/redundancy\\-pay](https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay)). You can take this and **do not need to sign anything**.\n\nHowever, sometimes companies make slightly more generous offers in exchange for you agreeing not to take them to tribunal/court or discuss/disclose certain matters. This would often involve more money and an agreed reference. **These agreements only have legal standing if you have taken legal advice from a person qualified to give it**. The UK's national conciliation and arbitration service ACAS has information on settlement agreements at [http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid\\=4395](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4395)\n\nTherefore the employer is offering to pay legal fees because they need you to get advice before you sign a document which protects them. They are suggesting solicitors because they know of solicitors willing to do this work for the price they are willing to pay.\n\nSome companies will do this for every dismissal and have a have a standard package for enhanced redundancy. Other companies decide for each case.\n\nBefore you proceed to arrange a solicitor, you should check:\n\n* That you are free to choose another solicitor who will do the same for \u00a3500\\.\n* That this will be paid whether or not you agree to the terms.\n* What your length of service is, what your statutory entitlement is and what the difference is between that and what you are being offered.\n\nYou should also think carefully about whether you have any potential claims against the employer \\- for instance, if you think you are not being made redundant because the employer is doing less of a particular type of work but because you have raised issues of discrimination. You are probably being asked to give up your right to pursue this.\n\nIn terms of choice of solicitor, a solicitor which gets work from employer recommendations probably won't be too forthright in encouraging you to challenge unfavourable terms (even if they do not work for employers). If you are a member of a trade union, they will be able to suggest lawyers who do settlement agreements for employees on a regular basis. If not (and I assume not as otherwise they would be helping you through this), I would suggest finding a firm that specialises in representing employees \\- some solicitors' firms like Thompsons and Morrish are pretty open about their focus.",

Settlement agreements typically offer more generous terms in exchange for the employee agreeing not to take legal action against the employer or disclose certain information.\n\n2. These agreements only have legal standing if the employee has received qualified legal advice. By paying for this advice, the employer ensures the agreement will be valid.\n\n3. The employer's suggestion of specific law firms is likely because they know these firms will work within the budget they're willing to pay.\n\n4. While the process can benefit the employee with enhanced terms, the primary goal is to protect the employer from potential legal claims or reputational damage.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because:\nA) While fair compensation may be part of the agreement, it's not the primary purpose of the employer's actions.\nB) The employer is actually encouraging legal counsel, not preventing it.\nC) The redundancy process itself doesn't require this step to be legally binding; it's specifically for the additional settlement agreement."

This option allows for ribbon UI implementation, but under the constraints of using Microsoft's provided tools rather than completely independent development."

If one sibling wants to have a huge funeral and the other wants to just toss the body in a dumpster, does the cost for the funeral come out of the estate before it is split?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> **Who owns a dead body?**\n\nNo one, in common law countries human remains are not property and therefore have no owner.\n\n> **Who is responsible for disposal?**\n\nIt varies by jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, in [NSW](http://www.legalanswers.sl.nsw.gov.au/guides/wills_estates/when_someone_dies.html), Australia:\n\n> * When the deceased has appointed an executor in their will, it is the executor\u2019s responsibility to organise the funeral. The executor ... **is not bound by specific directions left in the will**.\n> * If there isn\u2019t a will or an executor hasn\u2019t been appointed, the next of kin is responsible for the body. If the next of kin doesn\u2019t want to be involved, the funeral may be arranged through the government contractor.\n> * Where a person who dies in hospital has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, and had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, the hospital where they died must accept responsibility for arranging and paying for the funeral through the government contractor.\n> * If a person died at home, and has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, when a doctor has issued a medical certificate of cause of death, the police will complete a burial/cremation of a \u2018Deceased Destitute Person\u2019 form P372, which is sent to the Director of Public Health Unit (PHU) of the relevant Health Service. The government contractor will be contacted by the PHU to organise a funeral. If a medical certificate of cause of death was not issued, the body is taken to the coroner\u2019s morgue.\n> * The coroner issues an \u2018Order for Disposal of a Destitute Person\u2019 and forwards it to the Director of the relevant Health Service\u2019s Public Health Unit (PHU). The PHU, in turn, contacts the government contractor who forwards the invoice to the PHU for payment by the Area Health Service. See the section on destitute funerals. If a Coroner\u2019s case involves a destitute person, and there are next of kin, the counsellors at the Department of Forensic Medicine can be approached by the family to assist with funeral arrangements.\n> * If the deceased has no next of kin, but did have money or assets, the case is referred to the NSW Trustee and Guardian who arranges and pays for a funeral from the estate.\n\n> **If someone dies with a will, but does not mention their body or how to dispose of it who decides what happens?**\n\nAs stated above, your requests in your will as to the disposal of your body are **not** binding on your executor. They must decide how to dispose of the body with consideration of their duties to the estate and beneficiaries. For example, if your will requests a funeral costing tens of thousands of dollars but your estate is worth only a few thousand then the executor is duty bound to ignore that request.\n\n> **a parent has two children and dies leaving no will, which of the siblings decides?**\n\nThey decide together. If they cannot agree then they will have to go to court. In general, in Australia, courts take a very pragmatic view of what should happen: quickest and lowest cost option on the table will generally win.\n\n> **Who pays for the result of that decision?**\n\nThe estate is responsible for funeral costs (and court costs in arguing about them). As a practical matter, funeral service providers (and lawyers) will require the person engaging their services to pay the bill; that person can then claim reimbursement as a creditor of the estate. In the event that the estate is insolvent (i.e. has more debts than assets) then their reimbursement will be less than their costs.\n\n> **If one sibling wants to have a huge funeral and the other wants to just toss the body in a dumpster does the cost for the funeral come out of the estate before it is split?**\n\nObserving that to \"just toss the body in a dumpster\" would be illegal; the costs of the funeral come from the estate as a creditor of the estate. The residual equity of the estate would then be divided in accordance with the will or the law if there is no will.\n\nIt is worth noting that joint assets (e.g. real property owned as joint tenants, joint bank accounts) pass directly to the surviving owner and never become assets of the estate.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a widower with two adult children, Sarah and Michael, dies unexpectedly without leaving a will. He has a modest estate worth $50,000. Sarah wants a lavish funeral costing $20,000, while Michael prefers a simple cremation for $2,000. They cannot agree on the funeral arrangements. Based on this scenario and the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Sarah, as the older sibling, has the final say in funeral arrangements, and the $20,000 cost will be paid from the estate before it's divided.\n\nB) Michael can legally dispose of John's body in the cheapest manner possible without Sarah's consent, saving the estate money.\n\nC) If Sarah and Michael cannot agree, they must go to court, where the judge will likely favor the quickest and lowest cost option for body disposal.\n\nD) The executor named in John's will has the ultimate decision-making power regarding funeral arrangements, regardless of the siblings' wishes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When there is no will (intestate) and the next of kin cannot agree on funeral arrangements, they must seek a court decision. As stated in the provided information, courts generally take a pragmatic view and favor the quickest and lowest cost option available. This approach aligns with the duty to preserve the estate's assets for beneficiaries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because neither sibling has automatic priority in decision-making, and the cost of the funeral doesn't automatically come out of the estate before division if it's disproportionate.\n\nOption B is incorrect and illegal. Disposing of a body in the \"cheapest manner possible\" without proper procedures would be against the law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because John died without a will, so there is no executor named. In cases of intestacy, the next of kin (in this case, the children) are responsible for arranging the funeral.\n\nThe court would likely favor Michael's preference for a simple cremation as it's more cost-effective and preserves more of the estate for the beneficiaries. The funeral costs would be paid from the estate as a creditor claim before the remaining assets are divided between Sarah and Michael."

I doubt pulling someone over as a civilian is legal, strictly speaking, especially since the guy had to speed himself to keep up with the speeding officer. I know there are some situations where officers speed within their right, even without emergency lights, under certain circumstances. \n\nBut I was interested, for technicality sake, in learning what legal rights civilians have if they wish to take action against an officer they believe to be needlessly violating traffic laws **for personal benefit**. Lets say someone witnesses an officer turn on their lights and speed to pass traffic, then sees them pull into a doughnut shop a few blocks later and want to report that kind of misuse of power. \n\nI know one can \"make a complaint\" but I'm wondering if there's generally any legal obligation for these complaints to be taken seriously, and if there's any feasible way a driver could validate the encounter. If a civilian takes a video of the officer speeding he'd probably be admitting to distracted driving, a crime in itself. If he looks at an ID number on the car and claims that was the car, it seems like it would be the civilian's word against the officer's. Wouldn't that just go the officer's way?\n\nLegally speaking, do civilians have any right to apprehend an officer for a traffic violation? I've heard of civilian arrest but I know little about it. I'm curious to know if what this civilian in the video did (asked the officer to slow down) is even legal if he managed to stop the officer without speeding to do so.\n\nFurthermore, even with evidence, is there any way a citizen could ensure that legal action be taken against the officer for a proven traffic violation?

Very few states allow anyone other than a prosecutor (or sometimes in minor cases, a law enforcement officer) to bring criminal or quasi\\-criminal charges.\n\nOf course, if compelling evidence of a violation is found and shared with the media, there may be powerful political pressure to bring a prosecution, but how that is developed would entirely depend upon the circumstances. \n\nStill, the relationship between prosecutors and law enforcement is so symbiotic, that prosecutors are loathe to press charges against law enforcement officers in all but the clearest of cases, especially for offenses occuring while a law enforcement officer is on duty in his home jurisdiction.\n\n> Legally speaking, do civilians have any right to apprehend an officer\n>  for a traffic violation?\n\nWhile this would depend upon state law, most states treat traffic violations as a class of offense different from other misdemeanors and infractions and never authorize a citizens arrest for a traffic violation. Normally, only law enforcement officers can stop and cite people for traffic violations that aren't actually misdemeanor crimes.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, true traffic infractions are defined as civil matters for which someone may be stopped and subjected to a citation but not arrested (even by a law enforcement officer). *See* Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 42\\-4\\-1701(1\\). In Colorado, only more serious traffic offenses (e.g. hit and run) are crimes subject to arrest.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord hires Realtor A to sell an apartment. Realtor A is part of the city Board of Realtors and has a listing agreement with the landlord that allows other professional realtors to show the property. Realtor B, who is affiliated with Realtor A through the Board of Realtors, enters the apartment to show it to a potential buyer without explicit permission from the landlord. Which of the following best describes the legal status of Realtor B's entry?\n\nA) Realtor B is trespassing because only Realtor A has permission to enter the apartment.\nB) Realtor B has apparent authority to enter the apartment as an agent of the landlord.\nC) Realtor B can only enter if accompanied by Realtor A.\nD) Realtor B needs written permission from the landlord to enter the apartment.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Realtor B has apparent authority to enter the apartment as an agent of the landlord. This is based on the concept of apparent authority in agency law, where a reasonable third party would believe the person (in this case, Realtor B) was an agent with the authority to act on behalf of the principal (the landlord). The listing agreement allows for other professional realtors to show the property, and Realtor B is affiliated with Realtor A through the Board of Realtors. This creates a chain of agency where Realtor B can be considered a sub-agent of the landlord through Realtor A. Therefore, Realtor B would have the apparent authority to enter the apartment for the purpose of showing it to potential buyers."

Can corporations be charged with any criminal offense, or are there some that cannot apply to anything except a human being? I'm interested in formal limits established by statute, caselaw saying a corporation can't satisfy the elements of certain crimes, and/or practical considerations making it essentially impossible to convict them of some kind of crime.\n\nWhile I'm especially interested in the US, I'd also be interested in other countries. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **This answer assumes Europe as jurisdiction, not the United States.**\n\nThis will vary wildly across jurisdictions, but given that this question is unanswered for two weeks now, I will provide an answer for Europe, specifically the Czech Republic. It will be somewhat different in other states.\n\nFirst, the list of criminal offenses a corporation can commit is specified in the law. It is exactly that, a list. Of the 300 crimes an individual can commit here, about 100 of them can also be done by a corporation. \n\nIt is hard to discover why these hundred crimes were chosen specifically. Logic used to make this list eludes me. For example, a corporation can commit *Rape*, but not *Murder*. It can commit a *Terrorist attack* but not *Terror*. It can commit *Threatening a public official* but not *Oppression*.\n\nI looked through the explanatory notes for the law and I discoved the reason: Strictly only those crimes were created for corporations that were required by higher european law, which only moves the question higher up. I did not look up what the European Parliament had to say about this.\n\nThere is one crime that was added specifically, later on, to the list, and that is [Usury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury).\n\nIn principle, all crimes committed by an individual can be done by a corporation, because a crime is considered to be committed by a corporation if the action is done by an employee in the name of the corporation.",

I'll just clarify some confusions that are palpable from the comments/chat.\n\nThe biggest trouble one could have faced is a claim of defamation regardless of the Non\\-Disparagement Agreement. However, according to your elaboration of the LinkedIn post, that is not the case because *truth* is an *absolute defense* in defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe difference of names OldCompany and NewCompany is irrelevant if they can be reasonably understood as referring to the same entity. \n\nRegarding the entity's convoluted mergers and operations, what matters is the concept of *economic reality*: Your post being about the same entity (1\\) for which you performed work, (2\\) by which you were paid, and (3\\) on the entity's LinkedIn page are very likely to outweigh the \\[rather inconsequential] fact that the company has used different names.\n\nSince the contract \\[based on your chat] does not specify sanctions for \"violating\" the non\\-disparagement clause, a court would have no objective way to quantify damages for you to pay to the company. The severance you received would not be indicative of that either.\n\nDepending on the specifics about your friend \\& ex\\-colleague's veteran status, and the conditions of his or her employment \\& termination, your public denouncement of his or her firing *might* be protected by the whistleblower statutes of your jurisdiction. Thus, if the company filed a lawsuit against you for violation of the non\\-disparagement clause, then you might want to analyze the whistleblower legislation to identify whether or not the whistleblower protections are available for your defense strategy. \n\nMy limited knowledge of whistleblower laws is that they relate to denouncements to a public/governmental body, whence an argument in the sense of whistleblower protection might require further thought and consideration of your specific situation.",

While the employee's action might be seen as a potential violation of the non-disparagement agreement, the legal consequences are likely to be limited. The primary concern would be a potential defamation claim. However, if the information posted is truthful, this serves as an absolute defense in defamation cases. The concept of \"economic reality\" suggests that the difference in company names (OLD COMPANY vs. NEW COMPANY) is likely irrelevant if they can be reasonably understood as the same entity. Criminal charges (A) are not applicable in this scenario. The agreement isn't automatically void due to a name change (D), and the employee isn't completely protected just because the agreement mentioned the old company name (B).

But between different eras of Supreme courts I guess the present takes precedence over the past? What is the rationale for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The House of Lords declared themselves able to depart from their own precedents in 1966, [stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_Statement) (emphasis added):\n\n> Their Lordships regard the use of precedent as an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It provides at least some degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in the conduct of their affairs, as well as a basis for orderly development of legal rules.\n> \n> \n> Their Lordships nevertheless recognise that **too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law**. They propose therefore, to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of this house as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\n> In this connection they will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts, settlement of property, and fiscal arrangements have been entered into and also the especial need for certainty as to the criminal law.\n> This announcement is not intended to affect the use of precedent elsewhere than in this House.\n\nThis applies equally to the Supreme Court, which has replaced the judicial functions of the Lords. The Practice Statement of 1966 itself overturned *London Street Tramways v London County Council* \\[1898] AC 375, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, had said:\n\n> A decision of this House once given on a point of law is conclusive on this House afterwards.\n\nIn the modern understanding, it is in the interests of justice for the Supreme Court to always be able to say what the law is, even if that conflicts with the understanding of the past. As it is the final court of appeal, there is no other court which could review or overturn its decisions. Parliament *could*, and sometimes has, done so, but it is not always easy to express the desired effect in statutory language; and Parliament has many other demands on its time. It was felt that the court itself should be in a position to say that a past judgement was wrongly decided, or should no longer be considered binding for another reason.\n\nIn the Scottish tradition, this power has long been held to be inherent in that country's highest courts, the Court of Session / High Court of Justiciary. It is allied to the *nobile officium*, or equitable jurisdiction of those courts to provide a just remedy in the absence of any explicit law. Judicial precedent is not a barrier to justice either. As Lord Kames said (*Historical law\\-tracts*, 1758; tract 8\\),\n\n> No defect in the constitution of a state deserves greater reproach, than the giving license to wrong without affording redress. Upon this account, it is the province, one should imagine, of the sovereign, and supreme court, to redress wrongs of every kind, where a peculiar remedy is not provided.\n\nThose courts have not held themselves to a strict idea of *stare decisis* with respect to their own decisions, feeling instead that in the interests of justice they should be able to decide what a particular case demands. John Erskine explained (*An institute of the law of Scotland*, 1773; book 1, title 1, section 47\\):\n\n> Decisions therefore though they bind the parties litigating create no obligation on the judges to follow in the same tract if it shall appear to them contrary to law.\n\nEnglish courts, at least once in their roughly modern shape following the reforms of the late 19th century, have taken a stricter view of precedent, in the interests of predictability. The reform of 1966 was influenced by differences between English and Scottish practice, and represents something of a course\\-correction away from the strict position of the prior era.\n\nIn terms of the present and the past, \"precedent\" doesn't precisely mean that the past wins out. It would be better to say that a past decision is *presumed to be right*, up until proved otherwise, or made obsolete by events such as the passage of new statutes. The presumption is binding on lower courts, and merely \"very strong\" for the highest court. The post\\-1966 position recognises that it is sometimes appropriate for the Supreme Court itself, seized of a particular case, to point out when a past decision is no longer right.",

The project is also similar to my current company projects.\n\nI had a discussion with him personally and shared quotations and documents representing myself and not any of my company. Everything is representing me and documents also specially made. I have not signed any documents also I have not gotten any money from him.\n\nWill this be a problem? If so what will be the solution?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is almost assuredly in violation of your non\\-compete (assuming that is what you mean).\n\nCompany documents would be covered under a non\\-disclosure agreement, so it doesn't matter if you generated them yourself or shared company documents. The key part of a non\\-compete is that you agree not to engage in work that is similar to the work/business of the company.\n\nThe only solution would be to have your company that you have the non\\-compete with sign off on you doing this work. This means you need to be very open about what they are requesting, what your function will be, and what solutions you will provide. Further muddying up the situation would be IP ownership, your current employer may have claim to anything you develop for this other company/person. Make sure that the other person knows this (and they will probably walk away if they are smart).\n\nHonestly this is one of those situations you don't want to be in, you should decline this request now before you get further in trouble.

Even though the employee hasn't signed any documents or received payment, discussing a similar project and sharing quotations likely violates the non-compete agreement. Non-compete agreements typically prohibit engaging in work similar to the current company's business, regardless of whether company resources are used or formal agreements are signed.

This is stated because, therefore, you should be treated the same as if you conferred with a lawyer before signing the contract even though you didn't. Otherwise, if one side had a contract drafted by a lawyer and the other side didn't, the contract would be construed in favor of the unrepresented party in cases of ambiguity.\n\nContract terms like that are usually placed in pre\\-nuptial agreements and agreements between lawyers and their clients, where there is a right to afford the other party an opportunity to seek independent legal counsel before signing the contract.

This doesn't actually waive future rights to legal advice, but rather indicates that the signatories should be treated as if they had consulted a lawyer, even if they didn't. This interpretation aligns with common contract practices, particularly in situations where one party might otherwise have an advantage due to legal representation.

A number of exchanges have become very predictable:\n\n* **Q**: How do you feel about a past decision? **A**: It is precedent. **Q**: Sure, but precedent can be overturned based on judge's interpretations. How do *you* feel about it? **A**: I am a judge, I just follow precedent\u2014stare decisis, etc.\n* **Q**: How do you feel about a case currently in the court system, which might come before you? **A**: I cannot give hints as to how I will vote in pending cases.\n* **Q**: How do you feel about a case that might come up in the future? **A**: I cannot speak to hypotheticals.\n\nAs to the *why* he is not able to answer these questions, he says that he studied previous nomination proceedings and is following what these other judges did. He calls this \"nominee precedent.\" However, he always says that is what \"I call it.\" This implies to me that \"nominee precedent\" is not a widely\\-used term.\n\nI do not have a background in law. The questions I have are:\n\n1. What is the precedent for what a Supreme Court nominee can and cannot say? How different is his approach from what people have done in the past? For lack of a better phrasing, is Kavanaugh just saying this to dodge questions, or is there actually a tradition of precedent supporting his pattern non\\-answers?\n2. What are the consequences if he does not follow this precedent? It seems to me to be unlikely that there is any legal consequence\u2014the only negative consequence he could face for not following this precedent is just that the Senate would not vote to confirm him.\n3. If there is solid, non\\-partisan, defensible precedent for him not answering questions, then what is the point of questioning the nominee? If a nominee cannot comment on past decisions by others, says to \"read the opinion\" on their own previous decisions, cannot comment on current cases, and cannot comment on hypotheticals of future cases, then what is the point of a hearing in the first place? It seems naive to believe that a person is a machine that follows predecent.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If a nominee cannot comment on past decisions by others, says to \"read\n>  the opinion\" on their own previous decisions, cannot comment on\n>  current cases, and cannot comment on hypotheticals of future cases,\n>  then what is the point of a hearing in the first place?\n\nMuch of what you describe constitutes improper evasion (please note that I have neither watched the hearings nor read any holdings by Kavanaugh, which I presume has prompted your question). A judge's mere answer that he would follow *stare decisis* is as useless as if a candidate for investment management simply answered that he would \"*buy low, sell high*\".\n\nNot all of that evasion is improper, though. For instance, the [Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct](http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/rules/documents/michigan%20code%20of%20judicial%20conduct.pdf) in its Canon 3\\.A(6\\) reads:\n\n> A judge should abstain from public comment about a pending or\n>  impending proceeding in any court, and should require a similar\n>  abstention on the part of court personnel subject to the judge's\n>  direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from\n>  making public statements in the course of official duties or from\n>  explaining for public information the procedures of the court or the\n>  judge's holdings or actions.\n\n(Note: I doubt the the federal equivalent of these rules would significantly differ. In this regard, the U.S. consists of many jurisdictions copying each other this type of rules. I would call it *jurisdictional rip\\-offs*. The term *rip\\-off* applies also from the standpoint that many judges flagrantly violate these rules, but I am digressing from the topic.)\n\nIn theory, the rationale for that \"Canon\" is that a judge's (or judicial candidate's/nominee's) public comments about pending or impending cases are very likely to disrupt litigation, exacerbate court\\-shopping, and is perceived as catering to certain lobbyists or groups of power, thereby heating the undeniable trafficking of influences in court. Moreover, that kind of comments would prejudice the party who is not favored by the comments and who has no equal access to the forum or media in order to refute those comments.\n\nHowever, you can see that the same item of that Canon allows a judge to explain \"*for public information \\[...] the judge's holdings or actions*\". Thus, principles of transparency should compel a judicial nominee to openly answer questions about his or her own decisions. Of course, for an examination to be effective, it is necessary that the legislators come prepared to the hearing by having read various opinions (decisions) released by that judge.\n\nFurthermore, the Canon does not prohibit to answer inquiries about hypothetical scenarios. As long as the hypotheticals do not resemble a pending or impending case, a judicial nominee (or candidate, where elected by public vote) should promptly give others a \\[non\\-conclusory] walk\\-through of his or her judicial rationale.",

However, it also explicitly allows judges to make public statements explaining \"for public information the procedures of the court or the judge's holdings or actions.\" This matches option C most closely. \n\nOption A is incorrect because judges are allowed to explain their own holdings or actions.

While there is indeed a potential risk that a courier could misuse the personal information provided (in this case, a copy of the passport), the likelihood of this happening depends on several factors. These include how carefully the company selects its couriers, what actions the company and local law enforcement would take if such misuse were reported, and the individual courier's integrity. It's not accurate to say there's no risk at all (A), nor is it reasonable to assume the risk is so high that the application should be cancelled (B).
