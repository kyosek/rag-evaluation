In fact, the word \"crisis\" does not appear at all in:\n\n[Mental Health Act 1959](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/contents), the [Mental Health Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/20/contents), the [Mental Capacity Act 2005](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents), or the [Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/8/contents).\n\nThe 1983 Act, being the primary legislation in this area, uses \"mental disorder\" which it defines at [section 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/20/section/1?timeline=false) as:\n\n> ...any disorder or disability of the mind", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to UK legislation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the concept of a \"mental health crisis\"?\n\nA) The Mental Health Act 1983 provides a clear statutory definition of a \"mental health crisis.\"\nB) The term \"mental health crisis\" is legally defined in the Mental Capacity Act 2005.\nC) \"Mental health crisis\" has no specific legal definition in UK mental health legislation.\nD) The Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2013 outlines the criteria for determining a \"mental health crisis.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation clearly states that the term \"mental health crisis\" has no legal definition in UK legislation. The word \"crisis\" does not appear in the Mental Health Act 1983, Mental Health Act 1959, Mental Capacity Act 2005, or the Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2013. Instead, the primary legislation (Mental Health Act 1983) uses the term \"mental disorder,\" which it defines as \"any disorder or disability of the mind.\" This makes option C the most accurate statement, as it correctly identifies that \"mental health crisis\" lacks a specific legal definition in UK mental health legislation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67224/using-sting-confessions", "docs_id": 67224, "title": "Using &quot;Sting&quot; confessions", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In USA, if I am not mistaken, if the police fail to warn someone that \"anything you say may be used against you,\" then whatever he says to them is inadmissible.\n\nI don't understand then why a confession gotten by the subterfuge of someone else with a hidden recorder is admissible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because a \"sting\" does not trigger the prerequisites for the warning\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [Miranda Warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_warning#Circumstances_triggering_the_Miranda_requisites) has triggering events:\n\n> The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda warnings, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\n\n> The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure, or once an officer has probable cause to arrest, or if the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation.\n\nIf you voluntarily speak to a police officer (uniformed or undercover, identified as such or not) while not being both in custody and subject to interrogation, that speech can be used in evidence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A suspect, John, is approached by an undercover police officer at a bar.

In this scenario, John was not in custody (he was freely conversing in a bar) and was not being formally interrogated by a known police officer. The undercover nature of the interaction means that John's statements were voluntary and not the result of custodial interrogation. Therefore, the admission would likely be admissible in court without any additional circumstances needed. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Miranda rights are not required for voluntary statements made to undercover officers. \nOption B is incorrect because the admissibility of the statement depends on the circumstances at the time it was made, not what happened afterwards. \nOption C is incorrect because revealing the officer's identity would likely make the interaction more like a formal interrogation, potentially requiring Miranda warnings if John was also in custody."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25590/when-is-a-place-generally-accessible", "docs_id": 25590, "title": "When is a place &#39;generally accessible&#39;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In local regulation at a place I wish to wildcamp there is something like this (translated):\n\n> 1\\) Within the city limits of Werfen, Austria it is not allowed to place tents, trailers. mobile homes etc. for the purpose of sleeping over night in public (generally accessible) places.

Is this a valid argument?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Firstly, yours is not a valid argument. What is meant by \"generally accessible\" is public places like plazas, stretches of green by the road, parks, parking lots, etc. The definition is kind of a negative and could be more easily phrased as: \"You may camp at A) designated camping areas or B) private places where you are entitled to camp\". This means you either have to find a camping area where you pay a fee for a period of time, or you may camp on private grounds that either belong to you, or you have been given explicit permission to camp, say in a private garden or field. Of course this is practically impossible if you don't know anyone in there.\n\nBut, the screenshot explicitly restricts this rule with the leading prase \"Im Gemeindegebiet\" which means if you leave the legal boundaries of Werfen, Salzburg county law applies (Which may or may not be similar).\n\nDisclaimer: While I don't have legal background, I can tell from personal experience that local governments are touchy on this and striking up camp somewhere where you are not allowed to will at least (if detected) require you to leave the premises immediately and the police may charge you with trespassing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the local regulation in Werfen, Austria, which of the following statements is correct regarding camping restrictions?\n\nA) Camping is allowed in any privately-owned area within city limits without permission\nB) The regulation only applies to tents, not to mobile homes or trailers\nC) Camping is prohibited in all public areas within city limits, except for licensed camp sites\nD) \"Generally accessible\" places include private gardens where permission has been granted\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because private areas still require explicit permission from the owner.\nB is incorrect as the regulation specifically mentions tents, trailers, and mobile homes.\nC is correct, as the regulation prohibits camping in public (generally accessible) places within city limits, with an exception for licensed camp sites.\nD is incorrect because private gardens with permission are not considered \"generally accessible\" public places.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the regulation's scope, the definition of \"generally accessible\" places, and the exceptions to the rule.

Even if the procedure is not covered under the original insurance contract, the insurance company can be held liable under the tort of negligent misstatement.

Does it matter whether an investigation ended up resulting in a prosecution? If so, does it matter whether the case goes to trial? If so, does it matter whether the prosecution is successful (defendant is convicted)?\n\nIf search warrants generally are public records, what is the best, most efficient, most compelling way to retrieve them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short answer:** Maybe.\n\n**Long answer:** The answer here varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nNormally, the process goes like this: The application for the warrant is usually made under seal or otherwise in secret to prevent the target from trying to hide evidence. So before it's been executed, you can pretty much forget about accessing it. After the warrant is executed, though, there are differing answers to this question.\n\nThe Supreme Court gave us a test for this kind of question in *[Press\\-Enterprise II](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13753927311495241910)*, which held that the First Amendment gives us a qualified right to access court proceedings and records. The right applies when public access makes sense using the \"experience and logic\" test: Has the Anglo\\-Saxon experience typically been to provide access, and does logic tell us that access has beneficial effects for the judicial process?\n\nBut lower courts have disagreed about how to apply the test. The Eighth Circuit allowed access to warrants in a defense\\-industry corruption investigation in *[In re Search Warrant for Secretarial Area\\-Gunn](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10448147063985598731)*, but the Ninth Circuit denied access in to warrants in the same investigation in *[Times Mirror Co. v. U.S.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3799723892039676377)* I think, though, that the Ninth Circuit decision would have come out differently if the investigation had already ended.\n\nJust to mix things up further, the Fourth Circuit has also allowed access, but based on common law principles of access, rather than the First Amendment. That was *[Baltimore Sun Co. v. Goetz](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11321522830792891234)*. Same in the Second Circuit: *[In re Application of Newsday, Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11861486303090610370)*\n\nIndividual states also have their own rules, but those are of course subject to limits under the First Amendment.\n\nWhen I wanted a copy of a warrant, I would go first to the clerk of the court whose judge signed the warrant. I would tell them what I was looking for, and I pretty much always got it.\n\nI would rarely submit a FOIA request, especially if the warrant was issued by a federal agency. Those requests sit in a queue for months or years without being reviewed, and the agency virtually always denies the request anyway. When law enforcement agencies and courts have copies of the same record, you're almost always going to have better luck getting access from the courts, which are set to open by default.

The accessibility of search warrants in the United States varies significantly depending on the jurisdiction and several other factors. Key points supporting this answer include:\n\n1. Different circuit courts have issued conflicting rulings on the matter. For example, the Eighth Circuit allowed access to warrants in a defense-industry corruption investigation, while the Ninth Circuit denied access in the same investigation.\n\n2. The Supreme Court's \"experience and logic\" test from Press-Enterprise II provides a framework for determining access, but lower courts have applied it differently.\n\n3. Some courts base access on First Amendment principles, while others use common law principles.\n\n4. The status of the investigation can affect accessibility. Warrants are typically sealed before execution, and some courts may be more likely to grant access after an investigation has concluded.\n\n5. State laws also play a role in determining accessibility, subject to First Amendment limits.\n\n6.

The example shows that alternative formats can be used effectively.\n\nAnswer B is false because the information explicitly states that \"ritual language of contracts is not strictly necessary\" and that courts will interpret documents as contracts if there's a reasonable way to do so.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as there's no indication that using an index or list of defined terms would invalidate a contract.

A *title* is a document that serves as proof of ownership. A *prima facie title,* is when one doesn't have a title, but has other things that usually indicate one is the owner. Having these things shows, *on their face*, that you are the owner of the property.

However, this is distinct from establishing a prima facie title, which must be proven with evidence during the trial.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text clearly differentiates between a prima facie case and a prima facie title, stating they should not be confused.\n\nOption B is wrong on two counts: it reverses the relationship between prima facie case and temporary injunctions, and it incorrectly suggests that prima facie title is needed for an injunction.\n\nOption D is incorrect as the text explicitly states that these terms are not interchangeable and have distinct meanings in the context of property law and court proceedings."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37532/what-is-the-legal-procedure-for-suing-to-void-a-contract-for-non-performance", "docs_id": 37532, "title": "What is the legal procedure for suing to void a contract for non-performance?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes a person might have a contract that they wish to void because the other party is not performing on their end of the contract. Generally it is the person who is paying money who wants to void the contract and the one providing services would be the plaintiff. For example, recently [a small business owner got hit with a $4000\\+ contractual demand when she tried to end her internet service contract because the internet service was bad](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/frontier-demands-4300-cancellation-fee-despite-horribly-slow-internet/).\n\nSo, for example, in Massachusetts I know that district courts are supposed to handle certain \"equitable injunctions\", but superior court handles \"equitable relief\". I am not sure of the exact distinction there. So which court would it be?\n\nAssuming we have figured out the right court, is it then just a matter of making a normal suit for equitable relief stating cause and asking for an order voiding the contract as the remedy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are at least three options available to litigate this dispute. \n\nThe first doesn't actually require going to court unless the other side tries to sue you. The second would probably be cheaper if the suit could be brought in a limited jurisdiction district court rather than a general jurisdiction superior court. The third would have to be brought in a superior court which would usually be slower and more expensive than bringing suit in district court.\n\nAlso, @I\u00f1akiViggers is correct that the contract might require mediation prior to commencing litigation, or might require an arbitration forum. That would need to be confirmed before someone files suit. Both kinds of terms would be common in contracts like the one described.\n\n**Self Help**\n\nThe usual one is to stop paying and advise the non\\-performing party why you are doing so (which takes little or no legal fees). Then, the non\\-performing party has to sue you to get paid, and you have a credible defense against that suit. But, you can't be sure in advance that the court will rule in your favor.\n\n**A Suit For A Refund**\n\nA second option would be to sue the service provider for a refund of the amounts already paid which were not earned as a result of non\\-performance. This breach of contract suit would be proper in any court with jurisdiction over breach of contract suits with the appropriate amount in controversy in the lawsuit. The service provider would then probably counterclaim against you for the amount owed for which you have not yet paid (if any).\n\nA declaration of the rights of the parties would have to be made by the court incident to resolving the claim for money judgment relief in the case.\n\n**A Declaratory Judgment Action**\n\nA third option is to bring a suit for \"declaratory judgment\". This is a lawsuit brought when there is a bona fide dispute between the parties concerning the interpretation of a legal issues such as contract interpretation or statutory interpretation as applied to a particular situation. The court would then rule on the question of whether you had a right to withhold payment before you risked being sued, without providing any other relief.\n\nIf the court determined that the breach of contract eliminated your obligation to pay, you could then cease to pay and request a refund of what you have already paid without risking being sued for non\\-payment which could hurt your credit rating, or put you at risk of violating some loan covenant that considers being sued for non\\-payment of a debt to be an event of default unless a bond is posted for the payment of that debt (which is not uncommon in business loan agreements).\n\nIt is not entirely settled whether a declaratory judgment action is equitable or not. In some circumstances in some jurisdictions, these kinds of lawsuits are aways treated as equitable because they don't seek either a money judgment or possession of specific real property or personal property, which are the primary kinds of remedies allowed in non\\-equitable cases called \"actions arising at law\". Other jurisdictions, for example, for the purpose of determining a right to a jury trial, look to whether the underlying dispute in which relief is sought arises at law or in equity to determine the character of the action.\n\nUsually, case law interpreting or the express language of, the statute setting out the jurisdiction of particular courts, or the statute or constitutional provision authorizing declaratory judgment actions in a jurisdiction, will address the question of whether a particular kind of court has jurisdiction to entertain declaratory judgment actions. As explained below, in MA, a statute expressly states which courts do and do not have jurisdiction to enter declaratory judgments.\n\nA suit for an injunction is always one seeking equitable relief, but an injunction is a court order directing someone to refrain from taking a particular action, or ordering someone to take a particular action, rather than simply declaring what the law says about the rights of the parties in a particular situation without actually requiring either party to do, or refrain from doing anything, as a declaratory judgment does. In the situation that you describe in the question, the proper court in which to bring a declaratory judgment action regarding this dispute would be the superior court.\n\nIn MA, the statute describing jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment is M.G.L.A. 231A, \u00a7 1\\. It states (emphasis added and paragraph break added for ease of reading in this digital format):\n\n> \u00a7 1\\. Power to make declaratory determination; jury questions\n> \n> \n> **The supreme judicial court, the superior court, the land court and the probate courts,** within their respective jurisdictions, may on\n>  appropriate proceedings make binding declarations of right, duty,\n>  status and other legal relations sought thereby, either before or\n>  after a breach or violation thereof has occurred in any case in which\n>  an actual controversy has arisen and is specifically set forth in the\n>  pleadings and whether any consequential judgment or relief is or could\n>  be claimed at law or in equity or not; and such proceeding shall not\n>  be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment\n>  or decree is sought thereby and such declaration, when made, shall\n>  have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and be\n>  reviewable as such; provided, that nothing contained herein shall be\n>  construed to authorize the change, extension or alteration of the law\n>  regulating the method of obtaining service on, or jurisdiction over,\n>  parties or affect their right to trial by jury. \n> \n> \n> When a declaration of right, or the granting of further relief based\n>  thereon, shall involve the determination of issues of fact triable by\n>  a jury as of right and as to which a jury trial is duly claimed by the\n>  party entitled thereto, or issues which the court, in accordance with\n>  the practice of courts of equity, considers should be tried by a jury,\n>  such issues may be submitted to a jury in the form of questions, with\n>  proper instructions by the court, whether a general verdict be\n>  required or not.\n\nAs the language above indicates, for purposes of a right to a jury trial, MA is a state in which a declaratory judgment action is not automatically either at law or in equity, but instead the court looks through to the nature of the underlying dispute to determine if there is a right to a jury trial (which hinges on the distinction between law and equity).\n\n**FOOTNOTE RE STATUTORY DRAFTING STYLE**\n\nThe MA declaratory judgment statute demonstrates a common feature of (bad) American statutory drafting, which is the use of very long compound, multi\\-clause sentences. This is disfavored in modern legal writing because it often gives rise to ambiguities in meaning and is hard to read.\n\nThis style became common because American statutory drafters were worried that if the entire concept of a statute was not contained in one sentence that a sentence from the statute could be truthfully quoted out of context in a way that would mislead a reader regarding the meaning of the statute as a whole. This was particularly a problem in the days when few people had easy access to the full statutory language of a law. Thus, many readers of a misleading out of context quote from a statute would not be able to review the full context of the quoted language to determine its true meaning.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, a small business owner wants to void their internet service contract due to poor service quality.

Some documents, mostly relating to mediation, can never be made public. Other documents are covered by the blanket rule \"A non\\-party may, if the court gives permission, obtain from the records of the court a copy of any other document filed by a party, or communication between the court and a party or another person\", which allows the court itself to draw the line between open justice and breach of privacy which will discourage frankness in future cases.

Physical evidence, such as paperwork, exists to verify testimony and protect against misremembering, but it does not stand alone without someone testifying to its authenticity and relevance. In the case of a dispute over the contents of registered mail (e.g., claiming to have received an empty envelope), the sender would testify that they sent a specific letter and provide a copy as evidence. The proof of delivery shows the item wasn't lost in transit. If one party claims they sent a letter and the other claims they received an empty envelope, it becomes a matter of conflicting testimony, potentially involving perjury, which would merit further investigation.

If so, that's how you have to do it.\n\nIf not, is there a *designated* email address for such communications? The courts have held that addresses that are advertised (e.g. on a website or letterhead) or actually used for communications between the parties are *prima facie* *designated*.

In my home state a child as young as 8 can be left alone, but it's unlikely a child that young would have any idea he could refuse a search from police if they showed up and demanded to do so.\n\nCould such a search authorized by a child be upheld by the courts? Is there some cutoff for age before a child is old enough to be able to authorize a search of a home he resides in?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The central legal question would be whether the minor has the capacity and authority to consent to a search: in the context of search law, the police would have to have a reasonable belief that both are the case. It is not reasonable to believe that an 8 year old can consent to a police search, that is, a child will most likely acquiesce to a request from the authorities to conduct a search. It is as reasonable to believe that a 16 year old can give actual consent as it is to believe that an 18 year old can consent. The law leaves the matter open for those under 18, to be determined by circumstances. The other consideration, applicable to younger children, is whether the child is authorized to open the house to outsiders.\n\nSo in [People v. Hoxter](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/75/406.html), 75 Cal.

The homeowner is away, but their 14-year-old child is present. The officer asks the child for permission to enter and search the home. Under what circumstances is this search most likely to be considered legal?\n\nA) If the child has been explicitly told by the parents to never let anyone in the house\nB) If the child regularly babysits younger siblings and has authority to make household decisions\nC) If the child is home alone for the first time and has no history of being left in charge\nD) If the child is actively engaging in illegal activities inside the home\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The legality of a search authorized by a minor depends on the child's capacity and authority to consent. Courts generally consider factors like age, maturity, and the child's role in the household. Option B presents a scenario where the 14-year-old regularly babysits and makes household decisions, suggesting they have been granted a level of authority by the parents. This implies the child may have the capacity to understand the implications of consenting to a search and the authority to allow others into the home. \n\nOption A would likely invalidate the search as the child has been explicitly instructed not to allow entry. Option C presents a situation where the child likely lacks the necessary authority or experience to consent. Option D might actually give the police probable cause for a warrantless search, making the child's consent irrelevant.\n\nThe age of 14 is also significant, as it falls within the range (13-14 years old) that some courts have suggested as a potential line for when minors might be capable of consenting to police searches. However, it's important to note that age alone is not determinative, and courts would consider the totality of circumstances."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33369/is-it-illegal-for-someone-to-view-my-private-instagram-through-someone-else-s-ac", "docs_id": 33369, "title": "Is it illegal for someone to view my private Instagram through someone else\u2019s account?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it illegal for someone to view my private Instagram through someone else\u2019s account?

There are subtleties; in the UK for example more than 20 one penny coins are not legal tender.

Say you go shopping in a supermarket for $40\\. You take your shopping, you now have a $40 debt. You take four $10 bills and hand them over, your debt is paid. At that point this $10 bill must be accepted. However, the shop owner could refuse to let you take the shopping if he doesn't like your bills. So you have no debt, so he doesn't have to accept legal tender as a debt.\n\nIn a restaurant, where you typically eat your food, creating a debt, then he cannot refuse the $10 bill.

While businesses generally should accept all legal tender, there's a crucial distinction between refusing service before a debt is incurred and refusing payment for an existing debt. The shop owner can refuse to enter into a transaction (i.e., sell a pizza) if the customer only has the John A. MacDonald $10 bills. However, if the pizza has already been made and given to the customer, creating a debt, the shop owner would be obligated to accept the legal tender offered as payment. This aligns with the principle that businesses have some discretion in how they conduct transactions, but once a debt exists, they must accept legal tender as payment.

My state does not require an operating agreement, but I read online that it's a good idea to have one to protect your personal finance from liability further that just having an LLC would, so I made an operating agreement. My question is: what do I do to put this agreement on record, besides just keeping it in my personal folder at home? There is nowhere on my state's filing website where I could upload such an agreement. \n\nI'm a sole proprietor with no employees at this time. My concern is that if a question comes up that would put the operating agreement into play, how would people know that the agreement was established originally and I didn't just write a new one to suit the situation? Would the creation date of the PDF file be enough proof? How often is such proof needed? Or am I worrying about this for nothing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Normally operating agreements are kept in private files in a home or office. The law in Iowa legally requires the managers or manager\\-members of an LLC to maintain the records of a limited liability company in an organized fashion including an operating agreement, if any. \n\n(In most countries in continental Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia, these kinds of company records have to be kept instead in the custody of a notary public who has more record keeping responsibilities and education comparable to a lawyer, unlike a U.S. notary public. I don't know what the rule is in Puerto Rico and Louisiana, where the legal systems are based on Spanish and French law respectively, but have been influenced by the law of other U.S. states over the years.)\n\nAn operating agreement can't change the rights of the LLC vis\\-a\\-vis third parties. It is only binding on the members of the company, the company itself, and tax authorities. When you have only one member, the LLC is disregarded for tax purposes, so what the operating agreement says doesn't even affect the tax authorities. So, as a practical matter, there are almost never meaningful disputes over the authenticity or date of execution of an operating agreement in a single member LLC, and if there are, your signature and the date on the original operating agreement will be presumptively valid.\n\nIf you have more than one member, the presence of original signatures from more than one person on the operating agreement will typically be sufficient to authenticate the operating agreement in any dispute that arises between the members, between a member and the company, or with taxing authorities.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to have a copy somewhere as well, because an operating agreement is not like a dollar bill. The physical document isn't something with legal power, the physical document is only evidence of what you have decided to do and your decision is what has the actual legal power. So, as long as you can authenticate a photocopy of the original operating agreement that is just as good as the real thing, and normally identifying the fact that you signed the operating agreement will be sufficient to authenticate it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A sole proprietor in Iowa has created an operating agreement for their newly registered LLC.

Alternatively, are there any mechanisms by which one could possibly learn on a less speculative basis, perhaps by a FOIA request or the local equivalent, for the judge's timesheet entries that might have logged his efforts deliberating and working on that case as a government employee? Or simply writing to him on an informal and candid basis inquiring as to how long this impressively comprehensive reference on vexatious litigation tactics took him to produce?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judges don't have timesheet entries (and are often expressly excluded from FOIA obligations). They get paid salaries and are expected to work hard enough to clear their dockets in reasonable periods of time, however long that takes.\n\nIf you wanted a more direct evidentiary estimate, you could estimate that a judge and his clerk together probably work 90\\-120 hours a week, figure out how many trials and hearings of what length were conducted and deduct that time spent on that from the total, and then divide the remaining hours by the number of opinions one can estimate that the judge wrote (or better yet, a reasonable estimate of the number of pages of opinions that one can estimate that the judge wrote).\n\nTypically, a lot of the legal research grunt work and more boilerplate parts of an opinion are written by the law clerk under some general instructions from the judge, with the judge writing the more substantive sections personally and heavily (or lightly, depending upon the quality of the law clerk) revising the draft opinion as a whole. The longer the opinion, the more likely it is that a substantial portion of it was written by the law clerk.\n\nFor similar kinds of legal writing (e.g. appellate briefs and motions for summary judgment and proposed orders or written closing arguments) one to six hours per page from all professionals working on the document would be in the right ballpark.\n\nJudicial opinions come with some efficiencies, because once a judge decides a point of law or reaches a factual conclusion it doesn't have to be belabored in the same way that a litigant who isn't sure if their reasoning will be persuasive or not must.\n\nBut, judicial opinions also typically have to spell out a greater proportion of legal and factual foundation for the end analysis that isn't hotly contested, will summarize all of the material points from the evidence presented in the case, and will frequently also recap in some detail the arguments made by the advocates for both sides of the case before actually engaging with those arguments in an analysis section.\n\nOn balance, those factors probably pretty much balance out.\n\nIf the judicial opinion is shorter, elegantly written, contains pithy turns of phrase, and/or contains lots of legal citations or factual analysis not raised by either party, it is probably closer to five or six hours per page or more. If the opinion is longer, has a rote and mechanical feel to it, and has very little factual analysis or references to law not mentioned by the parties, it is probably closer to one hour per page or even less. When some of these factors go one way, and other of these factors go the other way, it is probably in between in terms of hours per page.\n\nThis said, sometimes it takes a judge a long time to write an opinion, but the end product is very short and elegant. In these situations, often what happened is that the judge and the judge's clerk spent lots and lots of hours writing a long and detailed first draft, then got an insight that provided a much more efficient and succinct way to reach a resolution to the case. In those circumstances, there would be dozens or scores of hours of work that went into the discarded first draft, only to be superseded by a half a dozen or dozen hours devoted to a much shorter final draft. In those cases, the final draft of the opinion might be ten or twenty hours per page or more once you include the time spent on the discarded draft.\n\nOf course, another factor is that some judges are just more efficient legal writers than others, and some judges have more familiarity with some areas of law than others. A opinion that might take one judge twenty hours to write might take another judge presiding over the very same case and producing an opinion of the same length and quality a hundred hours to write.\n\nThe opinion in *Meads v.

According to California Family Code \u00a72030-2034, the court has discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs. The decision is based on what is \"just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties.\" The court considers the need for the award to enable each party to adequately present their case, taking into account their financial resources.\n\nWhile John is the wealthier spouse, this doesn't automatically mean he must pay all of Jane's legal fees (eliminating option A).

The parent, not the child, would likely face legal consequences. The intent behind choosing such a name is crucial. The parent knowingly selected a name designed to cause data damage, which could lead to criminal charges for destruction of property or cyber crimes. Additionally, they could face civil liability for damages resulting from the data loss. The unusual nature of the name and its clear purpose as a SQL injection attack would make it difficult to argue lack of intent.

Very few states have adopted the false light tort because of its conflict with First Amendment principles and there was no agreement or even request to keep the text private.\n\nThe copyright issue is trickier. First all, the TOS may provide that the copyright belongs to the text service provider or that there is a license. But, even in the absence of an express license, sending someone a message which is equivalent to sending them a letter, probably gives rise to an implied license that the person to whom it is sent can use the message that arises merely from the act of sending it without restriction or qualification. Implied license and fair use also heavily overlap.\n\nPublishing the text exactly as it was sent to you protects you from defamation liability because it is true.\n\nOn the whole it would be extremely unlikely for there to be any legal liability for publishing a text from someone that they sent to you. \n\nOf course, one can imagine exceptions. \n\nIf the person receiving the text was in an attorney\\-client relationship, or priest\\-parishioner making confession relationship, or was communicating regarding classified national security matters, or there was a non\\-disclosure agreement in place, among other possibilities, an evidentiary privilege and duty of confidentiality could apply and disclosing the material without the permission of the privilege holder could breach a duty of confidentiality and give rise to liability.\n\nIf the picture was a nude picture of a minor, there could be a criminal and/or civil liability issue, and some states have also made posting \"revenge porn\" a criminal offense and/or a basis for civil liability.\n\nIf the disclosure was effectively a way to facilitate insider trading that could be a problem.\n\nIf the contents of the text were accurately transmitted but known to be false and were disseminated without disclosure of its falsity for the purpose of defrauding a third party, that could be a problem.\n\nBut, no facts that obviously flag any exception are identified in the question.

So under U.S. laws, what's considered a reasonable time for leasing agreements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Reasonableness\" is a deliberately vague and flexible term. It does not \\-\\- and is not meant to \\-\\- have any precise definition.\n\nInstead, it is meant to be highly case specific. A \"reasonable\" time to repair will therefore be longer or shorter, depending on the circumstances. If you want a scratch in your countertop repaired, a \"reasonable\" time is probably a lot longer than if you want the plumbing repaired. And a reasonable time to repair the plumbing may itself vary with the availability of vendors, supplies, etc.\n\nLikewise with the air conditioning. It's probably a lot more reasonable to wait three months to fix the AC if it breaks down in December than in if it breaks down in the summer, which it sounds like is what's happened to you.\n\nBased on the timing, I'd feel very comfortable arguing that the leasing company has breached the agreement. The \"reasonableness\" standard is meant to give the landlord adequate time to respond and get the job done properly, but it can't be stretched indefinitely as seems to be happening here, to the point where you have essentially lost the entire benefit of air conditioning by sitting in a hot apartment for the entirety of the summer.\n\nNew York City has pretty strong tenant\\-protection laws, so I suspect that you would have the option of hiring someone to handle the repairs yourself and then deducting your costs from the rent you owe.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in New York City has been experiencing recurring air conditioning issues in their apartment for three months during the summer.

The concept of \"reasonable time\" for repairs is intentionally flexible and depends on the specific circumstances. In this case, three months without proper air conditioning during summer would likely be considered unreasonable. New York City has strong tenant protection laws, and in such situations, tenants may have the right to arrange for repairs themselves and deduct the cost from their rent. While the tenant might have grounds to terminate the lease, this isn't automatically permitted without penalty.

However, German employment law generally favors the protection of employees. In this case:\n\n1. The employee has a signed contract with Company A, which could be considered valid.\n2. The employee is receiving payroll documents from Company B, indicating an employment relationship.\n3. German law strongly supports the concept that if you work somewhere, you are employed there.\n4. The employee could potentially sue Company B to obtain a proper employment contract, based on the actual work relationship.\n5.

The criminal law of Canada recognizes no middle category called \u201clegal impossibility\u201d. Because Mr. Dynar attempted to do the impossible but did not attempt to commit an imaginary crime, he can only have attempted to do the \u201cfactually impossible\u201d. For this reason, Mr. Dynar\u2019s proposal that s. 24(1\\) criminalizes only attempts to do the factually impossible does not help him.\n\nAn example of a \"factual impossibility\" cited by the court was \"impossibility due to inadequate means... For example, A tries to kill B by shooting at him from too great a distance or by administering too small a dose of poison.\"\n\n> That this man\u2019s design is premised on a mistaken understanding of the facts does not make it any less his design.

The court recognizes \"factual impossibility\" as a valid basis for attempt charges, which includes cases where the means are inadequate or impossible. As long as John had the genuine intent to kill (which can be inferred from his belief in the ritual's deadly power) and took steps beyond mere preparation (completing the ritual), he could be convicted of attempted murder, despite the impossibility of his methods actually causing harm.

I've always assumed that the birth certificate has always been a simple record keeping device used by the government as a basis for identity and to prevent frauds.

Meads dubs them) proponents of the BC as originally a type of financial device?\n\nIncidentally I was reading the other day about indentured servitude contracts and they seem to be more along the lines of what these movements are describing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in the United Kingdom is a nineteenth\\-century innovation, based on the previous practice of keeping parish records of baptisms, marriages, and burials. The history is different but parallel in England (and Wales) and Scotland.\n\nWhat the churches were originally trying to do was to record information about their own ceremonies, because there are religious consequences to being baptized, married, etc. Civil law follows: you might have to prove in court that you were validly married to such\\-and\\-such a person, now deceased, and therefore had the right to live in his home as his widow.\n\nThe parish system, because of its general utility, was regulated by legislation. In England, it was made mandatory in all parishes in the middle of the sixteenth century (although in practice, this happened at different rates in different places). Legislation in the following centuries covered the manner of keeping records, penalties for non\\-compliance, and fees for registration. For example, by the late seventeenth century you would have to pay sixpence to register the birth of each child, and a massive 40 shillings if you failed to do so within five days of the event. Registration also served as a device to give nonconformists an incentive to join the established churches, as there was no secular way to prove age, and few ways to marry.\n\nWith liberalisation of religious strictures in the nineteenth century, the civil system began in England and Wales in 1837, and in Scotland in 1855\\. Under the Acts ([6 Will 4 c.33](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1836_(33)_Registration_of_Births_%26c._A_bill_for_registering_Births_Deaths_and_Marriages_in_England), [17\\&18 Vict c.80](http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)&active=yes&mno=4048)), records were kept by governmental authority, with no religious qualification required. This was helpful for non\\-Anglicans or non\\-Presbyterians wanting to live their lives, and helpful for the government for having a more complete set of records for the population in general.\n\nCurrently, registration of births is free, but there are various penalties for not doing it in time, and it costs money to get copies of birth certificates. The fees are not based on any estimate of lifelong earning power or anything of the kind. There was a *very brief* period (1695 to 1706\\) where in order to fund a war with France, the government levied a variable rate tax on parish register entries. The rates depended on the degree of the person registered. It was abolished due to its considerable unpopularity, also resulting in low rates of compliance and therefore revenue gained.\n\nThe law, [An Act for granting to his Majesty certaine rates and duties upon Marriages Births and Burials and upon Batchelors and Widowers for the terme of Five yeares for carrying on the Warr against France with Vigour](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol6/pp568-583), 6\\&7 Wm\\&Mary c.6, now called the \"Duties on Marriages, etc. Act 1694\", set out the following for births:\n\n* Paupers: Free\n* Most people: Two shillings\n* Aristocrats: Between twelve and thirty pounds depending on rank, and with a surcharge for the eldest son, in addition to the two shillings.\n* Baronets, knights, lawyers, academics, gentlemen and senior clergy: Between one and five pounds, plus the two shillings.\n* Anyone not included in the above but who is rich: Twelve shillings.\n\nSimilar fees were charged for marriages and so on. I believe this is the only time in UK law when there were differential fees for registration depending on the status of the parents. The scale was presumably based on the idea that wealthier people could afford to pay more. There were no legal consequences for the *child* as a result of the different fee paid, except insofar as they would be disadvantaged later in life if they were not properly registered.\n\nThe law was repealed and the \"Warr against France\" has also been over for a long time.\n\nAs usual, the \"sovereign citizen\" conception is completely bogus. There is not, and has never been, any notion of a birth certificate being a financial instrument. The confusion may be due to the word *instrument* being used for lots of different kinds of official documents, as well as a general boneheadedness about how the law works. A birth certificate is a convenient way to prove the circumstances of your birth, and for the government to collect statistics.

The documentation mentions that from 1695 to 1706, there was indeed a brief period where birth registration fees varied based on social status and wealth. This was implemented through the \"Duties on Marriages, etc. Act 1694\" to fund a war against France. The fees ranged from free for paupers to substantial amounts for aristocrats and wealthy individuals.\n\nOption A is incorrect because birth certificates have never been used as financial instruments or based on estimated earning potential. This is a misconception often promoted by \"sovereign citizen\" movements.\n\nOption B is inaccurate because while parish records became mandatory in England in the mid-16th century, the current civil registration system began much later - in 1837 for England and Wales, and 1855 for Scotland.\n\nOption D is also incorrect.
