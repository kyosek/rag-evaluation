While it's true that generally, contracts may become void when a company ceases to exist, there are scenarios where confidentiality obligations can persist. For instance, if the company's assets (including contracts) were sold during bankruptcy, the new owner might have the right to enforce the agreement. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, dissolved companies may continue to exist legally for a period after dissolution, allowing for the potential enforcement of contracts. The survival clause in the agreement also indicates an intent for the confidentiality obligations to continue beyond the agreement's termination.

There's a seemingly unsolved question of \"How Many Federal Laws Are There?\" ([https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/03/frequent\\-reference\\-question\\-how\\-many\\-federal\\-laws\\-are\\-there/](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/03/frequent-reference-question-how-many-federal-laws-are-there/))\n\nAfter reading some related articles, delving into the Statutes at Large and United States Code, and finding a question in a similar vein ([How many lines of text in all currently active federal laws of US?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22502/how-many-lines-of-text-in-all-currently-active-federal-laws-of-us/22512#22512)), I'm starting to see the monstrous size of the problem.\n\nAssuming you don't care about time, effort, etc., what would be the simplest, most naive approach to compiling all of US law into a single body of work? Is it even theoretically possible?\n\nMy initial thought was to find all of the relevant information (all the many volumes and documents), but even this seems difficult. How does anyone (citizens, lawyers, judges, other government officials, etc.) even verify that the actions they've taken are legal when the potential applicable laws are so vastly separated from each other being in entirely different series of documents written in format of chronological amendments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main impediment is identifying exactly what \"a law\" is. When people talk (casually) about \"the law\", that can refer to statutes enacted by Congress, regulations set forth by administrative agencies to articulate specifics of those statutes, and Supreme Court rulings as to what \"the law\" is or says. The canonical example of \"a law\" is a statute passed by Congress. Under that understanding, you could point to the US Code and ask the question \"how many\", though you may have to also subtract things ruled unconstitutional by SCOTUS (they aren't removed from The Code, unless actually repealed by Congress).\n\nIn the US code, there isn't an enumerable element \"a law\". [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17) pertains to copyright; [Title 18](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18) pertains to crime. There isn't just one law about crime and one law about copyright. There are 12 chapters in Title 17; Chapter 1 has a couple dozen sections. Sections can get fairly minutely subdivided: there is no clear point at which you can say \"this is one law, this is another\". However, it is legally irrelevant how many there are \u2013 unless Congress passes a law that counts likes (\"must repeal two laws for every new one passed\").\n\nThe immediate product of congressional enactments is the US Code; the immediate product of administrative rule\\-making is the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=browse). Supreme Court decisions are also published in [United States Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports), though I don't if there is an exhaustive online compendium of all rulings.\n\nAlso note that things passed by Congress are \"Laws\" (some public, some private). Things in the US Code originate in such acts of Congree, but not every act of Congress affects the US Code, for example [PL 118\\-81](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1617/text). When new subject matter is first introduced it is usually entirely contained in the corresponding law passed, but subsequently it can be amended, and an amendment to copyright law could be snuck into a bill generally about terrorism. I think that the stuff in the US Code corresponds to what most people think \"a law\" is, but it's better to look at the US Code as a single thing \u2013 \"the law\" \u2013 rather than try to count individual laws.\n\nIf you are armed with access to all of these resources, you would also need to know where to find relevant law. Once you find all of the applicable text, you simply apply general legal principles to reach a conclusion, then hire a lawyer to determine where you went wrong, then hire another lawyer to determine where *he* went wrong. At least in difficult cases. Fortunately, although enacted bills often glue stuff together in crazy ways, when it is assembled into the US Code, it is organized more sensibly. Still, not all crimes are defined in title 18 (there 1re 52 other titles to search to find crimes).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the challenge of compiling and quantifying all US federal laws?\n\nA) The main difficulty lies in accessing the various legal documents, as they are not readily available to the public.\n\nB) The primary challenge is the sheer volume of laws, but they can be easily counted by tallying the entries in the United States Code.\n\nC) The core issue is defining what constitutes \"a law,\" as legal content is dispersed across statutes, regulations, and court rulings, with no clear delineation between individual laws.\n\nD) The main obstacle is the frequent changes in laws, making it impossible to create a comprehensive compilation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage highlights that the fundamental challenge in compiling and quantifying US federal laws is the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes \"a law.\" Legal content is spread across various sources, including congressional statutes (found in the US Code), administrative regulations (in the Code of Federal Regulations), and Supreme Court rulings (in United States Reports). \n\nThe US Code, while organized by titles and chapters, doesn't have clearly enumerable elements that can be definitively called individual \"laws.\" Sections can be minutely subdivided, making it difficult to determine where one law ends and another begins. Additionally, not all acts of Congress affect the US Code, and amendments to one area of law can be included in bills primarily about other subjects.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while access to documents may be challenging, it's not presented as the main impediment. Answer B is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that simply counting entries in the US Code would not accurately represent the number of laws. Answer D, while touching on the complexity of changing laws, does not capture the core issue of defining what constitutes a law in the first place."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60421/will-naver-own-all-user-content-on-wattpad-when-the-sale-goes-through", "docs_id": 60421, "title": "Will Naver own all user content on Wattpad when the sale goes through?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On January 19, the [Naver buy of Wattpad](https://technocodex.com/south-korean-internet-firm-naver-to-acquire-toronto-based-wattpad-for-600-million-usd/) was reported.

The other rights listed by Naver seem probably included in \"reasonably related to publishing\" with the possible exception of a right to \"create derivative works (only limited to translation)\". It dopes not seem that the rights claimed by Naver will be very much more extensive than those already granted to Wattpad.\n\nNothing in the Naver terms quoted says that Naver will \"own\" the content uploaded by users.\n\nIn addition although Naver will purchase Wattpad, one news story says \"Lau confirmed Wattpad will continue to operate independently\" which may well mean that its TOS will be unchanged \\-\\- it is not unusual for different services of the same owner to have different TOS documents and terms.\n\nMoreover, if the Naver terms did grant Naver significantly greater rights in the content uploaded by users, it is not clear that they could unilaterally obtain greater rights in content previously uploaded without some form of consent by the uploader\\-owners.\n\nIn short, I think the concerns expressed in the question are overstated.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about Naver's acquisition of Wattpad, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright and ownership of user-generated content on Wattpad after the acquisition?\n\nA) Naver will automatically gain full ownership of all content previously uploaded to Wattpad.\n\nB) Users must immediately delete all their content from Wattpad to prevent Naver from owning it.\n\nC) The rights granted to Naver are likely to be similar to those already granted to Wattpad, with users retaining copyright of their work.\n\nD) Wattpad's terms of service will definitely change to match Naver's, granting Naver more extensive rights to user content.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the information provided suggests that the rights granted to Naver are likely to be similar to those already granted to Wattpad. Both Wattpad's current terms and Naver's terms indicate a non-exclusive license for the platform to use the content, rather than transferring ownership. The analysis points out that the rights claimed by Naver are not significantly more extensive than those already granted to Wattpad.

Let's imagine I am in a public place, such as a mall, or some other large gathering of people, when I hear gunshots ring out. Let's say that I am armed with a lawfully acquired and registered firearm, with a concealed carry permit. As I approach the location of the gunshots, I see a man armed with an assault rifle, gunning people down. To be clear, I witness this man killing others.

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Could I be held criminally and/or civilly responsible?\n\nProbably not criminally in Colorado. You would lack the requisite intent (criminal negligence which verges on recklessness) for even the lowest level homicide offense (negligent homicide), and unlike when a criminal trying to murder someone accidentally kills someone else, the doctrine of transferred intent doesn't create criminal liability because your primary target was one you were authorized by the defense of other statute to use deadly force against.\n\nFor civil liability in Colorado, the standard would be \"negligence\", which means, did you take the care of a reasonable person under the circumstances (engaged in the lawful business of defending others with a deadly weapon) to not hit bystanders. This would probably go to a jury and the claim would be covered by your homeowner's or renter's insurance in all likelihood. You would be a very sympathetic defendant in front of a jury.\n\nA case like that would be fact intensive and could go either way. It is a case in which the quality of lawyering would probably matter a lot. A ricochet off a hard surface to hit a bystander who was not in your line of fire would probably not be sufficiently foreseeable to impose liability (or would limit your liability to a very low percentage of the total). So would a victim you didn't see because the victim was in rapid motion or hidden behind an opaque but not bullet proof object. Other scenarios could conceivably be more culpable, for example, if the active shooter was holding the bystander in a hostage situation.\n\nAlso, the jury would allocate 100% of the liability between you and the criminal as a \"non\\-party at fault\" and that would probably significantly reduce your liability even if the jury found that you had some civil negligence. Maybe the active shooter would be found 90% at fault, and you 10% at fault, for example, if the jury thought that a reasonable person would have taken more care not to hit bystanders. But, since the victim would probably be 0% at fault, the odds of a full exoneration are lower than in cases where the victim is at fault, since it the victim is majority at fault there is no liability.\n\nThe civil liability analysis would different if a law enforcement officer had deputized before you took action (which could be done orally). If that had happened, you would probably be immune from civil liability entirely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, a civilian with a concealed carry permit intervenes during an active shooter situation in a mall.

Therefore the shop could sue you for any damage this causes (maybe you took something the shop did not want to sell, or the person at the information desk was not an employee and ran away with the money).\n\nHowever, whether this constitutes a crime such as theft will depend on jurisdictions.\n\nGermany\n-------\n\nIn Germany, for example, it would probably not, because by definition a theft requires \"intention to take posession in violation of the law\" ([StGB \u00a7242](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html)).

This would almost certainly fall under the rubric of defamation against public figure, where one must show \"actual malice\" (such as knowing that the claim is false, or having reckless disregard for the truth of the statement).\n\nAnother consideration is that a publisher might believe themselves to be open to lawsuit for tortious interference, as in the infamous 1995 case of CBS 60 Minutes backing down on an interview, where they felt that maybe they induced the interviewee to breach a non\\-disclosure clause in a contract (it is generally held that CBS's concerns were ill\\-founded).\n\nThe only imaginable path for retribution against the employee would be a non\\-disparagement or non\\-disclosure clause in the employment contract. \"Disparagement\" is sufficiently under\\-defined that telling the truth about a company's actions would not be \"disparagement\".

Many early episodes have plot points centering around Constitutional issues and Presidential powers that Americans will remember from their school days (e.g. the ability of the President to federalize units of the National Guard). Based on those early episodes, it's clear the show is *attempting* to be accurate in its depiction of existing US law, and not just making stuff up wildly or in an alternate reality with different laws.\n\nIn S1E11 of the show, police officers have surrounded a building where they believe a terrorist is hiding. They are on US soil, and believe that the occupant of the building is the person who attempted to assassinate the president several hours earlier. It is unclear if they know the nationality/citizenship status of the terrorist.\n\nThe (Acting) President of the United States has an open line of communication to the on\\-scene police commander from a bunker in the White House. Other characters explain that standard procedure is for police to attempt to take the alleged terrorist into custody so that criminal charges may be brought, and for police to not fire their weapons unless attacked. The President gives a preemptive order for police to kill the suspect even if a non\\-lethal option is available. His advisors object, but he overrules them, explicitly commanding them to \"shoot to kill.\"\n\nThe show set things up to feel sort of like a Commander\\-in\\-Chief giving orders to a military unit in a war zone overseas, but ultimately, the scenario was a domestic police operation. So, is this something a President can actually do, from a legal standpoint? Or did the show decide to ignore reality in the service of the plot this time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The show ignored the existing legal framework.\n\nAlmost all U.S. police officers are employed by state and local governments and do not report directly to the President, even in an emergency. \n\nA small number of law enforcement officers are federal employees with a direct line of command to the President (e.g. the Secret Service and the security guards in the General Services Administration and TSA officers), but a law enforcement officer, unlike a member of the military or a CIA officer, does not simply follow the orders of the civilians to whom his superiors are responsible without the intervention of their law enforcement superiors based solely upon that civilian's whims and directions the way that a soldier would.\n\nThe Secret Service has some limited authority to direct and even deputize local law enforcement officers in pursuit of their missions, but that would probably not extend to the kind of national security kill order contemplated in this episode.\n\nThis said, lots of law enforcement officers are ex\\-military, most law enforcement agencies has a quasi\\-military organizational structure, and in the extreme circumstances of *Designated Survivor*, it wouldn't be shocking for law enforcement officers to follow their natural military chain of command intuitions rather than the law that actually applies in these situations. Law enforcement officers are personality types that are very deferential to authority which is a natural counterpart to support for their hierarchical view of the world that endows them with their own authority. There is no one in the loop to play devil's advocate for the suspected terrorist.\n\nBut, strictly speaking, the proper protocol within the U.S. would be to have a CIA agent make the strike (because the military is prevented by the posse comitatus act from doing so, unless these events counted as an \"insurrection\" which they very well might in which case the military could be involved), rather than a law enforcement officer.\n\nIncidentally, the U.S. Supreme Court has basically held that the citizenship of the suspected terrorist is irrelevant, even though policy makers in all of the Presidential administrations since 9\\-11 have not been very comfortable with that state of the law and have sought to distinguish U.S. citizens from non\\-U.S. citizens in their own policies.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the TV show \"Designated Survivor,\" the President orders police to \"shoot to kill\" a suspected terrorist on US soil.

According to the information provided, the President does not have direct authority over local police forces, which are under state and local jurisdiction. Even federal law enforcement agencies typically follow their own chain of command rather than direct presidential orders. The President could potentially direct the CIA to take action in such a scenario, or possibly the military if the situation was deemed an \"insurrection.\" However, the President lacks the legal authority to directly order law enforcement agencies to kill a suspect, especially if non-lethal options are available.

While gambling on life is generally illegal, the concept of \"insurable interest\" allows for the possibility of purchasing life insurance on someone if you can demonstrate that their death would cause you significant financial loss. In the case of a US President, one could potentially argue that their death could lead to market instability and financial consequences, thereby establishing an insurable interest. This nuanced approach reflects the complexity of laws surrounding life insurance and betting on lives.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not always legal to bet on deaths, even with licensed bookmakers.

What is the idea behind that? I expect that the reason may vary depending on the country where it does exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simple legal answer is that the President has this power because the law gives it to them.\n\nHistorically, the right of the head of state to grant pardons is a legacy of autocratic monarchical rule: this was a power that kings and queens had over their subjects. In France, this power ended with the monarchy during the French revolution but was reinstated by Napoleon, himself an autocratic monarch, and it has remained in the various incarnations of the French legal system ever since. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon) is an examination of the concept in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept of [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) is a much more recent concept. In particular, the tripartite separation into administrative, judicial and legislative power can be traced to [Montesquieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu) in his [The Spirit of the Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_the_Laws) in 1748\\. This Enlightenment point of view crept into many political systems, however, the specific expression of it reached full flower in the establishment of the United States. It is worth noting, that pardons at both state and Federal level are part of US law vesting in the Governor (or some other member of the executive) and the President respectively.\n\nThe tripartite separation is supposed to provide checks and balances with each arm of government serving to limit the power of the other two. In this context, it is perfectly reconcilable that the executive branch should have the power to intervene and correct \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary just as the legislative branch does by being able to change the law in the light of judicial interpretation of existing law. In effect, the executive can correct \"mistakes\" in individual cases looking backwards and the legislature can correct \"mistakes\" in general going forward (the do in fact have the power to make laws retrospective \\[backwards looking] and specific but they tend not to do so).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the concept of presidential pardon and the principle of separation of powers?\n\nA) The presidential pardon is a modern concept that was introduced to support the separation of powers.\n\nB) The presidential pardon contradicts the principle of separation of powers and should be abolished.\n\nC) The presidential pardon is a legacy of monarchical rule that has been integrated into modern systems of checks and balances.\n\nD) The presidential pardon is exclusively a feature of the United States political system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The presidential pardon is indeed a legacy of monarchical rule, originating from the power kings and queens held over their subjects. However, it has been integrated into modern political systems, including those with separation of powers. In the context of checks and balances, the pardon power allows the executive branch to intervene and correct potential \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary, similar to how the legislative branch can change laws in light of judicial interpretations. This integration demonstrates how an older concept has been adapted to fit within the framework of separated powers, rather than contradicting it. The pardon power is not exclusive to the United States and predates the modern concept of separation of powers, which was developed during the Enlightenment period."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36922/legally-enforceable-contract", "docs_id": 36922, "title": "Legally enforceable contract?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I told my landlord that I will only be living in the apartment for half a school year because of my early graduation.

He'll say he didn't see it, and besides, all those inspection records were thrown out ten years ago. The condo association may or may not have had oversight of the construction.

Take photos and get a licensed plumber to take a look at it and give you an estimate for separating the water systems. That will document that the two systems are not separate. (Either call your own plumber or ask the condo association for the name of someone).\n\nThen, start with the condo association. They may be responsible for the inspections before the sale.

In other states, you are simply penalized if the person giving the order is a police officer. In those states where there is no statutory limit on police power to give commands, it depends on what the courts have ruled. In North Carolina, following [Glenn Robinson v.

There are very limited circumstances in which a government program may be race\\- or sex\\-aware. As the *New York Times* said in the story [\"A Covid\\-19 Relief Fund Was Only for Black Residents.

Private individuals may create scholarships restricted by race, sex, or other criteria that the US government may not use.\n\nGovernment programs may be limited by race when the program is narrowly tailored to improve diversity in an institution that has been and remains less diverse than the population, in some cases.\n\nThe recent AP story [\"Court rules against using race, sex to allocate federal aid\"](https://apnews.com/article/tn-state-wire-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-courts-business-c95f6b6c8819a66d80219cc3fca01e0b) said:\n\n> The U.S. 6th Circuit Appeals Court issued a 2\\-1 opinion Thursday that said the government cannot allocate limited coronavirus relief funds based on race and sex.

My understanding basically is that a notary is an unbiased 3rd party that observes a transaction and creates some legal documentation about it or a legal document of some sort, and then \"stores that at their office\". It sounds like they are independent contractors or lawyer\\-like people who work for themselves. It looks like you need to be [certified](https://www.nationalnotary.org/knowledge-center/about-notaries/how-to-become-a-notary-public) as well.\n\nGiven that, I'm wondering what happens if the notary passes on.

Wondering what the protocol is here. It's not as if the notary's documents get dispersed to their children, or passed on to people according to an arbitrary will. I would imagine they'd need to be part of a highly structured system so that there is a chain of notaries that is unbroken and that is known to always be legally valid or something like that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This could vary by jurisdiction. I'll discuss California; its rules are explained in the [California Notary Public Handbook](https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/handbook/), which also includes relevant excerpts from the law. \n\nThe system is not as structured as you might think. Basically the \"documents\" consist only of the notary's *journal*, a log of all the official actions the notary has taken. So if, for instance, you go to sign a document before the notary, they will enter into their journal information such as your name, the date, how they verified your identity, and the type of certification they provided.\n\nSection 8209 of the California Government Code specifies how those documents get passed on when something happens to the notary:\n\n> (a) If any notary public resigns, is disqualified, removed from office, or allows his or her\n>  appointment to expire without obtaining reappointment within 30 days, all notarial records and\n>  papers shall be delivered within 30 days to the clerk of the county in which the notary public\u2019s\n>  current official oath of office is on file. If the notary public willfully fails or refuses to deliver\n>  all notarial records and papers to the county clerk within 30 days, the person is guilty of a\n>  misdemeanor and shall be personally liable for damages to any person injured by that action\n>  or inaction.\n> \n> \n> (b) In the case of the death of a notary public, the personal representative of the deceased\n>  shall promptly notify the Secretary of State of the death of the notary public and shall deliver\n>  all notarial records and papers of the deceased to the clerk of the county in which the notary\n>  public\u2019s official oath of office is on file.\n> \n> \n> (c) After 10 years from the date of deposit with the county clerk, if no request for, or reference\n>  to such records has been made, they may be destroyed upon order of court.\n\nSo if the notary quits being a notary while still alive, they send their journal to the county clerk. It doesn't get given to another notary. If they die first, the notary's personal representative (typically their [executor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor)) is responsible for doing so. If the journal needs to be examined, e.g. as evidence that you signed your document on a particular date, you would be able to get a copy of the journal page from the county clerk.\n\nThe journal does not necessarily have to be kept for more than 10 years after the notary's death, resignation, etc, so there is no guarantee that those records would be available in perpetuity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In California, what happens to a notary public's journal if they pass away?\nA) The journal is automatically transferred to another active notary public\nB) The journal is destroyed immediately\nC) The personal representative of the deceased notary must deliver the journal to the county clerk\nD) The journal becomes the property of the notary's family\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to California Government Code Section 8209(b), in the event of a notary public's death, their personal representative (typically the executor of their estate) is responsible for promptly notifying the Secretary of State about the death and delivering all notarial records and papers, including the journal, to the clerk of the county where the notary's official oath of office is on file. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the journal is not transferred to another notary, but to the county clerk. \nOption B is wrong because the journal is not immediately destroyed; it's kept by the county clerk for at least 10 years. \nOption D is incorrect as the journal does not become family property but must be turned over to the county clerk.\n\nThe correct answer, C, accurately reflects the legal requirement in California for handling a deceased notary's journal."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55376/whats-the-impact-of-this-late-fee-typo", "docs_id": 55376, "title": "What&#39;s the impact of this late fee typo?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My landlord has a late fee clause in our lease, which says that if the lessee is late with the rent, the lessor must pay a (poorly defined) late fee.\n\nWhat would be the effect of this clause?\n\n1.

This act specifically addresses the possession of offensive weapons in public places. Section 1 of this act states that it's an offense to have any article in a public place that is intended by the person to cause injury to another person. The key here is the intention of the person carrying the item.\n\nWhile hairspray is not inherently an offensive weapon, the person's admitted intent to use it for self-defense (which implies causing injury to another person) could classify it as an \"offensive weapon\" under this law. The act defines an offensive weapon as \"any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use by him or by some other person.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect as the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 primarily deals with specific weapons like knives and corrosive substances.

After the surgery is successfully completed and Dr. Smith is paid, Patient Jones experiences complications and wants to sue for malpractice. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of their agreement?\n\nA) The contract is void because it wasn't in writing, so Patient Jones has no legal recourse.\nB) The contract is valid and enforceable because both parties performed their obligations.\nC) The contract is valid but unenforceable, so Patient Jones cannot sue based on its terms.\nD) The contract is voidable at Patient Jones' option due to the lack of written documentation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The contract between Dr. Smith and Patient Jones is valid, as oral contracts are generally permissible. While it might have been unenforceable if one party had tried to back out before performance, the fact that both parties fully performed their obligations (Dr. Smith performed the surgery, and Patient Jones paid the fee) means the contract has been executed. Once a valid but potentially unenforceable contract is fully performed by both parties, it becomes enforceable and cannot be rescinded under doctrines like the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, the contract is now both valid and enforceable, allowing Patient Jones to potentially sue based on its terms if there's a basis for a malpractice claim."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28993/just-how-different-is-the-legal-situation-in-germany-under-gdpr-compared-to-prev", "docs_id": 28993, "title": "Just how different is the legal situation in Germany under GDPR compared to previously with respect to running a website?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A frequent statement with respect to making German websites GDPR\\-compliant is that barely anything has changed in Germany with DSGVO (the German version of GDPR) and the previously applicable national law (BDSG).\n\nAt the same time, while many aspects of GDPR are still considered unclear or disputed, there seems to be pretty much a consensus in Germany that any website owner1 whose site is hosted on the server of a 3rd party will have to sign a [contract for processing on behalf](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-28-processor-GDPR.htm) with the webhoster.2 This appears the case even if the webhoster merely handles visitors' IP addresses such as for security logging purposes.\n\nWhile I concede companies and people as a whole used to be sloppy about former privacy laws and very late at starting to prepare for GDPR, the requirement for those specific contracts with webhosters are generally implied to be something new. Webhosting companies have started to offer the respective contract templates only recently as a part of their GDPR preparation, and articles point out these contracts as something to take care of to make one's site GDPR\\-ready, especially including non\\-commercial fan sites, blogs, and similar.\n\n**Was there3 a requirement to have such a contract with one's webhoster for non\\-commercial/hobbyist websites before GDPR?** (If so, was it simply widely ignored, especially on sites hosted abroad, where hosters wouldn't know about (and be unwilling to sign?) such contracts?\n\nEDIT: The only thorough essay on the topic I have found so far is a [blogpost on CR\\-online](https://www.cr-online.de/blog/2018/05/16/ds-gvo-es-aendert-sich-doch-gar-nicht-so-viel/) (in German). It specifically addresses the situation of non\\-commerical and/or small services (coming to the conclusion that from the point of view of these services, the claim that \"not much has changed\" is a \"myth\") and points out that the obligations for internal documentation have been considerably extended. However, it does not concretely discuss any particular setups such as \"running a website\".\n\n---\n\n1: Except for websites maintained as a part of a [\"purely personal or household activity\"](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/), but it seems disputed whether any publicly accessible website can meet these criteria at all.\n\n2: My understanding is that the website owner ensures towards visitors the visitors' personal data will not be used for anything beyond what is stated in the site's privacy note, and the contract for processing on behalf is the website owner's legal handle to also ensure the webhoster does not exceed the boundaries of the privacy policy (or informs the website owner in time so they can update their privacy note).\n\n3: Either from BDSG itselt, or based upon some EU\\-wide regulation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 2009 edition of BDSG in [section 1](https://dejure.org/gesetze/BDSG_a.F./1.html) describes the BDSG specifically not to apply for computerized data being collected, processed or used exclusively for personal or family activities:\n\n> Dieses Gesetz gilt f\u00fcr die Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung\n>  personenbezogener Daten durch \\[\u2026] nicht\\-\u00f6ffentliche Stellen, soweit\n>  sie die Daten unter Einsatz von Datenverarbeitungsanlagen verarbeiten,\n>  nutzen oder daf\u00fcr erheben oder die Daten in oder aus nicht\n>  automatisierten Dateien verarbeiten, nutzen oder daf\u00fcr erheben, es sei\n>  denn, die Erhebung, Verarbeitung oder Nutzung der Daten erfolgt\n>  ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr pers\u00f6nliche oder famili\u00e4re T\u00e4tigkeiten.\n\n(BDSG 2009, \u00a71, 2\\.3\\)\n\nDepending on one's interpretation, there is some overlap between \"personal or familiy activities\" and \"non\\-commercial/hobbyist\", but other than this, German website owners are very likely to be bound to BDSG 2009\\.\n\n[Section 11](https://dejure.org/gesetze/BDSG_a.F./11.html) has been enacted in September 2009 and is named \"Erhebung, Verarbeitung oder Nutzung personenbezogener Daten im Auftrag\" (Collection, processing or use of personal data on behalf) and describes data storage and processing via a contractor.\n\nDrastically shortened and oversimplified: if you're asking someone else to store or process data on your behalf, you're still responsible to enforce data protection of the stored/processed data and you'll need to have a written contract with your contractor to address this topic. This contract should outline how and which data is to be stored/processed, how (technical and organizational means) this data is being protected, that your contractor will notify you for data protection violations by the contractor or their employees and that any data is being deleted when the contract has been finished.\n\nDepending on a few circumstances, your current web hosting contract or T\\&C with your web host may already be sufficient to satisfy both BDSG and GDPR requirements.\n\nAt least from a German perspective, you and your web host have demonstrated implied conduct (\"konkludentes Verhalten\") of storing personal data according to BDSG: by offering web site storage, usually access to server log files and some email service as well, a German web host does offer contractor services according to BDSG and are most likely about to store personal information (server logs, email messages). Most web hosts also do describe their infrastructure in detail, so you've also some outline of their technical measures to protect your data. \n\nSo: if you as a German resident did sign a contract with a German web host company after September 2009, you've both most likely agreed by implication to have that web host company to store, process and use personal data as regulated by BDSG.\n\nIf\n\n* your legal advisor does not follow this idea of implied conduct to be \"safe enough\",\n* your specific contract may be too old to correctly meet BDSG 2009 requirements or\n* you've made your contract with a foreign web host who didn't consider to be possibly impacted by some German law,\n\nyou may want to have a specific agreement with your web host in order to satisfy BDSG and/or GDPR requirements.\n\nMost web hosts are used to inquiries regarding which standards or regulations they are compliant with and how those do relate to one's specific product (for example, a web host may be PCIDSS\\-compliant to handle credit card information in a safe way, but this won't cover your self\\-written PHP script running on their shared web hosting server farm. While those confirmations are certainly less than a \"written contract\", they do give you some idea of how serious the web host does take their job to secure your data. \n\nAs you've already noticed, web hosts today do offer a free \"data processing contract\" as an amendment to your existing contract to legally assure how they're storing and processing data.\n\nSuch a contract usually doesn't imply any obligations to you, but still may be important. Why: according to BDSG and GDPR, you're still responsible regarding your user's data. If your web host experiences a data breach and loses your user's data, your behavior of NOT having a written contract might be seen as \"reckless\" in a legal dispute. A written contract saves you from that and also offers you the opportunity to file a complaint against your web host for violating that contract in order to redeem for damages.\n\n**So in summary:** BDSG from 1st of September 2009 does already address your specific topics in a very similar way than the GDPR does, asking for a written contract. As the GDPR has been presented in January 2012, the BDSG did already address your specific topic before the GDPR has been enacted or even been presented.\n\nThe website requirements have to be met by website owners, regardless of where they're hosting their site. If website owners did silently ignore those requirements or implicitely agreed via implied conduct is hard to answer and only known to each website owner. There are also many more, often very specific factors like the age of the contract and the corresponding applicable law. So that part of the question is hard to answer and probably will never come to a profound conclusion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) of 2009, which of the following statements is correct regarding the requirement for a contract between a website owner and their web hosting provider for processing personal data?\n\nA) The BDSG 2009 did not require any contract between website owners and web hosts for data processing.\n\nB) The BDSG 2009 required a written contract only for commercial websites, not for non-commercial or hobbyist sites.\n\nC) The BDSG 2009 required a written contract or implied agreement for both commercial and non-commercial websites if personal data was being processed or stored by the web host.\n\nD) The requirement for a contract between website owners and web hosts was introduced only with the GDPR in 2018.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The BDSG 2009, specifically Section 11, addressed the collection, processing, or use of personal data on behalf of others. It required that if someone else (like a web host) was storing or processing data on your behalf, you needed to have a written contract or an implied agreement to address data protection. This applied to both commercial and non-commercial websites, as long as they were not exclusively for personal or family activities. The law predated the GDPR and already included similar requirements for data processing agreements."}}
