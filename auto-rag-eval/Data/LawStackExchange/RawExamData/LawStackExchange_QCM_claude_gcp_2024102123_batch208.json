            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say a person (U. S. resident) has a personal website (which has a Donate button) in which everything on that site is freely accessible whether or not a donation is made. Are the monetary donations collected by the recipient subject to federal taxation according to IRS law? I have looked into this question in the past but did not find an explicit answer.\n\nAlso, if there is a clear answer, do states with personal income taxes do the same regarding website donations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Are the monetary donations collected by the recipient subject to\n> federal taxation according to IRS law?\n\n**Yes.**\n\nUsually, money received from an activity from third\\-parties with no personal relationship to you (assuming that \"you\" are not a tax exempt organization), are taxable income under [Section 61](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61) of the Internal Revenue Code as interpreted by case law, as a form of \"compensation for services\", under I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1\\), or as \"gross income derived from business\", under I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(2\\) (exactly which prong of I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a) it comes under isn't legally relevant for tax purposes in this situation).\n\nThis is also informed by [I.R.C. \u00a7 83(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/83) (which is a general rule even though the balance of the Code section applies mostly to equity compensation in entities), which states in the pertinent parts (material in brackets inserted for clarity):\n\n> If, in connection with the performance of services, property is\n> transferred to any person other than the person for whom such services\n> are performed, the excess of the fair market value of such property .\n> . . over the amount (if any) paid for such property \\[by the person who\n> receives the property], shall be included in the gross income of the\n> person who performed such services\\[.]\n\nBut, gifts are expressly excluded from income under [Section 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/102) of the Internal Revenue Code as interpreted by case law.\n\nOne point which the case law makes clear, however, is that an obligation to pay doesn't need to be a legally binding obligation to make a payment something that counts as income rather than a gift. The tax law instead looks at the substance of the interaction and the reality of how decent, well mannered people would act under circumstances in which they receive an uncompensated benefit.\n\nUltimately, whether are voluntary payment made through a private individual or business's website is taxable income or is not taxable because it is a gift is a case by case determination to be made in light of all of the relevant facts.\n\nFor example, if your mother donates $7,500 to your website on your birthday, even though all of your other \"donations\" are from third\\-parties whom you have never met in person in amounts from $5 to $100 and you have provided all of those other third\\-parties with some kind of service or benefit through your website (e.g. they were allowed to read free webcomics or listen to music you wrote and recorded without charge over the website), the donation from your mother probably counts as a gift, even though the other donations probably count as income taxable income.\n\nBut, in the absence for any reason for the donation other than gratitude for the performance of the services provided by the website, or for the conduct of the business that the website belongs to, the donation will generally be treated as income under Sections 61 and 83, rather than as a gift under Section 102\\.\n\nThe notion of a gift is normally limited by case law and suggestive related section of the Internal Revenue Code that illustrate its intended meaning in the case of gift loans and bargain sales made for donative purposes, to circumstances in which the person making the gift has received nothing in return for it. A donation to a website usually wouldn't meet this test to show a transfer's character as a gift.\n\nThe most familiar example, upon which there is a great deal of case law and authoritative guidance, is that tips paid to restaurant and hospitality industry workers are income rather than gifts, and are subject not only to income taxation but also to FICA payroll taxation. These tipping situations are closely analogous to voluntary payments made through a website.\n\nThere are a great many tax regulations, court cases interpreting tax law, and authoritative guidances from the IRS (such a revenue rulings) that address the basic concepts that I've set forth above. And, the income tax law authorities are further informed by the statutes and case law governing gift taxation, which is, as intended, interpreted to define a gift in a matter that dovetails more or less perfectly with the definition of a gift for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 102\\.\n\nAs the IRS [explains at its website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/gift-tax) discussing the gift tax for which the concept of a gift is defined consistently with the income tax concept of a gift:\n\n> The gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property by one individual to\n> another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return.\n> The tax applies whether or not the donor intends the transfer to be a\n> gift.\n> \n> \n> The gift tax applies to the transfer by gift of any type of property.\n> You make a gift if you give property (including money), or the use of\n> or income from property, without expecting to receive something of at\n> least equal value in return. If you sell something at less than its\n> full value or if you make an interest\\-free or reduced\\-interest loan,\n> you may be making a gift.\n\nDonations which are not income are gifts and there is a tax on gifts given (paid by the donor rather than the person receiving the gift). But, there is a $15,000 per donor per donee exception per year from gift taxation for gifts under the Internal Revenue Code, in addition to more than $12 million per lifetime per person exemption from gift and estate taxation for gifts in excess of this $15,000 amount (called the annual exclusion) and inheritances left at death. So, usually, if a transfer is treated as a gift rather than as income, no tax will be due.\n\nBut this part of this answer's short summary of the law is the top level conceptual framework for all of those other subordinate tax law authorities.\n\nAlso, this income is also subject to self\\-employment taxation, which is imposed in lieu of FICA on income which is not a wage, salary or employment\\-related tip. Often self\\-employment taxes are due on self\\-employment income even when no federal income tax is owed upon it.\n\n> if there is a clear answer, do states with personal income taxes do\n> the same regarding website donations?\n\nMost states and localities with a personal income tax start from the federal definition of income and modify that definition in ways that the taxing jurisdiction deems fit either to make sense (limiting the tax to income related to the state, for example, at least for non\\-residents), or to fit local policy preferences (e.g. exempting from income taxation, capital gains made in an investment in the state favored by state lawmakers).\n\nAlmost no states or localities have chosen to deviate from the federal definition of income for income tax purposes with respect to donations made to websites that are not non\\-profit entities.",

He has a \"Donate\" button on his website. Last year, he received the following:\n1. $500 from his mother on his birthday\n2. $1000 from various readers in small amounts ($5-$50 each)\n3. $200 from a company that wants him to review their travel gear\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding John's tax obligations?\n\nA) All of the money received ($1700) is considered non-taxable gifts.\nB) Only the $500 from John's mother is taxable; the rest is non-taxable.\nC) The $500 from John's mother is likely a non-taxable gift, while the $1200 from readers and the company is likely taxable income.\nD) All of the money received ($1700) is taxable income, including the amount from John's mother.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The $500 from John's mother on his birthday is likely to be considered a non-taxable gift due to their personal relationship. The $1000 from various readers, although voluntary, is likely to be considered taxable income as it's given in appreciation of the service (blog content) John provides. The $200 from the company is clearly compensation for a service (reviewing their gear) and is taxable income. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the $500 from John's mother is likely a non-taxable gift, while the $1200 from readers and the company is likely taxable income."

A contractor working for the building owner wants to use parts of these drawings to create installation plans for a low voltage system. The drawings have a copyright statement referencing California Assembly Bill 701.

The building owner likely has a license to use the drawings for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, and modifying the building. This is typically explicit in contracts with architects, or can be implied.\n2. By providing the drawings to the contractor, knowing their intended use, the building owner has effectively granted a license to use them for that purpose.\n3. Even without explicit permission, this use would likely fall under fair use, given the purpose (installing systems in the building), the nature of the work, and the minimal impact on the market value of the original drawings.\n4. The fact that the contractor works for the building owner and the documents are for internal use further strengthens the case for permitted use.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because explicit permission or payment is not necessarily required in this scenario. Option C is too restrictive, as modifications for the purpose of system installation would likely be permitted."

The claim is that it is impossible to find who is liable for the wrongdoing. This claim seems strange: isn't it obvious that it's the company who developed the algorithm that is liable for any issues that this algorithm caused?\n\nCan someone explain where the current legal system/framework/laws break down when it comes to any harm caused by artificial intelligence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Real\\-world situations are rarely so clear\\-cut\n\nLet's say, hypothetically, that I'm in the driver's seat of a car. The company told me that the car has \"Full Self Driving\" capabilities based on some sort of artificial intelligence, though they also said that these capabilities \"are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.\" Let's say I was *not* fully attentive at a moment when the car's AI decides to swerve into oncoming traffic, and I fail to grab the wheel and prevent that.\n\nWho's at fault? Is it the car company's fault for a bug that caused that? Is it my fault for failing to be fully attentive? Is it some combination of the two?\n\nBut wait, it can get more complicated: maybe the car company argues that they couldn't have reasonably anticipated the situation that caused it: maybe the lines were incorrectly drawn on the road, and indicated that the road continued in that direction. Maybe I argue that the car swerved quickly enough that even a fully attentive driver couldn't have recovered.\n\nThese and more are all facts that need to be sorted out in a trial. There's no way to simply say that \"any issues that this algorithm caused\" are entirely the company's fault.\n\nIn other words, this isn't really the legal system \"breaking down\"\u2014it's working as intended, trying to figure out whose fault an event *actually* was.

The documentation emphasizes that real-world situations involving AI and human interaction are often complex and not clear-cut.

Read the contract.\n\nThe contract might or might not address this specific situation. Before you approach your counterparty make sure you have a thorough understanding of what the contract stipulates your relative positions are.

If nothing, then fine. You might want to open the negotiations with that offer.\n\n### Also: Study common industry practice\n\nAlso, you should become familiar with how these matters are commonly dealt with in the publishing industry.

What is the current standing law with regard to non\\-disparagement clauses in contracts? I recall a recent law prohibiting them in terms of service agreements, but what about employment an other (e.g. severance) contracts? Are they legally enforceable? Does California have an anti\\-SLAPP law?\n2. What is the legal definition of disparagement in the context of a non\\-disparagement agreement? Is it like libel in that it is limited to untrue claims, or are any negative and business\\-impacting claims subject to it even if demonstrably true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: California has a law prohibiting non\\-disparagement clauses in consumer transactions.1 The rule tells us that any waivers of the rule are void. We also learn that the penalty is $2500 for the first violation and $5000 for each subsequent. The consumer can bring the lawsuit.\n\nNon\\-disparagement agreements are valid in employment and severance agreements. So, yes, they are enforceable as a matter of law. (But note that the NLRB and the EEOC have recently come out against certain *broadly* worded non\\-disparagement language.)\n\nCA has an anti\\-SLAPP statute.2\n\nThere is no \"legal definition of disparagement in the context of a non\\-disparagement agreement.\" If the term is not defined in the contract the court will likely apply the plain meaning rule. Generally speaking, the plain meaning of disparagement is speaking or writing about the subject in a negative light. As such the term \"disparagement\" will apply to negative speech, regardless of truth. In fact, most non\\-disparagement clauses will include a word like \"criticize.\" The thing is, false negative comments are already a tort which means that you can get sued for those even without the non\\-severance agreement. However, a non\\-disparagement agreement makes it easier for the plaintiff because they do not need to prove damages and they can include liquidated damages in the contract.\n\nThis might be confusing because *disparagement* is a tort recognized in CA.3 \n\n> A claim of disparagement requires a plaintiff to show a\n>  false or misleading statement that (1\\) specifically refers to the\n>  plaintiff's product or business and (2\\) clearly derogates that product\n>  or business.\n\nThe point is that the disparagement prohibited in employment contracts is not the recently\\-defined tort of disparagement but rather the plain definition of disparagement. The disparagement prohibited in employment contracts applies to true statements. (The caveat being that the definition is subject to a definition included in the contract.)\n\n---\n\n1**[Cal. Civ.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee in California signs a severance agreement containing a non-disparagement clause. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this clause?\n\nA) The non-disparagement clause is automatically void under California law.\nB) The employee can only be held liable for false negative statements about the employer.\nC) The clause is enforceable and can restrict both true and false negative statements.\nD) The employee retains full rights to criticize the employer under California's anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Non-disparagement clauses are generally enforceable in employment and severance agreements in California. Unlike non-disparagement clauses in consumer contracts, which are prohibited by California Civil Code 1670.8, these clauses in employment contexts are valid.\n\nThe clause can restrict both true and false negative statements. As explained in the documentation, the term \"disparagement\" in these agreements typically applies to negative speech regardless of its truthfulness. This is broader than the tort of disparagement, which only applies to false or misleading statements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because California law does not automatically void non-disparagement clauses in employment contracts. Option B is incorrect because the clause can cover both true and false statements. Option D is incorrect because while California does have an anti-SLAPP statute, it does not give employees full rights to criticize employers in violation of a valid non-disparagement agreement.\n\nIt's important to note that while these clauses are generally enforceable, very broad language may be challenged by agencies like the NLRB or EEOC. However, a typical non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement would be enforceable and restrict the employee from making negative statements about the employer, regardless of their truth."

I do not understand 1\\. Williams was correct to refute the Witness's falsities; so how was Williams impotent? If Williams had ignored them, then the audience may infer that the Witness was speaking the truth?\n4. How is 2 true? What else should Williams have done?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Williams was correct to refute the Witness's falsities\n\nNo, he wasn't. The role of the barrister during cross\\-examination is to ask questions of the witness so that their answers become evidence; not introduce evidence of their own. \n\nWith skill and judgement they will ask a witness to explain inconsistencies within their evidence or between their evidence and other evidence and *allow* the deciders of fact (jury or judge) how to reconcile those inconsistencies.\n\nWe do not know what the witness actually said but it was something to the effect of:\n\n> People in the service of Germany are able to get British secret service agents marooned \\[on the Greek islands] by the orders of the British Government\n\nbecause that is where Williams started to make his mistake \\- he repeated the witness' answer in a \"tone of incredulity\" which the witness took as an opportunity to introduce extraneous information that he had told Williams this before. Williams then compounded the problem by claiming that he and the witness had never met: who cares if they had or had not? He made the evidence about whether he or the witness was lying (or, generously, mistaken); not about if the British Government was being duped by the German's nobbling into its own agents by standing them in the Dodecanese.\n\nInstead of doing this he could have said \"Please explain your role in the British Government or the German Secret Service that allows you to know this?\" or \"That seems to me to be an outlandish assertion, what evidence do you have to support it beyond hearsay?\"\n\nIf the witness had insisted on introducing the *fact* that they had communicated this information to Williams, he could have said: \"I do not believe that we have met, however, even if we had and you had told this to me I do not see how that makes it true. Do you have any evidence of this beyond your mere assertion?\"",

This shifted the focus away from the credibility of the witness's claims about British agents and onto a personal dispute between the lawyer and the witness. As a barrister, Williams should have focused on asking questions to expose inconsistencies or lack of evidence in the witness's testimony, rather than making statements about his own experiences or interactions. This mistake allowed the witness to control the narrative and distract from the central issues of the case."

Assuming this problem continued another week, what courses of action may be available to us? What information should we record during that time?\n\nTo give an example of \"encouragement\" \\- in a past problem with a USA\\-based clothing seller, simply the mention of the phrase \"small claims court\" in a letter to them was sufficient to make them take us seriously.\n\nDetailed info\n=============\n\nMyself and two friends recently started renting a flat in London. We are renting from a previous tennant who is subletting (authorized by her landlord/owner). We are on an \"assured shorthold tenancy\".\n\nLast week, we received notification that the flat below was taking on water from above. This was identified as a leaky pipe in our flat\n\n* We were told that a plumber would come on Monday to repair the pipe. I stayed home for the day, no plumber came.\n* We were told that the plumber would come on Tuesday. A flatmate stayed home for that day, but again \\- no plumber.\n* On Wednesday, the other flatmate stayed at home. The plumber came and repaired the pipe. The plumber claimed that he had only been ordered to do the job since Tuesday.\n* On Thursday (today), the plumber came and said that he wanted to do a \"check up\". The only flatmate in at the time let the plumber in. The plumber then turned the water off and took his pipes out. The flatmate protested, the plumber said that he hadn't been paid by the landlord so the pipes were his property, then he left.\n\nOne flatmate turned the water back on briefly \\- predictably, this resulted in water freely flowing from where a pipe had been removed.\n\nWe contacted the landlord and he said that he would pay the plumber on Friday (tomorrow) and that one of us would need to be in the flat to let the plumber in, and to verify that he had done the job properly.\n\nWe have no water in our kitchen and probably no hot water (I don't want to risk running the on\\-demand boiler if there's a chance that it the pipes will fill with air). We have wasted three days and now one of us needs to waste (at least) one more.\n\n1. How can we give the impression that we're prepared to take swift legal action if the situation isn't resolved within the next 24 hours?\n2. If the situation isn't resolved within a few days, what courses of action would be available to us, and what information should we be recording during that time?\n\nWe understand that this site is purely \"friendly community advice\" not \"professional legal advice\", and is no substitute for formally talking to a lawyer :)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This guide from Shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/repairs_and_bad_conditions/repairs_in_private_lets/landlord_refusing_to_do_repairs) lists the steps you should take.\n\nIt can be summarised as: if the landlord fails to arrange the repairs, contact your local council. If they can't help, you can arrange the repairs yourself and request that the landlord reimburse you. If the landlord still refuses to co\\-operate, then you can pursue legal action.\n\nIt's important that you document everything you're doing, and keep the landlord fully informed at every step.\n\nThe guide states that you can deduct the cost from future rent. But it also says:\n\n> You do not have the right to withhold your rent if your landlord refuses to do repairs. If you don't pay rent, the landlord could take steps to evict you.\n\n...so you may want to get expert advice before going any further.",

Narcotics Agents*](https://casetext.com/case/bivens-v-six-unknown-named-agents-of-federal-bureau-of-narcotics). My understanding is that *Bivens* created a cause of action for the 4th Amendment. Without the cause of action, you wouldn't be able to sue federal officials for violating the 4th Amendment. Now, my question is this:\n\n* Before *Bivens* was ruled, how would you sue a government official in court for a constitutional violation, as there was no cause of action?\n* According to my knowledge, the Supreme Court has only afforded a cause of action similar to that of Bivens to some amendments. Now, if I wanted to sue a government official for violating the 1st amendment (which, to my understanding, does not have an implied cause of action similar to that of *Bivens*), how would that work?\n\nI'm generally very confused about how this all works and interacts with each other.\n\n**Bivens:**\n[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/\\#tab\\-opinion\\-1949369](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/#tab-opinion-1949369)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The case is [Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/#tab-opinion-1949369).\n\nLiability under *Bivens* applies to federal agents who violate a direct constitutional right in a similar way that state officials, or others acting \"under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory\" may be sued under [42 USC \u00a7 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) for any action that causes \"the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\". Section 1983 does not apply to persons acting under federal laws, and thus *Bivens* becomes a counterpart.\n\nIt is true that *Bivens* applies directly to the Fourth Amendment. But it quotes favorably *Bell v. Hood*, 327 U. S. 678 (1946\\), specifically the passages:\n\n> where federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief \\[*at page 684*]\n\nand\n\n> it is . . . well settled that, where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done. \\[*also at page 684*]\n\nNeither of these passages singles out the fourth amendment. Nor does the logic of *Bivens* depend on anything specific to the Fourth amendment, as opposed to the Fifth, the Sixth, or the First.\n\nI don't know if a case has been brought under *Bivens* alleging violation of these or other federal constitutional provisions granting specific rights to individuals. The logic of *Bivens* would require a firm and clear grant of rights, but, for example the Due Process Clause of the fifth is such a grant.\n\nIf the courts were to hold that a particular claim could not be brought under *Bivens* because the Supreme Court has not authorized such an extension of *Bivens*, then *Bivens* itself describes an alternate procedure. The opinion points out that:\n\n> \\[*at Pages 390\\-391*] petitioner may obtain money damages to redress invasion of these rights only by an action in tort, under state law, in the state courts. In this scheme, the Fourth Amendment would serve merely to limit the extent to which the agents could defend the state law tort suit by asserting that their actions were a valid exercise of federal power: if the agents were shown to have violated the Fourth Amendment, such a defense would be lost to them, and they would stand before the state law merely as private individuals. Candidly admitting that it is the policy of the Department of Justice to remove all such suits from the state to the federal courts for decision, respondents nevertheless urge that we uphold dismissal of petitioner's complaint in federal court and remit him to filing an action in the state courts in order that the case may properly be removed to the federal court for decision on the basis of state law.\n\nThis procedure the Court rejected in *Bivens* as unneeded, but it did not say that such a procedure could not be followed.\n\nI would think that the logic of *Bivens*should extend to the invasion, by federal officials (other than judicial officers), of any right explicitly and specifically granted to individuals under the constitution. But one can never tell how the courts will react when asked to extend a previous decision.\n\nThe *Bivens* did not **create**a cause of action, or at least it did not purport to do so. It simply held that the longstanding rights grantef under the Fourth Amendment could result in money damages even n the absence of a specific statute providing for such damages. The *Bivens* Court wrote:\n\n> \\[*at Page 403 U. S. 402*] The contention that the federal courts are powerless to accord a litigant damage for a claimed invasion of his federal constitutional rights until Congress explicitly authorizes the remedy cannot rest on the notion that the decision to grant compensatory relief involves a resolution of policy considerations not susceptible of judicial discernment. Thus, in suits for damages based on violations of federal statutes lacking any express authorization of a damage remedy, this Court has authorized such relief where, in its view, damages are necessary to effectuate the congressional policy underpinning the substantive provisions of the statute. *J. I. Case Co. v. Borak*, 377 U. S. 426 (1964\\); *Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen \\& Enginemen*, 323 U. S. 210, 323 U. S. 213 (1944\\). Cf. *Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States*, 389 U. S. 191, 389 U. S. 201\\-204 (1967\\)\n\nThe OP wrote in a comment:\n\n> What's the point of Bivens if causes of action still exist for amendments like the 1st Amendment, that are not part of Bivens? What's the difference between suing somebody under the 4th amendment through Bivens, and suing somebody under the 1st amendment?\n\nThis is merely a matter of terminology. If the US Supreme Court now recognizes a right to sue **for money damages** directly under the First Amendment, that will be called \"an extension of *Bivens*\". If it rules that such a suit would need a new law from Congress to authorize it (as Sec 1983 authorizes suits against state officials), that would be cal;led \"refusing to extend *Bivens*. All suits for damages directly under a constitutional provision where there is no specific federal law authorizing money damages are now called *Bivens* suits, because that is the case that specifically held that such damages were permitted without such a law.",

She denies the accusation. Her clever lawyer Badal arrives and they have a three hour conversation going over all the details of the past events, coming up with different theories about the real culprit \\- and throughout it, Badal slowly gains her trust. He eventually manages to get Naina to confess that yes, she did in fact commit the murder. Including how she did it and where she hid the body.\n\nBadal leaves the scene and five minutes later the *real* Badal arrives! The fake Badal was actually Nirmal, the father of the murder victim, who of course recorded the whole conversation including the confession. He calls the police, and the credits roll.\n\nIt's a compelling movie but this struck me. Nirmal was deceiving Naina by impersonating a lawyer, which is a crime. But he had nothing to lose, he wanted to get justice for his dead son. And because he is not a police officer or official part of the prosecution in any way, this evidence wouldn't be inadmissible for being bad police practise, I would think ([this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8542/can-police-trick-you-into-a-confession-by-pretending-to-be-a-lawyer) says that the police cannot impersonate a lawyer to gain evidence, but Nirmal is not police). But if such a confession would be admissible in court, then why don't more people pretend to be lawyers, or generally do illegal stuff like deception to obtain evidence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n\nAdmission of the confession is at the discretion of the court\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[PACE](https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/investigation/witness-admissibility.htm) s78 gives the court the discretion to decide on the admissibility of confessions obtained if it appears to the court that \"having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\"\n\nThere is deliberately no case law guidance on this. Superior courts in the UK have been scrupulous in saying that each case turns on its merits.\n\nThe \u201ccircumstances in which the evidence was obtained\u201d are certainly suss and would not be permitted by a police officer who is required to warn the suspect and advise them of their right to silence. However, that is not sufficient to exclude the evidence.\n\nThe court also needs to consider whether it would have \u201csuch an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\u201d If the confession is the only evidence then admitting it would clearly be unfair. However, if the Crown has mountains of other evidence, then the confession may only have a small probative value.\n\nThere is no \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine in the UK\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFar more likely is that the Crown would not even seek to introduce the confession. It would just slow the trial and give the defence grounds for an appeal.\n\nInstead, they would use the confession to inform their investigation and get other evidence to convict.\n\nLegal privilege\n---------------\n\nIn England and Wales, legal advice privilege only applies where there is a lawyer present. If Badal is a lawyer, then the privilege attaches; if he isn\u2019t then it doesn\u2019t, irrespective of what he led Naina to believe. The same would be true even if Badal believed he was a lawyer but, for some reason, was not licenced in E\\&W.\n\nLitigation privilege is a broader concept and covers all advice, including from non\\-lawyers, where litigation (including criminal prosecution) has commenced or is reasonably likely. Based on the description, Naina has been committed to stand trial so everything she said is covered by privilege and is inadmissible.\n\nWhy bother doing this?\n----------------------\n\nMost criminals are not sophisticated and will often implicate themselves if you give them enough space without the police or others violating any rules.\n\nAnecdotally, I have a relative who was a psychologist for a remand prison \\- prisoners charged but not yet tried. At the start of every meeting with a prisoner they would say \u201cI work for the state, nothing you say is confidential and it can be used against you\u201d \\- they still had prisoners confess to crimes they weren\u2019t charged with, name accomplices, and tell where the loot was hidden.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK legal system, regarding the admissibility of a confession obtained through deception by a private individual impersonating a lawyer, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Such a confession would always be inadmissible in court due to the deceptive means used to obtain it.\n\nB) The confession would automatically be admissible as evidence since it was not obtained by law enforcement.\n\nC) The court has discretion to decide on the admissibility of the confession based on all circumstances and its potential impact on the fairness of proceedings.\n\nD) The confession would be protected by legal privilege and therefore inadmissible, regardless of the impersonator's actual status as a lawyer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) section 78, the court has discretion to decide on the admissibility of confessions obtained under questionable circumstances. The court must consider all the circumstances, including how the evidence was obtained, and whether admitting it would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis, with no strict precedent. While the deceptive means used to obtain the confession are certainly problematic, this alone is not sufficient to automatically exclude the evidence. The court must weigh various factors, including the probative value of the confession and its potential impact on the overall fairness of the trial.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the confession is not automatically inadmissible due to the deception.\nAnswer B is wrong because being obtained by a private individual does not guarantee admissibility.\nAnswer D is incorrect because litigation privilege would only apply if the impersonator was actually a licensed lawyer in England and Wales, which is not the case in this scenario."

Under that standard, a rather novel form of copyright seems impossible to defend: copyleft licenses.\n\nCopyleft, the common descriptor for copyright licenses which allow free use provided any derivative works are released under similarly free terms, attempts to force the spread of open content (most typically software) through clever usage of conditional license grants, most notably used in the GNU General Public License. But how could this possibly be enforced in court? Because this sort of license was designed to guard against violation of one's beliefs, rather than financial damage, in the case of a violation, it would seem one could only claim moral damage.\n\nIn short, how would one possibly justify a copyleft violation suit in a court of law?\n\n**Edit:**\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I'm referring alternately to either *US law* or *EU law*, as I'm curious about both given the clear differences in intellectual property law between the two.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As a general rule, civil suits for copyright violation exist to recover damages caused by the violation, and prevent future damage thereof.\n\nWith respect to US law, that's not entirely accurate.\n\nUnder US law, damages for copyright infringement are governed by [17 USC 504](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504). If infringement can be proved, the copyright holder has two options:\n\n1. Recover \"actual damages\" *plus* any profits that were attributable to the infringement. So suppose Alice licenses her free software under copyleft. Bob uses it in violation of the license to create a product which he sells. Even though Alice was not going to make any money by selling the software herself (so her actual damages are zero), she can still recover whatever profits Bob made from his sales. She doesn't have to prove that she was damaged; all she has to do is show that Bob earned revenue attributable to the infringement (and then it is up to Bob to show how much of that revenue went to expenses instead of profit).\n2. Recover statutory damages. The law specifies statutory damages of $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, to be determined by the court; this can be increased to $150,000 if the infringement was willful, or reduced to $200 if the infringer had no reason to know he was doing so. Again, it doesn't matter that Alice didn't suffer any actual damages, and she doesn't have to prove that she did. It also doesn't matter whether Bob profited from his infringement in any way, and again Alice doesn't have to prove that he did.\n\nSo Alice certainly has options to make Bob suffer for his infringement even if she didn't suffer any financial damage.\n\nI don't know the situation for EU law, so I'll let someone else address it.",

These damages can range from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, and can be awarded regardless of whether the copyright holder suffered any actual financial loss. This provides a significant legal recourse for copyleft license holders, even when their software was originally distributed for free. Options A and D are incorrect because they misunderstand the legal protections afforded to copyleft licenses. Option B is incorrect because it overlooks the statutory damages option available under US copyright law."

I know that under legal tender laws a business can set a policy on what forms of payment it will accept, but that only applies if [no debt exists prior to the time of payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender).

The same is true with physical pentesting where the pentester emulates physical attackers (even to the point of picking locks and forging access credentials, assuming it authorized in the scope).\n\nOne must have the document with them in case they are \"caught\" by the organization's security. On the Information Security site, the answer to [a question about this](https://security.stackexchange.com/q/221018/106285) suggests that it could be better to first *forge* the document and, if it is accepted by security, you continue on your way and document security's failure to stop you (since a real criminal could have forged the document as well). If, on the other hand, they don't accept the forged document, then you provide the real document.\n\nThe following is from the accepted answer (emphasis in original):\n\n> If you don't have your Permission to Attack with you, it's like driving without a driver's license. That said, if you are caught during an engagement, I recommend the following:\n> \n> \n> 1. **Present a *forged* Permission to Attack.** This way, you can see if criminals could possibly trick a security guard to letting them do their thing with a fake Permission to Attack.\n> 2. **Present the *real* Permission to Attack.** If a guard has not bought your fake slip, then it's time to hand in the real slip. If the guard believes you, it's time to pick up and leave the perimeter. A real attacker would have been stopped at this point. If the guard did not believe you, ask them kindly to talk to their supervisor. If they insist on not believing you and calling the police, so be it. You're not a criminal, so don't worry about it.\n\nAre there any circumstances under which this would be illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [california](/questions/tagged/california \"show questions tagged 'california'\")\n\n### It's legal, because the pentester doesn't have the intent to defraud.\n\n[California Penal Code Section 470](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=470.&lawCode=PEN) governs forging documents, signatures, handwriting, etc. All of its provisions making actions illegal begin with \"Every person who, with the intent to defraud...\"\n\nBecause the company itself is aware of and has authorized their actions, the pentester isn't attempting to defraud the company whose premises they are attempting to enter. They are providing forged documents to the guard (who isn't aware of the test), but a real attacker doing that would be attempting to defraud the *company*, not the *guard*.\n\nOf course, as with any otherwise\\-illegal action taken during a penetration test, this assumes that the agreement with the company granted the pentester permission to take that action (i.e., that it was in scope for the test).",

The local police can investigate, but will only investigate a theft (not a simple loss). Their interest would be in prosecuting the perpetrator (and possibly retrieving the stolen property). In the course of investigating, the police will ask (in some form) if you have a clue where it is, and if you do not admit that you know where it is, they can prosecute you, because that would violate your state's version of the false statement law (Washington example [here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.76.175)).\n\nThe physical card is not so important: loan applications etc. don't require producing a physical SS card: what they need is the number on the card.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A client requests their lawyer to copy them on all communications related to their case, including those with the court and other parties. The lawyer agrees and includes this in the retainer agreement. Later, the lawyer intentionally fails to copy the client on some internal communications and drafts. The client makes a Subject Access Request (SAR) for all documents. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The lawyer must provide all documents, including internal communications and drafts, as per the retainer agreement.\n\nB) The lawyer can refuse to provide any documents, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\nC) The lawyer must provide documents owned by the client, but can withhold internal communications and drafts that the firm owns.\n\nD) The lawyer must provide all documents or face criminal charges for concealing information.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Law Society's guidance, documents such as internal communications and drafts prepared for the firm's own benefit or to help do its job are usually owned by the firm, not the client. Even with a retainer agreement requesting copies of all communications, the lawyer is not obligated to share documents the firm owns. The client has a right to documents they own, such as correspondence sent or received on their behalf and documents created for them. While failing to comply with a SAR can lead to court action, it's not automatically a criminal offense unless there's intentional concealment of information the requester is entitled to receive. The lawyer can withhold firm-owned documents without facing criminal charges."

Most of those cases were dismissed on procedural grounds or dismissed as moot when he left office.\n\n> Could congress pass a law setting a fiduciary standard of care in some\n> fiscal matters, and enforce it (e.g., through impeachment?)\n\nCongress can impeach for any circumstance that it deems to be a high crime or misdemeanor, and its determination of that point is non\\-justiciable.\n\nIt is not obvious whether this obligation could be imposed by statute consistently with the constitution under existing U.S. Constitutional law.\n\nThis would be basically a question of first impression, or at most, a question for which the precedents available are so stale that the continued applicability of these precedents in the light of new legal developments in constitutional law jurisprudence is uncertain.\n\nThere is law that makes fairly clear that such a duty could not be imposed upon the President of the United States acting in his official capacity by state law under the supremacy clause and the general considerations of federalism, however. This is important, among other reasons, because the standing requirements of the federal courts do not apply with full force to state courts applying state law.\n\nOne important constitutional issue in this context would be who has standing to enforce such a duty, since standing is a matter of the subject\\-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n\nCurrent standing jurisprudence does not allow for \"citizen standing\" or \"taxpayer standing\" nor does it usually allow individual members of the U.S. House or U.S. Senate to have standing, nor does it usually allow one part of the Executive branch to sue another part of the Executive branch of the United States government. In most cases, this means that if the President's actions cause only generalized fiscal harm to the United States as a whole, that no individual could have standing.\n\nOne exception might be for a [*qui tam* action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam) in which an individual is deputized to act as a prosecutor for the United States government itself (with the relief obtained payable to the United States) in a civil action in exchange for a statutorily determined contingent fee related to the amount recovered. I'm not familiar with the constitutional dimensions of standing in such cases, which is mostly obscure at the outer limits because the existing statutes that authorize this have been upheld on a piecemeal basis with other their particular procedural details (including a right of the Justice Department to take over such lawsuits against private parties) and the fact that these suits are usually limited to suits against people other than government officials. It is closely related to the largely open question of whether, contrary to Justice Department policy, it is constitutional to bring federal criminal charges against a sitting President. These issues are closely related to the Unitary Executive theory of constitutional law which the current U.S. Supreme Court has been inclined to follow (which disfavors allowing liability for the President, at least, while in office).",

Is there some kind of implied limitation, such as it has to relate to the work?\n\n[Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *disparagement* \\[of Goods] as \"*A statement about a competitor's goods which is untrue or misleading and is made to influence or tends to influence the public not to buy*\". This gives a basis for inferring the scope of disparagement of a company itself (rather than just of the goods and services it provides), and how it applies to the scenarios you outline. Not every negative statement about a company or its agents meets the definition elements of (1\\) competition, (2\\) falsehood, and (3\\) deterrence of \\[potential or actual] counterparties.\n\n> an employee who signed this comments on a picture on social media that someone is wearing an ugly shirt and that person happens to be a stockholder\n\nAn opinion on social media regarding someone's ugly shirt clearly fails these three elements unless the company is in the business of producing/marketing that type of shirts. Even if that is the company's business, an actual opinion is not a fact, and therefore it is not susceptible to a test of veracity.\n\n> How would the person signing it even know if a person they are making a disparaging comment about fits in one of the above categories\n\nUnreasonable clauses are stricken as null and void, and in many contexts it is unreasonable to expect an employee to guess or know all of the \"*current or former officers, directors, stockholders, partners or employees*\" at the time of making his statement.\n\n> What if it's a matter of fact, like the company was late paying it's employees (assuming this was true)\n\nA truthful, non\\-exaggerated statement about the company's belatedness is not actionable because it is not false or misleading.\n\n> What if it's a matter of opinion like \"I wish I didn't have to wear a tie to work\"\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that such statement of opinion harms or tends to harm the company at all. For instance, no employee would leave the company only because you don't like wearing a tie at work. Nor would your preference discourage candidates from joining the company. What could discourage them is the underlying obligation to wear a tie, not a person's opinion about that obligation.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Supposed some Congress members thought it would be necessary to pass a bill without telling the public about national security. For example, if a war broke out and Congress wanted to allocate money to a secret cause, could they enter a closed session and pass a bill, send it to the President, and become law without telling the public?\n\nFirst, is this even possible/legal? Are there any instances of this happening (and later being revealed to the public)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Congress did exactly this in the war of 1812\\.\n\nNormally, laws passed by Congress must be published after being made. In 1789, the First Congress instructed the Secretary of State with the duty of printing new statutes at least three newspapers, and the current law puts it in the hands of the Archivist of the United States; in between, there have been variations.\n\nOn March 3, 1811, Congress passed [a law](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_2/11th_Congress/3rd_Session/Chapter_47) saying simply:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this act, and the act passed during the present session of Congress, entitled \u201cAn act to enable the President of the United States, under certain contingencies, to take possession of the country lying east of the river Perdido, and south of the state of Georgia and the Mississippi territory, and for other purposes,\u201d and the declaration accompanying the same, be not printed or published, until the end of the next session of Congress, unless directed by the President of the United States, any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nThis overrode the normal publication rules in order to hide the existence of the cited earlier law, and of its own existence. The proceedings in Congress also took place in secret session, including the signing of the bills by the President, James Madison. As the title suggests, the earlier statute authorized Madison to use military force to take possession of the disputed territory (which was also claimed by Spain), establish a provisional government there, and use $100k of newly appropriated funds to do so. A further law of 1813, with the same secrecy provision, extended the territory and gave $20k more.\n\nThese statutes were not published until 1818, after the war had ended and a further law reformed the publication of statute law in general. The supposed secrecy was also compromised in practice by the fact that the annexation of West Florida was widely known once it started happening.\n\nAs far as we know, Congress has not experimented any further with suspending publication of its legislative activity. It is allowed to meet in secret session, and the Constitution allows secret material to be omitted from the official journal. Nowadays, we know pretty well when secret sessions have taken place, even if we don't know what happened during them. It would be practically very hard for Congress to hide the fact that it had met and passed a law.\n\nThe closest modern counterpart is not a secret *act*, but the use of a \"classified schedule of authorizations\" or \"classified annex\" to direct spending on things that Congress does not wish to reveal. For example, in the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ103/PLAW-117publ103.pdf) (1068 page PDF), there are references like:\n\n* \"there is appropriated $125,000,000, for an additional amount for 'National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund', to remain available until September 30, 2024, which shall only be used for the acquisition and retention of certain materials, as specified in the classified annex accompanying this Act\"\n* \"The amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 101 for the conduct of the intelligence activities of the elements listed in paragraphs (1\\) through (17\\) of section 101, are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations prepared to accompany this division.\"\n\nThe second bullet point covers billions of dollars of total spending, but it is not revealed that we are spending $7\\.18bn on a project to explode the moon, or whatever. So in this appropriations case, your hypothetical is pretty real: Congress could pass emergency legislation authorizing spending on something, without revealing what the something was.\n\nOther kinds of laws would raise their own issues. For example, a secret criminal statute would very likely fall foul of the Constitutional prohibition on *ex post facto* laws. The concept of a secret law is in many ways objectionable \\- natural justice, interference with democratic accountability, etc. \\- which makes it politically difficult as well as legally questionable.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to this [article](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/) Apple is scanning all the photos users have on their devices to detect possible child abuse. The article explains that a NeuralHash of each image will be uploaded to Apple servers. It also claims that the NeuralHash is only a fingerprint of the image. But that is not true, a hashing made by a neural network is reversible, the reconstructed image will not be as good as the original, but it can be compared to a lossy compression with high loss.\n\nIs this compatible with the European GDPR? Can a corporation upload user content to their servers without asking the user permission?\n\nRelated question:  \n\n[https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/68507/can\\-countries\\-prevent\\-foreign\\-corporations\\-like\\-apple\\-from\\-acting\\-as\\-private\\-pol](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/68507/can-countries-prevent-foreign-corporations-like-apple-from-acting-as-private-pol)\n\n**Update:**\n\nThanks to the pointer from @Fizz I found the reference to the exception for child abuse recently voted. It is a bit ambiguous because as a law it should be immediately applicable, but member states should anyway update their legislation to avoid conflict. And the news reporting the laws mention some constraints.\n\n<https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2463>\n\n[https://eur\\-lex.europa.eu/legal\\-content/EN/TXT/?uri\\=CELEX:52020PC0568](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0568)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [According](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-platforms-child-sexual-abuse-reporting-law/) to a Politico article from July this year\n\n> EU Parliament lets companies look for child abuse on their platforms, with reservations\n> \n> \n> The European Parliament on Tuesday approved a controversial law that would allow digital companies to detect and report child sexual abuse on their platforms for the next three years.\n> \n> \n> Tuesday's vote was the final hurdle for the bill, and will allow companies to scan their platforms for explicit material without fear of violating Europe's strict privacy laws. The bill pitted the European Commission, who proposed the bill, and children's rights activists against the Parliament and Europe's privacy regulators, who fear the bill could undermine the EU's privacy rules.\n> \n> \n> The results showed 537 MEPs voted in favor of the bill, with 133 against and 24 abstaining. Despite the result, \\[some] European lawmakers warned that the rules are \"legally flawed\" and could crumble in front of a court. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> MEPs also said that the blanket scanning of private messages of European citizens to look for evidence of child grooming could clash with another set of privacy rules protecting personal data, the GDPR.\n> \n> \n> To allay the Parliament's concerns, EU countries agreed to modify the Commission\u2019s law to add additional safeguards, including bringing in Europe's network of privacy watchdogs to advise on what technologies should be used to do the scanning, and how they should be used. They also left out audio messages from the bill. The changes prompted Sippel, who was negotiating on behalf of the Parliament, to sign off on the bill.\n\nSo YMMV, but insofar it looks pretty legal unless a court decides otherwise.\n\nIt seems Apple went public with their plan after this EU law was passed, so they probably took it into account.\n\n---\n\nFor what's that worth, there's [an analysis](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rhw8c/download) from someone at Cambridge (in the Compliant and Accountable Systems Group, Department of Computer Science and Technology) that:\n\n> EU law would\n> require that Apple obtain the consent of individual iPhone users for on\\-device scanning. This\n> consent would need to be opt\\-in, rather than opt\\-out; there would need to be a real\n> possibility for users to refuse consent; users\u2019 access to iCloud could not be made conditional\n> on giving consent to CSAM Detection; and users must be able to withdraw consent without\n> suffering loss of iCloud service. This may place a welcome brake on the deployment of on\\-\n> device CSAM detection in the EU. However, these barriers may be removed by future EU or\n> Member State legislation \u2013 just as similar potential barriers for automated CSAM detection\n> by certain messaging services have already been removed by EU legislation.\n\nSo it seems that there would be a way for Apple to do this \"device scanning\" even in the EU with user (clickwrap) agreement...\n\nThe paper enumerates the things than can be made implicit (bundled) in a GDPR agreement, and then goes on to argue that probably none of these apply to Apple's CSAM on device, and so they'll probably need a separate checkbox for CSAM... which the paper's author is pretty sure the users would not check.\n\n> Importantly, because consent must be specific, consent to one purpose (such as processing\n> to detect CSAM) can\u2019t be presumed from consent to another purpose (such as processing\n> for cloud backup). Nor can consent to processing to detect CSAM be \u2018bundled\u2019 with\n> consent to cloud backup. GDPR strongly indicates that \u2018bundling\u2019 \u2013 the practice of making\n> access to a service conditional on giving consent to processing that is not necessary for that\n> service \u2013 is not permitted. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> It is unlikely in the extreme that even minimally informed holders of CSAM would give\n> consent to Apple\u2019s CSAM Detection system.\n\nThe paper more tenuously (IMHO) argues then that Apple needs do the same for their server\\-side scanning in the EU, i.e. get explicit consent, because it's somehow tied to the on\\-device scanning via the iCloud account. (The author also makes their personal disapproval of CSAM in all forms more explicit towards the end of the paper.) But still that someone who disapproves of CSAM entertains that it might be deployed via clickwrap user consent (albeit with a separate checkbox) is noteworthy.\n\nIn this context I'll note (even though the paper doesn't), that there is a 2019 CJEU [decision](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/top-european-court-rules-pre-checked-cookie-consent-boxes-invalid) that pre\\-checking certain kinds of checkboxes (like for \"nonessential\" cookies) is not legal. I suspect\nCSAM will fall in this kind of category... so they won't be able to have the checkbox for it pre\\-checked, unless Apple does something more devious and make it so that image hashes become \"essential\" to something else that the user would more readily like to agree to...\n\nAlso, looking at a current (August 1\\) [Apple description](https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf) of their system, it seems they *only* plan to run the image hashing *on the device* (and upload a threshold\\-encrypted version of the result, so that only multiple, cumulative \"hits\" on several images would be detectable/decryptable on the server), which would basically make their system (as currently envisaged) inoperable without the local hash step. I've also looked at Commission's 70\\-page [impact assessment](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_STU(2021)662598) for their most recent proposal (the one discussed at the beginning of this answer), but it only discusses things like PhotoDNA and server\\-side hashing. So I guess they were unware that someone might plan to do \\[only] client\\-side hashing as part of a CSAM design.\n\nIf this goes to an EU court, I guess an issue will be *when* and why iOS would create those (threshold\\-encrypted) vouchers that contain the images hashes, e.g. if they'd be considered an essential part/step of an otherwise approved purpose...",

The analysis from Cambridge suggests that EU law would require Apple to obtain separate, explicit consent from individual iPhone users for on-device scanning. This consent would need to be opt-in rather than opt-out, and users should have a real possibility to refuse consent without losing access to other services like iCloud. The consent for CSAM detection cannot be bundled with consent for other purposes, as GDPR requires consent to be specific. Additionally, a 2019 CJEU decision ruled that pre-checked consent boxes for non-essential features are invalid, which would likely apply to CSAM detection. While recent EU legislation does allow some scanning for child abuse material, it doesn't automatically override the need for user consent in this case. The system is not fully compliant without additional measures (A), not implementable without consent (B), and not completely banned (D)."

E.g.:\n\n> Alice and Bob are both cargo ship captains. Alice is bringing her ship into port, in perfect accordance with all relevant laws and guidelines. Bob's ship, close by, starts behaving erratically (either due to technical problems or human error on Bob's part). There is a risk of collision. Alice's ship has ample opportunity to change course and eliminate the risk, but Alice refuses to do so because \"Hey, *I* followed all the rules \\- this isn't my problem.\" A collision ends up occurring, resulting in material damage, huge delays \\& opportunity costs, and perhaps even loss of life.\n\nMy understanding (again, please correct me if I'm mistaken) is that in the above situation, Alice *would* have been expected to take action to avoid the collision, and bears some degree of (criminal or civil) liability for failing to do so, *even though* all she did was 'follow the rules'.\n\nMy question is whether any similar principle exists for road users. An example:\n\n> Carol and Dave are driving their cars across a level crossing, with Carol ahead and Dave following. Just after clearing the crossing, Carol's car halts (or slows down to a crawl), leaving Dave with insufficient space and trapping him on the tracks. The bells ring and the barriers begin to descend, indicating that a train is on the way.\n\nOf course, Dave should have known better than to cross a level crossing when there isn't already sufficient space on the other side. But now that the situation has occurred, and Carol is able to easily resolve it, is she under any legal obligation to do so? If she does not, is she civilly liable to Dave (or possibly to the engineer \\& passengers on the train)? Has she committed a criminal offence?\n\nDoes it matter whether Carol has a generally valid reason for stopping (e.g. she's letting a passenger disembark onto the sidewalk, perhaps completely unaware of Dave's predicament) or not (e.g. she's a bully who spontaneously decides she'd find it hilarious to terrify the driver behind her, maybe kill him, and possibly derail a train \\- and is later caught admitting as much in a brag to friends)?\n\nSay Dave, after a fruitless ten seconds of frantic klaxoning with the train barreling down, decides to floor it and physically push Carol's car with his own so that he can get off the tracks. Is Dave then liable for the damage he's caused to Carol's car? Has Dave committed a criminal offence by driving into her car? Is *Carol* possibly on the hook for the damage this maneuver caused to *Dave*'s car?\n\nI live in Belgium so that's the answer I'm most interested in, but I also welcome insights from other jurisdictions. I imagine this is an area of law that could easily vary quite a bit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are multiple questions on different areas of law, but I will answer purely on any criminal liability arising by the drivers concerned and leave the question(s) on civil liability to others.\n\nThe general rule to avoid creating unsafe situations appears to be in the Royal Decree of 1 December 1975, at [Article 7](https://www.code-de-la-route.be/textes-legaux/sections/ar/code-de-la-route/104-art7), which states (via English translation):\n\n> 7\\.2 Users must behave on public roads in such a way that they do not cause any inconvenience or danger to other users, including the staff working for the maintenance of the road and the equipment bordering it, the surveillance services and priority vehicles.\n\nHere are some specific regulations/offences relating to the railway crossing incident:\n\nUnder [Article 4](https://www.code-de-la-route.be/textes-legaux/sections/ar/degre/487-art4-v15-487) of the 30 September 2005 Decree:\n\n> It is forbidden to stop or park a vehicle on level crossings.\n\nCarol may have committed an offence under [Chapter 2, Article 2](https://www.code-de-la-route.be/textes-legaux/sections/ar/degre/148-art2-v15-148) of the 1975 Decree:\n\n> 19. It is forbidden to stop a vehicle or park it in any place where it is obviously likely to constitute a danger for other road users or to obstruct them unnecessarily...\n\nDave may have committed an offence under [Article 20](https://www.code-de-la-route.be/textes-legaux/sections/ar/code-de-la-route/178-art20-v15-178) of the 1975 Decree:\n\n> 20\\.2\\. The user approaching a level crossing must be extra careful to avoid any accident: when the level crossing is not equipped with barriers or traffic light signals or when these signals do not work, the user can only enter it after making sure that no vehicle on rails is approaching.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> 20\\.4\\.

Carol may have violated Article 7.2 of the Royal Decree of 1 December 1975 by causing danger to another user. She might also be in violation of Chapter 2, Article 2 of the 1975 Decree for stopping in a place likely to constitute a danger or obstruct other road users unnecessarily.\n\n2. Dave could be held liable under Article 20.4 of the 1975 Decree for entering a level crossing when traffic congestion made it likely he would be immobilized on the crossing.\n\n3. The intent behind Carol's actions (whether malicious or unaware) might affect the severity of charges but doesn't necessarily eliminate criminal liability.\n\n4. While Dave's situation is more sympathetic, he still violated a specific regulation about level crossing safety.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct as it acknowledges the potential criminal liability for both parties involved in this dangerous situation."

One party makes an offer and the other party accepts it. Acceptance can be done by word (verbal or in writing) or action \\- if the parties act as though there was a contract then there is a contract.\n\nExample 1:\n\n* I walk into a shop and say \"May I have a Mars bar please?\"\n* The shopkeeper hands me the Mars bar and *makes the offer* \"$2\\.50, please.\"\n* I hand over $2\\.50 *accepting the offer*.\n* The contract is now binding and barring some fault with the Mars bar, complete.\n\nExample 2:\n\n* I walk into a shop and pick up a Mars bar from a bin labelled $2\\.50 (technically this is an *offer to treat* by the shop \\- they are indicating that they will consider offers of around $2\\.50\\)\n* I take it to the counter and had over $2\\.50, making the *offer*\n* They *accept* the offer by taking my money\n* No words were spoken but we end up at the same point as Example 1\\.\n\nBy sending you their terms they have made an offer to you; by signing and returning it you have accepted their offer: **you are now parties to a binding contract**. There is no requirement for them to sign it or send it back.\n\nHowever, if you amended their terms then you have not accepted them , you have made a counter\\-offer. They can accept them by word (sending you a signed contract back) or deed (doing what the contract says they should).\n\nOffers can be withdrawn **until** they are accepted; after that there is a legally binding contract.",

Option A is incorrect because signing and returning by both parties is not always necessary for a contract to be binding. Option B, though potentially true in some cases, is too absolute without knowing if Person Y made any changes. Option C is incorrect because once an offer is accepted, it generally can't be unilaterally withdrawn. Option D is the most accurate because if Person Y made any amendments, it would constitute a counter-offer, requiring Company X's acceptance to form a binding contract. This aligns with the principle that acceptance must mirror the offer exactly for a contract to be formed."

You can try to get money by suing your parents. But suing your parents is rarely a good long term strategy. Your father made some argument why he isn't going to give you any money for your losses; whether it is a good or bad argument is irrelevant until you take him to court, and then what counts are the arguments that his lawyer will make, which will be much better arguments. \n\nIn court, you would have to actually prove your losses. Have you got a receipt for your winter boots? How long ago is \"when you were 19\", important to estimate their value now. You would have to prove that you didn't just abandon everything. Did you just leave, or did you sign a contract that your parents should look after your things, and you would pay them some rental fee for the space in their loft, for example?

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 19-year-old student moves away for college, leaving personal belongings at their parents' house. The parents later divorce and sell the house, and the student's belongings are no longer available. Which of the following factors would be LEAST relevant in determining the student's legal standing if they were to pursue a lawsuit to recover the value of their lost possessions?\n\nA) The existence of receipts or documentation proving ownership of the items\nB) Whether the student had an agreement with the parents about storing their belongings\nC) The amount of time that passed between the student moving out and requesting their belongings\nD) The student's age when they originally acquired the items\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The student's age when they acquired the items would be the least relevant factor in determining their legal standing in this situation. While the father mentioned this as a reason not to return the items, it is not a strong legal argument. The other options are more critical in establishing ownership, responsibility, and potential abandonment:\n\nA) Receipts and documentation are crucial for proving ownership and value of lost items in court.\nB) An agreement about storing belongings could establish the parents' responsibility to safeguard the items.\nC) The time passed could be used to argue whether the student abandoned the property.\n\nThe student's age when acquiring the items is less relevant, as gifts and personal belongings typically belong to the recipient regardless of their age at the time of acquisition."

This will be a contract between the customer and Origin. If it prohibits transferring an account or sharing an account between multiple people, such provisions would be valid.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A gamer wants to sell their Origin account containing The Sims 4 and several expansion packs on eBay. They plan to sell access to this single account to 5-6 people at a discounted price. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and potential consequences of this action?\n\nA) This action is completely legal and carries no risk, as digital goods can be freely resold once purchased.\n\nB) Selling the account is legal, but sharing it among multiple users violates criminal law and could result in arrest.\n\nC) The legality depends on Origin's Terms of Service, and violating them could lead to account termination and potential civil litigation, but not criminal charges.\n\nD) Selling digital accounts is always illegal and is considered software piracy under international copyright laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legality of selling and sharing an Origin account primarily depends on the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement between the user and Origin. If the ToS prohibits account transfers or sharing, doing so would constitute a breach of contract. This is not a criminal offense, but it could result in consequences such as account termination by Origin. Additionally, Origin could potentially pursue civil litigation for damages resulting from the breach of contract. It's important to note that while this action may violate the ToS, it doesn't typically fall under criminal law or software piracy statutes. The other options are either too extreme (B and D) or too permissive (A) given the information provided in the original post."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *German version below*\n\nLong story short: I am interested in buying a piece of land next to ours.\n\nAccording to the official land register (*Grundbuch*), it belongs to two people, let's call them G and S.\n\nFacts known about these people:\n\n* G: definitely dead (died ~~some time in the 1990s~~ in 1979\\)\n\n\t+ had a husband (who died as well, after her) and four children\n\t+ I have contact information for three of the children, but none for the fourth, who I'll call S\n* S:\n\n\t+ seems to have fallen out with the other three siblings\n\t+ has moved to Spain years ago\n\t+ ~~might have died there~~\n\t+ was married when she moved to Spain\n\t+ ~~her husband (\"H\") might be dead or alive, and if both are dead, he might have died before or after her.~~\n\t\t- has died in 2019 and was divorced then.\n\nEverything very complicated.\n\nDespite of the land being covered with junk and essentially being worthless, I plan to buy that land because it would enhance out piece of land and, besides, in order to prevent that soemone else buys it. If it wouldn't be covered with junk, it would be worth about 1000 \u20ac, but cleaning up the junk will probably cost more than that.\n\nBut how can I find out whom to contact? What can I do to find out if S is still alive and where she lives?\n\nOr better: How can I find out about the fourth, the heirs of the fourth, or evidence that the fourth share has passed to the three other owners?\n\nI see the following options:\n\n* Contact the \"inhabitants registry\" (Einwohnermeldeamt) to find out what happened to S\n* Contact the inheritance court (Nachlassgericht)\n* to find out who inherited what when (if I even am entitled to get information about that)\n* maybe to get a \"inheritance administrator\" (Nachlassverwalter)?\n* hire a\nprivate investigator \u2013 this will probably too expensive.\nThere is another issue about that land: because of the high trees on it (which we plan to remove as soon as we have the land), it poses a potential danger to our house we live in: if the trees fall in the wrong direction, our house might be in danger. So in any case, we might want (and need) to know who is responsible for this piece of land.\n\nUpdate:\n\n* I have asked at the town's tax office. They are not allowed to give me that information, and are likely as well not allowed to do so if I put in a request by mail.\n* I also have asked at the \"inhabitants registry\", but only online. The system could not give me the requested information. But maybe I could do the request again in person.\n* As of 2022: everything has resolved. See my answer to be posted.\n\n---\n\nThe whole stuff in German, because whoever is able to help me probably reads better German then English:\n\nIch habe Interesse, ein Grundst\u00fcck neben unserem Grundst\u00fcck zu kaufen.\n\nGem\u00e4\u00df dem Grundbuch geh\u00f6rt es zwei Personen, die ich nun G und S nenne.\n\nWas ich \u00fcber diese wei\u00df:\n\n* G:\n\t+ starb ~~in den 1990ern~~ 1979 an einem Autounfall\n\t+ hatte einen Ehemann (Ende der 1990er ebenfalls verstorben) und vier Kinder\n\t+ ich kann wohl drei der vier Kinder erreichen, aber nicht das vierte, nennen wir es S\n* S:\n\t+ hat wohl keinen Kontakt zu den anderen\n\t+ verzog vor Jahren nach Spanien\n\t+ ~~k\u00f6nnte dort verstorben sein~~\n\t+ war zum Zeitpunkt des Umzugs verheiratet\n\t+ ~~ihr Ehemann (\"H\") k\u00f6nnte noch leben oder ebenfalls verstorben sein, und falls beide verstorben sind, ist die Reihenfolge des Todes f\u00fcr die Frage evtl. auch relevant, jedoch unbekannt.~~\n\t\t- verstarb 2019\\.\n\nAlles sehr kompliziert.\n\nObwohl das Grundst\u00fcck total zugem\u00fcllt und daher \"netto wertlos\" ist, habe ich vor, es zu kaufen, da es gut zu unserem St\u00fcck passen w\u00fcrde, und um zu verhindern, dass evtl. jemand anders kauft. W\u00e4re es nicht zugem\u00fcllt, w\u00e4re es wohl etwa 1000 \u20ac wert, aber es zu entm\u00fcllen w\u00e4re sicherlich teurer als das.\n\nAber wie finde ich heraus, wen ich diesbez\u00fcglich kontaktieren muss? Was kann ich tun, um mehr \u00fcber S herauszufinden?\n\nOder besser: Wie kann ich S finden, ihre Erben oder Gewissheit dar\u00fcber, dass ihr Anteil an die anderen drei Eigent\u00fcmer \u00fcbergegangen ist?\n\nIch sehe die folgenden Optionen:\n\n* \u00dcber das Einwohnermeldeamt herausfinden, was mit S geschehen ist\n* Das Nachlassgericht kontaktieren, um\n* herauszufinden, wer was wann von wem geerbt hat (falls ich \u00fcberhapt berechtigt bin, diese Information zu erhalten)\n* m\u00f6glicherweise einen Nachlassverwalter einsetzen zu lassen, der einen eventuellen Verkauf regeln k\u00f6nnte\n* einen Privatdetektiv anheuern \u2013 das wird aber vermutlich zu teuer.\n\nEs gibt einen weiteren Punkt: aufgrund des Baumbewuchses (den wir beseitigen werden, sobald wir d\u00fcrfen) stellt es eine potentielle Gefahr f\u00fcr unser Haus dar: die B\u00e4ume sind so gro\u00df, dass sie auf unser Haus fallen k\u00f6nnten. Dies w\u00e4re daher ein weiterer Grund, weshalb wir herausfinden wollen und m\u00fcssen, wer f\u00fcr das Grundst\u00fcck verantwortlich ist.\n\nUpdate:\n\n* Ich habe bei der Stadtkasse nachgefragt, wer die Grundsteuer f\u00fcr das Grundst\u00fcck bezahle. Leider durfte man mir diese Information nicht geben, und stellten mir in Aussicht, dass auch eine schriftliche Anfrage daran nichts \u00e4ndern werde.\n* Ich habe auch eine Melderegisteranfrage get\u00e4tigt, jedoch nur online. Das System konnte mir die erbetenen Informationen nicht bereitstellen. M\u00f6glicherweise k\u00f6nnte ich die Anfrage jedoch pers\u00f6nlich (vor Ort) wiederholen.\n* 2022: Alles hat sich gekl\u00e4rt. Ich werde eine Antwort posten.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Finding S seems to be hard and I have not much hope, if her siblings cannot provide any information. I think the \"inhabitants registry\" (Einwohnermeldeamt) is not allowed to give you her first address in Spain (\"Zuzugsanschrift im Ausland\") (\u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45 Bundesmeldegesetz (BMG)).\n\nThe best option I see is a court auction (Zwangsversteigerung), more precise a \"Teilungsversteigerung\". If one of S's siblings want money for the land, he can ask for a court auction at the local court (Amtsgericht). The court will get S's first address in Spain (\u00a7 34 BMG) and if it cannot deliver its letter to S, there will be a \"public delivery\" (\u00f6ffentliche Zustellung) through a posting in court. It would take a while, but in the end the land could be yours.\n\nBe prepared that the cost for the court auction will be much higher than the 1000\u20ac. If you plan to take this way, ask a lawyer for detailed advice. Also you need one of S's siblings to participate in the process.\n\nIf the trees are really a danger for your house, the heirs could also have an obligation to remove them. Maybe this could help you too.",

A \"Teilungsversteigerung\" (court auction for division of property) through the local court (Amtsgericht) offers several advantages:\n\n1. It provides a legal mechanism to resolve complex ownership issues when some owners cannot be located.\n2. The court has the authority to obtain the missing owner's address in Spain, which private individuals cannot easily access.\n3. If the court cannot contact the missing owner, it can proceed with a \"public delivery\" (\u00f6ffentliche Zustellung) to meet legal notification requirements.\n4. This process, while potentially costly and time-consuming, can lead to a legal sale of the property.\n\nOption A is less effective because the inheritance court may not have or be able to share all relevant information. Option B, hiring a private investigator, is likely to be expensive and may not yield results or have legal standing. Option D is not viable, as the tax office is not allowed to disclose such information to private individuals. The court auction process, while complex, provides a legal pathway to resolve the ownership issues and potentially acquire the property."

If a person unknowingly receives a counterfeit bill during a transaction and has no intention of using it to defraud others, they are generally not held criminally liable. The law recognizes that innocent individuals can become unwitting recipients of counterfeit currency.

Sure, it may have been \"Disney World\\-ified\" in later years, but this is the 1970s and earlier.\n\nIt seems very strange to me that you would get such harsh prison sentences (or any punishment at all) for using Cannabis in a town full of booze, gambling, strippers and neon lights. It seems like the perfect place for this to be legalized as the first place in the USA...\n\nCan somebody please straighten this out to me once and for all?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can tell, it was punished severely, but not quite that severely.\n\nI found [Nevada's 1971 controlled substances statute, AB 107](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Statutes/56th/Stats197109.html#Stats197109_CH667). \"Marihuana\" appears in Schedule I, the list of drugs which are most tightly restricted (Section 31, subsection 4(j)).\n\nSection 65 makes it a crime to possess such substances. Under subsection 1, a first offense was punishable by 1 to 6 years in prison, a second offense by 1\\-10 years, a third or subsequent offense by 1\\-20 years. There were also fines of up to about $2000\\-$5000\\. There was an exception in subsection 3 for marihuana possession of less than one ounce: a first offense could alternatively be punished by up to one year in county jail, probably at the discretion of the prosecutor or judge. Second offenses were treated as a first offense under subsection 1, and so on.\n\nSelling and distributing drugs including marihuana was punished more severely. Under Section 62, the punishment was 1 to 20 years in prison for a first offense, and for a second offense, life in prison without possibility of parole. If the drug was distributed to a person under age 21, a first offense was punishable by life in prison, but with possibility of parole after 7 years. There was no exception for small quantities of marihuana.\n\nI didn't find a reference to the specific 25 year term you mention. It's possible that it comes from some version of the law as it existed before or after the 1971 statute; I didn't check. Also, marijuana was (and still is) also illegal under federal law; I didn't check what punishment federal law would have prescribed at the time. It's unlikely that the City of Las Vegas would have had separate laws; this sort of thing would normally be done at the state level.\n\nAs far as I know, this is in keeping with other state drug laws of the time, and given the prevailing politics, I'm not surprised by the law. Drug use was treated very differently under the law than the other \"vices\" you mention. It'd be outside the scope of this site to discuss the possible factors behind this, but you could perhaps take it to Politics.SE or History.SE.\n\nNevada eventually legalized recreational marijuana for adults in 2017, according to [https://norml.org/laws/nevada\\-penalties\\-2/](https://norml.org/laws/nevada-penalties-2/). It was not the first state to do so; Washington State had taken a similar step in 2012\\.",

According to the statute:\n- First offense: 1-6 years in prison\n- Second offense: 1-10 years in prison\n- Third or subsequent offense: 1-20 years in prison\n\nOption C correctly states the punishment for a third offense. Options A and B represent punishments for first and second offenses respectively, while option D is incorrect as it refers to the punishment for a second offense of selling or distributing drugs, not possession."

The concern is it being non FDA approved and requiring it. State\\-Mississippi\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are, as far as I know, no \"FDA\\-approved\" vaccines against covid in the US. The FDA has given [Emergency Use Authorization](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained) to some vaccines. This does not currently include the Johnson \\& Johnson vaccine. It is *impossible* for a person to get the J\\&J vaccine in the US, because it is not authorized, and J\\&J does not distribute it. One could imagine an unauthorized foreign vaccine being smuggled into the US, but it would be illegal to distribute it.\n\nI assume that you specifically mean, can a person refuse to get a vaccination on the grounds that it only has an emergency authorization and is not actually approved: and can one sue an employer for firing you because you refused to get vaccinated? In general, the employer can fire for anything they want, unless you have an employment contract that limits the grounds for termination. There are discrimination\\-based grounds that they cannot use, such as race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, disability, age (age 40 or older), or genetic information at the federal level. Mississippi has no specific employment discrimination laws. Other that that, an [employer can fire an employee for any reason](https://www.blr.com/HR-Employment/Performance-Termination/Termination-with-Discharge-in-Mississippi), or no reason (Mississippi is what's known as an \"employment at will\" state). There are some state restrictions where it is prohibited for an employer to fire an employee for engaging in a specific required activity such as being called for jury duty or being called to military duty. An employer could not require an employee to break the law, but that is not applicable here.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Mississippi, an employer wants to implement a policy requiring all employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine that has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this policy?\n\nA) The employer cannot implement this policy because the vaccine only has EUA and is not fully FDA-approved.\n\nB) The employer can implement this policy, but employees can sue for wrongful termination if fired for refusing the vaccine.\n\nC) The employer can implement this policy and terminate employees who refuse, unless the employee has a protected reason for refusal.\n\nD) The employer can only implement this policy if they have explicit permission from the state government of Mississippi.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Mississippi is an \"at-will\" employment state, meaning employers can generally fire employees for any reason or no reason at all, with some exceptions. The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine only has Emergency Use Authorization does not legally prevent employers from requiring it. However, employers must still consider protected reasons for refusal, such as medical conditions or sincerely held religious beliefs, which fall under federal anti-discrimination laws. The employer cannot force employees to break the law, but requiring a vaccine with EUA is not illegal. While employees might feel uncomfortable with an EUA vaccine, this discomfort alone is not a protected legal reason to refuse vaccination in an employment context."

There is no universal law forcing relocation based on residence, and the location of job openings doesn't automatically determine where an employee must work. The freedom of contract principle allows employers and employees to negotiate these terms.

Or, can an attorney be put under oath and compelled to testify against his client in such an event?\n\nClarification: This is not pertaining to a situation in which the Client is antagonizing the Attorney. Suppose, rather, that the Client at some point asked of the Attorney, \"Give me your professional advice on X.\" The Attorney responds with, \"My advice is Y.\" The Client instead does Z, gets into legal trouble, and in his defense claims, \"My Attorney advised in scenario X to do Z.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's no fantastic legal source, and rules may vary in different countries, but from [the Wikipedia article on Attorney client privilege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%E2%80%93client_privilege#Disclosure_ostensibly_to_support_lawyer.27s_own_interests):\n\n> Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves\n>  against disciplinary or legal proceedings.

When the client testifies about advice allegedly given by the attorney, they effectively waive attorney-client privilege for that specific conversation. The attorney is not obligated to immediately contradict the client in open court, which could prejudice the jury. Instead, the proper procedure is to wait and see if they are called as a witness.

Although the contract specifies certain methods of service, the Nova Scotia Labour Code allows for personal service of termination notices. Additionally, courts generally interpret contracts based on the parties' intent rather than adhering strictly to technicalities. The intent behind specifying methods of service is to ensure the employee is made aware of the termination. Personal delivery satisfies this intent more effectively than the specified methods. Furthermore, section 6 of the NS Labour Code defers to arrangements more favorable to the employee, and earlier notice could be seen as more favorable. Courts would likely view insistence on email delivery as overly ritualistic when the employee was already personally notified. Therefore, the notice period would likely be considered to begin when the employee was personally handed the notice on July 19th."

Just like time share sells.\n\nBut it's not normal win win trade either. \n\nSo what is it?\n\nScam?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are three answers here.\n\nFirst, as is common on this site, you are using the term, \"legal\" and \"illegal.\" Those are not legally meaningfully terms. A good lawyer won't use those terms to mean allowed or disallowed. We talk in terms of potential civil or criminal liability, or other sanctions and consequences. To say that something is \"legal\" does not communicate much.\n\nSecond, all contracts are governed by a duty of good faith. That means that you cannot try to \"trick\" someone with the terms of the contract and expect to enforce that contract against them and you cannot try to skirt your obligations by finding a tricky form of compliance not within the mutual understanding of the agreement. As with all things, defining good faith is not easy, and depends on the specific context of a situation. It is worth distinguishing between the duty of good faith, and the duties one owes to a fiduciary; good faith is surely far less, but nevertheless still meaningful.\n\nThird, a defense to non\\-performance of a contract is that the agreement as written is unconscionable. A contract that is a grossly unfair deal where the contract was not actively negotiated (i.e. Blindly signing a bad form contract), may fall under this category.\n\nNote: I am not your lawyer; this is not legal advice; contact a licensed attorney in your area; do not rely on my statements; I merely am providing a general answer that is academic in nature.",

Which of the following best describes the legal status of this clause?\n\nA) It is perfectly legal and enforceable since the customers signed the contract.\nB) It is illegal and the store owner could face criminal charges for fraud.\nC) It is likely unenforceable due to unconscionability and a lack of good faith, but not necessarily illegal.\nD) It is enforceable, but only up to a \"reasonable\" fee amount as determined by the court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario is best described by option C. The clause is not necessarily \"illegal\" in the sense of breaking a specific law, but it's likely to be deemed unenforceable in court. This is due to two main factors mentioned in the documentation:\n\n1. Duty of good faith: All contracts are governed by a duty of good faith, which means parties cannot try to \"trick\" each other with hidden terms. Burying such an extreme fee in fine print likely violates this principle.\n\n2. Unconscionability: A grossly unfair deal in a contract that wasn't actively negotiated (like a standard form contract) may be considered unconscionable by a court. A 500% fee would likely qualify as grossly unfair.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signing doesn't automatically make all contract terms enforceable. Option B overstates the case by claiming it's definitively illegal. Option D introduces a concept (court-determined \"reasonable\" fees) not supported by the given information."

It's unlikely the person would go to this extreme.\n\nB) This is the most likely consequence. The act of faking death and surprising funeral attendees could be considered \"disorderly conduct\" under Wisconsin law, as it would likely \"cause or provoke a disturbance\" and could be seen as \"boisterous\" or \"otherwise disorderly conduct.\"\n\nC) While there is a statute in Wisconsin prohibiting disruption of funeral services, it only applies if disorderly conduct is already established, and it would only become a Class I felony for repeat offenses after a prior conviction.\n\nD) The question specifically states that the aria sung is not subject to copyright, so this consequence can be ruled out.\n\nAdditionally, while not listed as an option, there's a possibility of a civil lawsuit for intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the question asks for the MOST likely legal consequence."

It's often repeated as some kind of dogma, I've never seen explanations for it.\n\nSo, what are the exact advantages of suing someone without warning? I doubt it's the effect of surprise, and they will have plenty of time to consult their own lawyers before anything crucial happens.\n\nThat the following example: Alice wants to sue Bob, because he caused her some damages. The damages are high enough that she wants to be made whole, but not as high that a lawsuit would be surely expected. Let's also assume that both know that Alice will have very good chances of winning if it comes to a trial. At first Alice asks him nicely to be repaid (without mentioning a lawsuit), and Bob refuses because he thinks that Alice won't bother suing over such a thing. At this moment Alice could say that if he doesn't repay the damages she will sue. Bob would then have an incentive to pay, as he now knows that Alice is likely to sue and if it comes to that, he will likely lose much more (legal fees, time, etc.) So it would be optimal for both of them if Alice tells Bob that she will sue, as both of them would be saving time and money if he just paid her without going to court.\n\nSo, in the above situation, why should Alice just sue Bob without first threatening/warning/telling him? What would she lose by trying? (and is there a difference if the jurisdiction does or doesn't have a \"loser pays both parties legal fees\" policy?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because threatening a lawsuit is a nuclear option\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are thinking about a lawsuit then you have a dispute. The best, most efficient, most effective and cheapest way to resolve a dispute is to negotiate a settlement. The best, most efficient and quickest way to derail a negotiation is to make threats.\n\nPeople don't like being threatened. It makes them upset and angry. People who are upset and angry like to make the person who made them upset and angry upset and angry in return. This rapidly leads to an escalation of tensions often to the point that the thing (a lawsuit) that was previously only one option out of many is now the only option.\n\nSo instead of resolving the dispute cheaply, quickly and under the control of the parties to the dispute, it gets resolved expensively, slowly and by someone who doesn't give a rat's arse about the parties.\n\nLawyers can't make empty threats\n--------------------------------\n\nLawers have an ethical duty not to make threats they don't intend to follow through on. A lawyer who makes empty threats of lawsuits can be censured.",

It states that the best way to resolve a dispute is through negotiation, aiming for a settlement without making threats. Option C aligns with this advice, suggesting Alice should continue negotiating without mentioning a lawsuit, which keeps the possibility of an efficient, cost-effective resolution open.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it advises threatening with a lawsuit, which the documentation explicitly warns against as it can make people upset and angry, leading to escalation.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. While it involves a lawyer, it still constitutes a threat of legal action, which can have the same negative effects as a direct threat from Alice.\n\nOption D, while mentioned in the documentation as a strategy some people advise, is not presented as the best course of action. The documentation suggests that negotiation is preferable to immediate legal action.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows for the possibility of resolving the dispute cheaply and quickly, under the control of the parties involved, rather than resorting to an expensive and time-consuming legal process."

One is for registering your car late, and the other is for driving in Arizona without proper registration.

The question \"Would you presume someone guilty if he or she refused a breath test on their refusal alone?\" is such a commitment question, and is disallowed. Similarly, \"If the evidence, in a hypothetical case, showed that a person was arrested and they had a crack pipe in their pocket, and they had a residue amount in it, and it could be measured, and it could be seen, is there anyone who could not convict a person, based on that\" ([Atkins v. State, 951 S.W.2d 787](https://casetext.com/case/atkins-v-state-11)).

Let us say that the IP in question is acoustic readings from sending sound waves into the ground (revealing huge oil reserves). I also assume that you are certain that this IP fell through the cracks and there was no official transfer. That table of data could be subject to copyright restrictions, so that people could not legally copy the table, but they could still make use of the data. Copyright protects the mode of expression, not the underlying facts (which would include the measurements). See [this standard characterization](http://www.lib.umich.edu/copyright/facts-and-data) of the non\\-protected status of data, and [this testimony before Congress](http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat092303.html) for broad discussion of copyright law as applied to databases. Data is not protected, databases are.\n\nCopyright is not extinguished with bankruptcy, and probably should have been sold off with other assets. The owner of the company would not necessarily have owned the copyright, unless s/he created the database (if it is a database). It would be perfectly normal for the creator to be required to transfer copyright to the company, assuming that this was a work for hire. But then the copyright would be owned by the company, not the owner of the company.\n\nAnother possibility is that the data is protected by a non\\-disclosure agreement. Assuming you signed some such NDA which forbids you from in any way disclosing this data, I would then say that you really do need to ask an attorney how to deal with this situation. The essential question is who acquired the contract that you signed, and whether they will go after you for breach of the NDA. Providing a tool to use such data may be prohibited by the contract, and if it is that valuable, [whoever assumed the contract](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-happens-leases-contracts-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html) could have a leg to stand on in preventing you from working on this project, even though others not covered by that NDA would be free to.",

The building's security takes down the person's contact information and identification details. What is the most likely reason for collecting this information?\n\nA) To follow up on the person's well-being and offer additional medical assistance if needed\nB) To document the incident for insurance purposes and protect against potential lawsuits\nC) To report the incident to local authorities as required by law\nD) To add the person to a list of individuals banned from entering the building in the future\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely reason for collecting the person's information is to document the incident for insurance purposes and protect against potential lawsuits. This aligns with the top answer from LawStackExchange, which suggests that the building management is creating a record of the incident to protect themselves in case the injured person tries to sue them later, claiming more severe injuries than what was initially reported. By having detailed documentation of the person's condition immediately after the incident, including that they only needed minor first aid, the building can defend itself against potential exaggerated claims in the future."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Normally, the existence of prior art containing matters for which a United States utility patent makes claims to patent rights prevents a patent from being issued for those claims, and if a patent somehow issues anyway, it provides a defense to a defendant in a patent infringement action.\n\nBut suppose that there exists prior art that is not know to anyone alive at the time that the patent is applied for and issued, but ten years later when the patent holder brings a timely patent infringement lawsuit, the prior art which had been unknown to anyone alive at the time is rediscovered. Does that invalidate the patent?\n\n**Example**\n\nFor example, suppose that Sharp Co. develops a process of making steel for knives that is superior in some way (e.g., it makes it much cheaper and quicker to manufacture the knives than an alternative status quo process that produces exactly the same end result), by incorporating flax oil into the process of forging its knives. It is impossible to discern that the flax process was used by physically inspecting a knife made with it after the fact.\n\nAssume that this patent easily qualifies as valid by every relevant legal test evaluated as of 2012\\-2014 and under all changes to patent law since then that do not pertain to prior art. This process was something that no published work available to living people was aware of at the time that Sharp Co. applied for its patent in 2012, and the patent was issued in 2014\\.\n\nIn time, Sharp Co. discovers that Dull Co., a company next door to it, is using the same flax oil process to forge its knives and brings suit in 2022 for patent infringement, having copied the Sharp Co. process from its patent application, and Dull Co. gains 50% of the market share of knives made with this process costing Sharp Co. US $50 million a year in lost profits.\n\nBut after filing an answer in the patent infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the patent infringement defense lawyer for Dull Co. who reads archaeology and linguistics texts in his spare time happens to learn that in 2016, archaeologists discovered an inscription in Old Persian from 1100 BCE in a newly unearthed tomb and translated it and published their findings in the journal *Nature*, describing precisely the same lost art of using flax oil to forge knives that Sharp Co. reinvented independently in 2012 and for which it secured its patent. No one affiliated of Sharp Co. learned about the newly discovered Old Persian texts until after they brought their infringement lawsuit and the lawyer for Dull Co. brought it to their attention. Dull Co.'s lawyer had raised the defense of invalidity based upon prior art in the answer that Dull Co. filed even though he didn't know about this particular prior art at the time.\n\nEvidence from the ancient Old Persian text and some related authentic texts written by Old Persian priests from a few centuries later indicates that there were hundreds of copies of the description of this process which were included in every prayer book of the predominant religion of the region now called Iran in 1100 BCE that was freely available in each of hundreds of temples in the region to anyone interested, but it was not preserved by later scribes who decided that it was considered an obvious piece of knowledge among metal workers that wasn't worth recopying at some point in the early Iron Age, even though they were wrong and the process was later entirely forgotten.\n\n**Question**\n\nDoes the previously lost prior art, that is rediscovered before the patent of the lost prior art process expires, provide Dull Co. with a meritorious prior art invalidity defense to the validity of Sharp Co.'s patent infringement lawsuit against Dull Co.?\n\nI can imagine this question functionally hinging on when prior art has to exist, and I could also imagine it hinging on the definition of what has to happen for something to constitute prior art. But, I'm not really sure exactly what the proper analysis would be.\n\n**Differences from prior similar questions**\n\nThis differs from the similar question \"[What impact does prior art discovered after (US) patent awarding have on enforceability and even validity of that patent?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15542/what-impact-does-prior-art-discovered-after-us-patent-awarding-have-on-enforce)\", because in this question, by design, there was nothing that would have operationally counted as prior art available at the time the patent was applied for and at the time that it was issued, while that question implicitly assumes that the only reason that prior art wasn't discovered was due to an inadequate prior art search when the patent was issued, and that a sufficiently thorough search for prior art at the time the patent was applied for and issued could have possibly found it.\n\nThis also differs from the fact pattern where someone already uses the patented process in a secret manner protected as a trade secret that is not disclosed until after the patent is issued, because, as I understand it, to be prior art, something must be knowable to people in the general public at some prior time (usually in a publication that is not confidential).\n\nThe example is loosely inspired by Rahil Alipour, Thilo Rehren, Marcos Martin\u00f3n\\-Torres. **\"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia.\"** Journal of Archaeological Science (2020\\); 105224 DOI: 10\\.1016/j.jas.2020\\.105224 (recounting their discovery that there was widespread manufacturing of chromium steel in Southern Persia around 1000 CE, a metallurgy technique that was subsequently lost and then only rediscovered about nine centuries later).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The patent is invalid\n---------------------\n\nFrom [35 U.S.C. 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102)\n\n> A person shall be entitled to a patent unless \u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent\n\nThere is no doubt that the Persion \"printed publication\" in c.1100 BCE predates the invention of the technique by Sharp Co. in 2012 CE. If follows that Sharp Co. is not entitled to patent protection.\n\nThis is merely a refinement of [35 U.S.C. 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/101) which says (my emphasis):\n\n> Whoever invents or discovers any **new** and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\n\nThe process Sharp Co. invented was not \"new\" \\- patent rights only accrue to the *first* inventor, in this case, some unnamed ancient Persian. The prior art exclusion is merely one means of ensuring that the patent holder is the first inventor.",

The law does not require that the prior art be known at the time of the application, only that it existed before the invention. Therefore, the patent is invalid due to the existence of prior art, regardless of when it was discovered. This ensures that patent rights only accrue to the first inventor of a truly new process or invention."

[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland) says in 1907 Newfoundland made the transition from the status of a \"self\\-governing colony\" to that of a \"dominion\".\n\nA \"dominion\" is what Canada called itself before 1982\\. As a \"dominion\", Canada was an independent country, which in particular sent and received ambassadors, etc., **except** that the basic constitutional law of the country was an act of the British Parliament, and so could be altered only by the British Parliament. I don't know whether that is how Newfoundland was organized when it was a \"dominion\". The Wikipedia article suggests the concept of \"dominion\" is defined in the Statute of Westminster, but that statute did not exist until the 1930s, so it could not have governed whatever it was that happened in 1907\\.\n\nWhat is the difference between the status of Newfoundland before 1907 and the status after 1907?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *I'll be referencing the* \"Minutes of proceedings of the Colonial Conference, 1907\" *throughout ([600\\+ pg. PDF](https://archive.org/download/minutesofproceed00colo/minutesofproceed00colo_bw.pdf)). The page numbers refer to the ones printed on the page instead of any software page number.*\n\nIt seems that @owjburnham's comment is essentially correct, it is mainly a shift in terminology. It came from a desire to further distinguish self\\-governing from non\\-self\\-governing colonies (or \"Crown Colonies\" as the official term seems to have been). As such, \"Dominion\" came to be (re)defined as \"self\\-governing colony.\"\n\n---\n\nDuring the 1907 Colonial Conference, Prime Minister [Sir Joseph Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ward) of New Zealand opined the following \\[pg. 30\\-31]:\n\n> I think the term \"Colony,\" so far as our countries are concerned, ought to cease, and that that term ought to apply to the Crown Colonies purely, and that those of us who are not at present known as Dominions or Commonwealths, should be known as States of the Empire, or some other expressive word, so as to make a distinction as between the Crown Colonies and the self\\-governing\n>  Dependencies.\n\nHe also stated the following \\[pg. 48]:\n\n> I assume that in this resolution New Zealand, now known by the term \"Colony,\" will be included in the expression \"Dominion,\" which I think it ought to be.\n\nAwkwardly, this was right at the end of the day and no one reacted to this statement as the conference adjourned.\n\n---\n\nAs the participants were deciding upon the structure and participants of subsequent conferences, there is a lengthy discussion of the exact term to be used to refer to the self\\-governing colonies \\[pg. 78\\-90]. Near its conclusion, the chairman states the following \\[pg. 89]: \n\n> We agreed \\[...] that instead of the word \"Colonies\" we should use the word \"Dominions;\" but is it sufficiently defined if we use the word \"Dominions\" alone throughout? \\[...] I would suggest that we might take what is really the official term \"the Dominions beyond the seas\" in the first place where it occurs \\[...] and any other reference to it in the course of the Resolution might very well be \"Dominions.\" That would make it absolutely clear what we mean by the expression in the first place.\n\nThus, the conference opted for an implicit rather than explicit definition of \"Dominion\". The designation of Newfoundland as a Dominion in 1907 is just a reconciliation of the fact it was a self\\-governing colony and the new understanding that the word \"Dominion\" was to mean roughly that. There was no effective change of status. An explicit definition of \"Dominion\" would not come until the [Balfour Declaration of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1926).\n\nIronically, Newfoundland played no role in deciding the term to be used for itself as [its Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bond) only arrived on Day 4 of the conference \\[pg. 87].",

According to the information provided, the change to \"dominion\" status for Newfoundland in 1907 was primarily a change in terminology rather than a significant alteration of its governance structure. The term \"dominion\" was redefined during the 1907 Colonial Conference to refer to self-governing colonies, distinguishing them from Crown Colonies. Newfoundland was already a self-governing colony before 1907, so its actual status did not change substantially. The conference decided to use \"dominion\" implicitly to mean self-governing colonies, without making major changes to their actual political arrangements. Options A and D describe aspects more associated with later developments in dominion status, while B implies a more significant change than what actually occurred in 1907 for Newfoundland."

Thankfully, the interviewee provided a scan of the police letter he received, so the rest of this question is relatively easy to answer.\n\nHe was specifically charged with *St\u00f6rung der \u00f6ffentlichen Ordnung* (lit. Disturbance of the public order) persuant to [\u00a7\u00a081(1\\) of the *Sicherheitspolizeigesetz*](https://www.jusline.at/gesetz/spg/paragraf/81), which reads (after putting it through Google Translate):\n\n> Who by a behavior that is likely to arouse legitimate annoyance, disturbs public order, commits an administrative offense and is punishable by a fine of up to 500 euros, unless the behavior is justified, in particular by the use of a constitutionally guaranteed right , In the event of aggravating circumstances, instead of a fine, imprisonment can be imprisoned for up to one week, or up to two weeks for repeated offenses.\n\nThis law is almost certainly constitutional as it specifically allows exercise of constitutional rights. Note this also includes human rights, as Austria has [included](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesverfassung_(%C3%96sterreich)#Europ%C3%A4ische_Menschenrechtskonvention_1958) the European Convention on Human Rights as part of its constitution.\n\nGiven that, I'm guessing if the interviewee had wanted to, he would have had a decent shot at having this charge dismissed.",

According to the information provided, under which law were they charged, and what is a key aspect of this law that relates to constitutional rights?\n\nA) They were charged under the Sicherheitspolizeigesetz \u00a7 81(1) for St\u00f6rung der \u00f6ffentlichen Ordnung (disturbance of public order). The law explicitly allows for the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nB) They were charged under the European Convention on Human Rights.

The law prohibits all forms of political expression at public rallies.\n\nD) They were charged under the Public Assembly Act. The law requires equal representation of all political views at public gatherings.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. The individuals were charged under \u00a7 81(1) of the Sicherheitspolizeigesetz for St\u00f6rung der \u00f6ffentlichen Ordnung (disturbance of public order). A crucial aspect of this law, as mentioned in the text, is that it specifically allows for the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed rights. This is important because it suggests that actions protected by constitutional rights may be exempt from prosecution under this law. The other options are incorrect: B falsely attributes the charge to the European Convention on Human Rights, C incorrectly cites the Austrian Criminal Code and misrepresents the law's stance on political expression, and D invents a non-existent \"Public Assembly Act\" with fictional requirements."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal rights of the parties involved?\n\nA) The artist can prevent the destruction of the painting based on copyright law, as they retain moral rights over their work.\n\nB) The collector has full rights to destroy the painting, unless it is specifically protected under heritage or cultural preservation laws.\n\nC) The artist can sue for damages if the painting is destroyed, but cannot prevent its destruction.\n\nD) The collector must obtain explicit permission from the artist before modifying or destroying the artwork.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, once a person owns a physical object, they generally have the right to do what they want with it, including destroying it, as long as they comply with other applicable laws. Copyright law does not prevent the owner of a physical instance of a copyrighted work from destroying it. The only exceptions would be if the artwork is specifically protected under heritage or cultural preservation laws. Options A and D are incorrect because copyright and moral rights typically do not extend to preventing destruction by the rightful owner. Option C is incorrect because the artist usually cannot sue for damages if the owner chooses to destroy their own property, assuming no other laws are violated in the process."

I.e., if I spend millions of dollars on a breach of trust case, will I win?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nThe police have no affirmative legally enforceable duty in the U.S., to the general public, or any particular person who invokes their assistance, to take action to enforce the law.\n\nThe leading case on point is *[Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales)*, 545 U.S. 748 (2005\\) (full text [here](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/748/)). In this case, despite the urgent requests of the beneficiary of a Colorado domestic violence restraining order and the warning that a violent crime was imminent, the police in the Town of Castle Rock blew the woman off, and did nothing to prevent ex\\-husband who had illegally abducted her three daughters from murdering them even though they could easily have done so. The conclusion of the majority opinion by Justice Scalia states that (some citations and footnotes omitted):\n\n> We conclude, therefore, that respondent did not, for purposes of the\n> Due Process Clause, have a property interest in police enforcement of\n> the restraining order against her husband. It is accordingly\n> unnecessary to address the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that the\n> town\u2019s custom or policy prevented the police from giving her due\n> process when they deprived her of that alleged interest.\n> \n> \n> In light of today\u2019s decision . . . the benefit that a third party may\n> receive from having someone else arrested for a crime generally does\n> not trigger protections under the Due Process Clause, neither in its\n> procedural nor in its \u201csubstantive\u201d manifestations. This result\n> reflects our continuing reluctance to treat the Fourteenth Amendment\n> as \u201c \u2018a font of tort law,\u2019\u201d . . . but it does not mean States are\n> powerless to provide victims with personally enforceable remedies.\n> Although the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights\n> Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 (the original source of \u00a71983\\), did not\n> create a system by which police departments are generally held\n> financially accountable for crimes that better policing might have\n> prevented, the people of Colorado are free to craft such a system\n> under state law.\n\nDespite this concluding statement, there was a very solid argument that the law of the State of Colorado at the time had already been intended to do just that, but was not and would not be given effect.\n\nThis U.S. Supreme Court case dealt with claims under federal law.\n\nThere is no affirmative constitutional right to reclaim a stolen car or try to prevent your car from being stolen by a private individual, even if you have a legal right to do so under state law. So, you can't bring a federal civil rights action to enforce a deprivation of that right.\n\nThe situation is even worse under state law, where police have absolute immunity from liability for all tort claims (i.e. roughly speaking, lawsuits to enforce rights other than contractual rights), unless it comes within a specific exception (of which are there are several) for cases of ordinary negligence such as car accidents when just driving around and not having emergency lights illuminated, or failing to clear ice from a sidewalk on police department property.\n\nTheir boss may not take kindly to their indifference, but that is a purely discretionary issue for their boss in the context of an employer\\-employee relationship (often further limited by civil service protections for public employees and/or protections as members of a law enforcement union).\n\nThe primary exception, not applicable in the example in the question, is that law enforcement officers have certain obligations to protect people who are in law enforcement custody from harm. This obligation is stronger prior to a criminal conviction, and is weaker after someone has been convicted of a crime and is serving a sentence of incarceration for that crime.\n\nIf you brought a lawsuit of the type described in the question, you would probably lose the case on a motion to dismiss filed swiftly after you filed your lawsuit, and there is a very good chance that you would be compelled to pay the legal fees of the people whom you sued.\n\n**Comparative Law Footnote**\n\nIncidentally, while this rule of law is widely shared in countries with \"common law\" legal systems derived from English law, it is not the case with nearly the same degree of clarity in \"civil law\" legal systems based upon the civil codes found in Continental Europe such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Almost all countries in Latin America, most countries that are not former British colonies in Africa, and most countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia, are civil law countries.\n\nIn civil law countries there generally are both statutory obligations and human rights law obligations for which the government or government officials can have liability for willfully refusing to enforce criminal laws. But even there it is, as a practical matter, difficult to enforce this obligation and is possible only in the most stark circumstances (such as the one described in the question where there is open defiance of this obligation without any understandable and legitimate contravening reason for failing to act).",

According to the U.S. Supreme Court case Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, police have no affirmative legally enforceable duty to the general public or any particular person to take action to enforce the law. This means that even if the police refuse to respond to a reported crime like car theft, they cannot be successfully sued for failing to do their job. \n\nOption A is incorrect because police do not have a legally enforceable obligation to respond to all reported crimes. \n\nOption B is wrong because there is no constitutional right to reclaim stolen property or prevent theft by private individuals that can be enforced through a federal civil rights lawsuit. \n\nOption D is incorrect because police generally have absolute immunity from tort claims, with only specific exceptions for ordinary negligence in situations not related to law enforcement duties (like car accidents during regular driving)."

Absent that information, your description reflects that most certainly the Albanian is committing a crime.\n\nThe Albanian's conduct matches \\-\\-at least\\-\\- the *ordinary* meaning of betting: he is not disbursing (or promising to disburse) money merely for fun or leisure, but for the prospect of possibly profiting from an uncertain event of which he officially has no control. Doing it through a third party located in another country changes nothing in this regard.\n\n> Am I committing a crime in Italy?\n\nThe Italian might be considered an *accessory* of that conduct being classified as criminal in Albania. Thus, facilitating activity that is prohibited in Albania could turn out to be problematic even for the Italian.\n\nFurthermore, even if betting is legal in Italy, the Italian might be in trouble under the laws of Italy if taking money (without the requisite license) from someone else to make bets constitutes *unauthorized business* of gambling.
