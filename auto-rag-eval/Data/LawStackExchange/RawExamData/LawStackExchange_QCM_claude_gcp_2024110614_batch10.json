That would be the case with an airline reservation, and one clear sign is that you have to pay for the ticket when you make the reservation; or, it you don't, then there is no contract, and they can cancel or change the price. You would look for clear signs of an agreement, such as a \"agree to terms\" button that you have to click. Paying a deposit is another clear sign. Then you would simply look at the terms of the contract to see what their obligation is, and what yours is. They may have strongly committed to providing service in which case you might have a cause for legal action if they break that commitment, or they might have made no specific promises about service in case of intervening events (such as if the chef has a heart attack, or the power goes out). If we do think of this as a contractual matter, you breached your duty as a customer, to be there by 7:30, so even if there is a contract, they didn't break it. The note that you added renegotiating the arrival time was insufficient \u2013 it is outside of the contract, and possibly something that they didn't see (they only look at the names and official time blocks reported by the web page).\n\nIn lieu of a contract, there could be some statutory obligation, i.e. a specific regulation in Sweden saying \"if a restaurant accepts a reservation, they absolutely must hold the space available for the entire reserved time\", which is an unreasonably onerous business practice that no nation requires.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A couple makes an online reservation for a romantic dinner at a restaurant in Sweden from 7:30-9 PM.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"making a reservation\" generally does not create a contract, especially without clear signs like payment or explicit agreement to terms.\n2. There's no mention of Swedish laws specifically requiring restaurants to honor reservations for the entire reserved time period.\n3. The couple technically breached the original reservation time (7:30 PM), and their message about arriving later was not part of the formal reservation process.\n4.

Our landscaper disputes the neighbor's claims, but allows that they may have inadvertently stepped over the property line. This is possible, but not likely, as the neighbor's plantings are low, and it would be difficult to trim their plantings that cross the line from slightly over the line. Not to mention, pointless, as it is easier to trim the encroaching plants entirely from our property, than it is to stand on or near the property line.\n\nNotwithstanding our neighbor's claim, he has crossed entirely to our property while trimming his plantings. When he attempted to confront us about our landscaper allegedly crossing over, he defended his own crossing over as allowed because he was maintaining his plantings.\n\nThe neighbor has sent a letter from his attorney stating that we are not allowed on his property without express written consent. Fine, we have no interest, nor need, to cross onto his property. However, we are incensed that he misrepresented the facts, and we feel he is essentially attempting to bully us into letting his plantings grow by vaguely claiming some of our trimmings have damaged the \"heart\" of the tree; and asserting our landscaper engaged in \"conversion\" (*sigh*).\n\nPrior to my neighbor's belligerence, we were content to simply trim the low trees that crossed over the line; it wasn't much of a big deal. But now battle lines have been drawn.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way to compel a neighbor to do something is to sue him and get the court to use force. In order to succeed in your lawsuit, you need to show that you have been harmed (annoyance/nuisance does not count). The courts are generally not sympathetic to battle lines being drawn, but might in principle listen if you show that the tree is harming you (not just annoying you). Even then, the court will order compensation for that damage and will not order the removal of the tree.\nThe tree\\-owner has a duty to take reasonable care to maintain the tree, so they cannot just let it fall on your gazebo and say \"oops\". The problem is that the basic rule is that \"a possessor of land is not liable to persons outside the land for a nuisance resulting from trees and natural vegetation growing on the land\", but if a tree destroys your property, the courts also will not suppose that the neighbor has a right to negligently destroy your house. See [Scott v McCarty](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2533344/scott-v-mccarty/), 41 So. 3d 989, [Gallo v. Heller](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1111782/gallo-v-heller/), 512 So. 2d 215\\. Therefore, a lawsuit would have to focus on the extent of actual damage \u2013 it has to be more than a nuisance. Also, the principle that \"it is wiser to leave the individual to protect himself, if harm results to him from this exercise of another's right to use his property in a reasonable way\" does not mean that you cannot trim the tree at all: you may be able to mitigate the problem without damaging the tree. You almost certainly will have to accept some level of \"trespass\" from the vegetation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner in Florida is dealing with a neighbor's pygmy date palm that grows diagonally over their property line, with all palm branches occurring on the homeowner's side.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the principle that courts generally require proof of actual harm, not mere annoyance, to intervene in neighbor disputes over trees.

There are a few questions here.\n\nFirst, is the message protected by copyright? In general, it probably is, but there are many exceptions that might allow you to use it without permission.

The exceptions tend to allow the use of small excerpts of a work for various sorts of purposes that don't undermine the copyright holder's ability to profit.\n\nThat leads to the second question, which is why you are using that message.

It's entirely possible that they allow you explicitly to do what you're considering, in which case it doesn't matter what copyright law says about it. On the other hand, Firefox is open source software, and under some open source licenses, if you incorporate any of the source code in your own product, you are required to release your product's source code under the same license.

If there are no conventional buyers of such a plot, are there any legal ramifications to selling said property to, say, an indigent buyer who has questionable means and perhaps low propensity to pay the taxes, but who could be incentivized to purchase the property for only a small loss to the seller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question seems to assume that the purpose of the sale is to avoid property tax liability.\n\nFirst, property tax liability on a parcel of property with marginal value is generally only a tiny percentage of the fair market value of the property, and the usual remedy if the property is overvalued is to contest the valuation of the property when it is made. Property taxes on property with a fair market value of a few hundred dollars would almost never be more than $1 per year.\n\nSecond, the usual remedy for non\\-payment of property tax, if it continues long enough, is for the property to be sold for tax liens in foreclosure sale. It would be extraordinarily exceptional for a lawsuit against the owner to be pursued to collect (lawsuits against owners are used in California to collect property taxes on tangible personal property that is subject to a property tax).\n\nSo, the implicit motives behind the question are misguided.\n\nBut, a property owner is free to sell real estate to an unrelated third\\-party at any price the seller wants, even if the buyer can't afford to pay the property taxes on the property.

The correct answer, B, is the most legally sound and ethically responsible approach for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that \"the usual remedy if the property is overvalued is to contest the valuation of the property when it is made.\" This directly supports the strategy of challenging the assessment.\n\n2.

See [here](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/ \"here\") for how works can enter the public domain (in your case, you're hoping that it was \"dedicated\" by the photographer, and not otherwise assigned to some third party who is not the photographer, e.g., his employer).\n\nAssuming it's in the public domain, what this means is that nobody has any of the exclusive rights to the work anymore (see [17 U.S.C. 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106)). \n\nNow, a bit of property law. You can imagine the list of exclusive rights listed above as a handful of post it notes. One says, \"to reproduce the copyrighted work...\" Another says \"the right . . . to display the copyrighted work publicly.\" Someone who owns all of these exclusive rights can do anything he wants with them. He can give one of the post\\-it notes away permanently (assignment) to another person, or he can give it away temporarily (usually, a license). He can give away just one, or all at the same time.\n\nThe terms of this website are effectively requiring you to let SE borrow, forever, the post\\-it note that says \"publicly display\" **so that they are not violating your exclusive right of public display**.\n\nHowever, this assumes you even own that exclusive right (post\\-it note). Something in the public domain no longer has any rights (post\\-its). No exclusive rights exist at all with respect to such a public domain work *in copyright*.\\*\n\nTherefore, since you do not possess any copyright rights with respect to a public domain work, you have nothing to give to SE, and so you have not given anything to SE.\n\nThe answers to your questions therefore are \"no you have not licensed anything\" and \"yes it stays in the public domain\".\n\n* Other rights can apply to images, such as trademark.

The key points are:\n\n1. Public domain works have no exclusive rights attached to them.\n2. Stack Exchange's terms require users to license certain profile content.\n3.

A multi\\-nation citizen who has US citizenship has equal US citizenship with every other citizen; therefore the answer to this binary question is \"Yes\". The citizenship(s) of anyone who does not have US citizenship is irrelevant to this question; thus, the answer to this binary question is \"No\".\n2. Yes. The main point here is to determine if you have the relevant documents and permissions to be legally present in the US. If you are a US citizen, a) this makes the process easier for you and b) avoids any possible issues if evidence is found of citizenship from another country, which will make immigration think that A) you are not a US citizen and b) you lied to them.

There's no downside for you to inform them; there may be additional difficulties, delays, and scrutiny if you do not.\n\nIf you are not a US citizen, most of the same applies.

Please note that the employee has to explicitely agree on that. I will assume getting an *additional* lootbox on top for free is something an employee can agree on without a second thought. Getting parts of your salary normally paid in Euros or bonus normally paid in Euros as Lootboxes would be something the employee would have to explicitely agree to, otherwise it must be Euros. You cannot \"force\" an employee to accept anything but Euros.\n\nNote the sentence that the employer can give the employee goods instead of Euros not for their made up \"sale\" price, but for the cost of making them.

For this situation we\u2019ll consider two versions of the product: version A is an upgraded version of the \u201cstandard\u201d version B, version A usually costs around double what version B does.\n\n**The situation**:\n\nI\u2019m part of a facebook group that pertains to one of my hobbies. Someone on one of those groups shared a link to the online store of the retailer, who was selling version A of the product around 40% less than normal retail price (it\u2019s common to share such links on this group when you find good deals). The advertised image on the website was that of version A and the description (basically a specs sheet) clearly stated the materials used were those of version A. It was a good deal, not too good to be true (stuff goes on sale all the time) but some group members contacted the store\u2019s customer support to make sure. Customer support confirmed that it was indeed version A. So far, so good, everyone\u2019s happy, a few of us bought the item thinking that it was version A. (you probably figured out where this is going) \n\nA few days later packages start arriving in the mail and everyone received version B. We had a good deal on version A at 40% off, but even at that price it\u2019s slightly more than what version B would cost\u2026 so one was happy. We contacted customer support who apologized, they said they did not carry version A (in fact, they never carried it in Canada) and that it was simply a mistake on the website. The website has now been updated to show the image and description of version B. Because they do not sell version A, they say that there\u2019s nothing they can do to provide us with the products that were advertised. They offered everyone who contacted them to return the item for a refund.\n\n**Additional info**:\n\nSome people who bought the items took screenshots of the webpage which was clearly advertising version A, and of the email sent to them by customer support confirming that it was indeed version A.\n\n**My question**:\n\nWhat can I do in this situation? Does it qualify as [bait\\-and\\-switch selling](http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00522.html#sec02)? How would I leverage that against them?\n\nIdeally, I\u2019d like to somehow force them to honour the listing and provide us with version A, however many of us already took the hassle\\-free route of simply returning for refund and since the items are worth about $140, there\u2019s not enough financial motivation to call up a lawyer to sue them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A lawsuit is designed to put you in the position you were in before the sale happened. Since the company has already offered you a full refund, suing would achieve nothing except cost you fees; your time and frustration are not legally recompensable.\n\nIt may be that some consumer\\-protection office can fine this company for misleading advertising; the case would turn on whether the mistake should have been noticed before customer support sent a false confirmation. If you want to start the process, you should make a formal complaint to your local trading standards/customer service office.

Customer support confirmed it was version A. However, customers received version B, which is a lower-quality product. The retailer claims it was a mistake and offers refunds. Which of the following actions is most likely to result in a favorable outcome for the customers while considering legal and practical constraints?\n\nA) File a class-action lawsuit against the retailer for bait-and-switch tactics\nB) Report the incident to the Competition Bureau of Canada for misleading advertising\nC) Demand the retailer provide version A at the advertised price, citing promissory estoppel\nD) Accept the refund and file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the situation and application of legal concepts. Option B is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. Filing a lawsuit (A) is impractical given the relatively low value of the items (~$140) and the fact that refunds have been offered, which would likely satisfy a court's remedy.\n\n2. Demanding version A (C) is unlikely to succeed as the retailer claims they don't carry this version in Canada. Promissory estoppel might not apply here as it was a mistake rather than a deliberate promise.\n\n3. Accepting the refund and complaining to the BBB (D) won't likely result in any significant action or compensation.\n\n4. Reporting to the Competition Bureau (B) is the most effective action because:\n   - It addresses the potential violation of Canadian law regarding misleading advertising.\n   - It doesn't require significant personal investment or legal fees.\n   - It could lead to an investigation and potential fines for the company, which might deter future misleading practices.\n   - Even if individual compensation isn't achieved, it serves the broader public interest by holding the company accountable.\n\nThis option balances the practical limitations (low item value, refund already offered) with the desire for some form of action against the misleading practice.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. As explained in the documentation, the First Amendment and similar freedom of speech protections typically apply to government actions, not private entities like Apple.\n2.

(Examples: If *B* poaches a key member of *A*, or if the existence of *A* as a going concern depends entirely on its contract with *B*.)

While option A seems to align with the strict interpretation of the \"No Assignment\" clause, it would lead to an unjust outcome that effectively immunizes GiantTech from liability for its own breach.\n\nOption C is the most appropriate answer because courts have the equitable power to prevent contract terms from being used to shield a party from the consequences of its own wrongdoing. The principle of equitable assignment allows the court to bypass the \"No Assignment\" clause in situations where strict enforcement would lead to an unconscionable result.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration typically applies when unforeseen circumstances make the contract impossible to perform, not when one party's actions cause the other's dissolution.\n\nOption D, while potentially relevant, is not the best answer. Tortious interference usually involves a third party, not a party to the contract itself. Moreover, it doesn't directly address the assignment issue.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts (contract clauses, equitable doctrines, liability), applies them to a real-world scenario in the tech industry, and tests critical thinking about how courts might balance strict contract interpretation against principles of fairness and equity."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71241/can-i-send-pictures-with-copyright-to-my-friends-with-no-commercial-purposes-wit", "docs_id": 71241, "title": "Can I send pictures with copyright to my friends with no commercial purposes without breaking the law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question about copyright.

Do I break the EU's or US's laws in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically, downloading such pictures and sending them to others is copyright infringement, unless they have been released under a license which permits sharing them with others.\n\nCopyright infringement is not a crime. It is a ***tort***. That means the copyright owner can sue, if and when the owner learns this has happened, and chooses to bring a court action. As that would involve paying a lawyer, and court fees, and other expenses, most owners will not bring such a suit unless they think the damages are likely to be large enough to make it worth their time and trouble, over and above getting their expenses back. Most copyright owners would not bother to sue over personal sharing of pictures posted on the net. However, that is the choice of the owner to make, if they learn of the sharing.\n\nNote that, if instead of attaching a picture to an email, one sends a link, there is no copyright infringement involved, even technically.\n\nWhile the details of copyright laws differ in different countries, the information above is true for both the US and the EU, and most if not all other countries.\n\nOne of the ways in which copyright laws differ between countries is in the exceptions to copyright that are available. In the US there is the somewhat complex concept of \"fair use\". Being personal and non\\-commercial use does not automatically make something fair use, although it helps support a finding of fair use. Some EU countries have a specific exception for personal use. I believe that India has such an exception also. Many countries have exceptions for news reporting, use in classroom teaching, parody, and various other cases.\n\nI said above tyht copyright infringement is not a crime. That is not always true. Under [17 USC 506](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) infringement can be criminal, but **only** if the infringement is:\n\n1. willful;\n2. for private financial gain or commercial advantage; and  \n\n3A) of works valued at over $1,000, or  \n\n3B) of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, knowingly preempting such distribution by electronic posting.\n\nI believe that there are similar limits on criminal copyright infringement in the laws of other countries.\n\nBeyond that, the current policy of the US Department of Justice is to prosecute criminal copyright infringement **only** when it is done on a bulk basis, as a business. In particular, mass reproduction and sale of CDs and DVDs without permission may be prosecuted.\n\nComments point out that a plaintiff may, in the US, elect to receive statutory damages, instead of actual damages, and in that case need not prove any financial loss. This is true, but the damages may be as low as $750 per work infringed (not per copy) or as low as $200 for \"innocent infringers\". The amount is set by the court, as it thinks just.\n\nIt is also true that a US court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs, under 17 USC 505\\. But this is wholly in the court's discretion, it is in no way automatic, and I understand is typically not awarded in \"minor\" cases.

While neighbors can complain about issues, actively recruiting them to spy on tenants would likely be considered harassment or an invasion of privacy.\n\nOption C is explicitly forbidden in the documentation, which states that \"a landlord cannot enter a leased or rented property without the tenant's consent.\"\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a realistic scenario, and choose the most appropriate course of action within legal and ethical boundaries."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53019/what-is-a-family-group-as-it-pertains-to-quarantine-orders", "docs_id": 53019, "title": "What is a &quot;family group&quot; as it pertains to quarantine orders?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: New York currently has travel restrictions in place, which require individuals coming in from specific states to quarantine for 2 weeks.

Non\\-competition clauses involving lawyers are also subject to heavy professional ethics regulations not common to non\\-legal professional activities.\n\nWithout a more concrete example of what the dropservicing business model would entail, it is impossible to do a very definitive analysis.

This, to a layman, seems like a (nearly) bulletproof defence.\n\nThe one exception I can see is if a future President (e.g. President Biden) unilaterally reclassify the document at a higher level, now that President Trump no longer possesses his powers of classification under the Presidential office.\n\nThis leads to two related questions:\n\n1. If the classification level of a document has been reduced \\- so exposing this to a larger audience \\- can it later be reclassified to a higher level?\n2. Can the President or delegated power capriciously classify any document in the possession of a political rival, without him or her knowing, and cause the rival to be in breach of law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The DOJ has [a handy FAQ about declassification on their site](https://www.justice.gov/archives/open/declassification/declassification-faq). There are statutory and E.O. provisions for automatic declassification of information (I think the most common one in practice is \"historically important information after 25 years\"). Though this is subject to review and may be rejected in particular situations, dictated by much the same provisions. As for reclassifying automatically declassified information, the FAQ says:\n\n> CAN INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN AUTOMATICALLY DECLASSIFIED BE RECLASSIFIED?\n\n> Yes. Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the FOIA, Presidential Records Act, 44 USC 2204(c)(1\\), the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of E.O. 13526, only if such classification or reclassification meets the requirements of E.O. 13526, and is accomplished on a document\\-by\\-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official. Information may not be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority.\n\nSimilar provisions were detailed in [E.O. 12958](https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/appendix/12958.html).\n\nA \"proper authority\" would not include, say, leaks, like those due to Snowden. Note that, as for Trump's situation, while he most surely counted as a \"proper authority\" while President, there is no indication whatsoever that the information was also released to the public under his or any other proper authority.\n\n[A recent and somewhat controversial example of reclassification began in 1999 under the Clinton administration, as a result of aforementioned E.O. 12958, and lasted for several years after](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB179/index.htm).\n\n> To justify their reclassification program, officials at CIA and military agencies have argued that during the implementation of Executive Order 12958, President Clinton's program for bulk declassification of historical federal records, many sensitive intelligence\\-related documents that remained classified were inadvertently released at NARA, especially in State Department files. Even though researchers had been combing through and copying documents from those collections for years, CIA and other agencies compelled NARA to grant them access to the open files so they could reclassify documents.\n\nA separate article from the same link provides:\n\n> ...security officials at DOE had become concerned that the implementation of EO 12958 had led to the inadvertent release in State Department and other agency records at NARA of \"unmarked\" restricted and formerly restricted data on nuclear weapons. In the fall of 1998, Congress formally authorized the Department of Energy to remove from public document repositories any and all sensitive nuclear weapons design\\-related information pursuant to Section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, entitled \"Protection Against Inadvertent Release of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.\"\n\nThe argument the agencies seemed to advance for this reclassification is that prior declassifications had not undergone the proper equity considerations: meaning that agencies other than the ones who declassified them had an interest and say in their classification, which should not have been overlooked. While some complained about the reclassification of information that had entered the public domain\u2014the material had been on the public shelves for years, and some of it had even been published and a good deal more of it sifted through by various parties\u2014this did not seem to matter to the agencies.

You likely signed a lease that agreed that you would pay accept this practice and spelled out what ever rights you have to challenge the billings. My guess is they are as limited as the courts will allow in Florida. And the only way to ensure access to those records would be to get the court to compel they provide you with the records. \n\nPerusal of the [Water codes in Florida](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=25-30) does not appear to directly engage this practice(I could have missed it). However it appears that there is code regulating the management of electrical limits the billing to no more than the actual costs to the customer of record(probably your real estate management company.)\n\nAccording the the [NCSL](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/utility-submetering.aspx) (This refers to electrical service. I am assuming there is similar language used elsewhere for plumbing, or that the intent of the law is uniformity of these codes in all utility billings.\n\n> Where individual metering is not required and master metering is used\n>  in lieu thereof, reasonable apportionment methods, including\n>  submetering may be used by the customer of record or the owner of such\n>  facility solely for the purpose of allocating the cost of the\n>  electricity billed by the utility. The term \u201ccost\u201d as used herein\n>  means only those charges specifically authorized by the electric\n>  utility's tariff, including but not limited to the customer, energy,\n>  demand, fuel, conservation, capacity and environmental charges made by\n>  the electric utility plus applicable taxes and fees to the customer of\n>  record responsible for the master meter payments. The term does not\n>  include late payment charges, returned check charges, the cost of the\n>  customer\\-owned distribution system behind the master meter, the\n>  customer of record's cost of billing the individual units, and other\n>  such costs. Any fees or charges collected by a customer of record for\n>  electricity billed to the customer's account by the utility, whether\n>  based on the use of submetering or any other allocation method, shall\n>  be determined in a manner which reimburses the customer of record for\n>  no more than the customer's actual cost of electricity. Each utility\n>  shall develop a standard policy governing the provisions of\n>  submetering as provided for herein. Such policy shall be filed by each\n>  utility as part of its tariffs. The policy shall have uniform\n>  application and shall be nondiscriminatory (Fla. Administrative Code \u00a725\\-6\\.049\\).\n\nNow here is where the 3rd party comes in. The 3rd party is the one levying fees for the management on your landlord. Granted if you follow the strings ill bet you find that the billing company is owned by the same company that owns your rental management firm.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The clause specifically states that the subtenant (business owner) must pay \"any privilege, excise and other taxes duly assessed against the business of the Subtenant.\"\n2.

From my perspective, the fish in the river is closer conceptually to that very water, than it is to crops and fruits. It is *res nullius*, the *thing nobody owns*, and as such it is *appropriation* i.e. fishing, which creates property; it is not property before that, that I know of. So can a fee simple be based on that? Plus I read that in UK common law, a [profit a prendre](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/property/document/393788/55KG-P261-F18C-41F9-00000-00/Profits%20a%20prendre), as opposed to an easement, can only be registered if it's in respect of something which can be owned (I quote: *eg a right to take water from a spring or pump, or the right to water cattle at a pond may be an easement but cannot be a profit a prendre. Water, when taken, is not owned by anyone; nor is it part of the soil*).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an area of law that is in flux. For example, in Colorado, where I practice, the rule has changed over the last ten to thirty years. I'll provide a traditional and modern view of each.\n\nThe intermediate view and to a lesser extent the modern view, also give more weight to individualized evidence of the intent of the parties on a case by case basis, while the traditional view would be rather indifferent to the actual intent of the parties.\n\n> How do you qualify that fishing right? Is it an easement,\n>  profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre; is that a full fledged fee simple or a mere\n>  interest arising out of a contract?\n\nThe traditional view would be that this would be a profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre, also known as an \"easement in gross\" which is a property interest (since it is permanent or at least indefinite). The modern view would see it as having more similarities to an easement (or more precisely to a generic \"servitude\"). This assumes, of course, that it was not merely an expressly designated or orally created \"license\" as opposed to a property right.\n\n> Is it alienable/assignable?\n\nThe traditional view is that it is not alienable or assignable. The intermediate view is that it is alienable or assignable only if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it is alienable or assignable unless the instrument creating it expressly provides otherwise.\n\n> Does the right outlast the life of the original grantee/holder?\n\nThe traditional view is that it does not. The intermediate view is that it only does so if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it presumptively survives the life of the original grantee/holder.\n\nThe traditional view would also terminate the right upon the death of the grantor, at least if it does not expressly provide otherwise.\n\n> Can there be apportionment of the right?\n\nThe traditional view is no. The modern view is that the right can be apportioned only if this can be done without increasing the burden that the rights holder (the dominant estate) imposes on the river owner (the servient estate) and does not expand its scope. Depending upon the way that the right is formulated, this may or may not feasible.\n\nAn exclusive right for one person to fish and an exclusive right to fish exercised by thirty people impose a very different burden on the fishery, unless the thirty people are limited to the catch that one person exclusively fishing would have reasonably accomplished.\n\n> I would also like to know which American states still have a\n>  noncommercial easement in gross which is assignable, based on past\n>  precedent i.e. states which have not yet integrated Restatement\n>  (First's) in that respect (i.e. in so many words still have profits \u00e0\n>  prendre independent of the modern easement).\n\nShort of a full fledged law review article this is pretty much impossible to answer. Based on searches of similar kinds of legal issues that I've done in the past, I would guess that 40%\\-60% of states have no clear precedents on the issue one way or the other, and another 10\\-20% of the states have some precedents but those precedents are ambiguous or are so stale that it is not obvious that they would be applied if the issue was litigated today.\n\nThe remaining states would probably be split fairly evenly between the traditional and modern rules.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about easements and profits-\u00e0-prendre, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A landowner grants an exclusive right to fish in a river adjacent to their property to a local angling club through a deed of exchange. The club later dissolves, and its assets are distributed among its members. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be legally valid under the modern view of servitudes in the United States?\n\nA) The fishing right automatically terminates upon the dissolution of the club\nB) The fishing right can be equally divided among all former club members\nC) The fishing right can be sold to a single buyer, who can then restrict access to all others\nD) The fishing right reverts to the original landowner, who can then re-grant it as they see fit\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the nature of the right granted, its alienability, and apportionment. The modern view, as described in the Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes, would likely treat this fishing right as a type of servitude, similar to an easement in gross.\n\nOption A is incorrect because under the modern view, the right would not automatically terminate upon the dissolution of the original grantee. The modern approach presumes that such rights survive the original holder unless expressly stated otherwise.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the modern view may allow for some apportionment, it specifies that this can only be done if it doesn't increase the burden on the servient estate (the river owner). Dividing the right equally among all former members would likely increase this burden significantly.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. The modern view generally considers these rights to be alienable and assignable unless expressly prohibited. Selling the right to a single buyer maintains the exclusive nature of the original grant and doesn't increase the burden on the servient estate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because under the modern approach, the right doesn't automatically revert to the original landowner upon the dissolution of the grantee.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts (alienability, apportionment, and survival of rights) and application to a real-world scenario.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Service outages, maintenance announcements (option D), and security notices (option A) are typically considered essential communications related to the service contract. These can often be sent without specific consent, as they fall under the 'Contract' basis for data processing.\n\n2. Notifications about account status changes (option C) are also generally permissible without fresh consent, as they directly relate to the service the user is receiving.\n\n3. Surveys (option B) for gathering feedback, especially if they involve profiling or data collection beyond the scope of the original service, may require separate consent. The documentation states: \"you may need to rely on consent for things like profiling done under your surveys.\"\n\n4. The answer aligns with the principle that consent is not always necessary, as stated in the documentation: \"a lot of your question to me seems to fall on what are the lawful basis you are using to process the data.\" Essential service communications often fall under 'Contract' basis rather than requiring explicit consent.\n\n5. This question tests critical thinking by requiring the candidate to differentiate between communications that are essential to service delivery (which often don't require fresh consent) and those that go beyond the core service (which may require consent).\n\nThe distractors (A, C, and D) represent common types of communications that a SaaS company might send, but which are more likely to be covered under the existing service agreement or 'Contract' basis, making them less likely to require fresh consent compared to a survey."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91174/can-one-appeal-a-moot-judgement", "docs_id": 91174, "title": "Can one appeal a moot judgement?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Coming on the heels of [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91015/judgement-for-possession-when-tenant-vacated-the-premises):\n\n> It seems like the action for possession would be moot under these\n> circumstances, prohibiting the court from entering judgment.\n\n> Accordingly, we ordinarily dismiss as moot an appeal challenging an\n> eviction when the tenant was removed from or otherwise vacated the\n> premises.\n\nIf a court enters a \"moot\" judgement, can one appeal the judgement on grounds that it should have never been entered in the first place?\n\nIs a moot judgement equivalent to saying that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgement at all and therefore should be appealable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, you can appeal\n-------------------\n\nDeciding that an issue is moot is a matter of law.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The judgment, although issued when the case had become moot, is not automatically void. Courts can and sometimes do issue judgments in moot cases, which remain on the record unless challenged.\n\n2. The tenant has grounds to appeal based on mootness.

Whether or not a literal knife with a blade under 3\\.5 inches long constitutes a redefined knife, it certainly constitutes a \"dangerous instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds\".\n\nIn the context of a specific law restricting the possession of weapons (concealed or not) in schools, the context requires that the definition explicitly mentioned in 18\\-1\\-901(3\\)(e), which is outside Article 12, is being referred to. The reason the law was explicitly written to refer to *that* definition was so that the general definition in article 12 would be overridden.\n\nMy point is that this is a not atypical example of the problem of legal definitions, which can get rather convoluted. If someone has told you that a knife under 3\\.5\" is legally not a knife, you probably now know why they would say that, but also you should know what that's simply not true when it comes to weapons in school.\n\nI omitted one complication, which in this instance is not applicable, namely the kirpan exception. In [Singh v. Thompson](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/36/1102/562950/), 36 F.3d 1102, it was ruled that a prohibition against knives (in school), in that instance, violates the Free Exercise clause (the kirpan must be worn at all times). On the other hand, [TSA does forbid](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/may-i-keep-head-coverings-and-other-religious-cultural-or) taking a kirpan into the secure zone, a matter which has so far not been litigated.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A high school student is caught with a 3-inch folding knife in their backpack. The school administration is considering expulsion based on the zero-tolerance weapons policy. The student's parents argue that the knife is legal because it's under 3.5 inches. Given the legal complexities described, what is the most accurate assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The knife is legal for the student to possess in school because it's under 3.5 inches\nB) The knife is illegal in school regardless of length, but legal for concealed carry outside of school\nC) The knife is illegal in school, and the 3.5-inch rule is irrelevant for school weapon policies\nD) The knife's legality depends on whether it's classified as a hunting or fishing knife\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that the school-specific law (CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18-12-105.5(1)) defines a deadly weapon more broadly than the general concealed carry statute.\n\n2. The school law refers to the definition in section 18-1-901 (3)(e), which includes any knife capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, regardless of length.\n\n3. The 3.5-inch rule comes from the general concealed carry statute (CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18-12-101), but this is explicitly overridden in the school context.\n\n4. Even if the 3.5-inch definition were applied, the broader definition of \"knife\" includes \"any other dangerous instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds,\" which would likely include a 3-inch knife.\n\n5. The context of the school law requires a stricter interpretation for safety reasons, making the general 3.5-inch rule irrelevant in this specific situation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misapplies the 3.5-inch rule to the school context. Option B is partially correct about school illegality but misrepresents the concealed carry law. Option D introduces a potential exception that's not relevant in this scenario and wouldn't apply in a school setting anyway.

There is no really plausible exception to the requirement to pay a minimum hourly wage that would apply to someone who is an employee in this position. For example, this person could not plausible be classified as a salaried employee or manager in this scenario for FLSA purposes.\n\nYou could, of course, set a reasonable expectation regarding how much time should be allocated to reading the manual, so long as the expectation you set is indeed reasonable \\- five minutes would be unreasonably short, but 20 hours to memorize it would be unreasonably long.\n\n**Is The \"Employee\" An Independent Contractor?**\n\nIt is conceivable that the person you describe as an employee is really an independent contractor, rather than a employee, and hence not subject to minimum wage laws. \n\nFor example, you do not have a duty to determine that a catering company that serves many customers and is its own business providing food for you on an irregular basis, or a third\\-party restaurant that delivers either itself or through a third\\-party delivery service, is paying minimum wage or complying with work safety laws like OSHA, because they are independent contractors. \n\nBut, there is nothing in your question that suggests that this is the case. (Note that if this person is an \"employee\" and not an \"independent contractor\" that it is also important that you obtain worker's compensation and pay withholding taxes for your domestic employee; often this is done via a third\\-party payroll service.)\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nThe [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, et seq., requires you to pay every hourly employee the federal minimum wage, plus overtime if applicable, from \"Portal to Portal\" (i.e. from showing up to work until leaving work, because commuting time is not counted as work for purposes of the FLSA).\n\nHours worked is defined as follows by the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(o), contains no exception for time spent reading a safety manual:\n\n> In determining for the purposes of sections 206 and 207 of this title\n>  the hours for which an employee is employed, there shall be excluded\n>  any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end\n>  of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during\n>  the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice\n>  under a bona fide collective\\-bargaining agreement applicable to the\n>  particular employee.\n\nThis states with respect to employees in domestic service at 209 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(f):\n\n> Any employee\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) who in any workweek is employed in domestic service in a household\n>  shall be paid wages at a rate not less than the wage rate in effect\n>  under subsection (b) of this section unless such employee\u2019s\n>  compensation for such service would not because of section 209(a)(6\\)\n>  of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 409(a)(6\\)](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0209.htm)constitute wages\n>  for the purposes of title II of such Act \\[42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 et seq.],\n>  or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) who in any workweek\u2014\n> \n> \n> (A) is employed in domestic service in one or more households, and\n> \n> \n> (B) is so employed for more than 8 hours in the aggregate, shall be\n>  paid wages for such employment in such workweek at a rate not less\n>  than the wage rate in effect under subsection (b) of this section.\n\nThe referenced Section 206(b) is the currently effective federal minimum wage (currently $7\\.25 per hour).

This understanding came to Party B partly because, according to Party B, that is how the agreement was presented by Party A, contrary to the letter of the agreement. This understanding comes also partly from previous clients of Party A, who also considered the fixed monthly payments as flat rates that do not need settlement. These clients used the service for years, stopped using it, and never received an overview for settlement according to art.14\\.\n\nFor more than 5 years, party A ignores their obligation regarding art.14\\. and never mentions it.

Nevertheless for the purpose of this question, I am interested in what principles of law apply, especially from civil law, but I am also curious of an interpretation according to common law.\n\nI am not a legal expert, but I am familiar with some principles of laws. The above is a working example, but my general question is whether a clause in a written contract is valid and enforceable, if all parties took regular actions contrary to the clause for a very long time without any dispute. An analogy to the above situation would be a written agreement of parties that monthly, 10$ would be exchanged for a selfie, for a period of 20 years. Then 19 years pass and nobody ever sent a selfie, or 10$ in exchange, or took any action with respect to that agreement, but one party starts sending selfies (many years later) and asks for their rightful 10$.

What do the experts think?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Party A has breached the contract\n---------------------------------\n\nParty A had an obligation that it did not fulfil, providing the section\\-by\\-section overview of the costs.\n\nTo the extent that Party B suffered damage from each breach, for example, because Party A owes a refund, Party B can recover that plus interest subject to any statute of limitations on actions for contract breach. To the extent that Party A suffered damage, tough \\- they don\u2019t get to benefit from their own breach.\n\nParty A might wish to argue that Party B has [waived](https://sklawyers.com.au/dictionary/waiver/) their right to adjust the payment but this would be difficult to prove. It doesn\u2019t appear that there is an explicit waiver but neither is their an implied waiver: Party A would need to show that Party B was aware of and condoned the breach in some way.\n\nYou are right that a contract can be altered after it is entered into and that such a change can be implicit rather than explicit. But that would require showing some action rather than inaction by the parties to effect a different arrangement. In practice, where one party affirms the written contract, without clear and compelling evidence that the contract has subsequently been changed, the written contract will prevail.\n\nFor an example, Yale University periodically collects the interest due on a perpetual [bond](https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest) originally issued by the Dutch water board Lekdijk Bovendams on 15 May 1624\\.

The section does not explicitly mention the extraction or extortion of money after the act has been done.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the act of extorting money from Y by X after causing the public servant to perform a duty improperly or dishonestly could be considered as an attempt to obtain an undue advantage by X through illegal means. The court's interpretation of the section will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, and the intent of the drafters of the law.\n\nIt is important to note that the Prevention of Corruption Act is a special law that is intended to combat corruption and ensure the integrity of public servants. Therefore, the court is likely to interpret the law in a manner that upholds its objectives and prevents abuse of power.

Vijay agrees but doesn't pay Raj upfront. After Raj successfully influences the public servant and Vijay wins the contract, Raj demands payment, threatening to expose Vijay's involvement if he doesn't comply. Which of the following best describes the legal implications for Raj under Section 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act?\n\nA) Raj is not liable under Section 7A because the undue advantage was not accepted before influencing the public servant.\nB) Raj is liable under Section 7A for attempting to obtain an undue advantage, regardless of when the payment was demanded.\nC) Raj is only liable if he receives the payment from Vijay, not for the initial act of influencing the public servant.\nD) Raj's actions fall outside the scope of Section 7A because he is extorting money after the corrupt act, not inducing corruption.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of Section 7A's application in a complex, real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because Section 7A covers not only accepting or obtaining, but also \"attempting to obtain\" an undue advantage. Raj's actions of influencing the public servant with the promise of future payment, followed by demanding payment afterwards, can be interpreted as an attempt to obtain an undue advantage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the timing of the payment is not explicitly specified in the law as a determining factor. The act of influencing the public servant with the expectation of reward is the key element.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the law covers attempts to obtain an advantage, not just successful obtainment. Raj's actions in influencing the public servant and then demanding payment constitute an attempt.\n\nOption D might seem plausible but is incorrect. As a special law intended to combat corruption, courts are likely to interpret Section 7A broadly to fulfill its intent. Raj's entire course of conduct, from the initial promise through to the extortion attempt, can be seen as part of a single corrupt scheme to obtain an undue advantage.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a complex scenario, integrate multiple aspects of the law (including its broad interpretation), and analyze the implications of timing and intent in corrupt practices."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26607/business-licence-obtained-with-fraud", "docs_id": 26607, "title": "Business Licence obtained with fraud", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What are the options for a landlord when he/she finds out that the tenant has been doing a business in the house with a licence obtained fraudulently?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A government determination that a license should be issued is authoritative as to the world and typically only the government that issued it would have standing to challenge its validity.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"a government determination that a license should be issued is authoritative as to the world.\" This means that even if the license was obtained fraudulently, it's still considered valid until revoked by the issuing authority.\n\n2. The landlord doesn't have the standing to challenge the validity of the license directly. As mentioned, \"only the government that issued it would have standing to challenge its validity.\"\n\n3. The lease agreement prohibits illegal activities, but running a business with a fraudulently obtained license isn't necessarily illegal if the license hasn't been revoked.

As stated, \"Anyone can encourage a government to revoke a previously issued license on the grounds that it was obtained fraudulently, but it is up to the issuing government to decide whether to do anything about it.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the tenant isn't necessarily in breach of the lease agreement if the license, though fraudulently obtained, is still valid.

The law starts by addressing the proscribed act, which is if one (I'll get to \"one\" below, which is the crux of the matter)\n\n> intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any\n>  other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or\n>  electronic communication\n\nThe [definition of \"intercept\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2510) is\n\n> the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,\n>  electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic,\n>  mechanical, or other device.\n\nA robo\\-call is send\\-only, so that action does not acquire anything. Then the question is whether Jarvis is a \"device\". There is a specific exemption from the definition of \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\":\n\n> (b) a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal\n>  hearing to not better than normal\n\nJarvis is not covered by (b). Part (a) exempts\n\n> any telephone or telegraph instrument...furnished to the\n>  subscriber...being used by the subscriber...in the ordinary course of\n>  its business... or (ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service\n\nwhich we can assume is not the case with Jarvis (the provider does not supply the device): Jarvis is a device, and Jarvis intercepts.\n\nOne way that such interception can legally be accomplished is via consent. At the federal level, it is sufficient that one party consents, though in some states, such as Washington, all parties must consent. Assume that only the federal law is relevant. The law regarding consent says\n\n> (d) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for *a person* not\n>  acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic\n>  communication where such person is a party to the communication or\n>  where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent\n>  to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the\n>  purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the\n>  Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State.\n\nA program is not a person, so a program cannot consent. However, if we go to the very top of the law, the prohibition starts:\n\n> Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any *person*\n>  who...\n\nA program cannot violate the law (laws apply to people), at the moment.\n\nIf a program is deemed to be a legal person (either statutorily or by Supreme Court ruling), this all changes, but then Jarvis would have the capacity to consent (unless a program is deemed to be a person incapable of consent, but that would be silly because criminal law is predicated on the assumption that the actor \"consented\" to do the act).

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The AI assistant processing and analyzing the content of outgoing calls it initiates constitutes \"interception\" under 18 USC 2511. The law defines interception as \"the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\"\n\n2. The AI assistant would be considered a \"device\" under the law, as it doesn't fall under any of the exemptions mentioned (e.g., it's not a hearing aid or a telephone instrument provided by the service provider).\n\n3. The key issue is consent. Federal law requires at least one party to consent to the interception. However, the documentation states that \"A program is not a person, so a program cannot consent.\" This means the AI assistant itself cannot provide the necessary consent.\n\n4. The user's consent might not be sufficient in this case because they are not directly party to the communication - the AI is making the call on their behalf.\n\nOption A is less concerning because it deals with incoming calls, where the user could potentially provide consent. Option C, while potentially problematic from a privacy standpoint, doesn't directly relate to the wiretapping laws discussed.

Why do society more interested in protecting something I perceive as more trivial, like recording, compared to something far more substantial, like beating.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't about bullying at all, this is about Virginia being a \"one\\-party\" state. [Virginia Law 19\\.2\\-62](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title19.2/chapter6/section19.2-62/) outlines that:\n\n> B.2 It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for a person to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\n\nHowever what is not said in the article is that the daughter didn't know that the recording device was in the backpack. This means that the mother did not get consent from either party being recorded (it isn't clear that a minor could give consent anyway), and is therefore in violation of 19\\.2\\-62\\.\n\nThe (US) law has been quite clear on \"two wrongs don't make a right\", the mother was not getting satisfaction through other channels, but that does not mean she is right in violating the law in pursuit of justice. \n\n---\n\nThis is still very much in the early stages of this particular case, but I'm willing to bet that the mother will see very little if any punishment in this matter.\n\nAs for why the DA doesn't prosecute the children (or their parents) for the bullying, this really depends on what kind of bullying is subject here. If the children are verbally bullying, this may not be a crime (yes, it is morally wrong, but may not be a crime). It isn't to say though that the children in this case haven't been reprimanded according to State law, at least the subject of the bullying has been moved to a different class as a result. Unless the bullying reaches a physical level, most State laws require the schools to deal with the bullying directly (through moving children to different classes, suspensions, expelling, etc), so the DA doesn't typically get involved until physical injury occurs.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mother, frustrated by her daughter's ongoing bullying situation at school, secretly places a recording device in her daughter's backpack to gather evidence.

Which of the following best explains the legal complexities of this situation and highlights the ethical dilemma faced by law enforcement?\n\nA) The mother's actions are protected under the First Amendment as free speech, and the authorities are violating her rights by considering charges.\n\nB) The recording violates Virginia's wiretapping laws, but the evidence of bullying should supersede this violation in the interest of justice.\n\nC) The mother's actions, while well-intentioned, violate consent laws for recording, creating a situation where law enforcement must balance enforcing wiretapping statutes against addressing the underlying bullying issue.\n\nD) The school's failure to address the bullying constitutes negligence, making them the primary target for legal action rather than the mother or the bullies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation highlights the complex interplay between various legal and ethical considerations. The correct answer, C, best captures the nuanced legal and ethical challenges presented in the scenario.\n\nVirginia's wiretapping law (19.2-62) requires at least one party's consent for recording a conversation. The mother, by secretly recording without her daughter's knowledge or consent, violated this law. This puts law enforcement in a difficult position: they must uphold the wiretapping statutes, which the mother clearly violated, while also addressing the serious issue of bullying that prompted the mother's actions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while free speech is protected, secret recordings are not typically covered under this protection, especially when they violate specific laws.\n\nOption B, while capturing the ethical dilemma, is legally incorrect. The law does not typically allow the ends to justify the means in this way, adhering to the principle that \"two wrongs don't make a right.\"\n\nOption D shifts focus away from the central legal issue of the recording and oversimplifies the school's legal responsibilities in bullying cases, which are often complex and may not rise to the level of criminal negligence.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the challenging position of law enforcement, who must balance enforcing clear violations of wiretapping laws against addressing the underlying issue of bullying, which may not always constitute a clear criminal offense depending on its nature and severity.

I forget the specific term but in court you can bring in multiple points of contradiction that are all contradictory to your other arguments, but would not be contradicting to your case, because they all contradict your legal adversaries case. The example as I heard it is A man is bitten by a neighbor's Pit Bull and the man takes takes his neighbor to court for damages. The neighbor mounts his defense by saying 1\\.) I don't own that dog. 2\\.) If I did own a dog, I wouldn't own that breed of dog. 3\\.) I always keep my dogs on a leash when I take them out of the house and would pull it away before it bit someone. 4\\.) On the day in question my dog was in the kennel.\n\nIn this case, the defense would be valid because the Plaintiff would have to disprove all 4 statements, any one of which would impact the case against the neighbor. In a criminal case, the defendant doesn't have to prove his story is true, he just has to prove that the Prosecution's story isn't. In a civil case, both sides merely have to prove their story is more likely to be true than the other side's. What's more, none of those statements is contradictory, they only seem so (Neighbor doesn't own that dog (he dog sits for his sister). If he did own a dog, it would be a different breed (He doesn't like Pitt Bulls). He never takes a dog out of his house without putting a leash on the dog and maintains control of the dog (Because that's what any dog owner would do). The dog was in the kennel on the day of the incident (because for his own reasons, he can't dog sit for his sister.)).\n\nIn effect, to avoid damage, the argument of \"That's not my dog\" is to argue that the neighbor isn't the responsible party for the dog's behavior. The second argument is that the neighbor would never own a pit bull even if he did own a dog, the third would demonstrate that even when there is a dog that the neighbor is caring for, he does so in a responsible way AND the dog being in the kennel shows that the dog couldn't possibly have been the one who bit the plaintiff.\n\nWhat's more, the defendant can counter sue his neighbor for harassment, who just plain hates Pit Bulls and has been shouting at defendant for daring to care for his sister's dog even on days where the dog is not on the man's property and instantly blamed the Defendant in court without considering the possibility that there could be another Pit Bull owner in the area and their Pit Bull got loose.\n\nIn OP's case, the filing of a countersuit is just \"Hope for the Best, prepare for the worst\". They could be filing because the appellant court's decision may not come out in the window of time they have before they lose the ability to file counter claims.

The vast majority of US's international agreements are done as executive agreements, and not treaties; and the power of the executive branch to make executive agreements has been repeatedly upheld in the courts.\n\nSpecifically, there are two types of executive agreements:\n\n1. \"**Congressional\\-executive agreements**\". These are the ones that require changes to legislation to be implemented. Congress passes the needed legislation just like any other normal legislation, i.e. a majority of both houses of Congress. Most trade agreements are passed as congressional\\-executive agreements.\n2. \"**Sole executive agreements**\". These are the ones that do not require changes to legislation to be implemented. Congress is not involved at all.\n\nThis Iran nuclear agreement is a \"sole executive agreement\" because it does not require Congressional action to be implemented. (So it doesn't need to be passed by a simple majority by Congress.)\n\nThe President already has the legal authority to implement all of the US's obligations under the agreement, which are the relief of certain Iran sanctions. Some of those sanctions were implemented by the President, and which the President can remove by himself. Some of these sanctions were implemented by Acts of Congress, but those Acts specifically give the President the authority to waive them.\n\nThe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (the \"Corker bill\"), passed by Congress in May 2015, also confirms that \"It is the sense of Congress that: \\[...] this Act does not require a vote by Congress for the agreement to commence;\"\n\n---\n\nAs to your question about whether something can \"have the effect of a treaty if it's passed by a simple majority\".

Thus, the nature of the removal obligation itself contemplates knowledge or awareness of **specific infringing material**, because **expeditious removal is possible only if the service provider knows with particularity which items to remove**...\n\nThus, *actual knowledge* must be knowledge that is specific enough to allow a service provider to take action against specific infringing content. \"General\" knowledge of infringement is not specific enough to be actionable, so it cannot qualify as \"actual knowledge\". (e.g., The general knowledge, \"In the past, about 5% of the videos uploaded to our site were infringing, and we expect that trend continues into the present, so some of our videos right now are probably infringing,\" is not actionable to specific videos, so it does not quality as \"actual knowledge\".)\n\nThat ruling also clarifies the distinction between *(i)* and *(ii)*, which are respectively termed the \"actual knowledge\" provision and \"red flag\" provision:\n\n> In other words, the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or \u201csubjectively\u201d knew of specific infringement, while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement \u201cobjectively\u201d obvious to a reasonable person.\n\n---\n\nActual knowledge is different from a notification, which the service operator must respond to according to section (c)(1\\)(C) (whereas your quote is from (c)(1\\)(A)):\n\n> (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3\\), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.\n\nExpeditious removal is required in *either* event: the operator has actual knowledge of infringement, per (c)(1\\)(A)(i), ***or*** the operator gets a notification, per (c)(1\\)(C).

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. According to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(C), upon receiving a notification of claimed infringement, the service provider must respond \"expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing.\" This is required regardless of whether the service provider believes the use might be fair use.\n\n2.

So let me discuss some general principles here, but details may well be different in Germany and Turkey.\n\nYou're mixing together three very different things: trademark, copyright, and patent. \n\nCopyright protects the expression of an idea, in this case, the exact computer code, images, etc. If you didn't copy his code, the chance that you would coincidentally write identical code is remote. The fact that you both have a line of code that says `x=x+1` wouldn't give him any grounds for a lawsuit. He'd have to show substantial portions of the code were identical. If you didn't deliberately copy his code, this isn't going to happen. Barring some extraordinary and unbelievable coincidence, you can't violate copyright accidentally.\n\nTrademark protects names and symbols used to identify a company or a product. If you decided to call your software company \"Microsoft\", then that other Microsoft could sue you for trademark infringement. Likewise if you copied somebody else's logo or other distinctive graphics. This is very different from copyright. It is quite possible to violate someone's trademark accidentally. Especially if he gave his company or product a rather generic name. Like if someone called his product, say, \"Password Manager\", someone else might make a product with the same name without ever having heard of the original. Ditto if he has some simple logo or other graphics. If you did accidentally duplicate a name or graphic elements, well, in the US a court would likely order you to change your name or graphics and that would be the end of it, unless you refused, in which case you'd end up in court. US Courts have ruled that very generic names have limited trademark protection. An example I saw recently was \"Main Street Auto Repair\". A court said that the owner of that name could prevent someone else from opening a shop in the same town with the same name, but he couldn't sue someone in another town who happened to use the same name. This is why, by the way, companies often use made\\-up words for their product names. In your case, this should be a trivial issue. If he is claiming trademark to the look of the main menu screen, just change the colors or move some buttons around. If it actually went to court, you should be able to argue that the similarity was accidental and when you were informed you promptly changed it, and that should be the end of it. Depending, I guess, on how hard\\-nosed the judge is, etc.\n\nPatents are different still. A patent gives the owner the exclusive right to use an invention or process for a specified period of time. It doesn't matter if you invented the same thing entirely independently. Whoever filed the patent first has exclusive rights. There have been cases where an inventor lost out to someone with a similar invention because he submitted his patent application one day later. If this other person has patents that you are infringing, you are pretty much out of luck.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A German app developer receives a trademark infringement claim from a Turkish developer regarding a similar app. Both apps provide the same core functionality, have similar names, and share some UI elements, but were independently created. The German app was released in 2017, while the Turkish app was released in 2015. Both are distributed on the Google Play store.

The most appropriate action is to modify the app's name and UI elements to differentiate it from the Turkish app, while maintaining its core functionality. This approach addresses several key points:\n\n1. Trademark issues: The similar names and UI elements could potentially be grounds for trademark infringement, even if accidental. By modifying these elements, the German developer can reduce the risk of infringement.\n\n2. Independent creation: Since the German developer created the app independently, there's likely no copyright infringement. Changing the superficial elements (name, UI) while keeping the core functionality acknowledges this fact.\n\n3. International considerations: With apps distributed globally through the US-based Google Play store, it's important to respect potential trademark claims from other countries. Modifying the app shows good faith in addressing the Turkish developer's concerns.\n\n4. Industry standard: The documentation mentions 40+ apps with similar functionality and names, indicating a crowded market. Differentiation through UI and name changes can help the app stand out while avoiding legal issues.\n\n5. Balanced approach: This solution allows the German developer to continue offering their app without completely overhauling it or facing potential legal action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because international trademark laws can still apply, especially when distribution is global. Option B is an overreaction that unnecessarily harms the German developer's business. Option D is aggressive and likely unproductive, as the German developer's app came later and shares similarities with the Turkish app.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts (trademark, copyright, patent), consideration of international factors, and application to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "63": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91328/what-does-florida-state-law-say-regarding-probate-in-real-estate-transactions", "docs_id": 91328, "title": "What does Florida state law say regarding probate in real estate transactions?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does Florida state law require that an estate go into probate in the event the seller in a real estate transaction passes away prior to closing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does Florida state law require that an estate go into probate in the\n> event the seller in a real estate transaction passes away prior to\n> closing?\n\nYes, if the seller is the owner of the property which is not in joint tenancy with right of survivorship or something similar (such as a transfer on death deed).\n\nA will is meaningless until it has been admitted to probate (which is a term that in the narrow sense means \"validating the authenticity and validity of a will). Likewise, an adjudication that someone had no will cannot be made without a probate proceeding. There is no exception for a clear an uncontested will. \"Will\" means \"probate\" pretty much by definition.\n\nThis doesn't mean, however, that the closing of the property has to waive until the probate proceeding including a full administration of the probate estate and closing of the probate estate is required. Often, a will can be admitted to probate and an executor can be appointed to manage the estate in a matter of a few weeks to a few months if there is no contest to either the validity of the will or the appointment of a particular person as an executor.\n\nGenerally, once the executor is appointed in the probate case, the real estate closing can go forward, sometimes with some additional uncontested motion practice. Once the property is sold, the proceeds are put in an estate bank account pending further administration of the estate's assets and liabilities. Indeed, even if the will is contested, as long as a consensus can be reached among the interested parties regarding who the executor should be, the real estate closing could go forward despite the fact that the will is contested.\n\nPowers of attorney are sometimes granted to real estate agents to complete a transaction in the event of a seller's incapacity. But powers of attorney are void no later than the point at which the person with the power of attorney learns of the death. (The common law rule was that a power of attorney was void at the moment of death, even if no one involved in the transaction knew that fact yet.)\n\nThe only person with authority to sign the deed to sell the property, if the property is titled in the name of the seller individually, with no co\\-owner (or with a tenant\\-in\\-common co\\-owner), is the probate estate's executor.\n\nThe real estate contract is a claim in the probate estate, which the probate estate is required to carry out if it is able to do so.

However, the will does not specifically designate\n> who inherits the property/deed.\n\nThis is an instruction regarding who inherits the property. It means that the executor of the probate estate (in an official capacity), who takes title by operation of law upon appointment, is directed to sell the property rather than to distributed it in kind.\n\n> Will there be legal or financial problems with a foreign executor?\n\nNot necessarily. Generally, the main issue is that a foreign executor must sign a document expressly submitting to the jurisdiction of the probate court when appointed in addition to other documents that are signed by all executors.\n\n> Pre\\-death, in the will, would it be better to designate the American\n> resident offspring as executor?\n\nNot necessarily. Hands on administration of the estate and dealing face to face with a local probate lawyer is easier for a resident of the state where the assets are located and the decedent resides, but in these days of telecommunications this isn't a decisive factor. The relative competencies of the prospective executors is more important.\n\n> If both offspring agreed, can the overseas offspring easily transfer\n> executorship to the American offspring, or will there be legal or\n> financial consequences?\n\nAssuming that they are the only interested parties in the estate, they can do so. You can't be compelled to serve as an executor just because you are nominated by a will to do so. If one person declines to serve, the person with next highest priority which would likely be the other sibling, may apply to the probate court to be appointed. The main financial consequence is that typically, whoever does the job is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate for their services.\n\n> Would there be legal or financial deed ownership issues, since neither\n> offspring specifically inherited the property?\n\nNo.\n\n> Could a court order the property to be auctioned out from under the\n> offspring?\n\nIf all interested parties agree, they can defy the will. The normal process, however, is for the executor to follow the will and to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, typically by engaging a real estate agent to handle the sale. If the executor fails to take action, and an interested party objects, it would be more common for a probate court to remove the executor and appoint another one, than to order a sale at auction, which would typically be a course of last resort.\n\nThis said, under appropriate circumstances, the court of probate jurisdiction would have authority to order an auction of the house. Most commonly, a court order to sell a decedent's house at auction would arise when the decedent (i.e. the dead guy) only owned an undivided partial interest in the house (called a tenancy in common interest) and the non\\-deceased third party co\\-owner of the house (perhaps a brother or ex\\-wife of the decedent) declined to cooperate in selling it.\n\n> If a court determines the overseas executor offspring receives the\n> property deed, the overseas executor wants to remain executor but give\n> deed to American offspring for easier selling of the property, would\n> the property have to go through titling and closing costs for the\n> transfer, and then again for property sale to a third party?\n\nThis question reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about how probate works. Title to the property vests in the estate by operation of law upon the death of the decedent. The executor has authority, once appointed, to take actions such as signing a deed to a third\\-party buyer, on behalf of the estate. There is no intermediate closing and transfer of title to vest title to the property of the decedent in the name of the estate before it goes from the estate to the third party. The net proceeds of the sale to the third party (after costs of sale and prorations of things like property taxes and prepaid insurance) are then placed in a bank account for the estate and paid to the heirs after expenses of administration are paid.\n\nThere is nothing that makes it significantly harder for an overseas executor to close than a domestic one. The title company handling the sale emails the deed (and any other paperwork that needs to be signed) to the executor. The executor prints the documents to be signed, signs the non\\-notarized documents, and signs the deed in the presence of his friendly neighborhood notary in the foreign country where the executor lives, who notarizes the deed. The executed deed, together with a document called an apostille proving that the notary is really a notary, is sent back to the title company (probably with a scanned copy by email and a hard paper copy following by express delivery). Coordinating time zones may be a pain depending on the location of the particular foreign country in question (but the closing does not have to happen for all parties at exact the same time), and if the overseas executor is someplace primitive and remote with no internet access or computers or printers or faxes and no notaries, that could be a problem.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The will's instruction to sell the property and split proceeds is sufficient to designate inheritance, contrary to what the question might imply as a potential issue.\n\n2. There's no inherent legal problem with a foreign executor, so transferring executorship (option A) is unnecessary and would add complexity.\n\n3. Giving the deed to the local sibling before selling (option B) misunderstands how probate works. The estate, not individual heirs, holds title until sale.\n\n4.

For example, if a treaty required that Canada make certain things illegal, then the legislature would have to pass legislation making that thing illegal to make Canada compliant with its treaty obligations.\n\nApproving a new NATO member wouldn't affect domestic law at all, as there is no bill the legislature would need to pass to implement it. It would effect military operations, but the executive branch already has the power to decide military strategy (the King is the commander\\-in\\-chief of the military, he delegated those powers to the governor general, and the governor general by convention only acts on the advice of the Cabinet).\n\nNote that unlike many other countries (such as the US), the Canadian constitution is mostly silent on the topic of international treaties, only mentioning treaties agreed to by the UK on behalf of Canada (at the time the constitution was written, Canada couldn't agree to treaties itself), so there are no constitutional requirements for the legislative branch to approve any treaties.\n\nAlso note that treaty implementing legislation is almost always passed, since the executive branch needs to maintain the support of a majority of the legislature.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, \"the treaty-making process is controlled by the executive branch of the federal government\" in Canada. This means the executive can ratify international agreements without formal Parliamentary approval.\n\n2. However, the documentation also notes that \"Parliament is often responsible for passing legislation to implement international treaties at the federal level.\" In this case, changes to domestic labor laws would require legislative action.\n\n3. The question presents a scenario that requires \"significant changes to domestic labor laws,\" which clearly falls under the category of implementing legislation that Parliament must pass.\n\n4. This answer choice accurately reflects the division of powers: the executive can enter into the agreement, but cannot unilaterally change domestic laws to comply with it.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests Parliament must approve the agreement itself, which is not required in Canada.

One of them might be that the content could not itself be unlawful, another that the DS has all needed rights to submit the content for creation of a modified version, yet another that the service could not be used for any unlawful purpose.\n\nHowever, other GDPR provisions would also apply.

The correct answer, C, is the most comprehensive approach that addresses several key GDPR requirements:\n\n1. It establishes a lawful basis for processing under Article 6(1)(b) by creating a contract between the data controller (April) and the data subject (user).\n2. It allows for specific disclosures required by Article 13, including the purpose and lawful basis of processing, retention periods, and user rights.\n3.

Let's break down each option:\n\nA) While this clause attempts to comply with the 30-day rule for charging late fees, it still violates the law. The documentation states that a landlord cannot charge interest or a penalty on late rent until 30 days after the due date. This implies that the rent must be 30 days overdue before any late fee can be applied, not just that the fee can't be charged until then.\n\nB) This clause violates the law against reverse penalty clauses. The documentation explicitly states that it's illegal for a landlord to reduce the rent if paid early, which is exactly what this clause proposes.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. The documentation clearly states that \"the landlord can begin the eviction process immediately, even if the rent is only one day overdue.\" This clause aligns perfectly with that provision.\n\nD) This clause violates the 30-day rule for late fees. Any fee for late payment, regardless of what it's called, cannot be charged until 30 days after the due date.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the given legal information to real-world scenarios, requiring integration of multiple concepts (late fees, eviction rules, and reverse penalty clauses) and critical thinking about how these laws would be applied in practice.

The prosecutor's office reviews evidence submitted by the police, and decides whether to file charges. A prosecutor has wide discretion to proceed with or drop a case. The prosecutor may direct the police to make further investigation if additional evidence is needed or wanted. The decision to file charges will be based on the seriousness of the matter, and on the prosecutor's judgement as to whether a conviction can be obtained, and the available resource of the office. Political factors may come into play.\n6. There may be a grand jury proceeding to review the evidence and produce an indictment. The Grand Jury can hear witnesses. Usually its proceedings and the list of witnesses are tightly controlled by the prosecutor. It has been famously said that any half\\-way competent prosecutor can get a Grand jury to \"indite a ham sandwich\". However, the Grand Jury has the power to push inquiry in directions not approved by the prosecutor, although this is quite rarely done in practice. In some states a \"preliminary hearing\" may be held instead. In either case the question is whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, and that the defendant(s) committed it. If the crime is a misdemeanor then the prosecutor can file charges without a Grand Jury or a preliminary hearing.\n7. Charges are filed with the court that has jurisdiction. The defendant(s) may be arrested, or agree to attend court. The defendant(s) will appear to respond to the formal charges, usually with a \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" plea.\n8. The Judge of the court will set the schedule for further proceedings, including a trial if things get that far. The defense may ask the Judge to dismiss the charges, which the Judge may do if they do not appear to be legally well founded.\n\nThis process could stop at any stage, and several people have authority to determine if it proceeds or not. The senior police officer(s), involved, the prosecutor, and eventually the judge all can halt the process, at one point or another.\n\nAs was mentioned in a comment by Paul Johnson , the supreme court in the case of [*Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) has significantly limited prosecutions for incitement to situations involving speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action\". Otherwise the protections under the First Amendment to the US Federal Constitution protect the speech and prevent any prosecution. Prior to that case the case of [*Schenck v. United States*, 249 U.S. 47 (1919\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) allowed prosecution for speech that \"creates a clear and present danger\". The very well\\-known passage is:\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.\n\nWhether prosecution in a given case is allowed under the First Amendment is a question of law for the Judge and perhaps for an appeals court. But I doubt that the reported speech would pass the *Brandenburg* test or even the earlier \"clear and present danger\" test. If not, no valid prosecution could be brought.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A prominent political figure makes a controversial statement at a rally, urging supporters to \"fight like hell\" against election results. A local prosecutor is considering pursuing charges for incitement. Given the legal precedents and prosecution process in the US, what is the most critical factor in determining whether this case should proceed to formal charges?\n\nA) The number of complaints received from the public about the statement\nB) The political affiliation of the speaker and the local prosecutor\nC) Whether the statement meets the Brandenburg test for incitement\nD) The amount of media coverage the statement receives\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most critical factor in determining whether to pursue charges in this case is whether the statement meets the Brandenburg test for incitement. As explained in the documentation, the Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio significantly limited prosecutions for incitement to situations involving speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\"\n\nThis test is more stringent than the earlier \"clear and present danger\" standard from Schenck v. United States. The Brandenburg test requires that the speech be both intended to cause imminent lawless action and be likely to actually produce such action. This is a high bar to clear and is designed to protect First Amendment rights while still allowing prosecution of genuinely dangerous incitement.\n\nThe other options are less relevant or appropriate:\nA) While public complaints might trigger an initial investigation, they don't determine the legal basis for prosecution.\nB) Political affiliations shouldn't influence the decision to prosecute, as this would be an abuse of the legal system.\nC) Media coverage, while it might increase public pressure, doesn't affect the legal standards for prosecution.\n\nThe prosecutor would need to carefully evaluate whether the statement, in context, meets the Brandenburg test before deciding to file formal charges. This evaluation would likely occur during steps 4-5 of the prosecution process outlined in the documentation, where the police and prosecutor's office review the evidence and decide whether to file charges based on legal standards and the likelihood of conviction."}, "78": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13656/can-a-statement-be-defamatory-if-it-is-damaging-out-of-context", "docs_id": 13656, "title": "Can a statement be defamatory if it is damaging &quot;out of context?&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose someone said that I was \"telling lies\" at the bridge table.

Will that defense shield the business from any liability?\n\nEssentially, what the question drives at is whether there is any sense in a warrant canary in principle. If a business is *never* liable for lying in its warrant canary, then how can one possibly trust a warrant canary at all?\n\nRelated: [What is the legal status of \"warrant canaries\"?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/268/what-is-the-legal-status-of-warrant-canaries)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A warrant canary has always been a somewhat legally questionable technique. Australia, for one, has made them illegal in certain kinds of cases, passing laws that forbid disclosing the \"existence or non\\-existence\" of certain types of warrants issued to a subject. (See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary#Usage).)\n\nHowever, in the US, an order to falsely update an existing canary would probably fall afoul of the prohibition on compelled speech stated in *West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette* (the 2nd flag salute case) and *Wooley v. Maynard* (state cannot mandate a motto on a license plate that some find offensive). The case of *New York Times Co. v. United States* (the Pentagon papers case) might also be relevant.\n\nHowever, before asking if a government order would shield a business from liability for falsely updating a canary, one must fist ask if they would have any liability in any case. It is generally not a crime, or even a tort, to make a false statement unless it is under circumstances where the statement constitutes fraud.\n\nTo prevail, a plaintiff A would need to show that it reasonably relied on the statement from B, and suffered measurable damage from that reliance. It would also need to show that the person or firm B falsely updating the canary knew or should have known that the statement was likely to be relied on, and possibly that B intended A to rely on the false statement to A's detriment.\n\nIt is hard to see what actionable damage to A this might include, as being discovered in unlawful acts is not actionable.\n\nIf a court did rule that A was damaged by B's false statement, then the question of a government order might be raised. In general it is a defense against a civil lawsuit that one was complying with a valid law or government regulation or order. Of course, this could raise the further question of whether such an order was valid, which might have different results in different jurisdictions.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn short, this is a situation untested in any actual court case that I know of, and not highly likely to be tested any tiem soon.

If customers discover this deception and file a class-action lawsuit, which legal principle is MOST likely to be central to the court's decision?\n\nA) First Amendment protections against compelled speech\nB) Tort law principles of fraud and reasonable reliance\nC) Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination\nD) Contract law principles of breach of implied warranty\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While this scenario involves multiple complex legal issues, the most central principle to a potential lawsuit would likely be tort law principles of fraud and reasonable reliance. Here's why:\n\n1. First Amendment (Option A): While relevant to the government's ability to compel false speech, this is more about the relationship between the government and TrustGuard, not directly about customer damages.\n\n2. Tort law (Option B): This is the most relevant because:\n   - The case hinges on whether customers can claim damages from relying on false information.\n   - As stated in the documentation, a plaintiff would need to show they \"reasonably relied on the statement\" and \"suffered measurable damage from that reliance.\"\n   - The company's knowledge and intent regarding the false statement are key elements in establishing fraud.\n\n3. Fifth Amendment (Option C): This is not directly relevant to the scenario, as it pertains to self-incrimination in criminal cases, not civil liability.\n\n4. Contract law (Option D): While there might be implied agreements between the company and customers, the warrant canary is more of a public statement than a contractual obligation, making tort law more applicable.\n\nThe documentation specifically mentions that for a plaintiff to prevail, they would need to show reasonable reliance and measurable damage, which are core concepts in tort law related to fraud.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. Patent infringement is not a concern here. As stated in the documentation, LEGO's patents on their brick design have expired \"a long time ago.\" This means other companies are free to produce similar interlocking brick toys without violating patents.\n\n2. The different size and incompatibility of the new toy with LEGO bricks are irrelevant to patent protection.

LEGO actively pursues legal action against companies that use their name or imply compatibility with LEGO products.

The statement about being \"compatible with leading brick toys\" could also be problematic if it's interpreted as implying compatibility with LEGO specifically.\n\n5.

You need to contact the copyright holder to get permission (and a license). That may be the authors themselves, or a journal if they have assigned the copyright to it.\n\nHowever, it might be more complicated, especially for commercial use. Since the authors of papers frequently use images created by others, sometimes correctly and sometimes not, you should explore a bit more. Perhaps the paper itself will have a citation of the figure and an indication of its source, and hence of its copyright holder. In that case, the authors may not be able to help you, since, at best, they probably also hold just a license. \n\nHowever, for some *academic* purposes and in some jurisdictions an academic work can be permitted to use a figure (or other things) without regard to copyright. This is called *fair use* and it varies around the world. But a commercial work won't be able (probably) to depend on the same exception to copyright law and you still have to find the copyright holder. \n\nMoreover, even if the authors have a proper license (explicitly), that license (a) may not be transferrable and (b) might be for non\\-commercial use only. \n\nAcademic copyright holders often (not universally) issue their work under a fairly permissive license but that is restricted to non\\-commercial use. Since they hold the copyright they can also issue additional licenses against it if they like, but need to do so explicitly. \n\nUltimately, to use the work of others you have to deal with the copyright question. It is further complicated by the fact that a figure may be considered under the law as a \"complete work\" even if it appears within another work. So, replicating it is less likely to fall under fair use rules \\- though they vary. \n\n---\n\nAnd, there is one other question you should ask yourself. Is your talk really a commercial use?

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. While Korematsu has never been officially overturned, it is \"generally regarded as a mistake\" and not considered good law by most legal experts.\n\n2. The documentation states that the \"general consensus of legal opinion\" is that the precedent would be reversed if a similar case arose.\n\n3. Given this consensus, it's unlikely that a modern court would rely on Korematsu to uphold a similar mass detention.\n\n4. However, courts typically avoid overturning precedents unless absolutely necessary. As mentioned, \"Interpreting law and setting precedent is incidental to that primary purpose\" of resolving disputes.\n\n5. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the court would find a way to strike down the detention on other grounds (e.g., violation of due process, equal protection) without directly addressing or overruling Korematsu.\n\nOption A is incorrect because modern courts are unlikely to view Korematsu as binding given its widespread criticism. Option B is possible but less likely, as courts generally prefer to decide cases on narrower grounds when possible. Option D is unlikely given the shift in legal opinion since Korematsu and increased scrutiny of national security justifications for civil rights violations.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal principles to a new scenario, understand the nuances of precedent and judicial decision-making, and critically analyze the current status of a controversial legal decision."}, "84": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81455/could-congress-ban-abortion", "docs_id": 81455, "title": "Could Congress ban abortion?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Could Congress override state laws and constitutions and pass a nationwide abortion ban?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably\n--------\n\nOr they could pass a law prohibiting bans.\n\nSince the provision of abortions is a commercial enterprise that affects interstate commerce, the Federal government probably has jurisdiction through the Commerce Clause.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Congress's potential ability to override state laws regarding abortion, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A conservative-majority Congress is considering passing a nationwide abortion ban.

The correct answer is C because the songwriter holds full copyright on the new song, including its chord progression. This is based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Chord progressions themselves are not protected by copyright. The documentation states that \"musical chord progressions are not protected if someone writes a new melody over the chords.\"\n\n2. Any common chord progression is likely already in the public domain. The answer notes that \"any remotely musical chord progression has already been invented and is now in the public domain.\"\n\n3. Copyright protection applies to the specific performance or recording of a song, not the underlying chord progression. The documentation mentions that \"You could copyright your particular performance of that chord progression, but the underlying composition that you are performing would be in the public domain already.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because using a chord progression from classical music does not constitute infringement, as chord progressions are not copyrightable.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the producer cannot claim partial ownership based solely on the use of a pre-existing chord progression, which is not protected by copyright.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the chord progression itself might be in the public domain, the new song as a whole (with its unique melody and lyrics) is not.

The most significant risk likely stems from the potential classification of this practice as an unlicensed banking activity.\n\nThe company is essentially accepting deposits from customers, which they can withdraw at any time.

Since the federal government doesn't get to totally write the law for everything, the FAA applies only to transactions covered by the Commerce Clause. As a result of [Allied\\-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.

Option C is the most viable approach because it doesn't directly challenge the arbitration clause. Instead, it leverages a government agency's power to investigate and penalize illegal practices. The FTC has the authority to address deceptive business practices and privacy violations, potentially leading to fines and mandated changes in company behavior without being bound by the arbitration agreement between the company and its users.\n\nThis approach also aligns with the question in the documentation about finding a way to address the issue without being a plaintiff in a class action, as the FTC's action could result in broader remedies for affected consumers."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19540/laws-regarding-fictitious-public-figures-or-celebrities-likenesses-etc", "docs_id": 19540, "title": "Laws regarding fictitious public figures or celebrities/likenesses/etc.?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We can already make simple the laws regarding the common scapegoating or scandalous nature of living, human public figures and/or celebrities.\n\nWhat exactly do laws state about public figures/celebrities that have no immediate, human likeness associated with them? For example, think the [muppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets), a famous set of characters which are famous, representative of personalities, but are **not real living human beings**.\n\nIf a muppet were to be subjected to scrutiny, is the muppet responsible? Is the ventriloquist responsible? Who answers to a muppet if a muppet may not be the work or being of one person?\n\nAlas, what are laws that subject famous characters/personalities/etc. which are not immediate, living humans? Some people run super famous Twitter/social media accounts that represent some visage, likeness or purported being, that of which may not actually be subjected to a real, specific human. As an example, think of a social media account of someone like Elmo, The Annoying Orange, or etc.\n\nMany people can run the account and as such their image or likeness can vary to the public.\n\nWho is responsible though? Assuming we already established that a non\\-human can still be a public figure or celebrity, who is ultimately responsible for the actions of a fictional or semi\\-fictional person?\n\nAlso, what about a smart agent or robot that does machine learning and threatens to kill a major figure, like an official? The programmer didn't do this \\-\\- the program \"learned\" words and made that threat via social media/etc. In short, the program COULD in theory be wholly responsible.\n\nThis same analogy can apply to a semi\\-fictional figure that may not be wholly dictated by the control or means of a human being, or the likeness of one human being either.\n\nBy \"semi\" I mean someone who can partially represent themselves in the form of another likeness/entity they may have made up, but do not fully represent their real personality to such likeness? For example, I could pretend to be \"Joe Shaqqa\" and use part of my personality to do so, but do not consider myself to be \"Joe Shaqqa\" and do not associate my real image with this fictional, famous character.

The account is jointly managed by a team of marketing professionals from different companies. In determining legal liability for the harmful content, which of the following is the most accurate assessment?\n\nA) The fictional character \"Zappy the Electric Eel\" bears primary legal responsibility as a public figure\nB) The individual team member who wrote the specific post is solely liable for the content\nC) Legal responsibility is shared equally among all individuals who have access to manage the account\nD) The companies employing the marketing team members could be held jointly liable for the actions of the fictional character\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the legal principles discussed in the documentation. The key point is that fictional characters are creations of persons (natural or legal) and the 'acts' of fictional characters are attributed to those who own or control them. In this case, the fictional character \"Zappy\" is managed by a team from multiple companies, making it a complex scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fictional characters themselves cannot bear legal responsibility. Option B oversimplifies the situation by placing blame solely on one individual, which doesn't align with the shared management described. Option C suggests equal individual responsibility, which doesn't account for the corporate involvement.\n\nOption D is the most accurate because it recognizes that the companies employing the team members could be held jointly liable. This aligns with the principle that those who control the fictional character (in this case, the companies through their employees) are responsible for its actions. It also accounts for the complexity of multiple entities being involved in managing the character, reflecting a real-world scenario where corporate responsibility for social media management of fictional personas can become a legal issue."}, "94": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94387/is-it-possible-for-a-witness-to-backtrack-and-claim-that-their-previous-statemen", "docs_id": 94387, "title": "Is it possible for a witness to backtrack and claim that their previous statements were wrong because they misremembered?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One of the Youtube channels I'm following is running a series of videos about an ongoing lawsuit (within reason, of course).

The top answer clearly states that the book author \"has no right to use the text from the article unless permission has been granted by the holder of the copyright in that article.\" The concept of \"innocent infringement\" doesn't apply here as the author is now on notice of potential infringement.\n\n2. Immediately ceasing all publication and destroying copies (B) is an extreme reaction that may not be necessary and could cause undue economic harm. It doesn't allow for the possibility that the confession might be false or that a fair use argument could be made.\n\n3. Removing the cited text and republishing while investigating (C) is the most balanced approach. It shows good faith effort to comply with copyright law by removing the potentially infringing content, while also taking steps to verify the true copyright status. This aligns with the responsibility mentioned in the answer: \"It is the book author's responsibility not to use other people's work unless it is in the public domain or permission has been granted in some way.\"\n\n4.
