        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Montgomery County, Texas, a 16-year-old is outside at 11:30 PM on a weeknight. Under which of the following circumstances would they NOT be in violation of the county curfew ordinance?\n\nA) Standing on the public sidewalk in front of a friend's house, with the friend's parents inside the house\nB) Sitting in their car parked on a public street, listening to music\nC) Walking home from their part-time job at a local restaurant\nD) Playing basketball in the driveway of their own home\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) This would violate the curfew. While the ordinance allows minors to be on the sidewalk abutting their own residence or a next-door neighbor's (if the neighbor doesn't complain), it doesn't extend this exemption to friends' houses.\n\nB) This would violate the curfew as the minor is in a public place (a public street) during curfew hours without a valid exemption.\n\nC) While returning home from employment is generally exempt, the question doesn't specify that the minor is going directly home. Without the \"without any detour or stop\" qualification, this could still be a violation.\n\nD) This is the correct answer. The curfew only applies to public places or establishments. A minor's own home, including the driveway, is private property and not subject to the curfew restrictions.\n\nThe key here is understanding that the curfew applies to public spaces, not private property, and recognizing the specific exemptions provided in the ordinance."

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The non-profit exception in COPPA primarily affects the government's ability to prosecute, not the overall obligation to comply.\n2.

Even if the website doesn't currently collect personal information, having COPPA compliance measures in place is a best practice for any website that could potentially attract children under 13.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because non-profit status alone doesn't guarantee exemption.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **tl;dr: How do courts redress jury decisions when evidence of jury bias is present?**\n\nExample case I know from Georgia: victim hit by a drunk driver. The players and timeline below. \n\nPlaintiff (victim) is a female of a different race of the jury as was her attorney. The victims had an attorney who asked her to increase the percent of the award under the contract because he needed help getting the case settled. That lawyer told her she would have a team of two working on the case. The first lawyer wound up not working on the case after she agreed to the increase and he essentially handed the case to the other attorney. The victim had documents proving medical visits, lost wages, and medical bills. \n\nThe defendant (drunk driver) had numerous attorneys appointed by the insurance agency that extended the case out over six years. The last lawyer was a female of the same race as the jury. The defendant, the drunk driver, did not appear in court. The defendant never spent a dime on legal fees and never showed up in court. The insurance company paid for an attorney to represent her; the insurance company could not be mentioned during the hearing.\n\nThe attorney for the victim offers a settlement to the insurance company. The settlement was for the legal limit of $25K under GA law. At the hearing, he requested a judgement of $80k.\n\nThe defendant's insurance company attorney counters the offer for $12K in writing before the hearing and $15k the day of trial. The first written offer refers to a legal code that would make the plaintiff pay the legal fees if the Jury does not award at least 75% of the offer. \n\nNeither party accepted the other's offer to settle.\n\nThe jury was composed entirely of a different race than the plaintiff; it had all women except for one male and was not a diversified group. \n\nThe jury asked a question because some invoices were not attached to a statement and wanted to impeach the victim's testimony. (Note: the total amount of the medical expenses and individual bills were listed on the statement.) Victim's attorney objected and motioned jury bias based on that question, which was denied by the judge. The jury ruled in favor for the victim with an award of only $500\\. My research shows that investigate questions by a jury and trying to impeach a witness does show bias but I could not find the code, only legal articles.\n\nThe victim felt that was an inadequate amount and wanted to appeal the decision. The victim's attorney refused to file an appeal or any motions that the victim requested stating that judges almost never overturn a jury's verdict. The victim wanted to file a motion on her behalf. She was not able to file the motion because she was under contract with her attorney and if she fired him she was liable for all of his fees. The lawyer informed her that the verdict has made her obligated to pay the insurance company back their legal fees. (Note: The victim did not file a lawsuit against the insurance company she filed a lawsuit against the drunk driver.)\n\nMy research shows that you can file a motion for the judge to give a Judgement notwithstanding a verdict and additur the amount of the award. There were numerous reasons this would be allowed jury bias was one of them. Jury prejudice is another.\n\nThe final settlement was the victim take the $500 and not file an appeal; both attorneys threatened her with the obligation to pay their legal fees if she did anything else. I could not find anything that allowed the victim out of the contract with her attorney and to act on her own behalf without being obligated to pay her lawyer his legal fees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no legal requirement that a jury be composed of people demographically like the defendant (or the plaintiff), there is simply a requirement that the selection process give all kinds of people an equal chance at being empaneled. So being a different race or gender from one of the parties is not prima facie evidence of a biased jury.\n\nThe statement that \"The jury asked a question because some invoices were not attached to a statement and wanted to impeach the victim's testimony\" is somewhat puzzling, since Georgia is widely cited as a state where jurors are forbidden to ask questions. Let us suppose though that jurors manage to communicate an interest in knowing a fact, such as \"Do you have an invoice for X?\", then the judge could decide whether that is a proper question. At that point, it moves from being a jury matter to a legal judge matter, and if the question was itself highly prejudicial, the case could be overturned on appeal. Alternatively, the way in which the question was framed by the jury could be proof of bias, e.g. \"Please ask that lying %@!^\\* defendant to prove her ridiculous story\". The defense attorney has entered an objection (if you don't object, you can't appeal), and perhaps if the question was legally improper then the verdict could be set aside. If the attorney failed to move for mistrial (if the question proves blatant bias) then that's the end of the matter, except for a possible action against the attorney.\n\nThe implied questions about attorney conduct are hard to understand. An attorney may refuse to engage in a futile legal act, but this does not preclude an individual from seeking another attorney to file a motion or even attempting to file a motion on one's own (which is probably a futile act). However, I also assume that the victim did not have her own attorney and that this was a case between two insurance companies *about* individuals \u2013 a third party claim. In this case, the attorney represents the insurance company, not the victim, and has to be responsible to the interests of the insurance company. The attorney thus is obligated to not cost the insurance company a packet of money if there is no realistic chance of getting anything in return. The alternative would have been be to engage (and pay) your (her) own attorney.",

This allows the judge to review the evidence and potentially adjust the verdict if it's found to be against the weight of evidence or influenced by improper factors such as bias.\n\nC) is incorrect because while jury diversity is important, there is no legal requirement for a jury to match the demographic composition of the plaintiff or defendant. Demanding a new trial solely on these grounds is unlikely to be successful.\n\nD) is incorrect because while jury decisions are indeed rarely overturned, there are legal mechanisms in place to address potentially biased or unreasonable verdicts.

How can I get the sidewalk gates taken down?

The parties are free to negotiate terms which govern their past behaviour.\n\nIf instead you mean that the contract purports to have been entered into in the past then no, that is not legitimate. Depending on the circumstances this can amount to fraud or forgery.\n\nIn practice it is common for people to misunderstand the difference and so you will often find contracts backdated by inserting the past date as the date of the contract (the 2nd type) when the correct approach is to have a clause which specifies that the terms apply from an earlier date (the 1st type).\n\nThere is also an implied question here about what those terms should be for the backdated period. The parties are free to agree what they like in order to \"rewrite history\" but failing that, what are the terms governing the period after the fixed term contract came to an end? The contract itself may contain an automatic renewal clause. Failing that there are a number of possibilities. From [Practical Law](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/7-520-5540) (pay\\-walled):\n\n> In the circumstances you describe (the parties have continued to deal)\n> one of the following legal outcomes is likely:\n> \n> \n> * A new agreement has been entered into.

They continued trading without a formal agreement, and now the landowner has offered a new one-year contract backdated to April 1, 2021. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Backdating the contract to April 1, 2021 is illegal and could be considered fraud, regardless of how it's worded in the agreement.\n\nB) The business owner and landowner are free to negotiate any terms they want for the period after the original contract expired, including backdated terms.\n\nC) The business owner is automatically entitled to continue operating under the exact same terms as the previous contract until a new one is signed.\n\nD) If the new contract is signed, it will automatically invalidate any implicit agreements or arrangements made during the period between April 1 and the signing date.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, parties are free to negotiate terms that govern their past behavior, as long as the contract doesn't purport to have been entered into in the past. The parties can agree on terms that apply retroactively to the period after the original contract expired. This allows them to \"rewrite history\" for the period in question. However, if no agreement is reached, the terms governing the period after the fixed-term contract ended would depend on various factors, including the parties' behavior and consistency with the old agreement's terms.

At the time I had a permit but not my license yet, so I got a ticket for the speed, and for not having a license. \n\nMy first court visit I got an extension to get my license before returning to court. I came to court without an attorney the first time, and the judge even recommended that I come with one next time. My court date is soon, and I have gotten my license but I was not able to secure an attorney due to lack of funds. \n\nGoing off of all that what can I expect in court? Any help is appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to the [Illinois Legal Aid site](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/my-right-public-defender-traffic-court) you may be entitled to the services of a public defender. That site suggests that you:\n\n> Tell the judge that you cannot afford to hire a lawyer. The judge may then ask you questions about your employment, expenses, and assets (money in the bank, home, car, etc.). The judge may also ask you to fill out a form that shows how much money you owe, how much you earn, or how much you have in the bank.\n\nYou may also want to read [This cook county FAQ](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/service/frequently-asked-questions) or find a similar site for the county where you live. \n\nAccording to the Legal Aid site linked above, speeding by more than 40 MPH (limit \\+40\\) can result in up to 1 year in jail. So can driving with a suspended or revoked license. I suspect that driving with no license ever issued might be similarly serious. You would be very wise to do all that you can to secure the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nYou may be able to call the clerk of the court, or your local public defender's office, and start the process of getting a PD before your court date. Either of those offices will probably be able to explain in some detail what you might expect from the court.",

The driver has since obtained a license but cannot afford an attorney for the upcoming court date. What is the MOST appropriate course of action for this individual?\n\nA) Plead guilty to both charges and hope for leniency from the judge\nB) Request a public defender at the court hearing\nC) Ignore the tickets and hope they will be dismissed\nD) Argue that obtaining a license after the incident should nullify both charges\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because pleading guilty without legal representation could result in severe penalties, including potential jail time for speeding more than 40 mph over the limit and driving without a license.\n\nB) is the correct answer. The documentation states that according to the Illinois Legal Aid site, the individual may be entitled to a public defender. They should inform the judge of their inability to afford a lawyer, and the judge may then evaluate their financial situation to determine eligibility for a public defender.\n\nC) is incorrect and potentially harmful. Ignoring tickets will not make them go away and could result in additional legal troubles and penalties.\n\nD) is incorrect because obtaining a license after the fact does not negate the original offenses. While it may be viewed positively by the court, it does not automatically nullify the charges.\n\nThe most appropriate action is to request a public defender, as this provides the best chance of navigating the legal process and potentially mitigating the consequences of the charges."

Another app with the same functionality and the **exact** same name appeared a few days ago. Now there are plenty of apps like mine out there that do what mine does so functionality isn't a problem at all, but it really bothers me that my app name was used by someone else for the same purpose. The name isn\u2019t legally registered with the INPI (French equivalent for the USPTO), but this situation really bothers me.  \nWhat can I do? I was thinking about sending a polite email asking if the person could maybe change the name, is this the way to go?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your mark is descriptive in nature (e.g., *Best Site Ever*), it's not unusual to find overlapping names in the same product space. As there are only so many short descriptions available of the same product or service.\n\nBut even if your name is a non\\-descriptive, abstract phrase (e.g., *Apple*, *Google*, etc.) it is unlikely that your brand carries enough cachet in your space to really damage you. Unless your brand is really well known by your potential customer base.\n\nIn any event, if you are serious about pursuing the matter, and you believe you have a legitimate infringement claim, in the U.S. the first step would be to have an attorney draft and send a ***Cease and Desist Letter*** and maybe demand some payment to settle the claim.\n\n[Click here for a sample letter and discussion of it by an attorney](http://jux.law/cease-desist-trademark-infringement-template-example-sample-form/).\n\nHowever, infringement suits can get quite expensive very quickly so you should consider that.

The regulation applies strict liability, meaning intent is not required for the offense to occur. The citizen is not denied entry into their country of citizenship, but they have 2 business days after arrival to provide the card. If they fail to do so within this timeframe, they may be fined. As of the information provided, 10 penalty units equate to $2,750.

Sidney Powell, the defense has invoked the [reasonable person standard](https://abcnews.go.com/US/dominion-files-16-billion-lawsuit-fox-news-false/story?id=76699634&cid=clicksource_4380645_3_heads_hero_live_twopack_hed). It is my understanding that Powell's First Amendment right is not tested as the plaintiff is Dominion Voting Systems and not the government. Assume Dominion has actually suffered quantifiable damages (loss of business), caused by the Powell assertions.\n\nIf plaintiff were to assert that Powell's statements were the extremist \"dog whistle\" that summoned unreasonable persons to cause said damages: How, if in any way, does the defense's reasonable person standard shield Powell? IANAL\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some simplified points of basic defamation law as background:\n\n* A critical element of defamation law is that the defendant said something false.\n* You therefore can't win a defamation case if it's based on a statement that can't be proven false: \"You are annoying.\" \"You are ugly.\" \"You are a bad lawyer.\"\n* If a statement can't be proven false, it is considered opinion.\n* Statments of opinion are virtually always protected by the First Amendment.\n\n[Powell's brief](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20519858/3-22-21-sidney-powell-defending-the-republic-motion-to-dismiss-dominion.pdf) relies on this framework to argue that because her statements were statements of opinion, no defamation could have occurred. It's like defending against a murder charge by saying that no one died. Although it isn't generally referred to as the \"reasonable person standard,\" reasonableness comes into this question because part of the calculus in assessing whether a statement is fact or opinion is to ask whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be making an assertion of fact. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/1).\n\nBy leaning into that language, Powell is not saying that reasonable people would not have any reaction or would not have any specific reaction to her statements; instead, she is saying that reasonable people would not have understood her statements to be assertions of fact. Her argument seems to turn on the fact that she was speaking as an attorney representing a political candidate in a lawsuit, and that reasonable people understand statements made in that context to be \"inherently prone to exaggeration and hyperbole\u201d and \"view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, that seems to me like a pretty weak argument. While people expect a certain amount of puffery from their candidates, they also expect that lawyers representing the President of the United States aren't going into court with frivolous allegations.\n\nMore importantly, though, I think she's running the analysis incorrectly. Rather than asking whether a reasonable person would understand her statements to assertions of fact, she's asking whether a reasonable person would think that she was prone to exaggerate in the setting in which she made those statements. As I understand it, a speaker cannot cloak statements of fact from liability by merely refraining from uttering them until she finds herself in a context where people expect some amount of loose speech. Even if you're a partisan hack with no credibility appearing on a TV show hosted by another partisan hack with no credibility, you generally can't accuse your opponent of being a murderer or child molester or something like that. Those are still assertions of fact, even if they're bookended with statements that \"Donald Trump is the greatest president this country will ever have.\"\n\nThe brief does not rely at all on *Hustler* or the First Amendment protections for parody that were discussed in the previous answer. These tests are closely related, however, as both defenses claim that the speech was not \"false\" in the relevant sense.",

Falwell case.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. This approach aligns with the defense strategy described in the passage, where the defendant (like Sidney Powell) argues that reasonable people would understand statements made in a political-legal context to be \"inherently prone to exaggeration and hyperbole\" rather than assertions of fact. This defense attempts to frame the statements as opinions rather than factual claims, which would protect them under the First Amendment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it doesn't accurately represent the reasonable person standard and could be seen as admitting the statements were unreasonable.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it misplaces the responsibility in a defamation case; the issue is about the nature of the statement itself, not the audience's responsibility to verify it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that the defense does not rely on the Hustler case or parody protections. This would be a different legal strategy altogether."

The state cannot seize Mary's house to satisfy John's tax debt unless John has a legal interest in the property. Living in the house does not give John a legal interest.

My early intention was to allow them to continue the rental but something comes up \\- my inlaw was diagnosed as a cancer patient and she needs a place to stay so that she can go to a nearby hospital in Flushing, Queens.\n\nI texted the tenant on 06/20/20 telling him the situation and informed that I won't renew the lease. His main complains was that 1\\) earlier I verbally agreed to allow him to stay so he already purchased the insurance; 2\\) given the current pandemic situation and his job status (he was in Hotel business which was heavily hit but he also said he was protected by unions), he had difficulty to find another place; 3\\) he had a newborn baby.\n\nNow my questions:\n\n* While I understand his hardship but my inlaw's situation of being a\ncancer patient is worse than his. What I heard is that most state laws\ndictate that a landlord cannot evict a tenant even they intend not\nto renew the lease, however there are criteria based on which the\nlandlord can. Does anyone know how pertinent laws in NY can work in my favor?\n* What's the proper way of serving my notice to the tenant? I texted\nhim on 06/20 of my intention. On 06/29 when I asked my agent to check\nwith him, the tenant refused to talk to the agent, claiming that I\nalready renewed the contract with him, which was of course nonsense.\n* If I take this to court (which is not likely given the pandemic, the\nearliest possible reopening would be 08/20\\.), anyone know what would\nhappen and what I need to do in terms of collecting evidence?\n* If the tenant continue to live after the current lease expires and\npays the rent, should I take it or just decline it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that if a tenant will not leave on their own accord, you have to get a court order to evict them, which the sheriff will enforce. Whether or not you can get such a court order and get it enforced is up in the air right now (July 6 is one day when things might change). In the normal case, you would file a holdover case, because the lease expired. [This document](https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/pdfs/TenantsGuide_holdover.pdf) from the NY Courts is addressed to tenants, but the information contained in it tells you what a landlord has to do. Notice of Termination is not required for a holdover eviction. Notice to Quit requires 10 days notice.\n\nYou do not collect rent in this case, unless you want to start all over (this is one of the defenses against holdover eviction). By collecting rent, you agree (by actions) to let the tenant continue, and the essence of a holdover case is that they are holding over without permission. While the case is going on, the judge may order the tenant to pay \"use and occupation\". Given the distinct possibility that the situation is going to continue for a long time, you may be in novel legal territory, therefore you should get an attorney. The premise of holdover evictions is that it is not an arduous process, you simply establish that the tenant overstayed the lease, and you won;t have to wait months without payment to get your (first) day in court. However, a holdover tenant is treated as a month\\-to\\-month tenant, so you can accept rent under those conditions while waiting for the legal situation to change. A [recent gubernatorial order](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/EO202.28.pdf) changes the eviction landscape, whereby in principle a holdover tenant could be evicted (after the backlog is cleared etc.).",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's legal options?\n\nA) The landlord can immediately evict the tenant after the lease expires without going to court.\n\nB) The landlord must file a holdover case in court, but cannot accept any rent payments after the lease expires.\n\nC) The landlord can file a holdover case and may accept rent payments while waiting for the legal situation to change, treating the tenant as month-to-month.\n\nD) The landlord must automatically renew the lease if the tenant refuses to move out, due to the pandemic situation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the landlord must file a holdover case in court to legally evict a tenant who refuses to leave after their lease expires. While traditionally accepting rent could jeopardize a holdover case, the current situation allows for more flexibility. The answer states that the landlord can accept rent payments while treating the tenant as month-to-month, which aligns with the information that \"a holdover tenant is treated as a month-to-month tenant, so you can accept rent under those conditions while waiting for the legal situation to change.\" This approach allows the landlord to potentially receive some income during what could be a prolonged legal process due to pandemic-related delays, while still pursuing eviction through proper legal channels."

I gather from the answer to the linked question that what happens in principle is that the police would investigate, and the local prosecutor would file charges against Alice.\n\nBut suppose Alice is a billionaire and she bribes the local prosecutor to not prosecute. What happens next? Presumably, if Bob can show the prosecutor was bribed he can make a new accusation against the prosecutor, but what if the bribe was clandestine?

Neither the legislature nor the judicial branches can compel the executive to prosecute someone.\n\nNote that none of this affects Bob's *civil* remedies: he can still sue Alice for damages. But that won't result in her ending up in prison.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, Bob is assaulted by Alice, a wealthy individual. Bob reports the assault to the police, but the local prosecutor, who has been secretly bribed by Alice, decides not to press charges. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's options in this situation?\n\nA) Bob can legally compel the prosecutor to file charges against Alice by presenting evidence of the assault to a judge.\n\nB) Bob's only recourse is to file a civil lawsuit against Alice for damages, as he has no power to influence criminal proceedings.\n\nC) Bob can appeal the prosecutor's decision to not press charges to a higher court, which can then order the prosecutor to pursue the case.\n\nD) Bob can attempt various non-legal methods to encourage prosecution, such as contacting elected officials or media, but cannot legally force criminal charges to be filed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate response based on the information provided. In the United States, prosecutors have broad discretion in deciding whether to file criminal charges, and victims cannot legally compel them to do so. This is rooted in the principle of prosecutorial discretion and the separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches.\n\nOption A is incorrect because neither Bob nor a judge can legally compel a prosecutor to file charges. This would violate the separation of powers doctrine.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that Bob can file a civil lawsuit, but it's not his only recourse. He can also attempt non-legal methods to encourage prosecution, making this option incomplete.\n\nOption C is incorrect because courts do not have the authority to order prosecutors to pursue cases, as this would infringe on prosecutorial discretion.\n\nOption D correctly states that while Bob can try various methods to encourage prosecution (such as contacting officials or media), he ultimately cannot legally force criminal charges to be filed. This option best reflects the reality of the situation as described in the provided information."

If the man passes away, what is likely to happen under French law?\n\nA) The estate will be divided exactly as stated in the will, with 50% going to the son and 50% to the partner.\nB) The estate will be divided between the man's biological children equally, disregarding the will and the partner.\nC) The partner will receive the entire estate as the long-term cohabitant.\nD) The will may be challenged, and the estate will likely be distributed according to French intestacy laws, potentially leaving the partner with no inheritance.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: In France, unmarried couples who have not entered into a civil partnership (PACS) have no automatic inheritance rights to each other's estates. The will may be challenged on several grounds:\n1. It incorrectly states the gender of one of the children.\n2. It refers to a \"wife\" when the couple is not married.\n3. It may not comply with French forced heirship rules, which protect children's inheritance rights.\n\nGiven these issues, the will is likely to be set aside, and French intestacy laws would apply. Under these laws, the man's children would have priority in inheritance, and the long-term partner, not being legally recognized, would potentially receive nothing from the estate unless other provisions had been made."

Could a judge cancel his own or (without requiring court appearance)\nhis relatives traffic ticket?\n2. Could a judge declare an individual as guilty simply because they\nwant to, esp. if the case does not have much direct evidence either\nfor or against an indictment?\n\n(I am not interested in what they are expected to do, or how they are expected to behave in their position, but what they are able to do without accountability.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the proper immediate action is to \\- while not leaving the judicial branch \\- appeal up to the next higher court. In federal courts, the lowest levels are district courts, which issues decisions appealable to the circuit courts, whose decisions are sometimes able to make their way to the Supreme Court by submitting a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. Then the Supreme Court meets and decides which appeals it will hear for the year ahead. \n\nThis works similarly on a state level, except the levels of the courts may have different names (for example, Washington, DC\u2019s trial level court is not the District Court, but the Superior Court. In Virginia, one trial court is the General District Court, which hears claims up to $25,000 and another trial court is the Virginia Circuit Court which hears other claims, and some felonies while also serving as an appellate court for the General District Court).\n\nAssuming those options have been exhausted, the reality is yeah, sometimes there are judges who will act that way. Sometimes they will get away with it because they are maintaining enough discretion, they are powerful enough, or because someone else is corrupt, too. \n\nA number of options and variables may come into play at this point. What, if any, laws exist to prevent the behavior in question? What ethics standard does the jurisdiction have (this would likely be developed by the local bar association)? Are there any other organizations he or she is affiliated with professionally? Who else knows about it, how serious is it, will anyone else speak up, etc...? Each of those variables \\- and likely a number of others not mentioned here \\- may play into the outcome. They each can serve to make one\u2019s actions more or less easy or desirable to perform, whether by exposing and embarrassing an actor, reminding him or her of the potential legal liability associated with such actions, etc. \n\nAll that said, there are limits on what a judge may or may not do. For example, in federal criminal cases, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, rules assembled by the US Sentencing Commission that are, of course, non\\-binding, set a floor and ceiling on the years in prison one should be sentenced to in various circumstances with a formula used to make the calculation. It is rare (and sometimes controversial and subject to scrutiny) if a judge grossly or unreasonable deviates from the Guidelines. The intent of the Guidelines is to remove judicial bias from the doling out of prison sentences. Results have arguably been mixed. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d be remiss not to mention that in general judicial discretion in many aspects of litigation is a desirable and useful occurrence, whether it manifests itself in the dismissal of a frivolous case or appointing counsel to an indigent defendant.",

As stated in the documentation, \"the proper immediate action is to - while not leaving the judicial branch - appeal up to the next higher court.\" In federal courts, decisions from district courts can be appealed to circuit courts. This allows the judicial system to review and potentially correct any errors or abuses of discretion by lower court judges.

( Teepublic has a very clear policy statement, too: [https://www.teepublic.com/copyright\\-policy](https://www.teepublic.com/copyright-policy) )\n\nMany companies \\- such as Marvel \\- employ agents to regularly check such websites and issue takedown demands to the sites; the sites in turn remove the products, and in some instances, ban the individual from using the site again.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, there can be two types of products sold that use trademarked artwork and characters: items sold by legitimate businesses that have license agreements with the trademark owners and who have the products sold by Amazon itself; and items sold on the Amazon marketplace by individuals who open Amazon Marketplace accounts themselves and don't have licenses. Amazon will be sure to check the products they sell; they will have a takedown notices system for their marketplace vendors. eBay is somewhat the same way; there is a mix of individuals and businesses on eBay, but eBay doesn't operate an umbrella sell/ship by eBay, like Amazon.\n\nIt's kind of a whack\\-a\\-mole situation on the Interwebs. How much time/money does a company spend to chase down trademark infringement? Is it worth going to court for persistent violators? (These are, for the most part, civil cases, not criminal). Violators can always open a new account on sites such as Redbubble and eBay under a different name. And it starts all over again.",

Recently, they've noticed an increase in designs featuring popular superhero characters. What is the BEST approach for TrendyTees to minimize their legal risk regarding potential trademark infringement?\n\nA) Ignore the issue, as it's the responsibility of individual sellers to ensure they have the right to use trademarked characters.\n\nB) Implement a strict vetting process, manually reviewing every design before it's listed on the site.\n\nC) Establish a clear policy against trademark infringement, provide an easy way for rights holders to submit takedown notices, and promptly remove infringing content when notified.\n\nD) Obtain blanket licenses from major entertainment companies to cover all superhero-related designs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best approach because it follows the practices of established marketplaces like Redbubble and Teepublic. This method:\n\n1. Clearly communicates the company's stance against trademark infringement to users.\n2. Provides a mechanism for trademark owners to report violations.\n3. Allows for prompt removal of infringing content.\n4. Balances the need to protect intellectual property rights with the practicalities of operating an open marketplace.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ignoring the issue could lead to legal troubles for the company. Option B, while thorough, would be extremely time-consuming and may not be feasible for a small company. Option D would be prohibitively expensive and doesn't address the issue of unauthorized use by individual sellers."

Colorado Civil Rights Commission Justice Kennedy said the treatment of the baker was \"neither tolerant or respectful\". In the [opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf) on page 2 it says:\n\n> As the record shows, some of the commissioners\n>  at the Commission\u2019s formal, public hearings endorsed the view that\n>  religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere\n>  or commercial domain, disparaged Phillips\u2019 faith as despicable and\n>  characterized it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of\n>  his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust.\n\nWhat exactly did the Commission (or their representatives) say and was it really that bad? I'm looking for sources outside of the opinion, ideally verbatim quotes from the commission or their own (public) records.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: See section II B of the opinion. On page 13:\n\n> On July 25, 2014, the Commission met again. This meeting, too, was conducted in public and on the record. On this occasion another commissioner made specific reference to the previous meeting\u2019s discussion but said far more to disparage Phillips\u2019 beliefs. The commissioner stated:\n> \n> \n> \n> > \u201cI would also like to reiterate what we said in the hearing or the last meeting. Freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust, whether it be\u2014I mean, we\u2014we can list hundreds of situations where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to me it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to\u2014to use their religion to hurt others.\u201d Tr. 11\u201312\\.\n\nThe analysis of whether it was really that bad follows, ending on page 16\\. The first paragraph of that analysis describes the reasoning quite well, however:\n\n> To describe a man\u2019s faith as \u201cone of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use\u201d is to disparage his religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical\u2014something insubstantial and even insincere. The commissioner even went so far as to compare Phillips\u2019 invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of Colorado\u2019s anti\\-discrimination law\u2014a law that protects discrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual orientation.\n\nThe analysis also considers that the Commission's reasoning in this case was inconsistent with its reasoning in \"the cases of other bakers who objected to a requested cake on the basis of conscience and prevailed before the Commission.\" Those cases concerned bakers refusing orders for \"cakes depicting anti\\-gay marriage symbolism.\" It then says that the ruling of the Colorado Court of Appeals, which upheld the Commission's ruling as permissible \"because of the offensive nature of the requested message,\" was improper because \"it is not, as the \\[Supreme] Court has repeatedly held, the role of the State or its officials to prescribe what shall be offensive.\"",

Which of the following best describes the Court's reasoning for finding the Commission's actions problematic?\n\nA) The Commission failed to consider the baker's First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.\n\nB) The Commission's decision was inconsistent with previous rulings on similar cases involving other bakers.\n\nC) The Commission members made explicitly disparaging comments about the baker's religious beliefs during public hearings.\n\nD) The Commission applied anti-discrimination laws too broadly, infringing on the baker's right to refuse service.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supreme Court took issue with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission's treatment of the baker primarily because of the explicitly disparaging comments made by commissioners during public hearings. Specifically, one commissioner described the baker's religious beliefs as \"one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use,\" and compared the invocation of religious beliefs to justifications for slavery and the Holocaust. The Court found these comments to be inappropriate and indicative of a lack of neutrality in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.\n\nWhile option B is also mentioned in the passage as a factor (inconsistency with other cases), it was not the primary reason for the Court's criticism.

In Scotland, generally speaking, at least one party must either be domiciled in Scotland or must have been a \"habitual resident\" of Scotland for at least a year.\n\nIn Europe, international jurisdiction over divorce cases is governed by the [Brussels II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_II) regulation enacted in 2003 (text [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2201:EN:HTML)), and different bodies of law allocate jurisdiction between different divorce regimes within federal states like the U.K. as explained [here](http://www.brodies.com/blog/what-are-the-rules-of-jurisdiction-for-family-cases-in-scotland/). The basic rule of Brussels II for divorces is set forth in Article 3 which states:\n\n> 1. In matters relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment, jurisdiction shall lie with the courts of the Member State\n> \n> \n> (a) in whose territory:\n> \n> \n> * the spouses are habitually resident, or\n> * the spouses were last habitually resident, insofar as one of them still resides there, or\n> * the respondent is habitually resident, or\n> * in the event of a joint application, either of the spouses is habitually resident, or\n> * the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least a year immediately before the application was made, or\n> * the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least six months immediately before the application was made and is\n>  either a national of the Member State in question or, in the case of\n>  the United Kingdom and Ireland, has his or her \"domicile\" there;\n> \n> \n> (b) of the nationality of both spouses or, in the case of the United\n>  Kingdom and Ireland, of the \"domicile\" of both spouses.\n> \n> \n> 2. For the purpose of this Regulation, \"domicile\" shall have the same meaning as it has under the legal systems of the United Kingdom and\n>  Ireland.\n\nA handful of countries do not and in the days when a divorce was hard to get in the absence of proof of fault, there was a huge amount of litigation over whether a couple could either unilaterally, or by mutual agreement, dissolve their marriage in a place that had loose jurisdictional requirements for obtaining a divorce. But, Scotland and other countries whose law follows the European Union rules are not such jurisdictions. (Historically, Mexico had more liberal divorce rules and weaker residency requirements and was on such jurisdiction although I do not know if that remains the case today.)\n\nAlso, while it is often possible for parties by control to choose a governing law and venue for disputes between them, generally speaking, the parties must have some meaningful connection to the venue for that principle to apply. The only way I can see that some court, somewhere might find a connection to jurisdiction when neither party has ever lived there would be if the wedding took place in there, but Scotland does not recognize this exception.\n\n**The Impact Of Children On The Question**\n\nFurthermore, if there were children involved in a divorce, there are international treaties that govern jurisdiction over child custody matters which generally require proceedings to be brought in the jurisdiction that is the child's \"habitual residence\" and a place where a child has never lived would almost certainly not qualify. The [most notable of these treaties](http://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/oct99cro.html) is the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a treaty with approximately 45 member countries.\n\n> The Hague Convention encompasses nearly all European countries,\n>  including some of the former Soviet and Yugoslav republics, and other\n>  westernized countries around the world. Members also include a very\n>  few countries in Africa, South America, and the pro\\-western margins of\n>  the Middle East.\n\nIn general, rights and responsibilities related to children, who cannot be parties to any binding agreement, may not be set forth in a marital agreement.\n\nSo, even if a Scottish court was willing to entertain the termination of marriage, property division, name change, and maintenance part of the divorce, and other jurisdictions chose to recognize the Scottish court's ruling, this would not give the Scottish court authority to issue orders related to children.",

This regulation stipulates that for a court to have jurisdiction over a divorce case, at least one party must either be domiciled in Scotland or must have been a \"habitual resident\" of Scotland for at least a year. The couple's prenuptial agreement does not override these jurisdictional requirements. Option A is incorrect because a prenuptial agreement cannot confer jurisdiction where none exists. Option B is incorrect because the minimum residency period for Scotland is one year, not 6 months. Option D is incorrect because mutual agreement does not bypass the residency requirements. Therefore, C is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the residency requirement for divorcing in Scotland."

Taking them in order:\n\nBecause of how HTTP/HTML works, there are essentially two ways for a server operator to know what software you are running.\n\n1. Your browser announces that it's running something. This usually takes the form of a modified [User\\-Agent header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#User_agent_identification). I'm not aware of any privacy laws that consider \"Person A told me something\" to be an invasion of Person A's privacy.\n2. They guess it based on the actions your browser takes. For example, if the website gets a request for a page, and the site's ad network does not get a matching request for an ad, the server deduces that the user is running an ad blocker. Since this is based on things that the server operator could reasonably be expected to be informed of, it isn't an invasion of privacy under any law I'm aware of.\n\nIs it discrimination? Yes. [But not all discrimination is illegal.](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/681/137) In general, only discrimination based on protected categories (race, sex, etc.) is prohibited, and I can't imagine a jurisdiction making \"choice of browser add\\-ons\" to be one of those categories, not least because it's something the person being discriminated against can easily change.",

The website's actions are both legally and ethically defensible. According to the information provided:\n\n1. Detecting ad-blockers is not an invasion of privacy, as it's done either through information voluntarily provided by the browser or through deduction based on the browser's observable behavior.\n\n2. While this is a form of discrimination, it's not illegal discrimination. Laws typically only prohibit discrimination based on protected categories (like race or gender), and the choice of browser add-ons is not a protected category.\n\n3. Websites have the right to protect their revenue streams and can choose to deny service to users who block their ads, as long as this denial isn't based on legally protected characteristics.\n\n4. Users always have the choice to disable their ad-blockers if they wish to access the content, making this a voluntary transaction between the user and the website.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they mischaracterize the legal aspects of the situation.

[18 USC 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511) is the federal wiretapping statute, which generally outlaws \"wiretapping\" \u2013 i.e., recording a conversation where neither party consents to the recording. (If at least one party consents, it is allowed, though [some states require all parties to consent](http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide).) There are a number of special cases, starting in subsection (2\\), where party consent is not required. Court orders would be one of those conditions. Another is if the Attorney General certifies in writing that the tap is legal and necessary to catch a spy. (2\\)(e) says, in particular:\n\n> it shall not be unlawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the\n>  United States in the normal course of his official duty to conduct\n>  electronic surveillance, as defined in [section 101 of the Foreign\n>  Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801), as authorized by that Act.\n\nwhere electronic surveillance is defined (partially) as \n\n> the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance\n>  device of the contents of any wire or radio communication sent by or\n>  intended to be received by a particular, known United States person\n>  who is in the United States, if the contents are acquired by\n>  intentionally targeting that United States person, under circumstances\n>  in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a\n>  warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes\n\nThis seems to satisfy the circumstances described in the question \u2013 the act would be \"electronic surveillance\" as defined in that section of the law. But the wiretap law also says \"as authorized by that Act\", so now we have to turn to authorization (without court order).

According to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) as described in the passage, the President cannot authorize electronic surveillance of a U.S. citizen without a court order. While the President can authorize certain types of electronic surveillance without a court order through the Attorney General, this is specifically limited to situations where \"there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party.\" The law explicitly restricts such surveillance to communications \"used exclusively between or among foreign powers.\" Therefore, surveillance targeting a U.S. citizen would not be permitted under this authorization and would require a court order.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the President cannot directly order surveillance without going through proper legal channels. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while the President can authorize some surveillance through the Attorney General, it cannot target U.S. citizens.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even if there's no substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communications, the law still does not allow targeting U.S. citizens without a court order."

This is an [equitable remedy](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85675/what-are-equity-and-equitable-remedies). Whether a personal right of action or a derivative action is appropriate generally depends on the nature of the loss. See e.g. *Anthony v. NPV Management Ltd.*, 2003 NLCA 41 at para. 14, quoting McGinness, *The Law and Practice of Canadian Business Corporations*:\n\n> Derivative actions must be distinguished from personal rights of action belonging to a shareholder. In deciding whether a particular cause of action is derivative or personal, the question to resolve is whether the essence of the action is the violation of some right of the corporation or some personal right to which the shareholder is entitled. Either one can produce a loss to the shareholder. **The difference is whether the loss is suffered by the shareholder directly or by the reduction in the value of his or her shares.**\n\nI am not sure that this reflects the exact boundaries of the availability of this action in other jurisdictions and I would expect there to be jurisdiction\\-specific thresholds/tests/procedures to establish a valid derivative action.\n\n### Dissipation of assets\n\nCommonly, a derivative action will claim that a defendant has dissipated assets of the corporation. E.g. in *Anthony v. NPV Management Ltd.*, the claim was (among other things) that\n\n* \"the Defendants dissipated or permitted the dissipation of the assets and transferred business of Conpak Seafoods Inc. to Daley Brothers Limited\" and that\n* one defendant \"acted in such a manner to serve his personal objectives to the detriment of Conpak Seafoods Inc. and its Shareholders.\"\n\nIn this [overview article](https://www.mondaq.com/pdf/clients/87654.pdf), Aronson et al. describe a derivative action as follows:\n\n> \u2018the action is derivative, i.e., in the\n> corporate right, if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the\n> corporation, or to the whole body of its stock or property without\n> any severance or distribution among individual holders, or if it seeks\n> to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of\n> its assets.\n\n[This answer by ohwilleke](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56345/46948) presents another good description.",

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The alleged harm (not reinvesting profits and using them for a competing venture) is primarily to the corporation itself, not directly to the individual shareholder.\n2. Derivative actions are designed to address situations where corporate assets are being dissipated or misused by those in control.\n3. The essence of the complaint is injury to the corporation and its overall value, which affects all shareholders indirectly through the reduction in the value of their shares.\n4. Derivative actions allow minority shareholders to act on behalf of the corporation when those in control (like the majority shareholder/CEO) are allegedly harming the company.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a personal lawsuit would only be appropriate if the shareholder suffered a direct, personal harm separate from the harm to the corporation. Option C might be too extreme without more evidence and doesn't address the underlying issue. Option D is incorrect because suing the corporation itself doesn't target the actual wrongdoer and could further harm the company's value."

Will that hold in a small claims court where I am suing her for the full deposit?\n\nThat seems unlikely. Lease contracts typically establish that tenants are jointly and severally liable. If your lease does not establish that, you would need to prove the landlord's agreement that your husband's acts with respect to the contract are not binding to you.\n\nEven if you prove the aforementioned issue, the security deposit to be reimbursed would be prorated if the court decides that your husband essentially desisted from his portion of the deposit by saying to the landlord \"*you can keep your money*\".\n\n> Do we have a chance of winning the case?\n\nYes. It is unclear from your post whether the landlord's pretexts are tantamount to complying with her statutory obligation of timely notification of an itemized list of damages. Landlord\\-tenant statutes give a deadline (such as 30 days) for sending that notification. Non\\-compliance forfeits whatever entitlement the landlord would otherwise have as to the security deposit.\n\nIn case of landlord's compliance regarding that itemized list, you as tenants may dispute the legitimacy of the damages alleged therein.\n\nHere the intricacy stems from your husband's statement \"*you can keep your money*\", which a reasonable person might construe as your husband's waiver \\-\\-notwithstanding the contentious context\\-\\- of reimbursement. A waiver may be cognizable even if made reluctantly or under apparent reluctance. In fact, it is common for people to reluctantly waive their rights because they deem the matter not worth the hassle that court or quasi\\-judicial proceedings as well as extra\\-judicial disputes entail.\n\nIf necessary, you as tenants might want to posit that \"*your money*\" in that expression literally refers to the amount \\-\\-if any\\-\\- that legitimately belongs to the landlord, and that the expression ought not to be confused with \"*you can keep the\\|that\\|my money*\". Your husband's expression literally reflects that he was not overreaching into landlord's funds, but that your husband's purpose simply was to recover \\[nothing more than] the security deposit.\n\nUnless impracticable, I encourage you to litigate this matter *in pro per* because in doing so you would gain some exposure to legal proceedings. The amount involved is not too high, whence the matter would be litigated in Small Claims court (hence without being represented by a lawyer) anyway. With that exposure you will not be easily intimidated by lawyers/charlatans if your rights are violated in the future. But one lesson here is that that type of expressions can backfire because such expressions don't truly reflect the person's ultimate purpose and thus may be construed to that person's detriment.",

As explained in the documentation, a statement like \"you can keep your money\" can be legally complex. While it might be construed as a waiver, the court would likely consider the context, including the frustration and anger mentioned. The specific wording (\"your money\" vs. \"the money\") could be interpreted narrowly. Additionally, the documentation suggests that tenants could argue the statement referred only to legitimate deductions, not the entire deposit. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the statement doesn't always constitute a waiver; context matters. Option B is wrong because co-signers may have separate rights, and one co-signer's statement doesn't automatically waive another's rights. Option C is incorrect because the statement can have legal implications and won't be entirely disregarded by the court."

Is this legal? I never signed anything accepting responsibility for stuff her senile father broke. Now instead of just quitting a job I have a letter here claiming I owe her several thousand dollars and claiming that my final check is forfeit. \n\nShe is a powerful attorney in California and I'm a regular working stiff. This is a bit out of my league and intimidating. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No employer has ever the right to withhold your pay check for work you have done. It is strictly illegal. Even if they had 100% evidence that you caused damage and were responsible for that damage, they still can't withhold your pay. They have to pay you, and *then* they can try to take you to court. The reason for this law is exactly cases like yours, where people try to avoid payment. \n\nIf the \"powerful attorney\" tells you that you are not getting paid, then that \"powerful attorney\" is making a big mistake, because any lawyer would *love* to take your case to court and see the judge cutting the \"powerful attorney\" down to size. \n\nIf you don't want a lawyer now, then you can write a letter by registered mail telling them that you worked for them, how much the payment due is, that they are legally required to make that payment, and that you will take them to court if they are not paying.

The employer, a powerful attorney, withheld the final paycheck, claiming the employee was responsible for damages caused by the elderly patient. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employer has the right to withhold the final paycheck if there is evidence of damages caused by the employee's negligence.\n\nB) The employee must pay for the damages before receiving the final paycheck.\n\nC) The employer must pay the final paycheck, and then pursue any claims for damages separately.\n\nD) The employee has no recourse because the employer is a powerful attorney.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to labor laws, an employer must always pay an employee for work performed, regardless of any disputes or claims of damages. Even if the employer believes the employee is responsible for damages, they cannot withhold wages as compensation. The employer must pay the final paycheck and then pursue any claims for damages through proper legal channels, such as filing a lawsuit. Options A and B are incorrect because withholding pay is illegal, even with evidence of damages. Option D is incorrect because the law applies equally to all employers, regardless of their profession or status."

Additionally, let's say I know that my friend did this but I have no proof (they reached out to my employer pretending to be someone else, or they used a burner phone) and subpoenaing their ISP wouldn't do much good, do I have much of a case in suing them?

A baseless belief that it must have been so\\-and\\-so will do you no good. You do not have to have iron\\-clad evidence of your allegations, for a civil suit, but you have to show with a [preponderance of evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)#Preponderance_of_the_evidence) that the claim is true.

To succeed in a civil suit, John needs to prove his case with a preponderance of evidence, not absolute proof. Sarah's history of similar behavior, combined with other circumstantial evidence, could potentially meet this standard. \n\nOption A is incorrect because small claims court typically handles much smaller amounts, not a case involving a $100,000 salary.

Many times you know that a law they are about to approve is wrong, it's approved by legislators not for the sake of people but to profit their own interests, and that the law is going to harm many people. My question is: Can such legislators be sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short answer, no.\n\nArticles 68\\-70 of Argentina's constitution effectively provide for legislative immunity while in office.\n\nThere are two issues with your plans to sue: 68 protects the legislature for opinions and speeches (such as approval of an unconstitutional law).68 appears particularly troublesome to your lawsuit, as it covers conduct that occurred during their office holding tenure, and seems to continue after their tenure. **Note:** I have not read this in Spanish, and instead I am reliant on the below translation.\n\nNow, if your accusations are true, you could make a case for this to be considered fraud or treason (or some other crime). If that legislator is currently in office, then their respective House would have to suspend them before any investigation could continue (which is unlikely).

Option A is incorrect because legislators have immunity for their legislative actions. Option B is too absolute; while legislators have strong protections, they're not entirely immune under all circumstances. Option C is incorrect because the immunity for opinions and speeches seems to continue even after their term ends.\n\nOption D is correct because according to Section 70 of Argentina's constitution, if there's enough evidence of wrongdoing, the legislator's respective House can suspend them with a two-thirds majority vote, which would then allow for prosecution.

Or are they, then why is it not working for them?\n\n**P.S:** I am not saying that Uber has no responsibility of doing a background check on drivers (and making sure that Uber rides are completely safe), so that the safety of women as well as men and children can be ensured. Also if we are coming to it, some sort of verification of the rider will encourage women cab drivers to also operate an Uber.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contracts that violate local law are void in just about every jurisdiction, as are contracts against clearly defined public policy. In many cases, laws are specifically *designed* to restrict otherwise valid contracts; for instance, in the US, an employment contract that pays less than $7\\.25 an hour will normally be invalid, even if the company and the employee both agree to the reduced wage. In employment law, where contracts are fairly common, the laws would be virtually meaningless if contracts took precedence.\n\nIn the case of independent contractor status vs. employee status, California law does not consider someone to be an independent contractor just because their contract says so. \"Independent contractor\" is defined in California law to be \n\n> any person who renders service for a specified recompense for a specified result, under the control of his principal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is accomplished. ([California Labor Code, section 3353](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=3353.))\n\nIf this definition isn't satisfied, it's irrelevant what the parties agree the status is; it's not an independent contractor status. According to the state department of labor, the test is that found in [*Borello v. Dept. of Industrial Relations*](http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/48/341.html) (a California Supreme Court case), which lays out a multifactor test for contractor status and says that\n\n> The label placed by the parties on their relationship is not dispositive, and subterfuges are not countenanced.\n\nLikewise, with product liability, a country can generally have laws *mandating* liability for people providing a product or service; the extent to which this happens depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, India may not want a big company like Uber to be able to block liability claims by putting some legalese in front of average consumers who aren't able to make a detailed risk\\-benefit analysis. Alternatively, India could decide that Uber is better able to take the risk from bad drivers than average consumers are, so the right policy is to assign the risk to Uber. Whether Uber should be able to avoid liability is something that every country can decide for itself based on public policy considerations; the point is that if they *do* decide that Uber should be liable for damages, their law trumps Uber's contract.\n\nUber actually *tries* to limit liability in their EULA, and to avoid an employer\\-employee relationship in their driver agreement. Their US EULA and driver agreement says they aren't a transportation provider and you aren't getting transportation from them, and even if you are they aren't liable for damages. However, if that provision violates the law in some state, the provision is invalid. Likewise, if they claim it's not an employment contract but it meets the \"employee\" definition in some state, it's an employment contract.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of a contract between a company and a worker that designates the worker as an independent contractor?\n\nA) The contract is always legally binding if both parties have signed it voluntarily.\nB) The contract can be overruled by the court if it violates minimum wage laws, but otherwise stands.\nC) The contract's designation is irrelevant if the actual working relationship doesn't meet the legal definition of an independent contractor.\nD) The contract is valid unless the worker challenges it in court within 30 days of signing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to California law, the designation of a worker as an independent contractor in a contract is not determinative. What matters is whether the actual working relationship meets the legal definition of an independent contractor as outlined in California Labor Code and further clarified by case law such as Borello v. Dept. of Industrial Relations. The court will look at multiple factors to determine the true nature of the working relationship, regardless of how it's labeled in the contract. This principle is summed up in the quote from Borello: \"The label placed by the parties on their relationship is not dispositive, and subterfuges are not countenanced.\" Therefore, even if both parties agree to label the relationship as an independent contractor arrangement, this can be overruled if the actual circumstances of the work do not align with the legal definition of an independent contractor."

The language defining the warranty term from a [warranty for a 2018 Acura](https://owners.acura.com/Documentum/Warranty/Handbooks/2018_Acura_Warranty_Basebook_BWL06581_v1__FINAL_.pdf) (I picked it at random as an example) is pretty typical.

The warranty period is 3 years from this date, so it would end on March 15, 2026. The mileage limit is 36,000 miles from the time of purchase, not from zero miles. Since the car had 25 miles at purchase, the warranty would expire when the odometer reaches 36,025 miles. The warranty expires when either of these conditions is met first.

What is the legal basis for having workers outside of the jurisdiction of the US working (effectively) on the US territory in this manner? These are people answering calls in a business setting. So there is no question of whether they are working or rather just talking. This is not a question of free speech. It's a question of work authorization. \n\nLet me clarify why I think this is or isn't an issue. If I go to hear a paid performance by a folk singer in the US, but he is not authorized to work in the US, he can't accept a payment for singing. If I call him on the phone and ask him to sing, and he lives in the US, but he is not authorized to work in the US, he can't legally sing for money during that call. But somehow if he is in a different country, then I can call him and he may be legally allowed to sing to me for money without being afoul of the US labor law. This doesn't seem legal. And yet this is what the call centers are doing.\n\nI am not asking for *some* reasons why this is happening. This is a question about the US law. What is the reason why providing services to the people situated in the US is not considered working in the US from the perspective of the US law?\n\n**EDIT**: a number of answers seem to center around the idea that a person who is not present in the US cannot be considered to be working in the US, by law, simply because they are not physically present in the US. \n\nIt is simply not the case that the US law cannot make such a consideration. \n\nThere is a **more general principle** at play here. An action performed outside of the US does not automatically become a non\\-US action. For example, US citizens owe US Federal income taxes on all income earned abroad. \n\nThe confusion maybe caused by a slight semantic distinction. It is not automatically the case that work done outside of the US is not work in the US. The fact remains that by servicing calls from numbers in the US, some work within the US gets done. \n\nWhether or not the US labor law considers this to be work in the US is a **matter of law**. **It's not a matter of fact**. If it were a matter of fact, then no law could change it. But it is certainly possible for a law to exist which would make such work to be considered work in the US. So a law could (at least hypothetically) change it. \n\nPlease, limit your answers to the law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Everything is allowed unless the law says it isn\u2019t\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCommon law systems like the USA are \u2018exceptions based\u2019 \\- the law permits everything except what it prohibits.

I can't find any information outlining the restrictions on moving to a different state with a firearm. I would like to believe that so long as the firearm is legal in the state I am moving to, that I would be able to bring it, no problem. \n\nMy question is, if I purchase an AR\\-15 in Washington and move to Utah, would I be able to bring the gun, and if so is there any extra registration, paperwork, or fees I need to deal with?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For regular firearms you only have to comply with the laws of the state to which you are moving. Since Utah (presently) has no state\\-specific restrictions on ownership or possession of AR\\-15 rifles that means in this case, as you say, \"no problem.\"\n\n(The only exception would be registered NFA items \u2013 e.g., machine\\-guns, suppressors, SBR, SBS, DD, AOW \u2013 for which the BATFE typically requires notice when you are moving them interstate. But if you have gone through the trouble of registering such an item, you probably already know that.)\n\nFinally, you have to exercise some care in the actual interstate transportation of firearms: *If you are passing through a jurisdiction where possession of them is restricted* then you have to follow the rules provided in the [Firearms Owners Protection Act](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20150101/guide-to-the-interstate-transportation). In particular:\n\n> Under FOPA, notwithstanding any state or local law, a person is\n>  entitled to transport a firearm from any place where he or she may\n>  lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he or\n>  she may lawfully possess and carry it, if the firearm is unloaded and\n>  locked out of reach. In vehicles without a trunk, the unloaded firearm\n>  must be in a locked container other than the glove compartment or\n>  console. Ammunition that is either locked out of reach in the trunk or\n>  in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console is\n>  also covered.",

As stated in the documentation, for regular firearms like an AR-15, John only needs to comply with the laws of the state he's moving to (Utah). Since Utah has no specific restrictions on AR-15 ownership, he can bring it without additional paperwork. However, he must follow the rules outlined in the Firearms Owners Protection Act for interstate transportation, such as keeping the firearm unloaded and locked out of reach.\nOption D is incorrect because both Washington and Utah allow ownership of AR-15 rifles, so there's no prohibition on bringing it from one state to the other."

I have attempted to contact them but they refuse to discuss my account with me. They are threatening me with collections over charges when services have not been rendered.\n\nWhat law(s) are relevant here? They must be in violation of some federal and/or state statutes. I'm in NY, they are based in GA.\n\nI found [this reference](http://foleybezek.com/representative/godoy-v-att-wireless.html) to a $47 million class action lawsuit for this kind of behavior from 2004\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary problem is figuring out whether the charges are legal or not. You might have a continuing contractual obligation so you need to pay an early termination fee; or maybe not. (There is also the question of whether you think you don't and they think you do). The alleged obligation might be something one\\-time (i.e. an amount still unpaid). Whatever it is, they will not discuss it with you unless you have the security code, or you appear in an office with suitable ID. This non\\-discussion extends to requests to cancel an account. \n\nThe two things that you would need to do, in a letter (if a trip to the store is not practical), is prove that you are who you say you are, and to make an official demand to cancel the account (which you know was delivered, because you sent the letter certified. You may hire an attorney to handle this, or you can try it yourself first and get a lawyer if that fails.\n\nThere is no law that requires a company to discuss details of an account with an unverified person, indeed if they don't verify that you are the relevant person, you might sue them for negligently putting you at risk. But there is no law that lets them say \"if you don't have the security code, we've got you for life\".",

The company refuses to discuss the account without a security code. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The wireless company is automatically in violation of federal law for charging after cancellation, regardless of contract terms.\n\nB) The customer has no legal recourse and must pay all charges demanded by the company, as discussing accounts without verification is illegal.\n\nC) The customer should send a certified letter to the company proving their identity and demanding account cancellation before considering legal action.\n\nD) The customer can immediately file a class action lawsuit against the company based on the 2004 precedent mentioned.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate course of action based on the information provided. The documentation suggests that the primary issue is verifying the customer's identity and officially cancelling the account. Sending a certified letter proving identity and demanding cancellation is a recommended step before pursuing legal action. This approach addresses the company's security concerns while creating a paper trail of the customer's efforts to resolve the issue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality of the charges depends on the specific contract terms and whether services were actually rendered. Option B is false; while the company has a right to verify identity, the customer does have legal recourse if charges are indeed improper. Option D is premature; legal action should be a last resort after attempting to resolve the issue directly with the company."

According to the information provided, a civilian can ask a police officer if they are being followed and why, but the officer has no legal obligation to answer the question or to answer truthfully if they choose to respond. The civilian has the right to inquire, but cannot demand an explanation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the civilian can ask, they cannot legally demand an explanation, nor is the officer required to provide a truthful answer.\n\nAnswer C is not the most accurate response. While calling 9-1-1 to verify the authenticity of the police car is a possible action, it's not necessary to immediately assume it's an impersonator. This could be done if there are suspicions, but it's not the primary or most appropriate action in this scenario.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Ignoring a police vehicle is not advisable, and the jurisdiction of the officer doesn't necessarily end at city limits, especially if they began following the vehicle within their jurisdiction."

According to the principle of duress, a person who is forced to commit an act under immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm is not considered guilty of that crime. In this case, Sam was under duress, as he was forced at gunpoint to participate in the dismemberment. Therefore, he would not be guilty of any crime related to this act.\n\nHowever, the situation may raise questions about Sam's conduct as an FBI agent. While he's not criminally liable, he might face internal disciplinary action or review for his involvement in the situation, even if it was under duress.

Not from a third\\-party, but from the US government source that maintains the list of embargoed nations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US government is not required to publish a single list of \"embargoed\" countries, however defined. They are, however, required to publish the legal underpinnings of any restriction. This takes two forms. First, Congress must pass some law that enables the restriction. [This page](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/HowTo/how_to_laws.htm) hosted by the Senate explains how to find such laws, however, it only goes back so far. You can find all of the US Code on the [House US Code website](https://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml). Usually, any change of sanctions don't require new legislation. The second set of publications are executive orders and executive\\-branch regulations, which are published in [The Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/). For example, [this](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/23/2022-04020/blocking-property-of-certain-persons-and-prohibiting-certain-transactions-with-respect-to-continued) is an executive order (February 21, 2022\\) regarding blocking of certain persons and transactions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce then published [an implementation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/03/2022-04300/implementation-of-sanctions-against-russia-under-the-export-administration-regulations-ear) of that order, which is published in the Federal Register. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, Dep't of Treasury later [published licenses](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16667/publication-of-ukraine-russia-related-web-general-licenses-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-and-25) related to this.\n\nThe obvious problem is that hundreds of pages of information are published in the Federal Register every day, so keeping up with the rules is challenging. A partial substitute would be to check the web page of each department that might be involved in promulgating such regulations. The Dept. of Treasury has pages on [financial sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information). One thing they provide is [useful information](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/where-is-ofacs-country-list-what-countries-do-i-need-to-worry-about-in-terms-of-us-sanctions) about is list of countries that you need to worry about in terms of U.S. sanctions: **there is no list**. As they explain,\n\n> U.S. sanctions programs vary in scope.Some are broad\\-based and\n> oriented geographically (i.e. Cuba, Iran).Others are \u201ctargeted\u201d (i.e.\n> counter\\-terrorism, counter\\-narcotics) and focus on specific\n> individuals and entities.These programs may encompass broad\n> prohibitions at the country level as well as targeted sanctions.Due to\n> the diversity among sanctions, we advise visiting the \u201cSanctions\n> Programs and Country Information\u201d page for information on a specific\n> program.\n> \n> \n> OFAC\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (\u201cSDN\n> List\u201d) has approximately 6,300 names connected with sanctions targets.\n> OFAC also maintains other sanctions lists which have different\n> associated prohibitions. Many individuals and entities often move\n> internationally and end up in locations where they would be least\n> expected.Accordingly, U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with\n> SDNs regardless of location and all SDN assets are blocked.Entities\n> that an SDN owns (defined as a direct or indirect ownership interest\n> of 50% or more) are also blocked, regardless of whether that entity is\n> separately named on the SDN List. Because OFAC's programs are dynamic,\n> it is very important to check OFAC's website regularly.Ensuring that\n> your sanctions lists are current and you have complete information\n> regarding the latest relevant program restrictions is both a best\n> practice and a critical part of your due diligence responsibility.\n\nThe Dep't of Commerce has a less\\-useful list, the [entities list](https://www.commerce.gov/tags/entity-list), and also a [Trade Enforcement web page](https://www.commerce.gov/issues/trade-enforcement).\n\nYou should note that sanctions against the Central African Republic stem from [Executive Order 13667 of May 12, 2014](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/car_eo.pdf), but the Dept. of Treasury amended the regulations as of [September 29, 2022](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/fr87_58972.pdf) not in response to a new executive order. This is reflected on the Treasury Dep't web page on sanctions. It is unknown, and perhaps unknowable, whether the Dept. of Commerce will promulgate any foreign sanctions regulation that are not mirrored on the Treasury Dept. web page. In the case of the CAR sanctions, the executive order directed Treasury to write rules, though the Sec'y of State also received ordered (not related to financial sanctions).",

The U.S. government does not maintain a single, comprehensive list of embargoed countries (eliminating option A). Instead, information about sanctions and embargoes is communicated through multiple channels. These include laws passed by Congress, Executive Orders issued by the President, and regulations published in the Federal Register by various departments such as the Treasury and Commerce.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while OFAC provides valuable information, it explicitly states that there is no definitive list of countries subject to sanctions, and that sanctions programs vary in scope and can target specific individuals or entities rather than entire countries.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while Congress does pass laws that enable restrictions, many changes to sanctions don't require new legislation. Executive Orders and regulations published by executive branch departments play a crucial role in implementing and modifying sanctions.\n\nThe correct answer (D) reflects the complex and dynamic nature of U.S. sanctions and embargo information, which is spread across multiple government sources and requires careful monitoring to stay up-to-date."

For exemple \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pies,_tarts_and_flans>\". Assume next that I want to get from that article only table that contain list of pies. I want to get **only** it data (only facts, only copying \"words\" from the \"name\", \"origin\" and \"type\" columns, but not from \"description\" column ), **without pictures.** Let's assume that I want to create pies database using data from this tables. And than I want to build some website, in which user can get \"list of random pies\". This \"random pies\" will, of course, be gotten from that database. At one time, user will get only some limited amount of such pies. For example \\- generating list of 10 pies \\- by one pressing of button \"generate random pies\".\n\n**What I already found:**\nThis type of use, in general, is linked to license on which that article are licensed. This Wikipedia article have license \"CC\\-BY\\-SA\". Also on wikipedia present detailed article on [reusing Wikipedia content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_content), where described how to correctly satisfy license terms.\nSo for now I understand that I need to: make attribution, indicate changes, stick \"licensing notice\" of used article, and also satisfy \"Copyleft/Share Alike\" part. Please keep this last, \"Share Alike\", part in mind.\n\n**Also license notes from official site:**\n[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by\\-sa/3\\.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\n\n**So, here is my question:**\nTrying to satisfy \"Copyleft/Share Alike\" part:\n \\- Am I **obligated** to make that database of pies publicly available, and with this also license them in the same license? For example, am I **obligated** to make a button \\- \"download pies database as some file\". Or I don't need to do this because I don't share the database directly. I just use some parts of it at once, in not direct way.\n\n**What I think about that:**\nProblem is that, that I really need to apply the same license on that database if I will be sharing it publicly. If I made it public. Because this database is \"build upon\", or is something similar to \"adaptation\" ([https://creativecommons.org/faq/\\#what\\-is\\-an\\-adaptation](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-an-adaptation)), of that table (\"ShareAlike \u2014 If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\" ([https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by\\-sa/3\\.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/))). But I don't know, if giving to users of that site, random parts of that pies database \\- will this be considered as if database is shared publicly.\n\nAnd I knew that there was such statement that there no copyrights on information. But there copyrights on databases, and also \\- is this creation of database will be considered as just use of information, but not other things from used tables.\n\n*So my question is merely about \"Copyleft/Share Alike\" part. Merely about of obligation of making database public.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (For the data you use, you [*might* not have to](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions \"CC FAQ: 'Do I always have to comply with the license terms?

The key point from the LawStackExchange discussion is that Congress is not questioning the validity of existing debt, which would be unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. Instead, the debt ceiling debates concern future borrowing authorization. The amendment's purpose was to ensure the validity of existing debt, not to prevent Congress from making decisions about future debt levels. While these debates may create uncertainty in financial markets, they are not inherently unconstitutional as they deal with future fiscal policy rather than questioning the legitimacy of debt already incurred."

I am not sure whether this act then only covers consumer debt (i.e. store purchases etc.).\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a landlord and not an attorney. For that reason, will answer this question from that perspective.\n\nThe Dodd Frank Act covers \"collections\" as primarily in a collections agency. If can cover a corporation collecting debts of course. It has nothing to do with a landlords ability to obtain a judgement or collect a debt which is covered by your states Tenant Landlord Act (or something similar).\n\nThe landlord has the right to file a complaint against anyone who has not paid rent, caused damage to the property, or any other loss to the landlord as a result of your action or inaction. Filing and getting a judgement is not collections as covered by the Dodd Frank Act. Once a judgement or judgements have been entered, there are several options including through the sheriffs department seizure and forfeiture depending upon your state law.\n\nOnly *if* the landlord sends your debt to a collections agency, does the Dodd Frank Act apply and, in that, only applies to how the collections agency that collects the debt and not to the landlord. It does not apply to the debt, the ability or right to collect the debt. It applies to the behavior of the collections agency seeking to collect the debt only.\n\nFor what it is worth, with so many legal options available to the landlord and not similarly afforded to consumer debt, it is unlikely that the landlord will use a collections agency. Options can include a collections attorney, the sheriffs department, direct collection by the landlord, the courts, etc. Landlords often take a loss of some sort using a collection agency and therefore avoid the option unless as a last resort. Often, if direct collection efforts fail, the landlord will either receive relief through the courts or through the sheriffs department according to state law, both of which are unavoidable and not ordinarily covered by the Dodd Frank Act. In this case, it is akin to owing the state the debt just like any other debt owed to the state. The state will have rights afforded by law such as the right to withhold privileges offered by the state such as drivers licenses, titles, tags, building permits, other licenses, etc. This may not apply equally in all states. You will have to read your states law to know what the limits of the ability of a landlord to obtain and collect a debt are.",

The Dodd-Frank Act primarily applies to the actions of collection agencies and certain corporate debt collection practices. It does not directly govern a landlord's attempts to collect a debt from a former tenant. The act would only come into play if the landlord chooses to use a third-party collection agency to pursue the debt. In that case, the Dodd-Frank Act would regulate the behavior of the collection agency, not the landlord or the debt itself.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Dodd-Frank Act does not directly govern the landlord's actions in this situation. The landlord's rights and actions are primarily governed by state landlord-tenant laws.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent landlords from pursuing legal action against former tenants for damages. Landlords retain the right to file complaints and seek judgments through the court system.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Dodd-Frank Act does not require landlords to use specific methods of debt collection. Landlords have various options for pursuing debts, including direct collection, legal action, or using collection agencies, depending on their preference and state laws."

Which of these scenarios, if any, are legal, and why?\n\nAlso, would the answers change in any of these scenarios if, instead of screensharing a movie directly, someone instead put a disc in a DVD player, turned on a movie through a TV set, and then pointed a web camera at the TV set for the entirety of the film? Would this have any legal change (I'm guessing not).\n\n**Edit:** To avoid conjecture, I'd like answers to reference any relevant statutes or cases if such are available.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically: NO\n===============\n\nThe question is: do you infringe copyright if you share your screen while watching a copyrighted film with somebody else?\n\nAnd the answer to that question is generally: yes, it's copyright infringement. Why? Let's see:\n\nAre you infringing ([Title 17 chapter 5](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html), esp. [section 501](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#501)) on the rights of the copyright holder ([Title 17 chapter 1](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106A) , esp. [section 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106)) to distribute their film by making it available? Yes, you perform it, thus violating copyright. Especially notice these excerpts:\n\n> **To \u201cperform\u201d a work means** to recite, render, play, dance, or act it, either directly or by means of any device or process or, **in the case of a motion picture** or other audiovisual work, **to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible**.\n\n> To **perform or display a work \u201cpublicly\u201d means**\u2014 \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (2\\) **to transmit** or otherwise communicate **a performance** or display **of the work** to a place specified by clause (1\\) or **to the public, by means of any device or process**, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\n\n> To \u201ctransmit\u201d a performance or display is to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.\n\n> 106. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works\n> \n> \n> Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (4\\) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and **motion pictures** and other audiovisual works, **to perform the copyrighted work publicly**;\n\n* Is a movie a work of art? Do you stream the whole movie? Are you usurping the market (people that have not yet seen the movie) from the movie distributor? Clearly, yes, yes, yes. This puts factors 2, 3, and 4 (nature is fictional, the amount is all, Effect on the market is that the stream is a replacement for a legitimate copy) against screen sharing on films. This makes it *near impossible* to claim [fair use (Title 17 Section 107\\)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107).\n\nSo...\n-----\n\nCase 3 is clearly illegal.\n\nCase 2 likewise does not change a lot: being \"internet friends\" is generally not recognized, and would likely not stop people from being considered the public or a subset of it under the law \\- especially not if the group is large and could be described as \"random people you met online\". Under that pattern, even if a broadcast that is somewhat publically accessible (through word of mouth access sharing or something) would have not a single viewer, it would still be aimed at some subset of the public, which is the public. This in turn means, that even sharing with a single person that isn't specifically allowed to be shared with is illegal. However, it would be up to a court to draw a line between the is\\-Public of \"these 42 random people Peter talks to on Zoom\" and the not\\-Public which is \"Peter, Paula, Maria and Marcus, who would meet and drink after work if not for COVID\". However... Usage licenses apply, and streaming services generally ban re\\-streaming in their ToS (see below).\n\nCase 1 has a Significant Other that might qualify as family under the law, and then it would not be copyright infringement. So it might be ok **unless** the ToS of the site make it a breach of the contract to re\\-stream to anyone. Which incidentally is banned in the Amazon Prime ToS. That would be a Breach of Contract claim of the streaming service against Victor, not Copyright Infringement.\n\nbut...\n------\n\nBut there is one difference: Copyright infringement needs to be filed for by the copyright holder. This means, the copyright holder needs to learn of the conduct first, then file suit with enough evidence. Which makes it incredibly hard for cases 1 and maybe 2\\.\n\nHowever, it is still not technically legal if those people are not inside the \"inner circle\" that is not *the public* and there is the problem with the ToS, making it not ok even with that inner circle.",
