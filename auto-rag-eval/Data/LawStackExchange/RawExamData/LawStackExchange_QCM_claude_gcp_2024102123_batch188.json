Times kidnapping revenge article.\n\nWhat I don't understand is what kind of rights they are trying to get. Surely anybody can write their own story about a lady who is running a private investigation in order to get her daughter's kidnappers in jail. Are they paying for the right to put in the caption \"based on a true story by N.Y. Times\"? Or is it to use the actual person's name (and in that case, why is N.Y. Times receiving the money)? I would assume they want to keep parts of the plot, but again, why is N.Y. Times receiving the money for something they didn't invent?\n\nOr do they plan to actually use the article's text verbatim in the movie? In my experience, movies based on a true story nevertheless deviate quite significantly from the hard facts, so I find that hard to believe.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The right in question would be the right to create a *derivative work* based on the story. Since this is a news story, it is presumably based on fact. Anyone may base a work (non\\-fiction book, novel, film, play etc) on a set of factual events, and there is no need to pay anyone for permission to do so. But the text of a particular news story is protected by copyright, and may not be used without permission (except to the limited extent permitted by fair use or fair dealing). This might include quoting the news story, or using its organization of the facts.\n\nIt is more common to see movie studios bidding for the screen rights to a work of fiction. There the detailed events are the original creation of the author(s) and if used without permission, the result is likely to be held a derivative work and thus a copyright infringement, depending on the exact facts of the case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A film studio wants to create a movie based on a true story reported in a New York Times article.

The film studio is likely bidding for the right to create a derivative work based on the specific article's text and organization of facts. While the factual events themselves are not copyrightable, the particular way the New York Times article presents and organizes these facts is protected by copyright. By obtaining these rights, the studio can closely follow the article's narrative structure and potentially use direct quotes without risking copyright infringement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because such a phrase would likely fall under fair use and doesn't require special rights. Option B is incorrect because the names of real people involved in news events are typically not protected by copyright. Option D is incorrect because factual events themselves cannot be copyrighted, and anyone is free to create a work based on true events without permission."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48984/in-a-civil-case-do-both-plaintiff-and-defendant-have-the-same-exhibit-lettering", "docs_id": 48984, "title": "In a civil case, do both Plaintiff and Defendant have the same exhibit lettering?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For instance, if the Plaintiff files a complaint and references \"Exhibit A\" and the Defendant files an answer denying the allegations of the complaint and also wants to reference some document/evidence, does the Defendant start labeling their documents with \"Exhibit A\" or do they start where the Plaintiff left off (i.e. \"Exhibit B\")?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Labeling is document\\-scoped.

Can it not be called original (even if it is), if it's not a work (fixed)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") copyright law, anything that is of one of the broad general categories that can be protected by copyright is said to be a \"work\" whether or not it has been \"fixed in a tangible form\". If a person sings a song, never having written it down or recorded it, the song is a \"work\" but has not been fixed, and is therefore not protected by copyright. The same would apply to a speech or a poem that has been recited but never written down or recorded, or a dance performed but never notated or recorded. They are all works, but none have (yet) been fixed, and so there is no copyright protection.\n\nAll this will also be true in any country that adheres to the Berne Copyright convention, although the word \"work\" might be translated into another language.\n\nIf someone later writes the work down, or records it, then it will have been \"fixed\", and copyright protection will be available provided the other conditions are met.\n\nWhether a work is original is a separate issue from whether a work has been fixed. If person A makes up a song and sings it without recording it, it is original but not fixed. If person B hears it and writes it down, it is now fixed, but not original to B. A will then have the copyright.\n\nIn copyright law \"originality\" usually means that a work is the separate creation of a person, not copied from the work of some other person. Note that a work may quote or imitate previous works, or use portions of them in some way, and still be sufficiently original for copyright protection.\n\nHowever the term \"original\" is sometimes used to mean \"creative\". A mere list of numbers in numerical order is not creative, and will not be protected by copyright (in the US and countries with similar laws). A list of all the names of people in a given town or area, in alphabetical order, is not creative enough to be protected by copyright (see *Feist vs Rural*). Courts and other writers on copyright sometimes express this by saying the work is not \"original\". Similarly, a simple geometric design, such as a white square on a black background, is not creative enough for protection, and again this is sometimes expressed by saying that it is not original.\n\nA work must be both original and creative to be protected by copyright, although it need not be **very** creative nor **totally** original. The rules on originality and creativity vary by country. I am here following US law, but the law of quite a few other countries is similar on these points. The term to look for what is counted as original and protectable is often referred to as [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality). This is what I have referred to as \"creativity\" above.\n\nThis is related to the question and answer at [Is a work copyrighted on fixation or publication? What's the difference?

It is also original, as it is the comedian's own creation and not copied from someone else. However, it is not yet protected by copyright because it has not been \"fixed in a tangible form.\" In U.S. copyright law and countries adhering to the Berne Convention, fixation is a requirement for copyright protection. Until the routine is written down, recorded, or otherwise fixed, it remains a work that is original but not yet eligible for copyright protection. Option A is incorrect because fixation has not occurred. Option B is incorrect because the routine is already considered a \"work\" even without fixation.

However, the loan agreement itself may still be enforceable.

In these cases, does the original YouTuber still have any copyrights over a mirrored version of their video? Can they still make a claim against the uploader for using their content without permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, taking a video made by someone else, making alterations and then distributing the resulting work is probably already a copyright violation. There are exemptions like fair use (check the comments for an example), but just taking a whole video, mirroring it and reposting it without any own contribution very likely does not constitute fair use. The people who do that don't avoid copyright infingement. They just try to avoid getting caught by any automatic system YouTube has in place to detect copyright infringements. But avoiding automatic filters does not mean to avoid DMCA takedown notices, cease\\&desist letters or lawsuits from real humans who find a mirrored version of their video and feel that their copyright was violated.\n\nHowever, alterations to a creative work can be a creative work in itself. So regardless of the fact that one violated copyright in creating a derivative work, that derivative work might still be eligible for copyright in its own right. That means someone who reposts a video originally made by party A and then altered by party B would violate the copyright of both A and B at once and thus expose themselves to potential legal actions from either party.\n\nBut the question is if simply mirroring a video constitutes the necessary [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality) to make the resulting work eligible for copyright.

At the very least you have a contract under which they repair (or make their best efforts to repair) your camera and you give them some money. more than likely, there are specific terms of the contract drafted by the repairer which you agreed to, either by signing something or by clicking on something on a web page (you know all that stuff nobody reads? That's a legally binding contract)\n\n**So, what does the contract say about time?**\n\nIf it says nothing then there is an implied term that the repair must be done in a *reasonable* time. What is a reasonable time? Its the time that a reasonable person who knows all the circumstances would consider neither too short nor too long. Is 2 months a reasonable time? Right now we don't have the information to say: it probably is a reasonable time if parts were required to be sourced etc. 2 years would definitely be unreasonable, 2 months? \\[shrug].\n\nIf it is an unreasonable time you can sue for damages (i.e. whatever the absence of your camera has cost you) or seek a court order forcing them to complete the contract by a certain date.

Even if the customer doesn't remember explicitly signing a contract, there is likely an agreement in place (e.g., through terms and conditions accepted when submitting the item for repair). This contract would outline the obligations of both the repairer and the customer, including any specific timeframes for the repair.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because cancelling the contract immediately is not typically justified unless the delay is so extreme that it constitutes a repudiation of the contract.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there's no standard 6-month threshold mentioned in the documentation.

The distinction in the common law dates from the 19th century when industrialisation created more and more employees and those employees slowly gained more and more rights.\n\nLegislation in the UK (and most other common law jurisdictions) does not usually further define employee so the common law definition is still relevant. The *Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988* is no different.\n\nThe courts have developed 3 tests to determine if a person is subject to a contract of service. These were stated by MacKenna J in [Ready Mixed Concrete (SE) Ltd v Minster of Pensions and National Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Mixed_Concrete_(South_East)_Ltd_v_Minister_of_Pensions_and_National_Insurance) \\[1968] 2 QB 497\n\n> A contract of service exists if these three conditions are fulfilled. (i) The servant agrees that, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, he will provide his own work and skill in the performance of some service for his master. (ii) He agrees, expressly or impliedly, that in the performance of that service he will be subject to the other's control in a sufficient degree to make that other master. (iii) The other provisions of the contract are consistent with its being a contract of service.\n\nThese are known as the control test; the integration test; and the multiple test. It is now considered that the control test and the integration test (which were both developed first) are now merely factors, albeit significant factors, of a single multiple test.\n\n> I can put the point which I am making in other words. An obligation to do work subject to the other party's control is a necessary, though not always a sufficient, condition of a contract of service. If the provisions of the contract as a whole are inconsistent with its being a contract of service, it will be some other kind of contract, and the person doing the work will not be a servant. The judge's task is to classify the contract (a task like that of distinguishing a contract of sale from one of work and labour). He may, in performing it, take into account other matters besides control.\n\nThe definition is a little tautological: a contract is a contract of service if it has the elements of a contract of service. This case was also important as it clearly establishes that whether a contract is an employment contract is a matter of law and the parties cannot redefine their relationship with words \\- if it meets the requirements of a contract of service then that\u2019s what it is even if it describes itself as something else. A [duck test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test) is required.\n\nThe sorts of questions that are relevant to the multiple test are:\n\n* Can you work whatever hours you like?\n* Can you work where you like?\n* Do you get paid for what you produce (rather than by the hour or day)?\n* Can you hire somebody else to do the work?\n* Do you have to fix defective work without additional pay?\n* Can you make a profit or loss?\n* Can you be sued if you screw up the work?\n* Do you use your own plant and equipment?\n* Do you carry your own public risk/professional indemnity insurance?\n* Do you provide services to multiple clients and can you choose the quality of service you give to each?\n\nFrom your description, the \u201cagency\u201d sounds exactly like a labour hire employer. The fact that you can pass on individual placements is not enough to make this a contract for service since, if you do accept the placement, you can\u2019t send me to do the work, you can choose to work from 6\\-10 in the morning and 6\\-10 in the evening 4 days per week, you get paid by the hour etc. This is a contract of service and the agency is your employer.

Are there any other interpretations likely possible?\n\nRetaining possession doesn't have to be wrongful prior to the point at which a person with a superior right to possession demands that possession be transferred to them.\n\nFor example, suppose that I own a custom desk, and I direct my employee and agent to retrieve the desk for me, which has been paid for in full and is being held at a furniture store awaiting my pickup. The furniture store's possession of the desk isn't wrongful until my employee goes to the furniture store and asked to be given the desk and the furniture store can confirm that my employee is authorized to pick it up, but refuses to turn over the desk to my employee anyway. And, this happens while I'm abroad on an ethnography research mission deep in the Amazon jungle for the next year, and I am unavailable.\n\nMy employee could sue the furniture store which upon refusing my employee's demand had wrongfully detained my custom desk to gain possession of it. This is because my employee has a superior right to possess the custom desk to the furniture store, even though I own the desk.\n\nSimilarly, if I buy a car with a car loan and then default on my loan in a way that authorizes its repossession upon the demand of the lender under the loan agreement and the applicable chattel mortgage law, and I refuse to allow it to be turned over to the repo man for the lender, either the lender or the repo man would have superior right to possession of the car to me, and I would be wrongfully detaining the car. This is true even though I came into possession of the car rightfully and was not wrongfully detaining it until the lender had the right to repossess it and demanded that I turn it over. Even then, my wrongful detention might be merely a breach of contract, rather than a crime.\n\nSo, yes it is unlawful possession in the technical sense, but wrongful possession includes a much broader range of conduct than, for example, criminal theft.\n\n> It's worth noting, that in this circumstance, the defendant gained\n> possession of the goods lawfully, there is no prior or contemporaneous\n> agreement with respect to returning goods.\n\nIn this situation, absent other extenuating circumstances (like a possessory repairman's lien or storage costs lien, or possession of something by a spouse while a divorce is pending, or a court order directing someone to hold property pending a determination of ownership by a court), anyone with a greater right to possession than the person who is currently in possession of it can simply demand that possession be turned over immediately, and their possession then becomes wrongful detention if they don't promptly comply.\n\nFor example, if you loan you backhoe to your neighbor with no other agreement, your neighbor has to return it to you or your agent upon demand.\n\nSomeone who is in possession of property of another lawfully entrusted to them, who has no other relationship to the owner of the property, is a \"bailee\" of the property for the owner or other person with a superior right to possession of it who delivered the property to the bailee, who is the \"bailor\" of the property."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Alice lends her vintage motorcycle to Bob for a weekend ride.

In this scenario, Bob's initial possession of the motorcycle was lawful, as Alice lent it to him voluntarily. However, when Alice (the owner with superior right to possession) demanded the return of her property and Bob refused, his continued possession became a wrongful detention. This aligns with the explanation in the original text that wrongful detention can occur even when initial possession was lawful, and it doesn't require a prior agreement about return. Options A and B are incorrect because they mischaracterize the initial possession as unlawful or imply theft, which isn't necessary for wrongful detention.

The act of filming *per se* is therefore not illegal in a criminal sense. However, the proprietor of a private place can ask you to stop filming or demand that you leave; if you fail to comply then you will be trespassing.\n\nTrespass is not a criminal offence (although the police will undoubtedly remove you if called). However, if your intent was to intimidate, obstruct or disrupt activity within the premises, you could be charged with Aggravated Trespass under [s68 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/68).\n\n### Could the owner, or someone else, have a civil claim against me?\n\nThis is more difficult to answer. Trespass is a tort, so the owner could in theory have a claim against you if you were filming against his wishes. However, he would have to prove some measurable amount of damage, and this is why few trespass cases come to court.\n\nThe occupants of the premises may be able to sue if you breach their right to privacy (Article 8 [ECHR](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf), incorporated into UK law by the [Human Rights Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42)); however, a court will balance this against your Article 10 right to freedom of expression.

Notably, the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of [*Castle Rock v. Gonzalez*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales) came to its conclusion that there was no civil liability of a police department or police officers for failure to enforce a restraining order in the face of language in a state statute whose plain language fairly clearly created a mandatory duty to that effect.\n\nThe offense of unlawful restraint Texas Penal Code \u00a7 20\\.02 is as follows:\n\n> (a)\u2002A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly\n>  restrains another person.\n> \n> \n> (b)\u2002It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section\n>  that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002the person restrained was a child younger than 14 years of age;\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002the actor was a relative of the child; \u2009and\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002the actor's sole intent was to assume lawful control of the child.\n> \n> \n> (c)\u2002An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor, except\n>  that the offense is:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002a state jail felony if the person restrained was a child younger\n>  than 17 years of age; \u2009or\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002a felony of the third degree if:\n> \n> \n> (A)\u2002the actor recklessly exposes the victim to a substantial risk of\n>  serious bodily injury;\n> \n> \n> (B)\u2002the actor restrains an individual the actor knows is a public\n>  servant while the public servant is lawfully discharging an official\n>  duty or in retaliation or on account of an exercise of official power\n>  or performance of an official duty as a public servant; \u2009or\n> \n> \n> (C)\u2002the actor while in custody restrains any other person.\n> \n> \n> **(d)\u2002It is no offense to detain or move another under this section when\n>  it is for the purpose of effecting a lawful arrest or detaining an\n>  individual lawfully arrested.**\n> \n> \n> (e)\u2002It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section\n>  that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002the person restrained was a child who is 14 years of age or older\n>  and younger than 17 years of age;\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002the actor does not restrain the child by force, intimidation, or\n>  deception; \u2009and\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002the actor is not more than three years older than the child.\n\nIn practice, almost any restraint by a police officer would not obviously be outside the immunity for a lawful arrest sufficient to give rise to the duty to report a felony. Also, the person who decides whether to press charges is the prosecuting attorney who has a strong long term strategic interest in maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement and who often subjectively views law enforcement as his client even though this is the correct as a matter of legal doctrine.\n\n> Question 1: Are any police on the scene responsible for reporting the\n>  crime of unlawful restraint which has become a felony in their\n>  presence?\n\nIn general law enforcement may have a duty under department policy as a matter of employment law, but there is no general legal duty for a police officer to report a crime committed in their presence. Law enforcement officers, like prosecutors have wide discretion over whether they will choose to enforce crimes in the U.S.\n\nBut, since Texas has a mandatory reporting law, this comes down more to a matter of interpretation and a restraint by an officer would almost never never give rise to a felony due to the privilege for an arrest. Also, it isn't at all obvious that a law enforcement officer has to report the crime to anyone but him or herself to satisfy the requirements of the law, and there is no duty for a law enforcement officer to act upon a report of a felony.\n\n> Question 2: Would the police in not reporting the crime be implicating\n>  more involvement than mere presence and thereby threaten their\n>  immunity stance?\n\nGenerally not. To have liability personally, the law enforcement officer would have to be a co\\-conspirator. Usually conspiracy liability would require an affirmative action in support of the illegal action and not merely inaction in the form of failing to report a crime.\n\nPolice have qualified immunity from civil liability for any act that is not a clearly established violation of a constitutional right. \n\n> If the police do not owe a duty to protect the person being unlawfully\n>  restrained, it would seem they still owe a duty to uphold the laws of\n>  the state like they would for the crimes of jaywalking, driving\n>  without a seat belt, or rape.\n\nThis is mistaken. Law enforcement officers have no legally enforceable duty to uphold any laws. They may have a moral duty to do so, and they may have a strong employment relationship pressure to do so, but a law enforcement officer faces neither civil nor criminal liability for merely failing to enforce a criminal law when they know a crime has been committed.\n\n> If the police do not owe a duty to the citizen to arrest another\n>  officer for violating the law do they at least owe a duty to the law\n>  to make a criminal complaint regarding the violation they witnessed?\n\nArguably, there is a criminal law duty to report a clear felony, but since the duty is only to report the matter to a law enforcement officer and they are a law enforcement officer, it isn't clear that this statute applies at all. A report of a suspected felony is not a criminal complaint.\n\n> And if so, and if they do not, would they be more accountable than the\n>  populace who are required by law to report felonies?\n\nNo. As noted above, they are arguably less accountable than members of the general public."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In Texas, a police officer witnesses a colleague make an unlawful arrest that potentially qualifies as felony unlawful restraint.

Okay, so VP is out \\- but if there was a [Tom Clancy's Debt of Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_of_Honor)\\-style situation where most of the government officials were killed, is there any position in the U.S. Government that could legally assume presidency, even though under normal circumstances due to age, birth, or other restriction they would normally be ineligible to hold the office? And if so, what is that office?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several possible ways to get there, but the answer is \"there is no such position.\"\n\nActing President vs. President\n==============================\n\nUnder the Constitution:\n\n> In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, **the same** shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then **act** as President, and such officer shall **act** accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.\n\nWhen William Henry Harrison died, there was some question as to what \"the same\" that devolved on Tyler (his VP) meant. Some thought it meant that Tyler was Acting President; others thought the office itself went to Tyler. Tyler was in the latter group, and set a precedent that the VP *became* the President (finishing out the President's term) if the President died; the VP wasn't just acting. The 25th Amendment later clarified that presidential death, removal, or resignation made the VP the President; if the President was unable to exercise the powers and duties of the office, the VP was Acting President.\n\nFurther down the line, the Constitution explicitly says Congress decides \"who shall act as President.\" Congress only talks about succession further down the line in terms of the Acting President and the officer acting as President. So, if that interpretation is correct, the answer is \"the VP is the only officer who can assume the office of President in the event of the President's death.\" Of course, a new precedent could potentially be set if this situation ever arises; if someone will definitely act as President until the end of the term, then it makes a certain amount of sense to say they just assume the office itself. \n\nEligibility for office\n======================\n\nThe Constitution doesn't say \"you can't be *elected* President unless over 35, natural\\-born citizen, and 14 years a resident.\" It says you are not eligible for the office unless you meet those requirements. That would include any way of assuming the office, including succession. You can't become President if you are not eligible to hold the office, period (that's what eligibility for an office *means*); the only requirements you'd get around are those covering eligibility to be elected.\n\nSuccession\n==========\n\nIt's unclear whether the Constitution's eligibility requirements apply to a person acting as President who does not assume the office.

According to 3 USC \u00a719, which sets out the presidential succession beyond the Vice President, only officers who are eligible for the office of President under the Constitution can act as President. This means they must meet the age, citizenship, and residency requirements outlined in the Constitution.

Apparently you want to sell a product where aspects of the design of the product might infringe someone's copyright, and you want to market the product online. By providing samples of your product and the \"other\" products, you would provide a basis for a legal professional to assess the probability of an infringement lawsuit (how similar are the items?).

I suppose the reasoning is that it's more likely that you would get caught if the product is marketed online, compared to sold by word of mouth with the aid of signs in front of your house.\n\nYou could ask \"would disclaimers on the product help avoid an infringement lawsuit?\", though since I can\u2019t imagine how a disclaimer on a product would immunize against a lawsuit, you might be better off explaining what you would be disclaiming, and why you *think* that is relevant to the question of infringement.\n\nAnytime someone intends to infringe copyright, the first question would (or should) be, why not get permission to copy the content in question?\n\nYou can Google \"attorney referral service\", which will give you the names of services, such as nolo, findlaw, lawyers, avvo, also the local bar association (sometimes) then you can fill in zip code, general legal area and a \"what's the issue\" summary, and you may get instant replies or eventual replies.

This case happened in the UK (England to be specific, should that make a difference).\n\nAbout two weeks ago, a colleague of mine told me that while getting their mortgage application sorted through a mortgage broker, the mortgage broker offered some insurances to protect him and his family for the duration of the mortgage (life insurance and income protection), as he seemingly was working together with some insurance companies to offer that as part of the mortgage application. My colleague was hesitant to sign any deal on the spot, as he wanted to review all of the policies / quotes before signing anything, as insurances were never covered before in any of the appointments. He then felt pressured by the broker who seemingly was using typical sales techniques (\"only I can offer these quotes\", etc.) to which he then just replied that he will not make a decision on that during their meeting and insisted on review the policies / quotes, which makes sense to me.\n\nThey agreed to have a follow\\-up meeting to discuss this, but the mortgage broker never called again. Much to their surprise, they later received a letter from one of the policies who confirmed they have set up the direct debit for their insurance and that payment would be taken once the mortgage payments would start. They had, however, since looked for alternative policies and decided to go with a different policy and so basically had now two life insurances, one of which they didn't need and which was arranged by their mortgage broker without explicit consent (email, telephone, signature, etc.). In\\-fact, they wanted to inform the mortgage broker in the follow\\-up meeting that they had gone with a different insurance company but figured that since the mortgage broker never showed up again they do not need to inform him then (they did not assume the mortgage broker would take out insurance in their name without getting permission beforehand to do so).\n\nThey were able to get out of that by talking to the insurance company but were quite upset with their mortgage broker (understandably). However, here is the part that I do not understand, I have not studied law but I would bet that there must be laws in place (in the UK (England)) that prohibits third parties from taking out insurance on someone else's behalf without their explicit consent. Assuming these laws exist (and here is where my curiosity comes in), what are the consequences for mortgage broker? Slap on the wrist or potential bigger punishments (if pursued that is)?\n\nIn addition to my own curiosity, I am actually about to embark on the same journey (mortgage application) and I just want to avoid this whole situation in the first place so I would like to know what my mortgage broker is and isn't allowed to do in my name. I would assume they would know the consequences of taking out insurance that I have not instructed them to do but I would feel better / more informed if I knew what the law actually says on this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, apply [Hanlon\u2019s Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity\n\nIt\u2019s quite likely that the broker\u2019s recollection of the meeting is very different from your friend\u2019s \\- whenever 2 people witness an event there are a minimum of 3 versions of that event \\- one for each person and what actually happened. Very soon there will be more as each person\u2019s memory of the event changes with time.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, even likely, that even though your friend verbally refused the insurance, they signed something accepting it. When the broker looked at that, even if they remembered the refusal, it may convince them that your friend changed their mind.\n\nAgency\n------\n\nAs a matter of law, a life insurance agent is an agent of the insurer, whereas a mortgage broker is your friend\u2019s agent. So, if the broker did something wrong vis\\-a\\-vis the life insurance, that\u2019s a matter between them and the insurer, from your friend\u2019s position, the broker *is* the insurer.\n\nNo harm, no foul\n----------------\n\nYour friend has suffered no damage so they have no basis for a lawsuit. The contract has been cancelled and they are not out of pocket. Indeed, they received a benefit: if they has died while both policies were active their beneficiaries would have gotten both payouts.\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nLife insurance agents have legally enforceable ethical standards.

The method is explicit in that tenants are to be charged \"*\\[t]he provider's bills*\".\n\nLandlord's evasion of tenant's scrutiny causes reasonable suspicion of *breach of contract* and/or *breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing*. That covenant is implied in every contract.\n\nDuring court proceedings, the tenant will be entitled to conduct discovery on the defendant landlord, the non\\-party provider, and other non\\-parties who might be relevant to the claim(s).\n\nSince the clause is valid, relief in the form of striking that clause from the lease seems unlikely to be granted. In case of overcharge, the relief for breach of contract will be primarily in the form of reimbursements plus interest (see sections [3300](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=4.&title=2.&part=1.&chapter=2.&article=1.) *et seq* of CA Civil Code), or the corresponding deductions on subsequent bills.

The tenant has a right to transparency and fairness in billing. If the landlord refuses to provide a reasonable explanation for the charges, the tenant can pursue legal action based on potential breach of contract or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Conditions for consent are defined by the GDPR. This was also confirmed by the \"Planet49\" case.\n\n1\\. consent is required unless the storage of or access to information on the end users device is either strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user, or necessary for technical reasons. E.g. functional cookies like a shopping cart feature in a web shop are fine, as are cookies used solely for security purposes or technical features like TLS session resumption.\n\nIt is however likely that this cookie does qualify as personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The cookie contains an ID that lets you single out/distinguish this user from all other users, even though that ID doesn't link the user to a real\\-world identity. It is also possible to argue that the cookie is entirely anonymous, but the safer approach is to treat it as personal data. Similarly, other features of the website necessarily involve the processing of personal data, such as processing the user's IP address, if only for the purpose of responding to their HTTP requests.\n\nThe GDPR's criteria for valid consent are mainly about ensuring that the consent is a freely given unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. For example, consent can never be the default, it needs to be an opt\\-in. However, Art 7(1\\) GDPR says that the data controller has the burden of proof of showing that valid consent was given. The GDPR itself does not provide further guidance on what this means specifically. I would argue that it can be decomposed into two aspects:\n\n* Showing that *valid* consent was given. The manner in which you ask for consent must enable a free choice, and must respect that \"no consent\" is the default. For example, you could archive screenshots of the cookie management flow to show that there is a free choice. You could archive the frontend software so that it can be demonstrated that the cookie is not set until consent is given.\n* Showing that *this user* gave consent. There is a wide variety of opinions on how to do that.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the existence of a cookie paired with a valid consent flow to set that cookie demonstrates that the cookie can only have been set in a valid manner.\n\nHowever, there are consent management solutions that provide additional insight, such as the user's entire history of giving and revoking consent. For example, the user's browser might generate a pseudonymous ID enabling that user's consent history to be stored on some server. Indeed, that would be personal data, and this would have to be disclosed transparently. It would not be valid to use the consent management information for other purposes, for example by using the consent management ID for analytics purposes.\n\nStoring the user's consent history is definitely appropriate if you have a concept of identity, such as for signed\\-in users. I have doubts whether this is also helpful on websites that don't have user accounts, and I have not heard of a case where the existence of such records made a difference. After all, such records can only be relevant if the user gave consent but later disputes this in a complaint with a DPA or in a lawsuit.\n\nWhich approach to choose will depend on more specific guidance provided by your country's data protection authority, and on the risk balance appropriate for your business. After all, the purpose of such compliance work is not to be 100% safe from lawsuits, but to reduce risks from enforcement/litigation to acceptable levels. What is acceptable is ultimately a business decision. E.g. the only 100% safe way to do web analytics is to have no analytics at all, but that is not acceptable for most businesses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company uses an analytics cookie on their website to recognize returning visitors.

You turn to [ORS 166\\.435](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_166.435). The answer (reflecting the logic of the statute) is \"No\", with some exceptions. There are conditions (subsections 2 and 3\\) where it is allowed if certain restrictions are satisfied. But you don't have to abide by those restrictions if subsection 4 is the case. Apart from transfers to and from the government, you can freely transfer a firearm under subsection (4\\)c to a spouse, domestic partner, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, first cousin, niece, nephew, or spouse or domestic partner any of the above. And under (4d), because of the death of firearm owner if \"conducted or facilitated by a personal representative\" (probate) or trustee as created in a will and transferee is one of those relatives. Not a friend, not a second cousin, not an ex\\-spouse, definitely not a stranger.\n\nOtherwise, you have to comply with subsection (2\\-3\\).

He didn't even bother to stop. Instead, he called his sister and friend to get him to Serbia border where he fled to Serbia. Later he turned himself and was extradited to Bosnia where the trial began. Now the trial is over and he is accused of \"causing general danger\" and \"not helping injured\", but there is no mention of killing someone. The prosecutors want the maximum sentence for those two crimes which is, I believe, only 8 years. \n\nSo, how would the crime be treated in the US? What would be the charges? What is the maximum sentence he could get?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that this wasn't a planned murder or assault, the most serious charge would be vehicular homicide. In the US, this is governed by state law, but states are not radically different in whether this is a crime. In Washington, under [RCW 46\\.61\\.520](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.520), vehicular homicide is a [class A felony](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.20&full=true), punishable by\n\n> imprisonment in a state correctional institution for a maximum term\n>  fixed by the court of not less than twenty years, or by a fine in an\n>  amount fixed by the court of not more than fifty thousand dollars, or\n>  by both such imprisonment and fine\n\nThe crimes is defined as causing death while driving\n\n> (a) While under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, as\n>  defined by RCW 46\\.61\\.502; or (b) In a reckless manner; or (c) With\n>  disregard for the safety of others.\n\nand such speeding is highly likely to be found to constitute the element of recklessness. There are also [hit\\-and\\-run charges](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.52.020), which is a class B felony (10 years and $20,000\\). A person can be found guilty of both charges, and the judge can apply the prison sentences consecutively, meaning you add them up, rather than serve the jail time at the same time (in this case, essentially dispensing with the hit\\-and\\-run term). The law is written so that a killing is a crime, and if you kill two people that could be two charges (the question is whether there is a single act or two \u2013 most likely there was a single act in this particular case). There is no state where recklessly killing a person while driving is legal.\n\nFirst degree murder could be considered under [9A.32\\.030](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.32&full=true) if a person \"Under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life, he or she engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to any person, and thereby causes the death of a person\". That kind of charge was applied to the [Charlottesville driver](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/driver-accused-of-plowing-into-charlottesville-crowd-killing-heather-heyer-due-in-court/2017/12/13/6cbb4ce8-e029-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?utm_term=.dc8dd11b7d35), but it is highly unlikely to be applied to even the most extreme speeding.\n\nThe actual penalty imposed depends on the sentencing laws of the state. In Washington there is a complex calculation based on the severity of the crime (16 degrees \u2013 vehicular homicide is level 11\\), prior criminal history, whether there are multiple convictions (vehicular homicide and hit\\-and\\-run). Aggravating and mitigating circumstances can also be considered to compute the actual sentence; I don't see any way for a non\\-specialist to guess what the actual penalty would be in this case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, a driver kills two teenage pedestrians by speeding through a red light at 105 km/h in a 60 km/h zone.

Additionally, hit-and-run charges could apply, which can carry up to 10 years. If convicted on both charges and sentenced consecutively, the driver could face up to 30 years in prison.

Suppose that also, the contract explicitly states that they are not going to have to pay for any additional software that will be required in the course of construction. Now, the hirer, during the course of development, asks the person to download a necessary component illegally. The developer is aware of this law and points out to them, as mentioned in the answers, that to do so is to commit a crime. The hirer responds with \"I don't want to pay for it, here you go, now download it\" and also that sie will not accept software developed with another tool. You tell them again, point blank, it's a crime. They repeat the demand. Then, in response, with no further warning, not feeling up to doing the job anymore, you, the developer, simply walk away and abscond from the contract of your own volition and agency as a free human being, never delivering anything and just letting it go.\n\nThe question is:\n\n* how serious is what you have done, legally? If the contractor tries to take you to court for a breach and you argue you didn't do nuffin because it said explicitly that you would not incur any fees and the hirer was demanding a criminal act on your part, would you be able to be absolved of any liability? If you are not, what sort of consequences as in damages could you expect?\n* from a moral point of view, since I like to have both, to how rightfully an extent should this or not prejudice your reputation many years in the future by other assessing your trust?

The developer's refusal to commit a crime is justifiable, but unilaterally terminating the contract without attempting to find a legal solution might still result in some liability.
