He loves weapons. Above all, he loves practice shooting with his shotgun, which he jokingly nicknamed *shotzooka*.\n\nOne summer, Billy decides to innovate. He spends his days adding new features to his shotzooka. First, he adds a telescope. Then he adds a laser sight. But does not stop there. Somehow he manages to attach a remotely controlled anti\\-tank guided missile to his beloved gun.\n\nThe now upgraded shotzooka is capable of immense destructive power. Strangely enough, though, the weapon still resembles a regular shotgun. Billy decides to test his weapon's new capabilities on a tree. He locks his target, then takes a 180 degree turn and pulls the trigger. The missile turns 180 around and, flying at Mach 3 speed, pulverizes the tree to the ground. Billy had never had such power in his hands.\n\nCan Billy legally possess his *shotzooka*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, we need to determine what laws this new hybrid gun falls under. We got a normal shotgun, which in itself might be under the National Firearms Act (NFA) a Class 3 Destructive device, but most aren't. So, let's assume \"Shotzooka\" is a standard Remington 870\\.\n\nBecause Billy wants his gun to be more compact, he shortens the gun with a telescopic stock. Great, there are 2 options for that: a full stock that can be lengthened and one that is pretty much folding out completely. This can be a problem if the total gun in its shortest configuration gets below 26 inches length \\- then it is illegal under Texas law as a short barrel firearm. And the complete removal makes it **no longer** a shotgun under federal law but pushes it to a different weapon category: Any Other Weapon. Since it once was a proper shotgun (which means it had a stock) it can't ever become a Pistol Grip Firearm.\n\nNow, here comes the crux: owning and operating these is totally fine if you have them registered at the Bureau of Alcohol Tabacco and Firearms. But you need to register your intent to manufacture them **before** you start with the conversion and have the approval of your project. It also costs 200$ tax \\-but you need to also make sure your new gun is allowed locally (see below).\n\nThe Laser sight likely isn't a problem... but now comes the really big problem:\n\nThe laser\\-guided anti\\-tank missile. THAT is a problem. Because anti\\-tank weapons are explosive and all explosives are classed as Destructive Devices under the NFA (well,technically that's Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968 amending the NFA of 1934\\...). And possession of such a Title II weapon like a Destructive Devices demands them to be registered and tax\\-stamoed for 200$ federally \\- and manufacturing them is prohibited for private citizens.\n\nThis means in the act of mounting the missile to his shotzooka he turned her into an illegal, unregisterable NFA Class3 DD of the explosive type, illegally manufactured it, and just for the possession alone put himself up to a [fine of 250k and 10 years jail time:](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/houston/press-releases/2011/texas-man-charged-with-unlawfully-possessing-destructive-devices)\n\n> The charge of unlawful possession of a destructive device in violation of the National Firearms Act carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nBut the trouble doesn't stop there, Texas itself has a penal code that defines that anti\\-tank missile somewhere! [Texas Penal Code, Title 10, Chapter 46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm):\n\n> 46\\.01 DEFINITIONS\n> \n> \n> (2\\) \"Explosive weapon\" means any explosive or incendiary bomb, grenade, rocket, or mine, that is designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting serious bodily injury, death, or substantial property damage, or for the principal purpose of causing such a loud report as to cause undue public alarm or terror, and includes a device designed, made, or adapted for delivery or shooting an explosive weapon.\n> \n> \n> (10\\) \"Short\\-barrel firearm\" means a rifle with a barrel length of less than 16 inches or a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches, or any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle if, as altered, it has an overall length of less than 26 inches.\n\n> 46\\.05\\.

See that? The mounting of the missile launcher just turned the gun highly illegal, and even in the act of shortening the shotgun by altering the stock to be telescopic, it might have become illegal if the gun became too short. And it gets worse. The mere possession of the guided missile is impossible unless it's a curio or relic (which would mean it is old!) or registered, but it can't be because private citizens can't make it... and even owning the **parts** for the missile would be illegal if they would be used in a crime... wait, manufacturing of a missile **is** a crime, so owning the parts also is a crime!\n\ntl;dr:\n------\n\nBilly is screwed under **both** texas and federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal analysis of Billy's \"shotzooka\" in Texas, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Billy can legally possess the \"shotzooka\" as long as he registers it with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and pays a $200 tax stamp.\n\nB) The \"shotzooka\" is legal under Texas law but violates federal regulations due to the anti-tank missile attachment.\n\nC) Billy has committed multiple violations of both Texas state law and federal law, potentially facing severe penalties including fines and imprisonment.\n\nD) The \"shotzooka\" is legal as long as Billy removes the anti-tank missile and ensures the overall length remains above 26 inches.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Billy has violated multiple state and federal laws by creating and possessing the \"shotzooka\". The anti-tank missile attachment classifies the weapon as a Destructive Device under the National Firearms Act, which is illegal for private citizens to manufacture. This violates both federal law and Texas Penal Code. Additionally, if the telescopic stock shortened the overall length to less than 26 inches, it would violate Texas law on short-barrel firearms. The possession of explosive components (the missile) with intent to use in a criminal endeavor (manufacturing an illegal weapon) is also a separate offense under Texas law.

Since you already asked the council, they may already be considering such a law.\n\nAnd, depending on the county, the council could invoke a law addressing threats to the public that has more severe penalties that the state law, because Missouri is a [home rule (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule_in_the_United_States) state.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under Missouri law, which of the following scenarios could potentially be considered making a terrorist threat in the first degree?\n\nA) Installing a visible security camera on your property\nB) Putting up a \"Beware of Dog\" sign in your front yard\nC) Installing a fake gun turret that tracks pedestrians walking by your property\nD) Verbally warning trespassers to leave your property\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because installing a fake gun turret that tracks pedestrians could be interpreted as making a terrorist threat under Missouri Revised Statute 574.115. This action could cause \"a false belief or fear that an incident has occurred or that a condition exists involving danger to life\" (RSMo 574.115.1(3)). It's likely to frighten multiple people and could be seen as an implied threat.\n\nOption A (installing a visible security camera) is a common and generally accepted security measure that doesn't typically cause fear of danger to life.\n\nOption B (putting up a \"Beware of Dog\" sign) is also a common warning that doesn't usually rise to the level of causing fear of danger to life in most circumstances.\n\nOption D (verbally warning trespassers) is generally within a property owner's rights and doesn't typically constitute a terrorist threat unless the warning itself contains extreme threats of violence.\n\nThe fake gun turret in Option C stands out as the most likely to cause widespread fear and be interpreted as a threat under the statute."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76388/i-supposedly-owe-91-dollars-for-a-4-dollar-toll-from-half-a-decade-ago-can-it-b", "docs_id": 76388, "title": "I supposedly owe 91 dollars for a 4 dollar toll from half a decade ago.

But it's okay because Delaware has an amnesty program and if I just pay in the next 20 days I 'only' have to pay 64 dollars on my 4 dollar toll.\n\nAs I said the state is hours of driving away from me and I couldn't imagine why I would be driving through it, though it's close enough, and long enough ago, that I can't rule out some forgotten long drive that took me through it. I've always had an ez\\-pass though so I would think any toll would have been automatically payed anyways. I've never received any notice about this supposed toll before today. I'd honestly suspect a phishing attempt if it wasn't for their asking me to pay via credit card in an easily tracked and recoverable manner, plus sending physical mail and knowing my license plate isn't the sort of thing phishers are likely to do.\n\nHowever, even if the fee was real I dispute being asked to pay non\\-payment penalties for a charge I was never informed I owe, plus I'm still skeptical how a 4 dollar toll qualifies as a 'violent crime'.

EZ Pass violation notices can be appealed.\n\nYour communication is apparently from a debt collector. You may demand evidence that the debt is valid before deciding whether to pay or contest the alleged debt. Or you can go straight to the Delaware EZ Pass authorities.\n\nAccording to [this official EZ Pass FAQ](https://www.ezpassde.com/pages/FAQs.shtml):\n\n> Q: What do I do if I receive a Violation Notice?  \n> \n> A: A Toll Violation Notice is issued for every violation (see example). In addition to the toll, a Violation Notice has a $25 Administrative Fee, $10 Ambulance Company Fund Fee, and a $15 fee to Combat Violent Crimes.\n> \n> \n> A Toll Violation Final Notice (see example) is issued if the Violation Notice has not been paid within 30 days. The Toll Violation Final Notice adds a Civil Penalty of $25 and a Civil Penalty Surcharge of $12\\.50 to the fees listed on the first Notice of Toll Violation. If the Toll Violation Final Notice is not paid, it will be subject to registration hold, collection activities or legal action.\n\nThose fees would add up to $91\\.50 on a $4 toll if a violation went unpaid for 30 days or more. Note that the \"violent crimes part\" is to fund the \"Combat Violent Crimes\" program, not because a toll violation is itself violent.\n\nThe FAQ goes on to state:\n\n> Q: How can I appeal my violation?  \n> \n> A: Delaware E\\-ZPass Customers with accounts in good standing can appeal their violation notices by accessing the [Appeal Page](https://acct.ezpassde.com/Violations.aspx) of this website, over the phone, in person, by fax or mail.

A friend of mine is a webcam model for a video chat site. She lives outside of the U.S. and because of this she has had difficulty getting videos of her public and private shows removed from various third party sites. It is unclear to me at this point whether or not the difficulty stems from the websites' unwillingness to remove the content based on her location, or if it is more a matter of her not fully understanding the English language and not meeting the requirements for an effective DMCA takedown notice. So my questions are:\n\n* What makes for an effective DMCA takedown notice specifically in regards to websites that host pornographic material?\n* Is a website more likely to respond to a DMCA takedown notice if the notice comes from within the United States?\n* If the answer to the previous question is Yes: how would someone from outside of the United States authorize someone residing in the United States to send a DMCA takedown notice on their behalf?\n* When sending a DMCA takedown notice, does one send the notice directly to the website in question?\n\nMany pornographic websites have a DMCA link on their page. One such site has this to say when clicking that link:\n\n> Requesting for DMCA removal\n> \n> \n> Depending on which part of example.tv site your material (videos or pictures) was posted, you can request for removal. If you wish to remove any material (picture or video) or have some information changed, you must identify yourself and prove that you are who you claim to be. To do so, you can simply take a picture of you (with face) holding a sign with the following written: \"I am MODEL NAME for example.tv\". Attach this picture when sending your request to admin@example.tv.\n\n* My final question \\- supposing we send a takedown notice to a website; might they be more inclined to remove the content had we played by their rules? Is this something a model should consider doing or would it be better to take the formal legal route of sending a DMCA takedown notice?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. If any further information is needed please let me know and I will supply all that I can.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: DMCA applies as long as the the website is being *hosted* inside the U.S. The location of the copyright holder is irrelevant.\n\nFor step\\-by\\-step help drafting a valid DMCA notice, see Step 2 of <https://nppa.org/page/5617>. If the site fails to comply with a valid notice, they lose the benefit of DMCA's safe harbor provisions and become themselves liable for continuing to host the infringing work, and you can sue them. (Prior filing suit, though, I imagine a letter from a lawyer that says, \"Hey, my client sent you a valid DMCA notice a while ago; kindly comply at once, or we will actually sue you,\" should be sufficient.)\n\nThe requirement to submit a photo appears to be totally unnecessary. A valid DMCA notice includes a signature (electronically including your name in an email is sufficient) and an assertion, under penalty of perjury, that the writer is authorized to control the copyright work and that the work is being used illegally. Beyond a signature and contact information, no further identity verification is necessary. The DMCA handles this by opening the submitter to perjury charges if the takedown was submitted illegally.\n\nOf course, any site might choose to ignore your DMCA takedown, at their own peril. They might bet that you won't actually hire a lawyer and follow through on your legal right to file suit, or they might not understand that identity verification is not a legal requirement listed in [17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512).

The DMCA applies to websites hosted in the US, regardless of the copyright holder's location. A valid DMCA takedown notice does not require the sender to be in the US or to hire a US-based representative.

The act of downloading itself is a form of reproduction, regardless of whether the individual intends to redistribute the content or use it for personal purposes. Both countries explicitly state that downloading without authority from the copyright owner is an infringement. The concept of \"information wants to be free\" or the lack of redistribution does not make the act legal.

I doubt that your strategy would work.\n\nThe GDPR does not explicitly allow you to choose in which format your requests will be answered. If the data controller chooses a different format or medium, I would assume they are compliant. All the GDPR says is this (Art 12(1\\)):\n\n> The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.\n\nFor example, it would likely be perfectly compliant if they provide a response through physical mail. Electronic mail is common as a convenience to both parties. You as the data subject have no legal basis for forcing the data controller to interact with any website.\n\nFurthermore, the GDPR does not give you a right to receive responses in a machine\\-readable format. In addition to your Art 15 right to access, you may have a separate Art 20 right to data portability. While generally similar \u2013 and usually handled by data controllers together \u2013 they have different conditions and cover different information. For example, information on the source and recipients of personal data is required under Art 15(1\\) letters (c) and (g), but that information will usually not be machine readable and is not in scope of Art 20\\. In any case, there are no commonly used machine\\-readable formats for responses to data subject requests, so that each controller could choose its own format (typically a JSON or XML file or a ZIP archive with a custom schema/structure) \u2013 but only for the copy of your data, not for the additional information mentioned in Art 15\\.\n\nSending data subject requests from a no\\-reply address could be an indication that you're not actually interested in the responses, which could indicate that your requests are \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d and can therefore be rejected under Art 12(5\\).

Article 12(1) of the GDPR states that information \"shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.\" This gives data controllers flexibility in how they respond, as long as they meet the GDPR's requirements. While electronic means (like email) are common, data controllers are not obligated to use a specific web form or website provided by the data subject. They can choose alternative methods, such as email or physical mail, that still comply with the GDPR's requirements for providing information.

Additionally, the answer mentions that Canonical's policy has serious problems, particularly in relation to GPL licensing, suggesting that their policy is not as enforceable as they claim.

There are all sorts of laws establishing duties of care, such as between doctor and patient, which may be created by a legislature or may be part of common law tradition. There is a duty of care imposed on a landlord w.r.t. the tenant, requiring that the premise be \"secure\", therefore a landlord might easily be held liable if the main door into the building was not locked. This duty is a specific instance of a general duty from tradesman/businessman to customer.\n\nAs far as I can determine, there is no such statutory duty imposed on tenants in Washington state, and none from case law being revealed by a few cursory searches. In order to be subsumed under general \"everybody has a duty to everybody else\" law, the damage would have to be foreseeable. It is said that \"If something is foreseeable, it is a probable and predictable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligent actions or inaction\". This mean that a reasonable person would have known that, under the circumstances, the damage is likely to result. Circumstances vary quite a bit, and there is no general rule about holding the door open for another person.

The question of liability hinges on whether Alice breached a duty of care and if the damage was foreseeable. \n\nIn option B, two critical factors increase the foreseeability of the damage:\n1. Clear signage instructing residents not to let in strangers - This establishes a clear expectation and guideline for resident behavior.\n2. The area being known for high crime rates - This increases the likelihood that allowing a stranger in could result in criminal activity.\n\nThese circumstances make it more likely that a court would find that a reasonable person should have foreseen the potential for harm, thus potentially making Alice liable for breaching her duty of care.\n\nOptions A, C, and D present scenarios where Alice's actions might be seen as more reasonable or where the potential for harm might be less foreseeable, making liability less likely in those cases."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41862/can-liability-for-data-disclosure-be-waived-by-tcs-under-gdpr", "docs_id": 41862, "title": "Can liability for data disclosure be waived by T&amp;Cs under GDPR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in Ireland, an EU county subject to the GDPR.\n\nI see in a service T\\&Cs the line:\n\n> \"Despite our use of commercially reasonable efforts to protect your\n>  Personal Information from unauthorized access or disclosure, the\n>  Internet is not an inherently secure environment and so we cannot\n>  guarantee the security of your Personal Information.

Words can have different meanings in particular contexts and can be defined in a contract or statute to have a meaning different from the common meaning.\n\n**\"Person\" Usually Includes Entities Of Any Kind**\n\nThis said, usually the term \"person\" in the law refers to any human being and any trust, estate or entity that is capable of suing and being sued and entering into contracts. \n\nAn \"entity\" in this sense would often include partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, non\\-profit associations (whether or not incorporated), business trusts, joint ventures, local governments, states, the federal government and foreign governments. \n\n(I break out trusts and estates separately because there is divided authority in different jurisdictions over whether trusts and estates are entities, or are simply a special hat that the trustee or executor wears that are not entities, which can be relevant in some highly technical situations.)\n\n**Agency Situations**\n\nThe term \"person\" is also often used in the sense that it refers to the principal and not the agent, when an agent is taking action on behalf of the principal. \n\nThus, if there is a law that says \"a person who enters into a real estate contract must disclose that person's taxpayer identification number\", and someone with a power of attorney from you signs a real estate contract on your behalf, the power of attorney agent should disclosure your taxpayer identification number and not theirs.\n\n**Why Is The Term \"Person\" Defined So Broadly?**\n\nOne important reason for using the term \"person\" to apply to entities as well as human beings, is that it allows for statutes and contract terms or case law legal rules to be stated in very general terms without being wordy in a way that accurately reflects how those legal rules or contract terms should apply to entities.\n\nFor example, a statute using the word \"person\" might say: \n\n> A person who is engaged in business in this state must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nBy using the word \"person\" in this way, the statute wouldn't have to say instead (probably less accurately and less comprehensibly): \n\n> Any individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation,\n>  business trust, non\\-business trust, estate, governmental entity, or\n>  other entity, including the principal of any agent acting on behalf of\n>  the principal, engaged in business in this state, must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nThe phrasing without the word \"person\" would be more likely to create loopholes because some kind of entity is omitted, and would be prone to ambiguity because one would have to decide which words that define the kind of persons and entities that are covered modify which other words in the sentence. \n\nThus, using the word \"person\" is often makes entities more rather than less accountable to the law, by making legal language more clear and more general (and hence containing fewer loopholes).\n\n**\"Individual\" or \"Natural Person\"**\n\nUsually the term \"individual\" or \"natural person\" would mean a human being, although, of course, there are other senses of the word \"individual\" such as \"an individual Widget\" referring to exactly one Widget in particular, as opposed to Widgets in general.\n\n**Alternative Definitions Of \"Person\"**\n\nThere are isolated times when the word \"person\" would not include minors and incapacitated people who are incapable of suing or entering into contracts in their own name due to lack of legal capacity.\n\nIt isn't uncommon to have a definition of \"person\" in a statute or contract that omits governmental entities, that omits all kinds of entities, or that omits particular kinds of entities (e.g. foreign entities or corporations).\n\nFor example, a tax statute might define \"person\" in a way that includes natural persons and entities, but excludes governments.\n\nSome of the definitions of terms like these in the bankruptcy code are particularly non\\-intuitive.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under U.S. law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal definition of \"person\"?\n\nA) \"Person\" always exclusively refers to human beings and never includes any type of business entity or organization.\n\nB) \"Person\" typically includes only natural persons (human beings) and corporations, but never includes other types of entities such as trusts or government bodies.\n\nC) \"Person\" usually refers to any human being and any entity capable of suing, being sued, and entering into contracts, including various types of organizations and even government entities.\n\nD) \"Person\" has a single, fixed definition that applies uniformly across all U.S. legal contexts and statutes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the term \"person\" in U.S. law usually refers to any human being and any trust, estate, or entity capable of suing, being sued, and entering into contracts. This broad definition typically includes various types of organizations such as partnerships, corporations, non-profit associations, and even government entities.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it's too narrow. While \"person\" can include human beings, it's not limited to them and often includes various types of entities.\n\nAnswer B is also incorrect. While it acknowledges that \"person\" can include more than just human beings, it's still too limited. The definition usually extends beyond just natural persons and corporations to include other types of entities.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the reality of legal definitions. The information clearly states that words, including \"person,\" do not have uniform definitions for all times, places, and contexts. The definition can vary depending on the specific statute, contract, or legal context.\n\nOption C accurately captures the broad and flexible nature of how \"person\" is typically defined in U.S. law, while also acknowledging its wide-ranging applicability to various entities beyond just human beings."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7390/are-there-restrictions-on-parental-rights-to-limit-a-minors-association", "docs_id": 7390, "title": "Are there restrictions on parental rights to limit a minor&#39;s association?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: At what age does an individual gain the right to associate freely? For example, could parents bar contact with volunteers from a LBGTQ group to a child if the parents were (by ideal/simplified hypothetical case) in no way harming the child?\n\nI think this could apply to religious groups as well, but looking through the family law of a few states, it might also represent a special case. Could parents bar their child from associating with religious groups (or a\\-religious) they oppose?\n\nIs there a responsibility of any such group to get parental consent? \n\nGoing back to the two examples: Let's say an LGBTQ group was having a non\\-privileged support group meeting (no professional or licensed therapists present) and a local mosque was having a youth prayer meeting.

If there were some archetype examples, I would appreciate it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The constitutional protection afforded people in the United States for freedom of association is protection from interference by the government and its agents.\n\nUntil the age of majority, or emancipation by a court of law, parents enjoy broad discretion over the activities of their children including with whom they can associate.\n\nComplexities do arise for children of divorced parents *who disagree* as to who can set the characteristics of how the children are raised. In these cases family court intervention is used to deem what's in the best interest of the child.\n\nComplexities can also arise for children facing medical treatment. The most common example would be a parent attempting to refuse specific care for their child. In these cases it's possible to get a court to deem the parents \"unfit\" in order to force the medical treatment to go forward. This is usually a high\\-bar to achieve as the courts don't want to interfere in the parent\\-child relationship unless there is no other choice. Such medical treatment can also apply to mental\\-health services.\n\nNew York, [as an example](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx),\n\n> allows the local commissioner of social services or local commissioner\n>  of health to give consent for medical, dental, health and hospital services for any child found by the family court to be an abused, neglected or destitute child.\n\nOklahoma created the [Parent's Bill of Rights](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx) (same link as above) which:\n\n> prohibited the state from infringing upon parental rights, directed the board of education of a school district to develop a policy listing parental rights related to education, including sex education; prohibited a surgical procedure on a minor without parental consent\u2014excluding abortion\u2014 and, prohibited a mental health evaluation of a minor without parental consent.\n\nYou will find that it will take court intervention to interfere with parental discretion and that court intervention will likely need to find the parents unfit to make the decision. Assuming the advocacy groups you outline in your question are not providing medical care it is extremely unlikely that a court will interfere.\n\nThe right of association is not implicated in your question because it is not the government preventing the child from participating.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 15-year-old wants to attend meetings of an LGBTQ support group, but their parents object.

According to the documentation, parents have broad discretion over their children's activities, including associations, until the age of majority or emancipation. The constitutional right to freedom of association protects against government interference, not parental decisions. The LGBTQ group would not typically be held liable for the child's attendance unless they were providing medical care without consent. Court intervention to override parental decisions usually requires proving the parents unfit, which is a high bar to meet. The child cannot easily petition the court to overrule their parents without demonstrating a significant issue like medical necessity or parental unfitness."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85973/how-to-address-a-conclusory-statement", "docs_id": 85973, "title": "How to address a Conclusory Statement", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that a **[conclusory statement](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/conclusory)** consists of, or relates to, a conclusion or assertion for which no supporting evidence is offered.\n\nUPDATE: Assume that Bob worked in the US in 2021 and had a duty to pay Federal income tax and failed to do so.\n\nFor example, as a working American, Bob has a duty to file and pay Federal income tax.\n\nAn IRS investigator sends a letter to Bob indicating Bob did not file and pay his 2021 federal income tax.

Under the act, your complain would have to be about one of a number of things, including most likely\n\n> (iii) the services hired or availed of or agreed to be hired or\n> availed of by him suffer from deficiency in any respect;\n\nwhere furthermore\n\n> \"deficiency\" means any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inade\u00adquacy\n> in the quality, nature and manner of performance which is required to\n> be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or has\n> been undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract\n> or otherwise in relation to any service;\n\nand\n\n> \"service\" means service of any description which is made avail\u00adable to\n> potential users and includes, but not limited to, the provision of\n> facilities in connection with banking, financing insurance, transport,\n> processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or\n> both, housing construction, entertainment, amusement or the purveying\n> of news or other information, but does not include the rendering of\n> any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service;\n\nThere have been conflicting reports as to whether education is a \"service\", but the recent ruling (2 Feb 2021\\) by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in the case [Rajendra Kumar Gupta vs Dr. Virendra Swarup Public School](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/28032203/) states its position:\n\n> It is settled law, as stated in the aforementioned precedents set by\n> the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as this Commission, that Educational\n> Institutions do not fall within the ambit of the Consumer Protection\n> Act, 1986 and education which includes co\\-curricular activities such\n> as swimming, is not a \"service\" within the meaning of the Consumer\n> Protection Act, 1986\n\nThe Supreme Court of India in [Maharshi Dayanand University v. Surjeet Kaur](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1419708/) rejected an interpretation by NCDRC which concluded that education is a service, instead saying\n\n> The respondent as a student is neither a consumer nor is the appellant\n> rendering any service...The case decided by this Court in [Bihar School\n> Examination Board](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/615635/) (supra) clearly lays down the law in this regard\n> with which we find ourselves in full agreement with\n\nIn the Bihar decision, (1\\) the defendant was the examination board and (2\\) the Board is a statutory creation. Para. 11\n\n> The object of the Act is to cover in its net, services offered or\n> rendered for a consideration. Any service rendered for a consideration\n> is presumed to be a commercial activity in its broadest sense\n> (including professional activity or quasi\\-commercial activity).

The fact\n> that in the course of conduct of the examination, or evaluation of\n> answer\\-scripts, or furnishing of mark\\-sheets or certificates, there\n> may be some negligence, omission or deficiency, does not convert the\n> Board into a service\\-provider for a consideration, nor convert the\n> examinee into a consumer who can make a complaint under the Act. We\n> are clearly of the view that the Board is not a `service provider' and a student who takes an examination is not a` consumer' and\n> consequently, complaint under the Act will not be maintainable against\n> the Board.\n\nThe Maharshi case likewise involved a legislatively\\-created educational institution.\n\nIn [Anupama College Of Engineering vs Gulshan Kumar](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/31263824/), the Supreme Court cited an order from P.T. Koshy \\& Anr. v. Ellen Charitable Trust \\& Ors (which appears to be unpublished) that\n\n> In view of the judgment of this Court in Maharshi Dayanand University\n> v. Surjeet Kaur \\[(2010\\) 11 SCC 159] wherein this Court placing\n> reliance on all earlier judgments has categorically held that\n> education is not a Signature Not Verified commodity.

Such matters cannot be entertained by the\n> Consumer Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986\\.\n\nGiven the definite policy of the NCDRC, you *cannot* file a complain in consumer court. Theoretically, you could appeal up to the Indian Supreme Court, if you can distinguish your case from the Maharshi U case. Two issues raised in that case and the Bihar case that is foundational for the later case are whether the institute is a statutory institution or a private business, and whether you are a paying customer (paying tuition, not just fees). Even the most recent NCDRC ruling leaves open a distinguishing factor, that the putative deficiency relates not to education, but to an extracurricular activity made available by the institution. I conclude that the Supreme Court of India has *not* made a broad ruling that \"education is not a service\", it has ruled more narrowly that in certain cases, a specific education\\-related entity is not providing a \"service\"\n\nIf you sue, it will be dismissed, and you will have to appeal to the highest court.

The Supreme Court has not made a broad, all-encompassing ruling that \"education is not a service.\" Instead, it has ruled more narrowly in specific cases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the rulings have not definitively excluded all educational activities in all circumstances.\n\nOption B is too narrow, as even some private institutions have been exempt in certain rulings.\n\nOption C is incorrect, as the NCDRC has actually stated that educational institutions do not fall within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act.\n\nOption D is correct because the Supreme Court's rulings have left some room for interpretation.

In legal interpretation, when faced with conflicting clauses, the more specific and clearly defined clause typically takes precedence.

It relies from this on the concept of country of origin. Assuming that the book was originally published in the UK (as it has a London based publisher) then the applicable copyright law is that of the UK.\n\nExceptions to copyright can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exceptions-to-copyright). The relevant exemption is the first part of the *Teaching* section:\n\n> the copying of works in any medium as long as the use is solely to illustrate a point, it is not done for commercial purposes, it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement, and the use is fair dealing.\n\nAcknowledgement is pretty straightforward but *fair dealing* as a legal concept means:\n\n> There is no statutory definition of fair dealing \\- it will always be a matter of fact, degree and impression in each case. The question to be asked is: how would a fair\\-minded and honest person have dealt with the work?\n> \n> \n> Factors that have been identified by the courts as relevant in determining whether a particular dealing with a work is fair include:\n> \n> \n> * does using the work affect the market for the original work? If a use of a work acts as a substitute for it, causing the owner to lose revenue, then it is not likely to be fair\n> * is the amount of the work taken reasonable and appropriate? Was it necessary to use the amount that was taken? Usually only part of a work may be used\n> \n> \n> The relative importance of any one factor will vary according to the case in hand and the type of dealing in question.\n\nIf the work had been simultaneously or previously published in the USA the relevant consideration is *fair use* rather than *fair dealing*.

However, the Statute provides that the signature may be made by a person authorised by you.\n* In Australia, a Commonwealth income tax return must be signed by the taxpayer. The taxpayer must sign it personally. If you get your assistant to sign it then you haven't filled it in properly and you are liable to be fined for failure to lodge a valid tax return. There are rules in the legislation for corporations, e.g. the public officer signs it. Sometimes the law allows a tax agent/accountant to sign a form. The theme is that the law provides specific rules.\n* In Australia, banknotes must bear the signatures of two senior officials such as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. However, the law imposing this requirement allows a great deal of flexibility about how these signatures are applied, freeing these officials from the tedium of signing millions of banknotes: Reserve Bank Act 1959, s 37\\.\n\nIn the case of a letter, there are no specific laws about who can sign it and how. You could very well get an employee to sign it for you.\n\nThe other issue to be aware of is deception. If I write you a letter signed \"Kim Kardashian\", but she has no idea I've done this and has not given me permission, but I lead you to believe that Kim Kardashian just wrote you a letter saying you're great, and then you go and embarrass yourself posting that letter on Facebook, then potentially I am in a bit of trouble. (A more serious example would be where I impersonate your bank and purport to waive the repayments on your mortgage, resulting in you defaulting.) In such a case, the relevant laws are the various laws to do with deception, not laws specifically about who can sign a document.\n\n**Is it legal for a single individual to use multiple signatures when signing legal documents (ie, is there a requirement your signature be identifiable or consistent)?**\n\nThis is fine. A real signature is not like a cryptographic signature. Its function is not to, by itself, prove the authenticity of a document. The act of signing something is significant because it shows commitment, etc, and for very important documents (e.g. deeds) people (or the law) will ask for the signature to be witnessed. The verification in that case comes from the witness being able to testify as to who they saw sign the document, not the appearance of the signature itself. \n\nKeep in mind that the law related to signatures evolved at a time when not everybody could write their name and continues to accomodate people who cannot today. \n\nThere is no reason or principle requiring an individual to use a consistent signature.\n\nThere is a practical exception in relation to banks. Banks keep a specimen signature on file for each customer and use this to decide whether to accept withdrawal slips, cheques etc. It is not an ideal system (it is not hard to forge a signature well enough to get past a teller) but in conjunction with the banks' other fraud prevention methods it is the best they can do. However, this is a matter of their own risk management not a legal requirement.

According to the documentation, there is no legal requirement for an individual to use a consistent signature across documents. The answer states, \"There is no reason or principle requiring an individual to use a consistent signature.\" While authorization can be a factor in some cases (as mentioned in option B), it's not necessarily required for varying signatures.

If these allegations are to be used in a related lawsuit, the party attempting to use them as evidence still has the burden of proving that they are, in fact, true.

It will be divided among ten beneficiaries, each receiving a percentage.\n\nOne heir currently lives in a house that would be part of the estate. The elder relative has stated that they must keep the house, anything inside it, and perhaps some additional funds for property taxes and such \"off the top\" (meaning, they receive this in addition to their percentage of the remainder).\n\nFor reasons that stretch over decades of family history, I believe strongly in the justice of this arrangement (which I do not benefit from).
