I know that slavery is legal in the United States if it involves prisoners, but I am wondering if there are certain rights prisoners enjoy as forced labor. What are some of the rights that prisoners enjoy as forced labor in the United States if they have any?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary source of minimum wage and hours laws for the United States as a whole is the [Fair Labor Standard Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter8&edition=prelim). Generally [courts have held that prisoners are not employees within the meaning of the act](https://www.gao.gov/assets/ggd-93-98.pdf).\n\nThe amount paid for prison labor is a matter of state correctional system policy, and some states, such as Texas, pay nothing to prisoners for their labor, while others pay a tiny fraction of the federal minimum wage.\n\nThe main rights of prisoners who are detained pursuant to a conviction is to be free of physical harm arising from deliberate indifference to their well being, or to be free of punishment beyond what they were sentenced to for their crimes.

How about federally funded non\\-profits?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the [U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) website](http://www.eeoc.gov/employers/coverage.cfm):\n\n> An employer must have a certain number of employees to be covered by the laws we enforce. This number varies depending on the type of employer (for example, whether the employer is a private company, a state or local government agency, a federal agency, an employment agency, or a labor union) and the kind of discrimination alleged (for example, discrimination based on a person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information).\n\nAll employers are covered, whether or not a particular regulation covers a particular employer is dependent on the number of employees. For example, age discrimination is covered by employers who have more than 20 employees and Equal Pay Act coverage is for virtually all employers.\n\nFrom the same web site:\n\n> People who are not employed by the employer, such as independent contractors, are not covered by the anti\\-discrimination laws. Figuring out whether or not a person is an employee of an organization (as opposed to a contractor, for example) is complicated. If you aren't sure whether a person covered, you should contact one of our field offices as soon as possible so we can make that decision.\n\nThe EEOC has regulations covering:\n\n* [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_VII)\n* [The Pregnancy Discrimination Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_Discrimination_Act)\n* [The Equal Pay Act of 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963)\n* [The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_Discrimination_in_Employment_Act)\n* [Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990#Title_I.E2.80.94employment)\n* [Sections 102 and 103 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1991)\n* [Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973)\n* [The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act)\n\nThe EEOC is an agency responsible for creating rules and regulations and enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination. The regulations and enforcement actions are based on a large number of laws, any one of which may or may not apply to a particular employer.\n\nExemptions are based on a particular anti\\-discrimination law, not on the agency itself.

EEOC exemptions are not uniform across all anti-discrimination laws. Instead, they vary depending on the specific law in question and often relate to the number of employees an organization has. For example, age discrimination regulations apply to employers with more than 20 employees, while the Equal Pay Act covers virtually all employers. \n\nOption A is incorrect because non-profit status alone does not determine EEOC exemption. Option B is incorrect because the number of employees is often a key factor in determining coverage, not just the type of organization. Option C is incorrect because even federally funded non-profits may be exempt from certain EEOC regulations if they fall below the employee threshold for a particular law."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78593/credit-card-charged-but-domain-not-booked-by-a-domain-registrar-where-should-i-g", "docs_id": 78593, "title": "Credit card charged but domain not booked by a domain registrar where should I go against an International Merchant", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sav.com had latency in the month of October.

The campaign is wildly successful and raises $200,000. Sarah plans to use the funds to produce and ship the game, pay herself for her work, and cover other expenses. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding how Sarah can use the funds?\n\nA) Sarah must use all funds exclusively for production and shipping costs, and cannot pay herself a salary.\n\nB) Sarah can pay herself any amount she wants as long as she delivers the promised product to backers.\n\nC) Sarah can pay herself a reasonable salary based on industry standards, and may increase it if there are excess funds after covering all project costs.\n\nD) Sarah must set aside a fixed percentage (e.g., 20%) of the funds for taxes before determining her salary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Kickstarter guidelines, project creators can pay themselves a salary for their work on the project. This salary should be reasonable and comparable to industry standards. In cases where a project is overfunded, as in Sarah's case, the creator may choose to reinvest in the project, improve the product, or potentially increase their own compensation if all other project costs and obligations are covered.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Kickstarter does allow creators to pay themselves for their work. Answer B is too permissive, as it doesn't consider the responsibility to use funds appropriately and deliver the promised product. Answer D is incorrect because while taxes need to be considered, there's no fixed percentage requirement set by Kickstarter for tax allocation before determining salary."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64074/crime-in-one-country-criminal-from-another-whats-the-legal-recourse", "docs_id": 64074, "title": "Crime in one country, criminal from another, what&#39;s the legal recourse?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider a hypothetical situation where a USA citizen, present in Sri Lanka either legally or illegally, commits some murders and flees back to the USA. What can be done to bring this person to trial?\n\nSuppose there is no proof that this citizen killed two people. Of course, people saw them doing it, but they don't want to come forward as witnesses, and the family wants justice. Obviously, the police will want witness before issuing a warrant.\n\nIf this family is represented by a lawyer who appeals to the court, what will the court do? I'm not talking about extradition or something. It is more about bringing this person to trial, whether in USA or in Sri Lanka. What is the process after a crime's been committed and the perpetrator flees back to the safety of their country?\n\n### Supplemental Questions\n\n1. If a good lawyer was stating the question above, what would their precise terms be?\n2. Will this whole hypothetical situation fall under the case study of criminal law? Is it a matter of international laws as well?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the police or other authorities of Sri Lanka do not have witnesses or other evidences supporting that this American committed the crime, there is little that can be done. The police of Sri Lanka could ask the police of whatever locality the person is now in to interview the accused, which they might do as a favor, but are not obliged to do. If they do such an interview, the content would probably be sent to the Sri Lankan authorities. It might or might not be of help to them.\n\nIf the Sri Lankan authorities can assemble some evidence, they could apply for [extradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition). That is a matter which depends on the existence of a treaty. According to [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3181) there is an extradition treaty between the US and Sri Lanka, which became effective on Jan. 12, 2001\\.\n\nExtradition requests are normally subject to review by the courts and diplomatic authorities of the *sending nation*, that is the country that is requested to extradite a person. The request may be refused if there is not sufficient evidence, or if the charge is not a crime under the laws of the sending nation, or for other reasons specified in the law of the sending nation.\n\nIn the hypothetical case in the question, the main issue would probable be whether there was sufficient evidence. If it were claimed that the accused could not get a fair trial in Sri Lanka, or would be likely to be subject to torture there, that could also be a reason for refusal.\n\nIn the US this is handled under [18 USC 3184](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3184) This provides in relevant part that:\n\n> If, on such hearing, \\[the judge or magistrate] deems the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention, or under section 3181(b), he shall certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State, that a warrant may issue upon the requisition of the proper authorities of such foreign government, for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulations of the treaty or convention; and he shall issue his warrant for the commitment of the person so charged to the proper jail, there to remain until such surrender shall be made.\n\nI do not know the details of criminal procedure in Sri Lanka, so I don't know what, if anything, a court might do about such a case. In the US, a court would have nothing to do in such a matter until and unless the prosecutor was willing to present formal charges. Such charges would have to establish that there was *probable cause* to believe that a crime had been committed, and that the accused had comitted it, before a trial could be held.\n\nThe Sri Lankan authorities could also request that a relevant US prosecutor file charges and try the accused in a US court. In some cases the US will try US nationals for offenses committed outside the US. But in the kind of case described in the question, this would not be usual.\n\nIf Sri Lankan law permits, the authorities there could also try the accused *in absentia*. Many countries and many people regard this as fundamentally unfair, but it is sometimes done. In such a case, the person convicted *in absentia* could be arrested if s/he ever came within the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. Aside from that, Sri Lanka cannot bring the person to court unless they apply for and get extradition, or the person travels to Sri Lanka again and is arrested there.\n\nAs to the specific questions:\n\n> if a good lawyer was stating the question above, what would their precise terms be?\n\nThere are not very many specific terms to be used. The person said to have comitted the murder (or other crime) would probably be refereed to as \"the accused\" or possibly \"the alleged criminal\". If there is a specific term for the particular crime in Sri Lankan law, it would be used. If it were a real case, details such as the time and place of the crime would be given.\n\n> will this whole hypothetical situation fall under the case study of criminal law? I'm thinking international laws as well, but then I don't know for sure what international laws are, so there's that.\n\nYes, this is an aspect of criminal law, albeit one that most lawyers in criminal law practice never have occasion to deal with. In a sense there is no such thing as \"international law\", that is, law binding on countries. What is known as \"international law\" is the complex of treaties and agreements between various countries and the way in which they are given effect. Nations never have to enter into treaties, although there can be great pressure to do so. A nation can always denounce a treaty, although there may be consequences such as political or economic pressure, or in extreme cases, war.\n\n\"international law\" is also the accumulated precedents for how nations have interacted in the past over legal issues, but this is only binding in future cases to the extent that a given country's laws or courts treat it as binding, or that a current treaty makes it so."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a US citizen commits a murder in Sri Lanka and flees back to the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal process?\n\nA) Sri Lankan authorities can directly arrest the suspect in the US without any formal procedures.\n\nB) The US is obligated to try the suspect in a US court for crimes committed in Sri Lanka.\n\nC) Sri Lanka can request extradition, which would be subject to review by US courts and diplomatic authorities.\n\nD) The family of the victim can directly appeal to US courts to force the suspect's return to Sri Lanka.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. According to the information provided, if Sri Lankan authorities can gather sufficient evidence, they can apply for extradition. This process is governed by the extradition treaty between the US and Sri Lanka. The extradition request would be subject to review by US courts and diplomatic authorities. They would consider factors such as the sufficiency of evidence, whether the charge is a crime under US law, and potential issues like the fairness of trial or risk of torture in Sri Lanka. This process is handled under 18 USC 3184 in the United States. Options A and D are incorrect as they suggest direct action without proper legal channels.

The law focuses on the intent behind possessing such tools, not the mere possession itself.

These boards have both regulatory power like any other government agency, and the quasi\\-judicial authority to resolve union\\-management disputes outside of the regular court system.\n\nThe cited document is an opinion of the New York Public Employment Relations Board decided in 1998 and reported in the case reporter \"[Public Employment Relations Board Reports](http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/style-manual/2017/2017-SM.htm#APPENDIX%202)\" in volume 31 as decision number 4021 in that volume, for which the paragraph symbol (\u00b6) is used in their official form of citation (the section symbol is \u00a7).

If no section or paragraph mark were used, the reference would be to a page number in that volume of the case reporter under default rules for interpreting citations. But, since this is a reference to a sequential entry in the case reporter, rather than to a page number, some symbol must be used to identify it. The use of the \u00b6 symbol to break up logical components of a volume parallels the practice for learned legal treatises and legal services which usually break up their logical units by components denoted with the paragraph mark.\n\nThe case name \"(Matter of Freeport Union Free Sch.

If the municipal ordinances state that a particular place does not allow parking at certain times, then if you park there you have violated the law and will get ticketed. There is no requirement that there be signs prominently posted saying that you must obey the law in this particular location. A law might itself require there to be postings, for example speed limit law pertaining to school zones typically are stated in terms of \"posted\" boundaries. Assuming that the ordinance doesn't have such a \"as posted\" requirement, you have no legal leg to stand on, and the burden must be shifted to your political leg.\n\nIf, for example, you were in Pennsylvania, [75 PaCSA 3353(d)](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-75-pacsa-vehicles/pa-csa-sect-75-3353.html) permits local parking ordinances: \n\n> The department on State\\-designated highways and local authorities on\n>  any highway within their boundaries may by erection of official\n>  traffic\\-control devices prohibit, limit or restrict stopping, standing\n>  or parking of vehicles on any highway where engineering and traffic\n>  studies indicate that stopping, standing or parking would constitute a\n>  safety hazard or where the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles\n>  would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic.\n\nSigns are kinds of traffic control devices. Since PA does not statutorily prohibit overnight parking, any local restrictions on overnight parking would require signage. Thus restriction such as [this one](https://ecode360.com/32271425#32271425) that \"The following vehicles shall not be parked between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on the streets...\", applying to commercial vehicles among others, would require a sign.

Without knowing the specific terms of this contract, it's impossible to definitively state what actions the inventor is permitted to take. Options A and B are too extreme and absolute to be generally true in such situations, while D presents a specific arrangement that may or may not be part of the contract. Therefore, C is the most accurate answer, emphasizing the critical role of the contract in determining the inventor's rights."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19703/do-all-the-roommates-have-to-be-on-a-rental-lease-in-virginia-usa", "docs_id": 19703, "title": "Do all the roommates have to be on a rental lease in Virginia, USA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking to rent a property with my partner, but their credit is not great (lower than 650\\).

An authorized occupant is\n\n> a person entitled to occupy a dwelling unit with the consent of the\n>  landlord, but who has not signed the rental agreement and therefore\n>  does not have the financial obligations as a tenant under the rental\n>  agreement.\n\nA tenant is \n\n> a person entitled only under the terms of a rental agreement to occupy\n>  a dwelling unit to the exclusion of others and shall include roomer.\n\nThere is a third category, guest or invitee which\n\n> means a person, other than the tenant or person authorized by the\n>  landlord to occupy the premises, who has the permission of the tenant\n>  to visit but not to occupy the premises.\n\nSuch people who live there would not be invitees.\n\nClearly, you can have others living with you who are not on the lease, if the landlord agrees. The landlord's main concern regarding credit rating is probably financial responsibility, and if you qualify, having people live with you who have low or no credit rating is unlikely to make any difference. There may be other concerns, such as background checks or increases utility costs).\n\nVirginia law does not specifically allow \"unauthorized occupants\", i.e. occupants *not* approved by the landlord, nor does it specifically disallow such occupants. Leases often include a provision that addresses this matter, prohibiting unauthorized occupants. Supposing that the lease is silent on the matter (not likely) and the landlord wanted to compel the other occupants to leave, the procedure would be to tell the tenant that the unauthorized occupants must leave. Then if you do not comply (do not get them to move out), the landlord could start the procedure of evicting the lot of you, and the question would be whether the court would find that you have a right to let unauthorized other people live with you. I can't find any applicable case law, but it is unlikely that the court would find such a right. Tenants have special statutory rights, as do authorized occupants under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. A court would not find that the rights of an authorized occupant extend to an unauthorized occupant, which means that the landlord's rights as property owner are dispositive of the matter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John wants to rent an apartment in Virginia with his partner, Sarah.

An authorized occupant is someone who has the landlord's consent to occupy the dwelling unit but hasn't signed the rental agreement and doesn't have financial obligations under it. John can be the sole tenant on the lease, and with the landlord's agreement, Sarah can live there as an authorized occupant. This arrangement addresses the landlord's financial concerns while allowing Sarah to live in the apartment legally. Option A is incorrect because Sarah doesn't have to be a tenant. Option B is risky and potentially violates the lease.

Even though Disney owns the rights to the Darth Vader character, they do not automatically have the right to use James Earl Jones' voice or a close imitation of it without his consent.

Therefore, Disney would need to obtain explicit permission from James Earl Jones before using an AI-generated version of his voice, even if it's for a character they own.

On the other hand, *the first* defendant to actually fight back was able to uncover the hundreds of other cases, and the obvious fraud. The court swiftly ruled that\n\n* Jarek Molski is a *vexatious litigant* and **can file no more lawsuits**, except by asking permission (presenting the facts to a judge and the judge deciding that there's really a worthy case there).\n* The lawyers which represented Molski are likewise barred from representing anyone in an ADA case.\n* Their law firm, likewise.\n\nRighthaven\n----------\n\nAnother group of lawyers set up a law firm specifically to sue the owners of \"BBS's\" / internet forums / Q\\&A sites such as StackExchange, *whose public users* had pasted up copies of newspaper articles into the BBS. They **Bought the \"right to sue\"** from copyright owners such as newspapers \\- Righthaven didn't own the content, just the \"hunting license\" to go after people who infringed on the content \\- with the content owners getting a cut of proceeds.\n\nThey too filed hundreds of \"madlib\" lawsuits. In fact their lawsuit engine was so automated that they ['accidentally' sued journalists *writing about* Righthaven](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_righthaven_experiment_a_journalist_wonders_if_a_copyright_troll_was_rig) \\- (who quoted material from the entirely public lawsuit papers themselves \\- complaints are public by definition unless sealed by the courts.)\n\nNeedless to say, Righthaven had never heard of DMCA Safe Harbor, or hoped the forum owners hadn't. Again it worked: hundreds \"paid up\".\n\nMolski and Righthaven carefully chose \"settlement offer\" numbers ($5000\\-ish) that would be slightly cheaper than raising a legal defense ($6000\\-10,000\\). In the USA, each party pays their own legal bills \\- there's no concept of \"loser pays\" unless the other party's conduct is *outrageous*. It's so rare that when I had the pleasure of doing so, the court told us to take the standard garnishment forms, cross out \"defendant\" and hand\\-write \"plaintiff\" :)\n\nAnd again, the first defendant to actually stand up to Righthaven in court, asked the court to knock Righthaven to the moon, which [the court gleefully did](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/righthaven-on-life-support/).\n\nRIAA / MPAA\n-----------\n\nBitTorrent is a file\\-sharing network with no central hub. It breaks files into thousands of \"chunks\". Users collect chunks from hundreds of other users until they have the whole thing. Part of the social contract of BitTorrent is that people who download also upload (seed) to share the chunks they have gotten so far. People who refuse to upload are called leeches.\n\nRIAA and MPAA are the trade associations of the music and movie industries, respectively. They searched for BitTorrent (pirated, they claim) copies of their members' music and movies. They then \"leeched\" those copies with modified BitTorrent software that recorded the IP address of the \"seeder\". They took the IP address to the owning ISP, and demanded the customer identity. Then they sent out \"pay\\-us\\-or\\-else\" letters by the tens of thousands, and filed suits by the thousands. The argument was that the seeder had pirated the music, and that the ISP account holder was financially responsible for that activity, neither claim 100% reliable.\n\n[This campaign](https://jolt.richmond.edu/2018/03/15/has-the-riaa-given-up-on-combating-end-user-internet-piracy/) has been supported by the courts, because RIAA/MPAA were very careful of their legal footing. But I only mention this because **another gang of lawyers was paying attention, and they had their own ideas**.\n\nPrenda \"Law\"\n------------\n\nThis gang of lawyers correctly guessed that if users panicked at an RIAA/MPAA demand letter, **they'd *really* panic if the topic was pornography**.\n\nSo they set up a law firm specifically to apply RIAA/MPAA's techniques to porn. (one wonders if they paid RIAA a royalty). **But they were much more outrageous and careless**. For instance, rather than partner or purchase legitimate porn content, they worked with porn stars like Sunny Leone to create shell companies who, unbelievably [made original content](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/its-official-prenda-copyright-trolls-made-their-own-porn-seeded-on-pirate-bay/) *specifically as bait to ensnare BitTorrent users*.\n\nAgain, this situation only works until someone stands up for what's right: then it all falls apart.\n\nThis ended much, much worse than Righthaven or Molski. The civil judges were so offended they referred the matter out for *criminal prosecution*. **The organizers got [19 years in prison](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/prenda-law-porn-troll-saga-ends-with-prison-for-founder/)** between them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes a common tactic used by vexatious litigants like Molski, Righthaven, and Prenda Law in their mass lawsuit campaigns?\n\nA) They typically demanded extremely high settlement amounts, often exceeding $100,000 per case.\nB) They primarily targeted large corporations and wealthy individuals to maximize profits.\nC) They set settlement offers slightly below the cost of mounting a legal defense to encourage quick payouts.\nD) They only filed lawsuits after attempting mediation and out-of-court settlements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

If the third party does not sign up within X months, I give the money to charity.\n\nIs this legal according to the law of Minnesota, US? Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One way to look at this arrangement is that it would be an enforceable contract. \nAs a contractual matter, there is an agreement between you and the customer, and a separate agreement between you and the artist. In the first agreement, you have to give something of value, and the customer has to give something of value (money). You would be offering self\\-generated good feelings and encouraging something that the customer finds valuable. You would need to be clear about what they must do and what you must do, and assuming that, it would be a valid thus legal contract. (I set aside the question of whether the Spotify TOS might prohibit you from doing this: my answer is not Spotify\\-specific).\n\nTo be a real contract, you ought to be able to say what would be a breach of contract by you or the customer (you don't define breach in the contract, but conceptualizing the matter this way will help clarify the terms). You could breach if you simply refused to pass on the promised percentage, or unilaterally changed the percentage, or surprise customers by refusing to support Bj\u00f6rk or Enya. The customer might breach by e.g. inflating hit\\-rates by some software means, or by paying with fake money (rubber checks, invalid cards, whatever). One thing you cannot reasonably do is promise that the artist will be cooperative, so your promise would have to be clear about the non\\-cooperative artist option. (Suppose a customer listens to Bj\u00f6rk, Enya and Smith in that order, but Bj\u00f6rk declines to cooperate: is the money automatically re\\-distributed to Enya and Smith, or does Bj\u00f6rk's share go to the customer's charity? What is both the charity and artist are uncooperative \u2013 unlikely but not impossible?)\n\nTheoretically you can also form a contract with the artist, where you give something of value (money) in exchange for... and that part is not clear. \"Providing bank details\" might be the thing of value (valuable because it enables your contract with the customer). But there is no obvious reason for you to actually form a contract with the artist, and it is legal to give someone money with no strings attached (though you may have to mind income\\-reporting laws, if you hand over a lot of money). The tax consequences of this scheme should not be overlooked.\n\nAnother way to approach this is that you are running a charity, serving as a clearinghouse. Charities are highly regulated: the Minnesota AG provides [this guidance](http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Consumer/Publications/GuideCharityLaws.asp) on some of the law. If one opts to create a charity, one should hire an attorney. If one opts to not officially create a charity but does something that looks like it is a charity, one should hire an attorney to figure out how to do this so as to avoid prosecution for operating an unregistered charity.\n\nThere is also the potential that this could become a money\\-laundering operation. The federal [Money Laundering Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Laundering_Control_Act) might be relevant. The entire thing as enacted originally is [here](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg3207.pdf) (193 pages), the laundering part is Subtitle H. Fortunately, what is outlawed is willful acts, e.g. \"knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\", \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\". Thus one should hire an attorney to make sure that whatever you do, you are insulated against money laundering charges."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A business owner in Minnesota wants to set up a system where customers pay $10, and a portion of that money is distributed to third parties.

On May 26 2020, [Hertz](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HTZ?p=HTZ&.tsrc=fin-srch) announced bankruptcy and its price dropped even more, from $2\\.83 to 0\\.59\\.\n\n[Retail Traders Flout Legal Logic by Buying Up Bankrupt Stocks](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-traders-flout-legal-logic-224217982.html)\n\n> \u201cNo one ever loses equity in a bankruptcy case,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge [David Jones](https://ballotpedia.org/David_R._Jones) said during a status conference in the J.C. Penney case last month. \u201cEquity gets lost long before the case is filed.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Under U.S. bankruptcy law, shareholders are last in line for any kind of payout \\-\\- behind the lawyers, lenders, and vendors \\-\\- making a recovery for shares unusual. The size and scope of payouts is usually determined by a so\\-called Chapter 11 plan, which creditors vote on and send to a federal judge for approval. Those plans often leave even high\\-ranking creditors getting less than they\u2019re owed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because a company with positive equity isn't bankrupt\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nUsually.\n\n**The simple version**\n\nEquity in accounting terms is a part of the Statement of Financial Position (previously called the Balance Sheet) and represents the value owned by the shareholders. It was called a Balance Sheet because it balances:\n\n```\nAssets - Liabilities = Equity\n\n```\n\nA bankrupt company is one that is unable to settle its debts meaning that its Liabilities (what it owes) are greater than its Assets (what it owns). Therefore equity is negative \\- the equity has been lost before the company files for bankruptcy.\n\nSince shareholders have limited liability, they do not have to contribute to pay the company's debts so their shareholding is worthless. Their shareholding can't be worth less than worthless so in that sense David Jones is right \u201cNo one ever loses equity in a bankruptcy case, Equity gets lost long before the case is filed.\u201d It is the loss of the equity that caused the bankruptcy.\n\n**The more complex version**\n\nThe Statement of Financial Position is a point in time measure of the liquidated value of the entity \\- that is, the value of the company if all assets were sold for their book value and all debts were settled for their book value. This isn't something that can actually happen for all sorts of reasons.\n\nA company that gets liquidated will often not realise the full value of its booked assets because these are accounting measures of value rather than sale under the hammer values at a liquidation auction.\n\nFurther, businesses as [going concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_concern) have a different value than their book equity. An ongoing business will make profits (or losses) in the future and the expectation of these needs to be added (or subtracted) from the book equity. This is why a company with negative equity may still be worth operating and, conversely, why one with positive equity maybe should be closed.\n\nAlso, businesses may have significant off\\-balance\\-sheet assets such as valuable IP and branding that was developed in house and therefore don't create bookable transactions. For example, there is no item in the Coca\\-cola [balance sheet](https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/financial-information/balance-sheet) that represents the value of the brand. This is clearly an item of value that a) isn't on the balance sheet and b) only has value while someone is making cola and using that branding. Kodak, Blockbuster, Panamerican and Concorde were all once valuable brands that now only have nostalgia value.\n\nOne final point is that it is quite possible for a business with positive equity to go bankrupt because bankruptcy can be triggered by insolvency. Insolvency is being unable to pay your debts as and when they fall due. An asset rich but cash poor organisation can be insolvent while still having positive equity. For example, a property developer may have a large portfolio of valuable property and owe a relatively small amount to contractors, however, if they can't come up with the cash to pay these debts they are insolvent and this can trigger bankruptcy.\n\nMany businesses and individuals may be insolvent and recover from it \\- they borrow money from a bank (or by delaying payments to creditors) or inject more funds into the business. It is usually only when a business is of borderline profitability that insolvency will push them into bankruptcy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company has filed for bankruptcy, but its stock is still being traded on the market.

In any case, I never received a **formal** extension offer. Perhaps more importantly, because I rejected the \"extension offer\", my employeer will hire a replacement.\n\nNow, is this an unfair request, perhaps asking for myself to renounce redundancy (or other) rights? The [official information](https://www.gov.uk/fixed-term-contracts/employees-rights) in the UK government website about fixed\\-term contracts states:\n\n> Anyone who\u2019s worked continually for the same employer for 2 years or more has the same redundancy rights as a permanent employee.\n\nFurther on, regarding [ending a fixed\\-contract](https://www.gov.uk/fixed-term-contracts/renewing-or-ending-a-fixedterm-contract), it says:\n\n> If a contract isn\u2019t renewed\n> ===========================\n> \n> \n> This is considered to be a dismissal, and if the employee has 2 years\u2019 service the employer needs to show that there\u2019s a \u2018fair\u2019 reason for not renewing the contract (eg, if they were planning to stop doing the work the contract was for). ...\n> \n> \n> They **may be** entitled to statutory redundancy payments after 2 years\u2019 service if the reason for non\\-renewal is redundancy. \\[emphasis mine]\n\nSo, there seems to be a difference between dismisal and redundancy.

If your employer did not extend the contract when you would have been willing to continue, that is either a redundancy, or a dismissal of another kind.

This makes it a voluntary departure on the part of the employee, rather than a redundancy or dismissal initiated by the employer. In UK employment law, redundancy rights typically apply when the employer chooses not to continue the employment due to a reduction in workforce needs. Since the employee chose not to continue and the employer was willing to extend, this situation would likely be considered a voluntary departure, and redundancy rights would not apply."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52205/what-are-the-exact-charges-fort-worth-has-dropped-in-relation-to-the-recent-unre", "docs_id": 52205, "title": "What are the exact charges Fort Worth has dropped in relation to the recent unrest in the US?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Fort Worth has [dropped all charges](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/09/872827789/fort-worth-police-drop-rioting-charges-against-protesters-topic-of-a-broad-debat) against people arrested for \"rioting\" related to the George Floyd protests.

Can the contrasts between the nature of citizenship before and after the 14th Amendment be briefly summarized?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary intention of the 14th, and its largest effect, was of course to confer citizenship on blacks, particularly the former slaves. But it also constitutionalized the rule of \"birthright citizenship\" (aka *jus soli*), and removed any bars based on national origin or ethnicity. \n\nPrior to the 14th, naturalization was a federal matter, and Congress could make what rules it pleased. But citizenship for natives was a matter of state law, or largely of unwritten common law, although after *Dred Scott v. Sandford*, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857\\) blacks who were former slaves or whose ancestors had been slaves could not be made citizens. \n\nThe common law of England had long held that anyone born in the domains of the king was a subject, and the US followed that rule generally, in most states without ever reducing it to a statute. But state legislatures had the power to change that rule if they chose to.\n\nIn March 1790, Congress passed \u201cAn act to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\u201d which established that children born to American men abroad or at sea were still considered \u201cnatural born citizens.\u201d It also provided rules and procedures for those who immigrated to become citizens, providing:\n\n> That any Alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within . . . the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen.\u201d\n\nSuch would\\-be citizens had also to prove possession of \u201cgood character\u201d and swear an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. The details were changed from time to time, but the general nature of the requirements remained unchanged all through the 18th and 19th centuries. \n\nIn the 1844 New York case *Lynch v. Clarke*, a court held that a daughter born in New York state to Irish parents was considered a U.S. citizen, even though her parents returned to Ireland. \n\n> \\[B]y the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever were the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. . . . The term citizen, was used in the constitution as a word, the meaning of which was already established and well understood. The only standard which then existed . . . was the rule of the common law, and no different standard has been adopted since.\n\nSo that rule (*jus soli*) was not in practice changed much by the 14th, but it was made explicit and unchangeable except by later amendment. Laws on naturalization remain subject to Congressional action, and have been changed at various times.\n\nSee also [this question here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33056/what-is-the-meaning-of-and-subject-to-the-jurisdiction-thereof-in-the-14th-ame/33057#33057) and its answers."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the impact of the 14th Amendment on U.S. citizenship laws?\n\nA) It established the concept of birthright citizenship for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nB) It removed state authority to determine citizenship status for individuals born within their borders.\n\nC) It eliminated all racial and ethnic barriers to citizenship, including those for naturalization.\n\nD) It constitutionalized existing common law practices regarding citizenship while expanding their application.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The 14th Amendment did not introduce birthright citizenship (jus soli) for the first time, as this was already a common law practice in most states (option A is incorrect). While it did federalize citizenship rules, states had already been largely following the common law principle of jus soli (option B overstates the change). The 14th Amendment did not completely eliminate racial barriers for naturalization, as evidenced by the continuation of racial restrictions in naturalization laws after its passage (option C is incorrect). \n\nOption D is correct because the 14th Amendment primarily constitutionalized the existing common law practice of birthright citizenship, making it explicit and applicable nationwide, while also expanding its application to include formerly enslaved people and their descendants. It took existing practices and enshrined them in the Constitution, preventing states from altering these rules, while also broadening the scope of who was considered a citizen at birth."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41494/can-a-u-s-election-be-overturned-for-foreign-interference", "docs_id": 41494, "title": "Can a U.S. election be overturned for foreign interference?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can a U.S. election be overturned due to foreign interference?

Klingon stems from published grammar and dictionary (plus typeface) created as a work for hire, so there are limits to how much of the grammar and dictionary you can copy. We might assume that Droidspeak was similarly specified, and that this website implements the specification: anyone can then generate Droidspeak utterances, if they have the technical know\\-how. In that case, there is no copyright protection. Or we might assume that the sound derives from actual copying from the movies \u2013 that would be copyright infringement. (That is, original sounds are edited out as \"letters\" and automatically recombined by the program). A third possibility is that the squawks just resemble the movie squawks (and would not be infringing). So the answer depends on what the translator actually does.\n\nFrom the perspective of the person using the translator, the main concern would be whether a particular use is consistent with the terms of service. In this case, there are no terms, so you may do whatever you want with their tool (as long as you can legally do the thing without the website). You could translate, record and post a Droidspeak version of the Gettysburg Address (but not *Old Man's War*). They might later add a TOS that prohibits that. Your innocent use of the site would not open you to vicarious liability."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer uses an online R2D2 translator to convert warnings in their app to droid-like sounds.

The mere act of using translated sounds does not necessarily constitute copyright infringement.\n\nB is partially correct but oversimplified. While avoiding direct copying from movies is important, it doesn't address potential issues with the translator's methodology.\n\nC is incorrect because permission is not necessarily required to use a language or translation tool, especially if it's based on a general specification rather than copyrighted material.\n\nD is the most accurate answer. The developer's use of the online translator itself is likely legal, as there are no terms of service restricting its use. However, the legality depends on how the translator generates its output. If it uses actual sound clips from movies, there could be copyright concerns. If it's based on a general specification or independently created sounds, it's more likely to be legal. The developer should verify the translator's methodology to ensure they're not inadvertently using copyrighted material."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37345/can-i-share-scammers-personal-details-online-what-type-of-details-can-i-share", "docs_id": 37345, "title": "Can I share scammers personal details online?

For example, a wifi\\-capable router can be sold even if it is \"open\" by default. A Bluetooth device has a shorter range than wifi, but in principle can connect to any other device. An owner's legal liability is not different given wifi vs. Bluetooth.\n\nWhether or not there is criminal liability for a third person who connects to the device also does not specifically depend on whether the device uses Bluetooth technology, as opposed to some other technology. [18 USC 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030) is the general federal law prohibiting \"unauthorized access\". In the case of a bed, two legal question arise: is it a [\"computer\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-599163109-692694671&term_occur=999&term_src=), and is it [\"protected\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-695191731-692694672&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:47:section:1030)? It is an electronic high speed data processing device which performs logical, arithmetic, storage and communications facilities, i.e. it is a computer (in the legal sense). It *probably* is not protected, because it is not \"used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication\", that is, it is not connected to the internet (unless it is). State laws tend to be broader, not having the \"interstate commerce\" limitation, so accessing the bed would violate [Washington's](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.90&full=true) analog of the federal law. However, under Washington law, the access is probably not \"without authorization\". That term is defined as\n\n> knowingly circumvent technological access barriers to a data system in\n> order to obtain information without the express or implied permission\n> of the owner, where such technological access measures are\n> specifically designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals\n> from obtaining such information, but does not include white hat\n> security research or circumventing a technological measure that does\n> not effectively control access to a computer.

The term \"circumvent\n> technological access barriers\" may include unauthorized elevation of\n> privileges, such as allowing a normal user to execute code as\n> administrator, or allowing a remote person without any privileges to\n> run code.\n\nOne question is whether there is any technological access barrier that the user circumvents (I don't know if it is possible to circumvent \"hidden mode\"). Since the term \"may include ... allowing a remote person without any privileges to run code\", and since playing music on speakers involves running code, then the remote user may be criminally liable. On the third hand, the language of that paragraph (\"technological access measures are specifically designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining such information, but does not include ... circumventing a technological measure that does not effectively control access to a computer\") clearly indicates a legislative intent to address deliberately overcoming active access barriers and not accidentally connecting to an unprotected, open system.

If the things he agreed to were enforceable but mine weren't, would he still have to do them even if I didn't?\n\nFor example, the landlord rented out a storage area to an extra person. He said he would somehow share the money to lower others costs, but the details were never clear and weren't in writing. When he did not share the money, I reminded him he had agreed to.

Just what it would mean for a tenant to \"undermine the leadership\" of a landlord is not clear to me, at least. That might well be held to be \"too vague\".

The landlord's promise to share income is likely a clear, enforceable obligation. However, the tenant's promise \"not to undermine leadership or complain\" is problematic. \"Undermining leadership\" is too vague for a court to determine if it has been violated. Additionally, tenants often have legal rights to make complaints that cannot be waived by contract. Therefore, while the landlord's promise may be enforceable, the tenant's promises are likely unenforceable due to vagueness and potential conflict with tenant rights.

See for example Genesis 14:22, or Exodus 6:8\\. Some other times when hands are lifted up in the Bible, it's an expression of power. These concepts are linked in that an oath involves appealing to divine power to witness what is promised (and to punish the speaker if they break it).\n\nThe story that it comes from forcing witnesses or the accused to display brands is false. While branding was used historically to mark certain criminals, these marks were not often on the palm of the hand, but could be on the cheeks or chest or elsewhere. Courts have never asked witnesses to remove their shirts while taking an oath. Even in the era when branding was used, checking for the marks would not be applied to all witnesses, but perhaps just to the accused.\n\nIn contemporary practice, raising the hand is optional, and the oath or affirmation is taken as \"good\" if the court is satisfied that the witness is taking it seriously. Raising the hand might be seen as a gesture of respect for the law and not necessarily any particular religious tradition. Raising the hand while affirming is not unusual, nor even a mixed signal: affirmation arose because of Quakers wishing to observe the Biblical command \"swear not at all\"."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The practice of raising one's right hand before taking an oath or making an affirmation in legal settings has its origins in:\n\nA) Ancient Roman court procedures to check for criminal brands on hands\nB) Biblical traditions and the concept of appealing to divine power\nC) Medieval European customs of showing allegiance to the crown\nD) 18th-century Quaker practices of non-religious affirmations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The practice of raising one's right hand before taking an oath or making an affirmation in legal settings originates from Biblical traditions and the concept of appealing to divine power. This is evidenced by references in the Bible, such as Genesis 14:22 and Exodus 6:8, where raising hands is associated with making oaths or expressing power.\n\nOption A is incorrect.

Autonomous operation is allowed, but the operator must be able to intervene if necessary.\n\nC is correct. While autonomous drones are permitted, the operator is responsible for avoiding collisions and complying with FAA rules. This necessitates the ability to take manual control quickly if needed.\n\nD is incorrect as fully autonomous drones are not prohibited.

The final user or consumer used the work or product as intended, and\n2. the damage(s) stemmed from malicious intent or gross negligence on the contributor's part.\n\nThe second condition relates to, or at least is consistent with, the disclaimer statement that \"*\\[the] work is provided \\[...] without malicious intent or gross negligence*\". However, the exception should be more specific in that regard instead of only using the term \"immediate fault\", since \"fault\" may also consist of a state of mind which is less culpable than *malicious intent* or *gross negligence*.\n\nThe exception also should be clear about whose usage it means by the expression \"*using the work as intended*\". The likeliest, most reasonable interpretation is that the exception refers to usage by the final user. But, taken literally, the disclaimer is in terms of contributor's fault at the time of *contributor's usage* of the work as intended.

The clause is poorly worded, leaving room for multiple interpretations. It doesn't clearly specify whether \"immediate fault\" refers to malicious intent or gross negligence, nor does it clarify whose usage is meant by \"using the work as intended.\" This ambiguity could lead to broader interpretations of liability, potentially defeating the purpose of the disclaimer.

She then found out that he is cheating on her and wants to send this to the other party's mate.\n\nCan she use the web chats as evidence or will it be viewed as she puts it, unethical hacking?\n\nI did refer her to a lawyer, but I am now interested to hear what the answer could be.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [current law](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a25-02.pdf), Chapter XIII, simply says that\n\n> a person who intentionally accesses or intercepts any data without\n>  authority or permission to do so is guilty of an offence.\n\nThe law does not say what constitutes \"authority or permission\". \"Sharing\" an account typically constitutes giving permission to access the account. The [most recent proposed update of the law](http://pmg-assets.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/NA_bills2017_bill06B-2017.pdf), slightly clarifies that issue saying (Chapter II)\n\n> (3\\) For purposes of subsection (2\\),\"unauthorised\" means that the\n>  person\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) is not himself or herself lawfully entitled to secure access;\n> \n> \n> (b) does not have the lawful consent of another person who is lawfully\n>  entitled to secure access; or\n> \n> \n> (c) exceeds his or her entitlement or consent, to secure access, to\n>  data, a computer program, a computer data storage medium or a computer\n>  system.\n\nStill, this does not clarify whether account\\-sharing constitutes limited permission to access the data. Since the issue here is whether criminal prosecution is possible, the law would need to be much clearer, that is, a person cannot be prosecuted for a crime based on a party saying \"But I didn't think that she *would* actually look at the evidence of my infidelity\". \n\nIt is unclear what the analog of the US exclusionary rule in SA, but it is unlikely that it would protect against using such evidence in a civil matter (such as a divorce) \u2013 it isn't excluded in US civil cases. There could be statutory exclusions (such as the common law that illegal wiretap evidence cannot be used in any court proceeding), but there does not seem to be any specific exclusionary provision in existing or proposed SA law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In South Africa, a woman gains access to her husband's WhatsApp account with his permission as a trust exercise. She then uses this access to monitor his conversations through WhatsApp Web without his knowledge and discovers evidence of his infidelity. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of her actions under current South African law?\n\nA) Her actions are clearly illegal and she could be prosecuted for unauthorized access to data.\n\nB) Her actions are legally permissible as she had her husband's consent to access the account.\n\nC) The legality of her actions is ambiguous under current law due to unclear definitions of \"authority or permission\".\n\nD) She can freely use the information obtained as evidence in both criminal and civil proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The current South African law regarding unauthorized access to data is ambiguous in this situation. The law states that accessing data without authority or permission is an offense, but it doesn't clearly define what constitutes \"authority or permission\" in cases of shared accounts. While the husband gave permission to access his WhatsApp, the extent of this permission is unclear. The proposed update to the law attempts to clarify \"unauthorized\" access but still doesn't explicitly address account-sharing scenarios. Given this ambiguity, it's difficult to definitively state whether the wife's actions would be considered legal or illegal. Option A is too strong given the lack of clarity in the law. Option B assumes too much about the extent of permission given. Option D is incorrect as it overstates the usability of the evidence, especially in criminal proceedings. Therefore, C is the most accurate response, reflecting the ambiguity in the current legal framework."}}
