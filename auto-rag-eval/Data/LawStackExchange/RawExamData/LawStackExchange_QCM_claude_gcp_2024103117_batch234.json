It might not really be mandatory for everybody, however there will certainly be some citizens that will be required to have the app installed on their phones.\n* **The security.** The app relies on bluetooth connections to be able to detect another person when a citizen is close to them. A lot of people own smartphones that are insecure because they are not up\\-to\\-date. In many cases they cannot even be updated because the vendor doesn't release the security patches on time, or the vendor only provides support for a few months after the purchase. Bluetooth is known to have had vulnerabilities in the past, and the latest one was fixed a couple of months ago. Examples: [December 2017, billions of devices imperiled by new clickless bluetooth attack](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/bluetooth-bugs-open-billions-of-devices-to-attacks-no-clicking-required/), and [February 2020, Google fixes no\\-user\\-interaction bug in Android's Bluetooth component](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-fixes-no-user-interaction-bug-in-androids-bluetooth-component/). They can be pretty serious, and citing the last article, \"if left unpatched, the vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction and can even be used to create self\\-spreading Bluetooth worms, experts said.\" Yes, it is very ironic: an app developed to control the spread of a biological virus might lead to the spread of a software virus, by proximity! Very ironic.\n* **The precautions.** The goverment and the app developers take no precautions to avoid the above\\-mentioned risks. The app will install and run without any warnings if the device is not up\\-to\\-date. The government doesn't warn the citizens that such application must only be installed if the device is up\\-to\\-date, and doesn't require citizens to buy a new smartphone if the current one cannot be considered secure. So unless a citizen is particularly tech\\-savvy, they won't have a clue they are exposing their personal data to a risk when they turn bluetooth on. On the other hand, a lot of people are clueless anyway and probably already have bluetooth on right now.\n\nThe question is: is this legal? I'm not sure how much the GDPR is relevant here, because the app might not process much personal data. These kinds of apps might just exchange pseudonymous IDs, and might not record much data other than that. However the app will be installed in a system that is full of personal data (the smartphone), even sensitive personal data (think of emails, messages, social media), so it definitely has an impact on the overall security.\n\nJurisdictions: EU (but I'm also curious about the US, for comparison).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If and when some sort of contract tracing app becomes a key public health tool and is made mandatory in an EU member state, it would almost certainly be through some *ad hoc* law, possibly using emergency powers that parliaments have granted to the executive in several countries. That would set aside most existing legal hurdles and makes it difficult to think about the legality of such an app in advance.\n\nOf course, even a very broad national mandate would still formally need to comply with EU law and possibly be open to some constitutional or ECHR challenge. But it's difficult to see how these could be invoked based on a theoretical impact on a limited number of phones. It should also be possible to dispose of many human rights objections with a proportionality argument and I suspect most courts would be happy to accept it.\n\nInterestingly, article 23(1\\)(e) of the GDPR empowers national governments to set aside many obligations in the name of, *inter alia*, public health so the possibility to redefine what's legal or not at the national level is baked in. These restrictions are not absolute however and, in particular, do not cover articles 24, 25, 32 and 33 (which all have to do with data protection and security).

The information provided suggests that in times of public health emergencies, governments may use emergency powers or create ad hoc laws that could override many existing legal barriers. This is supported by the statement that such actions would \"set aside most existing legal hurdles and makes it difficult to think about the legality of such an app in advance.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the GDPR is relevant, it actually includes provisions (Article 23(1)(e)) that allow governments to set aside many obligations for public health reasons.\n\nOption B is false because the information explicitly states that national governments have the power to restrict certain GDPR obligations for public health reasons.\n\nOption D is unlikely, as the text suggests that courts would probably accept proportionality arguments in favor of such measures during a health crisis.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex interplay between EU data protection laws, national emergency powers, and public health imperatives in extraordinary circumstances."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41736/small-claims-court-uk-small-german-company-owed-less-than-e5000-eur-by-uk-comp", "docs_id": 41736, "title": "Small Claims Court UK - Small German Company owed less than E5000 EUR by UK company", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can the German company make a claim through the British Small Claims Court or do have to use the EU Small Claims Court system?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe you can, but you are likely to have to travel to the UK if a hearing is needed.

Copyright protection does not expire when a product is discontinued or no longer commercially exploited. The original company still holds the copyright for many years.

Can I use something like a poem from [Anton Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov) for example? He wrote his poems before any copyright laws, so logic would dictate it's safe to use (although law and logic don't always mix).\n\nIt's not actually a poem from Chekhov, but I'm using him as an example because of the fact he didn't write in English, which gets me to my second item.\n\n2.

It is in the US but will complicate things if you publish internationally.\n\nUnless you translate with something like Google translate, translation is definitely a creative process.

Option A is incorrect because copyright laws existed before Chekhov's time (the first copyright law dates from 1710).

The legal root of the matter is the [Therapeutic Goods Administration](https://www.tga.gov.au/). Dosages above 100 mg are on [\"Schedule 4\"](https://www.tga.gov.au/scheduling-basics) meaning they require a prescription. There are also apparently state regulations.

It is possible that some person may illegally copy copyright\\-protected material then use a website to modify that material, in which case the question of vicarious liability for copyright infringement could arise, so we appeal to the DMCA safe harbor provisions to see what the website must do. First, the owner of copyright must submit a properly constructed takedown notice to the website. Crucially, the notice must contain sufficient information that the website operator can find and take down the item(s) in question. Assuming that the complainant can supply the \"where is it\" information, then there is a notice and counter\\-notice routine where the uploader is informed and can deny the accusation \u2013 the website operator doesn't evaluate the merits of the claim, he only sees that the formalities were observed. If the operator follows the rules, he cannot be held vicariously liable.\n\nIf the link does not expire and if it is somehow promulgated, the technical potential for being a contributor to copyright infringement becomes very real, but it puts the operator in no worse a legal position than Youtube. So the question is not just related to OCILLA, it is entirely covered by that law. Questions of how users or website owners are \"supposed to\" act don't figure into this. If the website owner does not comply with those provisions, they have no access to the safe harbor provisions, and they can be sued.

In the UK, the overwhelming majority of flats are leasehold properties, not freehold. This means that flat owners purchase a long-term lease (typically 80, 100, or 999 years) from a freeholder who owns the land and building. The freeholder acts as a landlord and is responsible for managing the building and common areas, similar to how an HOA would function in the USA. This system differs from the typical HOA structure in the USA, where homeowners usually own their properties outright and collectively manage the community through an association. While it is possible for leaseholders to collectively purchase the freehold, this is a rare and expensive process.

(Congress and its committees have power to require both members and witnesses to abide by its rules of decorum, which forbid such insults, but as far as I know the remedy is merely to remove the disorderly person.) \n\nContempt of congress is defined by [2 USC 192](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/192), which provides that:\n\n> Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.\n\nNote that this is a Federal criminal statute like any other, and Congress does not normally \"declare\" a person guilty, much less \"apply the imprisonment penalty\". Charges would have to be brought before a federal court, and the person convicted by a jury, or by a judge if a jury trial was waived. \n\nCongress does have the \"inherent power\" to hold trials for contempt itself, but this has not been done since 1934\\.

The political motivations or perceived fairness of the hearing are not considered relevant legal defenses.

These include games from Masters and above, and for each game, they contain, if known, the rating and names of the players, their moves and venue of the game.

The moves that were made are facts. Facts are not protected by copyright, although particular words used to describe facts may be protected.\n\nWhat books, databases, or other sources report a given game is a fact, and not protected unless the source constitutes a single selected list. If the book is *50 Best Chess Games selected by Joe Expert*, then listing which games are included amounts to copying that selected list of games.\n\nAnnotations to or comments on a particular game would be protected by copyright, and may not be reproduced without permission unless they are old enough for copyright to have expired, or fit an exception to copyright. The fair use exception might or might not apply in the US, depending on the details and the use made, but would not apply elsewhere. The news reporting exception would not apply, I think.\n\nThe selection of a particular set of games as \"notable\" or \"best\" would be protected by copyright. Selecting such games as a set, or indicting which games belonged to such a list would be infringement. Including some such games along with many others, and in no way indicating which belonged to such a list would probably not be infringement of the copyright on the list.\n\nA website or open database that provides data on such games may well have a TOS limiting how a user can access or use the data. For instance data scraping may be prohibited. Commercial use may be prohibited or restricted. Such a TOS probably forms a contract with each user, and any user is bound to its terms. Use of the site contrary to the TOS may be a breech of contract, and thus grounds for a lawsuit. What damages might be available would depend on the terms of the TOS, and the laws of the country where such a suit might be brought.

In some countries, such as the US, Canada, or India, state or provincial laws might apply.\n\nIn some countries there is a \"database right\" similar to a copyright, that protects the data in a database as a collection.

Should car sharing company explicitly notify about liability before booking?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How Are Liability And Insurance Matters Usually Disclosed?\n==========================================================\n\nNormally, in a car sharing arrangement, you must establish a membership or account with the car sharing firm that includes all of the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties (at least by reference to a document that you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to read), often in connection with downloading an app necessary to use the service.\n\nI also strongly suspect (as a comment below indicates) that if you dug around enough on the firm's webpage that a link to the relevant terms and conditions could be found, even if it wasn't in the most obvious place. But, this information will often not be on the firm's main landing page of their website, and can instead often only be reached with multiple clicks and/or drop down menus.\n\nSometimes this is called a \"terms of service\", sometimes this is called a \"master agreement\", sometimes it is called a \"membership agreement\" or \"account agreement\". My list of names for this agreement is not exhaustive. Often these terms are also described elsewhere in simplified form, such as a \"how to\" brochure, or information that is posted on the interior of the vehicle itself or in a sleeve of documents in the car.\n\nUsually, in the course of the sign up process there would typically be a box to click and a link or scrollable portion of the screen at which you can review all of those terms and conditions which are the terms of the contract.\n\nWhat Must Advertising Say And Why?\n==================================\n\nIt is not generally necessary for the advertising itself to disclose every term and condition and detail of the arrangement. Generally speaking, an advertisement is considered merely an \"invitation to make an offer\" to enter into a contract, rather than an offer which can be accepted directly and form a contract. Of course, a particular jurisdiction's legislature certainly has the power to require that a car sharing company disclose liability and insurance information in a particular fashion set forth in a statute or regulation, if that jurisdiction's legislative body chooses to do so.\n\nEven when these issues are mentioned in advertising (even when some disclosure is required by law in adverising), usually this would be in the form of a sentence that incorporates another document by reference like \"Additional terms and conditions, including terms and conditions related to liability and insurance, that can be found at . . . . apply.\"\n\nThis is due to the practical reality that TV and radio ads are usually just 15\\-60 seconds allowing about 25\\-100 words or perhaps a few more if the announcer speaks quickly, and that ads in print or on a screen also typically have room for only a very small amount of text.\n\nWebsites, in principle, provide an effectively infinite amount of capacity to host content, but considerations of ease of website use and the need to make the landing page striking for marketing purposes (as well as the need to make websites mobile user friendly when that is the only way that many Internet users can access the web) usually relegates the legal terms of the agreement to less attention grabbing locations.\n\nOften, these terms are disclosed more conspicuously when the terms and conditions change materially, something that often has its own little PR campaign accompanying it.\n\nUnilaterally Imposed Contracts of Adhesion\n==========================================\n\nOne reason that disclosure isn't such a huge issue is that car share agreements are almost always mass produced, not up for negotiation, \"contracts of adhesion\" that only senior management of the firm has the authority to modify. In the case of these intangible contractually agreed services, the terms of the agreement are more akin to a non\\-negotiable product design than to the paradigmatic haggled legal agreement between parties.\n\nThus, a customer has only two choices. Use the service according to the standard terms, or don't use the service.\n\nGiven this reality, the average buyer of the services relies upon the market place rejecting contracts of adhesion with bad terms, upon testimonials (good and bad) from prior users of the service, and upon media publicity for notorious terms or incidents that makes it look like the business doesn't treat it customers well, to keep the agreements reasonable, rather than upon individualized decisions to use or not use the service based upon a detailed review of the contract terms.\n\nThere are legal doctrines pertaining to contracts of adhesion that invalidate terms that are unconscionable or not within the reasonable expectation of a consumer unless those terms of conspicuously disclosed.\n\nA classic example, for example, would be that a car share agreement that imposed extraction of a kidney as a fine for being one days late in paying an invoice would be void as a matter of law, even if the referenced document said so in bold large face type and the customer clicked a box acknowledging having read the agreement.\n\nWhat Happens If There Is No Agreement Or Disclosure?\n====================================================\n\nIf there was never a step at which the terms and conditions were disclosed or accepted, then the default rules of law pertaining to personal property leasing, together with the laws pertaining to automobile accidents and insurance (both statutory and case law) in the jurisdiction in question.\n\nIn almost all cases, liability to third parties for accidents is generally a matter of tort law or statute imposed by the government, rather than being something that can be modified by agreement. Also, usually the government imposes minimum insurance requirements and the owner of the car also has an incentive (and often a legal requirement) to have car insurance in force.\n\nIn the United States, the default rules of law pertaining to personal property leasing, are set forth in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in every U.S. State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each self\\-governing U.S. territory with its own internal laws.\n\nIn countries Europe or Latin American or Asia known as \"civil law\" countries (i.e. in those countries outside the British common law tradition, the Islamic law legal tradition, tribal or clan or caste law, or legal systems with communist regime roots established in the 20th century), the equivalent default rules of law (governing personal property leases, contracts to provide services, leases and insurance) would be contained in either a civil code or a commercial code of that country in most cases.\n\nIn common law countries, the contractual agreements tend to be longer than the default provisions of law are skinnier. In civil law countries, the reverse is true.\n\nA hybrid of these two approaches which also limits the need of customers to monitor contract terms is the regulatory model commonly used in the insurance industry in the United States takes the reality that contracts of adhesion are the norm and gives it a regulatory twist. In this hybrid model, all of the boilerplate language of every insurance contract down to the last word of non\\-customized or only semi\\-customized language, and often fee schedules as well, must be substantively improved by a state agency that regulates insurance. In these models, a public official negotiates the terms of the contracts with the firms, subject to intervention in and participation in the process by industry associations and non\\-profits or interested individuals on behalf of consumers or other interested parties. In these hybrid systems, the approved contract language which can't be modified in the boilerplate language by either the firms or the customers, is on file with the regulatory agency and provides constructive notice to all parties in much the same way as a statute or government regulation.\n\nIf not enough material terms of the agreement (e.g. the rental rate) were disclosed to form a contract, then there would be no enforcement contractual arrangement involved in the car share and the car share company would have to rely on the law of unjust enrichment to recover the fair market value of the services provided in each case, which as a practical matter, wouldn't be viable as a business model.\n\nDistinctions Between The Two Kinds Of Car Sharing Arrangements\n==============================================================\n\nThere is some ambiguity in the question because there are a couple main types of car sharing arrangements.\n\nOne is more like a rental car and you drive the vehicle yourself (Car2Go is one of them). In this case, the firm typically provides car insurance and does a limited background of a prospective account holders driving record before allowing someone to use the service. But, the user of the service, who drives the car, would be primarily liable for any accident that the car gets into.\n\nThe other kind, sometimes called a \"car share\" and sometimes called a \"ride share\" is more like an Uber or Lyft, which is a glorified, on demand taxi service, in which a driver provides the services of the driver and the vehicle and takes car of insurance and will be primarily liable for any accident the car gets into as a driver and owner of the car.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A car sharing company advertises its services on its website, focusing only on the benefits.

Car sharing companies typically include liability and insurance information in a separate agreement, often called \"terms of service,\" \"master agreement,\" or \"membership agreement.\" This information is usually presented during the sign-up process, where users must acknowledge they've had the opportunity to read it, often by clicking a box or scrolling through the text. \n\nOption A is incorrect because companies are not generally required to state all details on their main landing page. Option B is incorrect as companies do have some obligation to disclose terms, even if not in the main advertisement.

If the user wants to revoke or recall the consent, the user can now uncheck the checkbox and proceed, and the cookie will be deleted.\n\nTechnically, it works by checking for presence of the said cookie, if cookie is present, box is pre\\-checked, else box is empty.\n\nI wonder, is this valid consent according to GDPR, and is it permittable to use a pre\\-ticked checkbox to revoke/recall consent?\n\nI see two legal problems with this:\n1: If the user checks the checkbox, and then another user uses the same computer, or the user forgets he consented, the user could believe its an invalid consent as the box is pre\\-checked.\n2: If GDPR law requires the revocation of consent be a separate function and not built\\-in the consent checkbox, it could be problematic.\n\nAlso, I wonder, if I use this scheme and totally locally controlling this function, it will mean that I as a website owner will NOT be able to revoke consent on behalf of the user, only way for the user to revoke his consent is to uncheck the checkbox or delete his cookies.\n\nIs it valid to do this, or MUST I be able to revoke consent on behalf of a user if a user emails and wants to revoke consent, or can I refer user to uncheck that checkbox? Since the details is stored in a cookie, only way for me to revoke consent would be to somehow \"ban\" that cookie from being activated later on from the server side, requiring me to store personal details of users (either IP\\-adresses of computers which the cookies should not be respected from and immidiately deleted, or users email adress to \"ban\" the content of the cookie to be used, and immidiately delete all cookies containing that email adress)\n\nAnother thing is that since the function is locally controlled, it means that I don't know or store which users have consented, meaning I do not have any records of consent from users. HOWEVER, since the function is built in such a way that it will only place the cookie if consent is received, it would be sufficent as \"consent proof\" right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR doesn't impose specific requirements on how consent may be revoked, other than that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it. If the original consent is given via a checkbox, and if that checkbox is compliant, then withdrawing consent through the same checkbox should also be compliant. It might be appropriate to regularly remind the user that they can withdraw consent, e.g. by expiring the cookie after 12 months. It could also be a good idea to indicate that the user enabled this themselves, e.g. by showing the timestamp when consent was given.\n\nHowever, I am not convinced that consent is required in this scenario. While the definition of consent comes from GDPR, the cookie consent requirement comes from the ePrivacy directive which is then implemented in national laws. The ePD talks more generally about information stored on a terminal device of the \"subscriber or user\". Accessing such information (including but not limited to cookies) usually requires consent of the subscriber or user, but there is an exception for access that is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user to work. There are some consequences from this:\n\n* You might not need consent for setting the cookie if such storage is strictly necessary for your website to work. If your site features a log\\-in you could in theory also store the information server\\-side, but client\\-side storage might actually be more privacy\\-friendly.\n* At least, checking whether a consent cookie is set does not require consent since such access is strictly necessary for a consent mechanism to work.\n* It is not a problem if multiple people share a browser profile. Since this is an ePrivacy issue, you do not need the consent of the data subject but the consent of the subscriber or user.\n\nCookie consent is typically managed purely client\\-side, and I have *never* heard of functionality for a website operator to withraw consent on behalf of the user. If a website operator is concerned about this, they could offer a link that goes directly to a consent management panel.\n\nHowever, information about consent and withrawal events might be stored server\\-side.

According to the information provided, the GDPR doesn't impose specific requirements on how consent may be revoked, other than that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it. If the original consent is given via an unticked checkbox, and if that checkbox is compliant, then withdrawing consent through the same checkbox (now pre-ticked) should also be compliant. This approach satisfies the requirement that revoking consent should be as easy as giving it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pre-ticked checkboxes can be used for revoking consent in certain circumstances, as explained in the correct answer.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the GDPR does not mandate a separate, explicit function for revoking consent.

This could consist of an unopened letter with a date stamp, a notarized copy, or some other scheme involving a third party. According to the wikipedia entry there is no specific provision for this in US copyright law.\n\nIs there any legal reason to use a \"poor man's copyright\"? Have these techniques been used successfully in court, or are they mostly useless? And if one wanted to use such a technique, what is the best way to go about it?\n\nI am looking for an answer for US law, but would appreciate other countries' perspectives too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [U.S. Copyright Office says of poor man's copyright](http://copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman):\n\n> There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration.\n\nThis means that the U.S. government will not grant you any special rights or protections for having undertaken poor man's copyright, unlike advance copyright registration, which confers the ability to collect statutory damages. In any case, as a prerequisite to legal action, you will need to register your work, even if you must do so after the infringement has taken place:\n\n> You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work.\n\nInstead, poor man's copyright is purely an evidentiary mechanism for proving possession of a work at a particular point in time. Suppose a best\\-selling author illegally uses huge verbatim passages of your unpublished work in a new novel. As part of your legal argument against the infringing author, you want to prove that you possessed your unpublished work decades before the author claimed to have started work on the infringing novel.\n\nThe truly serious issue with many types of poor man's copyright is that it simply *doesn't* prove what it intends to prove. If you have a sealed envelope that is postmarked with a date, that only proves that the *envelope* passed through the postal system on that day. It says nothing about what the contents of the envelope were at the time; notably, the envelope could be mailed unsealed and then filled and sealed at a later date.\n\nMore involved forms of poor man's copyright, like storing a work in an undisturbed bank safe deposit box, *might* carry more evidentiary weight, but such an approach could still be difficult to verify reliably: we must ask the bank to verify the negative that no one ever accessed the deposit box. This may or may not be something the bank is prepared to do, and they may or may not maintain such records perpetually.\n\nIf you really want to prove that you had possession of a creative work on a particular day (which, again, is not a complete legal argument, but may be helpful), you will need to find a trustworthy third party who can demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that the work has remained undisturbed in their possession since a particular date. A bank might be good at this, but the best agency I know of to carry out such a purpose is the *U.S. Copyright Office*! They allow you to register your work (for probably much cheaper than a decades\\-long deposit box rental) *and* confer the benefits of registration, e.g. statutory damages.\n\nI don't know of any legal cases that have tested a poor man's copyright in court. On a personal note, I suspect there are none, because the primary case that poor man's copyright is intended to protect against \\-\\- someone taking your unpublished work and making the baldfaced lie that it is their own, such that your only recourse is to prove a timeline that renders their claims impossible \\-\\- seems somewhat uncommon.

Let us start by discussing [Cour de cassation, Chambre civile 1, 04 juillet 1995, 93\\-16198](https://juricaf.org/arret/FRANCE-COURDECASSATION-19950704-9316198), where the highest French court endorsed a 1993 court of appeal ruling, because it illustrates some relevant principles.\n\nA jewelry store put up a ring for sale for 100 000 francs (equivalent to roughly \u20ac20 000 in 2021\\), which someone bought. The store later realized that there was a mistake in the price tag (the intended listing price was more than four times higher) and sued to revert the sale.\n\nThe court of appeals judged that\n\n* as a general rule, mistakes in price tags are a risk the seller takes;\n* the buyer could reasonably think the asked price matched the true value of the ring, and therefore it was not \"unrealistically low\"\n\nThe latter point refers to a statute [(Code Civil 1169\\)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032041120) that says a contract of something\\-for\\-money is void if the price is \"unrealistically low\". The ruling essentially says that the test for \"unrealistically low\" is whether the buyer should reasonably be aware that the price is due to a mistake from the seller.\n\nI doubt a store can rely on the \"unrealistically low\" provision in the case of shipping fees. A random consumer has no way to accurately know the price of overseas shipping. Even if they did think the shipping fees were much lower than expected, it might be because the store chooses to charge something else that their exact costs, for whatever reason (e.g. uniform shipping fees is easier to maintain on their website that one cost for each country; some stores are \"free shipping\" meaning they recoup their shipping costs with higher item prices).\n\nNo surprise fees\n----------------\n\nThe seller might argue that their shipping costs were unknown, and that the shipping fee they charged was a provisional estimate, or conditional on a later determination of the true cost.\n\n[Code de la consommation, L112\\-3](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032227327) says that when the total price of the item or service sold \"cannot be reasonably known in advance \\[of the sale]\", the seller must provide advance notice to the buyer, as well as the method by which the unknown components of the price will be later determined. No such notice appears to have been made.\n\nOnline sale: when is the contract formed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe seller might argue that clicking \"buy\" on an online shopping cart does not form a contract, but that they reserve acceptance at a later date. The other answers seem to indicate that is a valid practice in some common\\-law countries, but I believe that is not the case in France. I could not find court cases on exactly that point, and therefore cannot be sure that the rest of my answer is correct.\n\nI believe the seller is bound by the terms offered on the website, based on [Code Civil, 1127\\-1 and 1127\\-2](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGISCTA000032007249/).\n\n> Quiconque propose \u00e0 titre professionnel, par voie \u00e9lectronique, la fourniture de biens ou la prestation de services, met \u00e0 disposition les stipulations contractuelles applicables d'une mani\u00e8re qui permette leur conservation et leur reproduction.\n> \n> \n> **L'auteur d'une offre reste engag\u00e9 par elle tant qu'elle est accessible par voie \u00e9lectronique de son fait.**\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> Le contrat n'est valablement conclu que si le destinataire de l'offre a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier le d\u00e9tail de sa commande et son prix total et de corriger d'\u00e9ventuelles erreurs avant de confirmer celle\\-ci pour exprimer son acceptation d\u00e9finitive.\n\n> Whichever business proposes by electronic means the sale of goods or services must allow the contractual conditions be be recorded and reproduced.\n> \n> \n> **The author of an offer is bound by it as long as it is accessible due to his or her actions.**\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> The contract is formed only if the recipient of the offer could check the details of his or her order, its total price, and could correct possible mistakes, before confirming the order to formulate his or her definite acceptance.\n\n\"Due to his or her actions\" means I cannot screenshot an Amazon page (or duplicate it on my web server) and request the conditions of that screenshot two years later. However, it does not include provisions for mistakes in the listed price or sales conditions, and I would expect the general rule (price tag mistakes are on the seller) to apply on the internet.\n\nThe last paragraph cited is a consumer rights provision \\- essentially, \"no contract is formed unless the consumer did X\". However, it implies that once the consumer did X, the contract *is* formed.\n\nContract enforcement\n--------------------\n\nFor the above reasons, I believe clauses that allow an online store to unilaterally cancel an order once placed are unenforceable (unless *force majeure* or other narrow exceptions apply). That being said, the incentive to sue in such cases is low (and I could find no jurisprudence).\n\nIn France (and I believe in all [civil\\-law](/questions/tagged/civil-law \"show questions tagged 'civil-law'\") systems), civil liability is established by three factors: a damage, a wrongful action, and a causation link between the two. In the jewelry case, the store could easily prove the damage (difference between the price at which the sale was made and the price at which the item was estimated), and the causation link between the consumer\u2019s action and the damage; however, there was no wrongful action.\n\nIn the case where the exchange of goods against money has been blocked by the store, the consumer\u2019s problem is to prove damage. If they have not been charged, or if they have been charged but refunded, the direct monetary impact is zero. The consumer would have to prove other theories of damage: for instance, that they relied on the ordered item to do something, and could not find a replacement in time. However, in all such scenarios, the causation link will be hard to prove.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Bob in New Zealand orders a device from a Spanish online store.

For online sales, the seller is bound by the offer as long as it's accessible due to their actions.\n3. Once the consumer has verified and confirmed the order details, including total price, the contract is formed.\n4. Clauses allowing unilateral cancellation by the store are likely unenforceable.\n5.

I'm inclined to think that if the document being notarized is of a type that only a lawyer may prepare (or it could be prepared by an individual acting for himself), then it would be unauthorized practice of law for a notary who isn't an attorney to suggest which kind of notarial act should be performed on the document.\n\nOn the other hand, if the document is of a type that anyone may give another person advice about, such as a school permission slip, an application form to obtain a birth certificate, or an absentee ballot application, does the mere fact that a notarization is needed magically transform it into a legal document, so the notary is prevented from suggesting which notarial act should be used?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whether this constitutes the practice of law is a close call, and would be somewhat context specific and jurisdiction specific. Generally speaking, the Northeast United States is the most jealous of actions that could be the practice of law committed by non\\-lawyers, while rural states in the Great Plains and Mountain West are most lenient.\n\nNormally, it boils down to a choice between an acknowledgement and an affidavit. One relevant issue is that in many states there is statutory short form language for each, arguably removing the issue of the drafting of the jurat as the practice of law if the statutory short form is used.\n\nOne of the risks would include the use of a notarization when it doesn't achieve the desired purpose (for example, to valid a Last Will and Testament that isn't witnessed), creating false hope.\n\nThe other issue is that if the client is someone from a civil law tradition, or a place like India (in both cases, a notary must have training equivalent to a lawyer admitted to practice engaging in transactional law and/or probate law) the risk of the client assuming that the notary has more legal knowledge that the notary actually does, is very severe.

Given that the client is from a civil law country where notaries typically have legal training equivalent to lawyers, there is a high risk that the client may assume the notary has more legal knowledge than they actually do.

They will then be distributed in accordance with your will. Your will should establish a [testamentary trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testamentary_trust) for the child for which you will establish the terms (for example, the will can consider things like living and education expenses and when the trust will end and the child can access the money directly) and name the trustee(s) in the will (and how they get replaced if they die or refuse to continue as a trustee). \n\nThe trustee is legally obligated to manage the funds in accordance with whatever terms you wrote into the trust for the benefit of the child. This should be someone you trust to a) do the right thing and b) manage the money wisely. You should also make provision in the trust to pay the trustee for their services. Most governments have a public trustee who will do this stuff for a fee.\n\nYou will need both professional legal and accounting advice to do this properly.

It allows the parent to set specific terms for how the money should be used for the child's benefit.\n2. A trustee can be appointed to manage the funds, ensuring the ex-spouse doesn't have direct control.\n3. It provides flexibility to account for future life changes (e.g., remarriage, additional children).\n4.

I have included the relevant statutes in the longer answer below, but to summarize:\n\nUnder Federal Law, you may not receive as a gift a firearm from a person who resides in another state without going through a licensed dealer in your state.\n\nUnder New Jersey law, you must have a firearms purchaser identification card in order to possess a rifle that you own at a range or any other location. You may receive a rifle as a gift from a person who lives in New Jersey provided you have a firearms purchaser identification card and the transfer is registered with the chief of police of the municipality in which you reside or the superintendent.\n\nYou may possess a rifle at a shooting range in New Jersey without a firearms purchaser identification card if the rifle was lent to you by the licensed range or a licensed instructor.\n\nLet's start with transferring firearms from the federal perspective:\n\nFrom the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/0501-firearms-top-10-qaspdf/download):\n\n> Under Federal law, an unlicensed individual \\[someone without a Federal\n>  Firearms License] is prohibited from transferring a firearm to an\n>  individual who does not reside in the State where the transferee\n>  resides.

In all likelihood, if a Dutch court was used, you would get a default judgment.\n\nThen, you would need to try to enforce the judgment some place where the defendant had assets. You could probably easily seize the Dutch account with a Dutch judgment if it wasn't closed as soon as the Defendant got word of the suit and before judgment entered.\n\nIn any other country, you would have to look to their law regarding the recognition of foreign judgments and follow the requirements of that law to convert your judgment into a judgment in a place where the defendant has assets. Recognition of foreign judgments for rent or other monies owed is usually more easily obtained than recognition of judgments for torts (e.g. damages owed from a car accident). In some U.S. states, this could be very straight forward and not involve a full fledged new trial on the merits, in other U.S. states, particularly if the Dutch judgment was obtained by default, it might be necessary to retry the case from scratch in the U.S.\n\nI do not know what the process is in Australia, but I suspect that it is similar.\n\nThe trouble is, that even though you could get a valid judgment in the Netherland and enforce it against the assets there, it would probably not be cost effective to pursue collection in the U.S. or in Australia for that amount of money.

Since store and I are both in the UK, that's how they have to do that by law. (There are exceptions, but this is the most common case).\n\nNow you are in Russia. The company is likely not much interested in a few sales to Russia. So they don't *have* to charge you VAT. But they will sell to you for \u00a3120, send you an invoice for \u00a3100 \\+ \u00a320 VAT, and send \u00a320 to HMRC. Just as with my purchase.

You can try to get the money back from HMRC \\- good luck.

Even though EU stores are not legally required to charge VAT to non-EU customers, many still do so for practical reasons. It's often simpler and less risky for stores to treat all transactions the same way, rather than implementing separate systems for EU and non-EU customers. The store will likely charge the full \u20ac120, including VAT, and remit the VAT to their country's tax authority. While the Russian citizen could theoretically try to reclaim the VAT, this process is typically complex and not worth the effort for small purchases. Options A and D are incorrect because most stores don't automatically exempt or require proof for VAT purposes in online transactions.

The child is identified as a victim and the police and child/youth services have the obligation to protect the child and to keep them from harm. This is the main goal of police and children/youth services \\- to keep the child safe and act in the best interest of the child.\n\nUsually, a complaint to a child abuse center can take time to process. When a police complaint comes in it is more immediate, with police having more 'influence' with CYS (child/youth services). Especially when the child is in deadly danger (they were just stabbed, after all), the police may arrest the mother or abusive sibling or intervene therein to remove the child from the parents care with CYS\\-equivalent services working to find suitable alternative living situations for the child as a result of a order of removal/protection authorized by a judge. (PA at least had emergency situation response plans for these situations where a judge is just a phone call away).\n\nAs well, the child will likely be made a ward of the state if the courts determine the mother cannot care for the child or is a threat as such (not caring enough to stop the brother may count), insomuch that the child may be removed from the dangerous situation and placed in the care of a willing relative or if none can be found will be placed in temporary foster care in a safer environment.\n\nNote that nothing happens rapidly without the initial complaint to the police. At age 16 the child is likely going to be taken more seriously (compared to a 12 year old, for example), and has the right to be allowed to reach out to hospital staff to ask to speak to a police officer \\- otherwise it takes a child abuse complaint from someone who knows the child and situation and that can sometimes take longer to process (though, the distance factor in the original question may make a complaint from overseas given a lower priority due to not knowing the person on a more personal in\\-person level)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old in Chicago, IL has been stabbed by her brother and her mother is negligent.

Having the child ask hospital staff to speak with a police officer is likely to prompt the most immediate action. Police have more influence with child/youth services and can take emergency action to protect the child, especially in cases of imminent danger.\n\nD) Waiting for child/youth services to process a complaint may take too long and doesn't address the immediate safety concerns.\n\nThe key is to involve law enforcement quickly, as they can work with child/youth services to take immediate protective actions, potentially removing the child from the dangerous situation and finding a safer living arrangement."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31238/copyright-on-patterns-in-coreldraw", "docs_id": 31238, "title": "copyright on patterns in CorelDraw", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I made an image that includes a pattern that comes with CorelDraw X4 and attempted to sell it printed on a T\\-shirt online, would that be a copyright violation?

There are other restrictions, as well, including on which patterns you can use (you can't use any clipart or patterns that depict an individual, for instance).\n\nThat answer masks a lot of gotchas, though. For one, you must set limits on the use of the t\\-shirt image. Consider this scenario: you do the image, make the t\\-shirts, and someone buys one. A third person sees the t\\-shirt and thinks it would make the perfect costume for a photograph. Recognizing your copyright in the t\\-shirt, he asks if he can put a model in your t\\-shirt and take a picture. On the language of the license, your answer must be, \"no.\" You do not have the right to sublicense the Corel clipart to the photographer, so you cannot authorize the photograph. Technically, you will need to be careful about using it in your online t\\-shirt store for this same reason: if you provide a final (non\\-downloadable) image for use in the store, you are probably fine. But if the store permits images to be downloaded and permanently stored, that use is forbidden.\n\nThe final image to be printed on the t\\-shirt, the clipart image, your intended and possible future uses of the final design, and much more information about the particular online t\\-shirt store would all be helpful in giving you a more complete answer.

[The law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/247d-6d) says that a vaccine manufacturer is\n\n> immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law with\n> respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to,\n> or resulting from the administration to or the use by an individual of\n> a covered countermeasure if a declaration under subsection (b) has\n> been issued\n\nand there was a [declaration under subsection (b)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/03/17/2020-05484/declaration-under-the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act-for-medical-countermeasures). This immunity is not conditioned either way by being approved, indeed the declaration states\n\n> To be a Covered Countermeasure, qualified pandemic or epidemic\n> products or security countermeasures also must be approved or cleared\n> under the FD\\&C Act; licensed under the PHS Act; or authorized for\n> emergency use under Sections 564, 564A, or 564B of the FD\\&C Act\n\nThe liability immunity is not perpetual, the declaration says:\n\n> Liability immunity for Covered Countermeasures administered and used\n> in accordance with the public health and medical response of the\n> Authority Having Jurisdiction begins with a Declaration and lasts\n> through (1\\) the final day the emergency Declaration is in effect, or\n> (2\\) October 1, 2024, whichever occurs first.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there can't be another declaration in the future.\n\nImmunity of a manufacturer to liability is not related to a patient being \"covered\". There are other ways in which a patient could be \"covered\". One of them is the [Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program](https://www.hrsa.gov/CICP) and the other is the [National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html), which presently redirects you to CICP.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal information provided, which of the following statements is correct regarding liability and compensation for COVID-19 vaccine side effects?\n\nA) Pfizer became liable for side effects after FDA approval on August 23, 2021.\nB) Patients who received both doses after FDA approval are fully insured against side effects.\nC) The liability immunity for vaccine manufacturers is conditional on FDA approval status.\nD) Patients may seek compensation through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, regardless of when they received the vaccine.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The information provided clarifies that vaccine manufacturers have immunity from liability based on a declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, not FDA approval status. This immunity lasts until October 1, 2024, or the end of the emergency declaration, whichever comes first. The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is available for patients to seek compensation for vaccine-related injuries, regardless of when they received the vaccine or its approval status.

(At least some U.S. Circuit Courts.) In Quebec, Parental rights are exercised jointly.\n\nSo, if there is a right for parents to \"pursue life\", would a right to abortion still remain for a surrogate parent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Pursuant to well\\-established law in the US, the person carrying the fetus (conventionally, the mother) has the right to an abortion. Doing so might be a breach of contract. Some jurisdictions flat out ban surrogacy contracts (Arizona, D.C), perhaps even penalizes (Michigan, NY), or declares void (Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska). In California, surrogacy contracts are legal and enforceable. One possible challenging scenario is that the mother refuses a requested abortion, the other is that one or both of the intended parents seek to block the mother from getting an abortion. The former case in the case of [Melissa Cook](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1487/44751/20180426163111738_Cook%20v.%20Harding%20et%20al.%20Petition%20-%20Refile.pdf), where there was an attempt made to reduce the number of pregnancies from three \u2013 Cook carried the fetuses to term despite a contrary request from the intended parents (no action was filed to attempt to force an abortion). There has apparently been no attempted case to force a mother to carry a fetus to terms because of a contract (i.e. order for specific enforcement).\n\nUnder present US law, the woman carrying the fetus has the exclusive right to choose to terminate a pregnancy. No statutes or case law suggest that a surrogacy contract will override that right, and some laws explicitly deny the ability to force a mother to have an abortion (Utah Code Ann. \u00a778B\\-15\\-808(2\\) \\& (3\\), Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7160\\.754(g), Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a763\\-213(3\\)(b)).

This right cannot be overridden by a surrogacy contract or the wishes of the intended parents. However, if the surrogate chooses to have an abortion against the terms of the surrogacy agreement, she may face legal consequences for breach of contract, depending on the state's laws regarding surrogacy agreements. It's important to note that while the surrogate has the right to make this decision, she may be liable for financial damages to the intended parents.

Hypothetically if the Client doesn't pay Contractor does that mean I wouldn't get paid and there would be nothing I could do about it? Is there even a deadline?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At common law there is no prohibition such a term\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nContract law is based on the premise that the contract is made by consenting people who want to make enforceable promises to each other and they know what\u2019s best for themselves. At common law, you can\u2019t agree to a contract and then avoid its consequences because you don\u2019t like them or don\u2019t think they are \u201cfair\u201d.\n\nAt common law, the only way to avoid a contractural obligation is to demonstrate that it is unconscionable, that is, the term is so onerous that no reasonable person would have agreed to it. A \u201cpay when paid\u201d clause is not unconscionable.\n\nContracts are about risk allocation \\- if a subcontractor agrees to assume the risk of the principal not paying the contractor there there is nothing to stop them doing so.\n\nStatute law sometimes recognises that people need protection\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe conceit of the common law is that contracts are formed by parties of relatively equal power who are able to negotiate and agree the terms of their contract. Since this is not necessarily the case, the legislature in various jurisdictions has stepped in to regulate some contracts.\n\nMost commonly this occurs in the context of [consumer protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection) law. Canada (and it\u2019s provinces) have these laws so you need to check if your contract is covered \\- \u201cconsumer\u201d can include businesses in some jurisdictions.\n\nFurther, in Canada (and it\u2019s provinces), certain contracts in building and construction are covered by [prompt payment](https://www.levelset.com/blog/canada-prompt-payment-act-passes-senate/) laws which, if they apply, make \u201cpay when paid\u201d clauses void.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A general contractor includes the following clause in their contract with a subcontractor: \"Payment to subcontractor is contingent on when the client pays the general contractor. If the client uses a net-30 payment schedule, the subcontractor can expect to be paid up to 30 days after the first day of the month following invoice submission.\" Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of this clause in Canada?\n\nA) This clause is automatically void in all Canadian provinces due to consumer protection laws.\nB) The clause is enforceable under common law, but may be voided by prompt payment laws in certain provinces for building and construction contracts.\nC) The clause is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable in any Canadian court.\nD) The clause is always enforceable regardless of any provincial laws, as it was agreed upon by both parties.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The \"pay when paid\" clause described in the question is generally enforceable under common law, as contract law allows parties to allocate risk as they see fit. However, in Canada, some provinces have implemented prompt payment laws specifically for the building and construction industry. These laws can potentially void such clauses in contracts that fall under their jurisdiction. The correct answer acknowledges both the general enforceability under common law and the potential for it to be voided by specific provincial legislation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because consumer protection laws don't automatically void such clauses in all cases, especially for business-to-business contracts. \nOption C is incorrect because \"pay when paid\" clauses are not typically considered unconscionable in contract law. \nOption D is too absolute, as it doesn't account for the potential impact of prompt payment laws in some provinces."}}
