The contract says something like, \"a condition precedent for the investment of X is a demonstration of the company's technology to the investor's reasonable satisfaction.\" The company delays in doing the demo, but asks for the money. The investor says, \"no demo, no money.\" Is this what \"condition precedent\" is meant to say? \n\nIf there is no express time limit written into the contract, is there an implied, or \"reasonable\" time limit after which the investor is off the hook? For instance, if the demo took place six months later, can the investor reasonably say, \"your technology sounded interesting six months ago, but I fear that it has been made obsolete by now.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In contract law, a [condition precedent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/condition_precedent) is a specified event that must occur prior to a party having to perform a contract obligation.\n\nIn your example, the demonstration is the condition precedent, and funding is the obligation to be performed. So, yes, \"no demo, no money\" is another way to put it.\n\nThe \"investor's reasonable satisfaction\" is the standard used to determine whether the condition has been satisfied (and thus whether the obligation will be triggered). The reasonableness standard falls somewhere in the middle segment on a scale of investor\\-friendly to inventor\\-friendly contract language. For example, \"the investor's sole discretion\" is investor\\-friendly (though likely subject to a good faith duty); \"the investor's discretion\" is still investor\\-friendly and is limited by a good faith duty; \"the investor's reasonable discretion\" anchors the discretion not in what the investor would want to do but in what would be objectively reasonable. Removing investor discretion and replacing it with something like \"upon demonstration\" would be inventor\\-friendly.\n\nWhat is reasonable will vary widely based on the industry and product obsolescence timelines.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A startup company and an angel investor enter into a contract where the investor agrees to invest $1 million in exchange for 10% equity. The contract states, \"A condition precedent for the investment is a demonstration of the company's technology to the investor's reasonable satisfaction.\" After six months, the company has not performed the demonstration but requests the investment. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The investor is obligated to provide the funding because six months is a reasonable time frame for the condition precedent to be fulfilled.\n\nB) The investor can refuse to provide funding indefinitely, as there is no time limit specified in the contract for the demonstration to occur.\n\nC) The investor can reasonably refuse to provide funding, citing the delay and potential obsolescence of the technology, but may be subject to a \"good faith\" standard in making this decision.\n\nD) The condition precedent is automatically satisfied after six months, and the investor must provide the funding regardless of whether a demonstration occurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement given the information provided. The demonstration is a condition precedent that must occur before the investor is obligated to provide funding. While there is no express time limit in the contract, there is an implied \"reasonable\" time limit. After six months, the investor can reasonably argue that the delay has potentially affected the value or relevance of the technology. However, the investor's decision must still meet a \"good faith\" standard and be objectively reasonable, as the contract specifies \"investor's reasonable satisfaction.\" The investor cannot arbitrarily refuse funding but must have a legitimate reason related to the demonstration or lack thereof. Options A and D incorrectly assume automatic satisfaction or obligation after a certain time period, while option B overstates the investor's ability to refuse indefinitely without consideration of reasonableness or good faith."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61920/trying-a-foreigner-in-the-united-states-praticalities", "docs_id": 61920, "title": "Trying a foreigner in the United States - praticalities", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am reading [this press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack) of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nNorthern District of California.\n\nThe attorney states that:\n\n> Mason Sheppard, aka \u201cChaewon,\u201d 19, of Bognor Regis, in the United\n> Kingdom, was charged in a criminal complaint in the Northern District\n> of California with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to\n> commit money laundering, and the intentional access of a protected\n> computer.\n\nSo the defendant appears to be located in the UK and is being charged in the US.\n\n1.

Can the company legally require her not to disclose the conduct of an illegal activity?\n\nI remember reading that contracts cannot be legally binding if there is a requirement of criminal acts, am I wrong to assume this for NDA's?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The validity of the NDA is not an easy question, but a related one is more clear.\n\nA lawyer in the U.S. in most states is not permitted to threaten criminal or administrative action (e.g. reporting someone to immigration or tax officials), to gain advantage in a civil case. You can unilaterally bring criminal charges or take administrative action, but it is deemed to be unethical and against public policy to refrain from bringing criminal charges or taking administration action to gain civil advantages.\n\nAn NDA of the type described arguably violated the same public policy and might be invalidated as a result. \n\nPut another way, there is a privilege to make certain reports to public officials without legal consequences and such an NDA might violate that privilege. Some of these privileges found in what are called \"whistle blower\" statutes specifically prohibit this kind of agreement as to some specific kinds of illegal conduct, but not others. There isn't a general rule.\n\nThis said, it is not black and white. For example, a private NDA can't prevent someone from testifying under subpoena, but can prevent someone from voluntarily testifying in the absence of a legal compulsion to do so such as a subpoena.\n\n> Suppose a woman is sexually assaulted at work, and is given an NDA to\n>  sign. Can the company legally require her not to disclose the conduct\n>  of an illegal activity?\n\nI can imagine this example coming out different ways in different jurisdictions. \n\nFor example, some states have a legal duty (rarely enforced) that requires people to report felonies, and an NDA in this case would contradict that affirmative legal duty, while others do not.\n\nAnother source of gray in the analysis is that there is a difference between not reporting a sexual assault that actually happened, and, as part of a larger settlement, executing an affidavit stating under penalty of perjury and under oath that a sexual assault didn't happen. The first is potentially an NDA that is void as a matter of public policy. The other, in principle, is a settlement that the person signing the affidavit can only enter into if it is true. There is nothing, in general, wrong, about requiring someone to confirm that certain representations are true as part of a business transaction or contract and allowing the contract to go forwards only if certain facts are true.\n\nThe gray gets deeper, because whether a sexual assault happened or not is not always a subjectively black and white clear issue of pure fact. (It is subjective because an affidavit or affirmation is made to the best of the declarant or affiants' knowledge and belief, not as a matter of objective fact.)\n\nFor example, someone may not have perfect memory of what happened, or there could be doubt over the question of whether the perpetrators acted recklessly (the Model Penal Code intent requirement for sexual assault) or merely with criminal negligence (which would not be sexual assault under the Model Penal Code).\n\nA statement made under oath about whether a sexual assault happened to the best of your knowledge, thus, might be a mixture of factual issues (A penetrated B at a certain date and time) and legal or not perfectly factually known ones (A acted with X intent regarding consent during that act).\n\nSo, in a case where there was some room to argue either way about how to characterize what happened and about what actually did happen, there might be some room for a settling party to make a non\\-perjured statement consistent with the settlement and then to agree not to a true NDA, but instead to not make statements which, if the affidavit is true, would be false.\n\nIn a plea bargain in a criminal case, one can plead \"no contest\" without agreeing that the crime factually happened, but that isn't really possibly in the context of an affidavit about what really happened, with an NDA limited to not disclosing the incident since it was already agreed as a matter of sworn fact that there is nothing to disclose that rises the level of a crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company asks an employee to sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) regarding an alleged sexual assault incident at work.

As the documentation suggests, there isn't a clear-cut general rule. Some jurisdictions may have laws that make such NDAs unenforceable as a matter of public policy, while others may allow them under certain circumstances. The enforceability may also depend on whether the NDA prohibits reporting to law enforcement (which is generally not allowed) or merely prevents voluntary disclosure in non-legal contexts. Additionally, the specific wording of the NDA and the nature of the statements being prohibited can affect its enforceability.

So to the extent that a newer law contradicts an older law, the newer law wins to the extent of the contradiction.\n\nHowever, it's good legislative practice to repeal or modify older laws so that the code of law is internally consistent on its face without having to work out which law came later.\n\n... but ...\n-----------\n\nCongress probably doesn't have to power to impose a national curriculum.\n\nThe Federal government only has three sources of power \\- 2 come from the Constitution and the third comes from being a nation\\-state. It can only legislate/regulate within its powers. If it has the power and it makes a law that conflicts with a state's law \\- too bad for the state. However, if it doesn't have the power then only the states can make laws on that issue.\n\nThe three sources of power are:\n\n1. [The enumerated powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_powers_(United_States)): The powers that the Constitution explicitly grants to the Federal government. Education isn't one of them.\n2. The implied powers: The Constitution gives the power \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" This means that if in order to do something it can do, there is something that is necessary but not a power explicitly granted, then it can do that necessary thing. How broad this power is, depends on the current fashions in the Supreme Court. Setting curricula for primary and secondary education doesn't seem to be strictly necessary.\n3.

The existing laws, including Section 6692, do not authorize federal control over curricula, but they also don't explicitly forbid it in all circumstances. However, if Congress were to pass new legislation establishing a national curriculum, it would likely face constitutional challenges. This is because education is not explicitly listed as a federal power in the Constitution, and it's debatable whether it falls under implied or inherent powers.

If you stay there over the objections of the owner or the owner's agent, you are trespassing.\n\nThe law applicable to government property owners and private property owners is basically the same in this regard.\n\nRealistically, on government property, furthermore, the standard by which the government employee may legally terminate your license to be there and exclude you from the property is low.\n\nBasically, it must merely not violate any constitutional right you may have, and you do not have a constitutional right to be present on government owned property, except in a quite narrow subset of cases (e.g. the \"town square\").\n\nMore exactly, you do not have a right to be on government property *per se*, but you can't be excluded from it for a constitutionally impermissible reason. The government gets to decide what parts of property it owns are available to the general public and for what content\\-neutral purposes.\n\nThus, the right to be present on government owned \"public\" property (which doesn't include private areas of government owned property) can be subjected to reasonable and content\\-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions.\n\nFor example, a town could legally decide that the town square is closed from midnight to eight a.m. every day.\n\nThe quoted material from the case *Chicago v. Morales*, 527 U.S. 41, 53\\-54 (1999\\) cited in the [answer by bdb484](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/90245) is narrower than a plain reading out of context would suggest. In that quotation, the term \"public place\" is being used in a sense much more restrictive than in the broader sense of property that is merely government owned. It is referring to places where the government has expressly or implicitly allowed members of the general public to be present on land that it owns (as opposed, for example, to a government office area of a building, or a maintenance facility in a government owned park, or a conservation area in a government owned park). This narrow sense of the word resolves what would otherwise seem to be a contradiction in the law.\n\nBut, the government has the authority to make something that once was a public place into a non\\-public place going forward.\n\nFor example, historically, the Civic Center park in front of the capitol in Denver, Colorado has been a public place. But, the government can and did close it off to the public for many months for maintenance and out of public health concerns when heavy use of it by homeless people and drug dealers caused the premises to be seriously damaged and created a public health risk from it being used to dispose of dirty, used, injection\\-drug syringes, and for people to defecate.\n\n**A Hypothetical**\n\nSuppose that Chris is the sole librarian in one of the towns of [College Corner](http://www.lyndonirwin.com/ccorner.htm), which is on the Ohio\\-Indiana border, which are in different time zones. In that capacity, Chris has the authority to set library policies including the hours of the library and the rules for its use without the approval of anyone else.\n\nChris has a hot date at 5:30 p.m. But, at lunch time, Chris learned that the hot date was at 5:30 p.m. in Ohio and not an hour later at 5:30 p.m. in Indiana, but the library's official closing time is 5 p.m. in Indiana, because Ohio was observing daylight savings time, but Indian was not, at the time when this happened.\n\nChris, as the sole government official in charge of the library, decides to close the library before its posted closing time at 4:00 p.m. Indiana time (5 p.m. Ohio time) in order to be able to make it to the hot date.\n\nChris quietly asks everyone left in the library to leave at 4 p.m. Indiana time, and everyone but you does. But you, who are homeless, really want to stay the extra hour before getting out in the cold and finding a bridge to sleep under, so you refuse to leave saying that the library is still open until 5 p.m. Indiana time, as stated in its posted hours.\n\nChris orders you to leave and warns you that he is calling the police to remove you if you don't do so voluntarily. The police arrive and restate the complaint of Chris. The police arrest you for trespassing and you are charged with this crime in the appropriate court by the appropriate prosecuting attorney.\n\nYou had done nothing wrong whatsoever prior to being asked to leave and refusing to do so. But, Chris has not violated your constitutional rights by ordering you removed for some unconstitutional reason. Chris then goes on the hot date; it is love at first sight, and Chris gets married the next week. As an apology for putting you out for the sole convenience of Chris, Chris invites you to the wedding.\n\nDo you have a valid defense to the criminal trespassing charge on the grounds that the librarian's actions were unconstitutional? No. You might have a \"good faith claim of right\" defense, however, to the criminal charges.\n\nDo you have a valid claim for money damages for a violation of your constitutional rights? No.\n\nIndeed, ordering you removed for \"no reason\" that has anything to do with your conduct, as in this case, is probably more likely to be legal and constitutional, than having you removed for \"some reason\" other than just \"because I the librarian say so\" that doesn't involve wrongdoing on your part.\n\n*A Variation In The Hypothetical*\n\nIf instead, your were being ordered to leave the library because you were wearing an National Rifle Association cap (and the library didn't prohibit wearing caps), this affirmative reason, which is contrary to the First Amendment freedom of expression, would be a violation of your constitutional rights, which would definitely be a basis for a civil lawsuit against the librarian and police involved in you being arrested.\n\nI don't know the details of constitutional defenses in criminal law well enough to know if the violation of your constitutional rights would be a valid defense to the criminal trespassing charge (or a failure to obey a police officer's order to leave charge) resulting from you failing to leave in that circumstance, and I can see legitimate arguments both ways.

While this doesn't give you a constitutional right to stay, it may provide grounds for a \"good faith claim of right\" defense in a criminal trespassing case.

Option B is wrong because the lack of explanation doesn't violate your constitutional rights in this context. Option C is incorrect because the lack of explanation actually makes the order more likely to be legal, not less.

A prosecutor can't bring a case unless he knows who did it. And, the police may be wise not to try to investigate a crime that previous experience has proven to them is a dead end most of the time for a crime of modest economic value.\n\nMost cases of simple larceny are never solved. And, institutionally, the police have to balance the cost of investigating the crime against the seriousness of the crime. Murders and kidnappings are almost always going to take priority for police resources over stolen phones, particularly if investigating the phone theft may require international cooperation that makes the investigation more costly.\n\nA key point is that the mere fact that a phone is pawned doesn't mean that the person pawning it is necessarily committing a crime, so even if you find out where the phone is in some pawn shop (possibly in Albania or Turkey, by now), that doesn't mean that the job is over. That person could have bought it innocently and at fair market value from a flea market, from someone who could have gotten it from someone who received it innocently as a gift, from a friend of a criminal fence, who may have bought it not innocently from a true thief. In fact, because criminals respond to incentives like anyone else, it is far more likely that the phone was swiftly \"laundered\" along the lines I suggest in this example, than it is that it is still in the possession of someone close to the thief.\n\nBut, only the fence and the thief would have criminal liability. \n\nIt is a lot harder to solve the crime of a stolen cell phone than you would think, and the agency may simply not be able to justify the resources it would take to investigate that case properly to a situation where someone had a phone stole that was worth maybe 400 Euros in used condition.\n\nThe more you can do to solve the crime, the more likely it is that they will find that it is worth further investigating until a thief can be identified and apprehended.

In California, [Penal Code sect. 518](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=518-527) defines extortion:\n\n> Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent,\n>  or the obtaining of an official act of a public officer, induced by a\n>  wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right.\n\nThe statutes do not clarify what \"wrongfully\" means, and the Calcrim jury instructions are also no help. I presume that this distinguishes the case where you create fear in the perpetrator and solicit payment for silence, versus the perpetrator becomes fearful on his own and offers money to \"compensate\" you (which is legal). So then sect. 519, states what can induce fear: \n\n> Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat of\n>  any of the following:\n> \n> \n> ...\n>  2\\. To accuse the individual threatened, or a relative of his or her, or a member of his or her family, of a crime.\n> \n> \n> 3. To expose, or to impute to him, her, or them a deformity, disgrace, or crime.\n\nYou would be threatening cause of fear number 2 (and 3\\). Then the question arises, were you successful? Note that extortion is defined in terms of *obtaining* property. If you actually obtain the property, that violates section 520:\n\n> Every person who extorts any money or other property from another,\n>  under circumstances not amounting to robbery or carjacking, by means\n>  of force, or any threat, such as is mentioned in Section 519, shall be\n>  punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170\n>  for two, three or four years.\n\nIf you only make the threat, and the threat is written, then per sect. 523, the same punishment results:\n\n> Every person who, with intent to extort any money or other property\n>  from another, sends or delivers to any person any letter or other\n>  writing, whether subscribed or not, expressing or implying, or adapted\n>  to imply, any threat such as is specified in Section 519, is\n>  punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were\n>  actually obtained by means of such threat.\n\nBut otherwise (if you do not obtain the property, and the threat is not written), per sect 524 there is a lesser penalty:\n\n> Every person who attempts, by means of any threat, such as is\n>  specified in Section 519 of this code, to extort money or other\n>  property from another is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail\n>  not longer than one year or in the state prison or by fine not\n>  exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000\\), or by both such fine and\n>  imprisonment.\n\nThere is no law prohibiting you from telling a person that they must return the money they scammed from you, and there is no law requiring you to report an attempt to scam.

Could it be because the job of interpreting laws is of the judiciary? And that is why the laws are purposedly left vague?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In countries with separation of powers, laws may be more vague in order to allow for flexibility and adaptability in their interpretation and application. This is because the judiciary, which is one of the branches of government with the power to interpret laws, plays a key role in determining the meaning and application of laws in practice.\n\nThe separation of powers doctrine aims to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful by dividing power among different branches. The judiciary, as an independent branch, has the power to interpret laws and ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution and other laws. This means that the judiciary has a degree of discretion in interpreting laws, and laws may be written in a more general and flexible way to allow for this.\n\nAdditionally, laws in these countries are often written to be applicable to a wide range of situations and cases. This is because it is difficult to predict all of the different ways that a law may be applied, and to anticipate all of the specific circumstances that may arise. Therefore, laws are often written in a more general way so that they can be applied in a variety of situations.\n\nIn short, laws in countries with separation of power may be more vague because they are written to allow for flexibility and adaptability in their interpretation and application, and to be applicable in a wide range of situations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why countries with separation of powers tend to have more vague laws?\n\nA) To prevent the executive branch from having too much control over law interpretation\nB) To allow for flexibility in interpretation and application by the judiciary, while maintaining broad applicability\nC) To make it easier for legislators to pass laws without requiring specific details\nD) To confuse citizens and make it harder for them to understand their legal rights\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B.

That is, would the Republican have to nominate the new presidential candidate, or is the presidential candidacy constitutionally inherited by the corresponding VP candidate? Furthermore, would Pence have the standing to participate in debates as both the VP candidate against Harris and as the presidential candidate against Biden?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a single \"candidacy\". Each of the 50 states and DC holds an election for a slate of electors, and those electors later participate in the actual election for President and Vice President in the Electoral College.\n\nFor each state's election for electors, the ballot usually prints the name of the \"candidate\" for President and Vice President submitted by the party. The rules on under what circumstances the names on the ballot can be changed varies by state, and it may also depend on how close to election date it is, as it may be infeasible to change it once ballots have started being printed.\n\nHowever, even if a state's ballots print the name of certain candidates for President and VP in the election for the slate of electors, that does not necessarily mean that those electors, once chosen, will necessarily have to vote for those candidates. So if a party's candidate withdraws too close to the election for the ballots to be changed, or withdraws after the election but before the Electoral College votes, the party's leadership will probably instruct all of the electors of that party (i.e. electors in the states that that party's candidate for President won in) to vote for a new ticket of President and VP in the Electoral College.\n\nWhether the electors will or can follow those instructions is a little tricky. Some states have laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the Presidential and VP candidates that won in that state, and I am not sure whether the parties can change the Presidential and VP candidates after the election. This would vary by state. In some states, the pledge requirement has no penalty for violation; in some states, there is a fine; and in some states, the state will replace an elector who does not vote for the pledged candidate. (And the Supreme Court ruled in *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020\\) that it is legal for states to fine and/or replace faithless electors.) Again, you would need to look at the specific state's law to see if there is an exception for if the Presidential/VP candidate withdraws.\n\n---\n\nAs for debates, as a commenter noted, they are run by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a private corporation, so it would be completely up to that corporation to decide who would be invited to which debates.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the event that a presidential candidate withdraws after the general election but before the Electoral College votes, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the process of selecting a replacement?\n\nA) The vice presidential candidate automatically becomes the new presidential candidate in all states.\n\nB) Each state's electors are legally bound to vote for the replacement candidate chosen by the party leadership.\n\nC) The process varies by state, with some states allowing electors to vote for a replacement while others may have strict laws about faithless electors.\n\nD) The Commission on Presidential Debates has the final say in determining who becomes the replacement candidate.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the process of selecting a replacement candidate if the original candidate withdraws after the general election but before the Electoral College votes can indeed vary by state. Some states have laws requiring electors to vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state, while others may allow more flexibility. The Supreme Court case Chiafalo v. Washington (2020) upheld states' rights to enforce pledges by electors, but the specifics can differ from state to state. Some states may allow parties to instruct electors to vote for a replacement, while others may have stricter laws about faithless electors.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the vice presidential candidate does not automatically become the new presidential candidate in all states.

This is called a \"work based on the Program\" on the GPLv2\\.\n\nIn this case, however, it seems that your own software does not include software covered by the GPLv2, but you want to put it onto an SD card together with software covered by the GPLv2\\. That would most likely fall under \"mere aggregation of another work\", as long as your software and the other software do not interact very closely (such as dynamic linking).\n\nTo quote the [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html):\n\n> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n>  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n>  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n>  the scope of this License.\n\nSo in that case the GPLv2 does not cover your program. You will still have to supply the source code for the GPLv2 software on the SD card. This is covered by section 3 of the GPLv2\\. Basically, you have two options:\n\n* send along the complete source code for all the software (would be quite bothersome for a complete distro)\n* *or* provide a written offer to provide the source code on demand to anyone who asks (you may charge for this, but only to cover your cost)\n\nGPLv2 contains a third option, but that only applies to non\\-commercial distribution.\n\n---\n\nPractically speaking, it should be enough to include a README.txt or similar explaining that the SD card contains software covered by GPLv2, and that you will provide the source code on demand for a certain, reasonable fee (say $5 or $10 per CD).\n\nIn practice, it is unlikely that anyone would ask for this, as the source code can usually be downloaded for free elsewhere, but if someone does ask, you just charge them $5 and send a CD.\n\nOf course, to reduce legal risks it may be prudent to contact a lawyer for your jurisdiction, as this is only general advice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a product that includes their proprietary software along with a Linux distribution and other open-source packages on an SD card for Raspberry Pi.

According to the GPLv2 license, when distributing software covered by this license (in this case, the Linux distribution and some included packages), the distributor must make the source code available. However, the developer's proprietary software, if it doesn't directly incorporate or link to GPLv2 code, is considered \"mere aggregation\" and isn't subject to the same requirement.\n\nThe GPLv2 allows for two practical options in this scenario: either include all the source code with the distribution or provide a written offer to supply the source code upon request.

The legal term for applying different laws to different issues that arise in the same legal case is called [d\u00e9pe\u00e7age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9pe%C3%A7age).\n\nFor example, the law of the place where the contract is signed might govern the issue of contract formation, while the law of the place where the contract is to be performed might govern performance of the contract.\n\nConsumer protection laws are often applied to contracts with consumers based upon the place where the consumer is domiciled or is located when the contract is entered into by the parties.\n\nIt isn't unusual for a contract to be subject to the law of more than one place on issues other than issues of contract formation, and other than on issues of contract interpretation. But, any given legal issue related to a contract is ordinarily subject to only a single jurisdictions laws (unless it is a public policy regulation).\n\nUnless anyone argues in court that the law from another place should apply to an issue and that law is different from the legal rule in the place where the court is located, in a court case, a court will apply the law of the place where the court is located (called the \"law of the forum.\"\n\n**Exceptions to the general rule**\n\nThere are some international treaties which create exceptions to the general rule and instead provide that a contract will be governed by law established in an international treaty (which is your possibility three). There are at least two such treaties to which the United States is a party which are notable and come up with some frequency.\n\nOne of them is the CISG, which is the [Convention on the International Sale of Goods](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/salegoods) that governs international contracts for the sale of goods that are not expressly excepted from the treaty (mostly business to business sales of goods), when both the seller and the buyer are associated with a country that is a party to the treaty.\n\nAnother is the [New York Convention](https://player.siriusxm.com/#/main) a.k.a. the \"Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards\" a.k.a. the \"New York Arbitration Convention\" which governs governs contracts with arbitration clauses in them that involve parties from different countries that are both parties to the Convention.\n\nIn addition to these treaty provisions, some international contracts are governed in the United States by [admiralty law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_law), rather than by the federal and state laws that would otherwise apply to these contracts. Obviously, the affected contracts are contracts with a maritime dimension, either in international waters or in the \"navigable waters of the United States.\"\n\nI am certain that this list of exceptions governed by special laws is not complete (e.g. certain international treaties apply to contracts involving international airline travel), but the question doesn't identify anything about the contracts that make them stand out.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A multinational corporation based in the United States enters into a contract with a supplier in Japan for the purchase of electronic components.

In the absence of a choice of law clause in an international contract, courts often apply the \"most significant relationship\" test to determine which law should govern issues related to the contract. This test considers various factors, including the place of contracting, the place of negotiation, the place of performance, the location of the subject matter, and the domicile or place of business of the parties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the place of signing can be a factor, it's not necessarily determinative, especially if it's not closely related to the parties or the performance of the contract.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the home country of one party is not automatically given preference in determining applicable law.\n\nOption D, while plausible, is incorrect in this specific case.

The CISG primarily deals with formation of the contract and the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer, but may not cover all aspects of contract performance.\n\nThe \"most significant relationship\" test (Option C) allows for a more nuanced consideration of all relevant factors, making it the most likely approach for determining the applicable law for performance issues in this scenario."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78829/2022-is-ukraine-at-war-with-russia", "docs_id": 78829, "title": "2022: Is Ukraine at war with Russia?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What exactly needs to happen in order for these two countries to be at war?

This fee is not a consequence for any of my misbehavior, is not mentioned in my contract, and they are not allowing anyone to opt out of using the online system to avoid the fee. To me this seems unfair and possibly mildly illegal, since I did not consent to this in any way. **Is my landlord within their rights to do this?** \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a landlord and not a lawyer. For this reason, I have not done any legal research, however, given my experience, I will answer with a short:\n\n**No. Your landlord likely cannot do this.**\n\nHere is my reasoning behind this.\n\nEach state law is different or course. I am answering as a licensed and bonded landlord and property manager in Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n\nWhether you have signed a lease with the landlord or not, you are under a lease provided by the state as state law where no lease was provided. This is for your protection. You will have to read the lease carefully. You will find your lease has terms which includes your monthly rent and any fees governing late fees and any other fee typically covering pets, additional persons not on the lease, parking, etc. No lease can contain an open clause that allows the landlord to simply add fees at will. This would not be enforceable under contract law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, no additional burden can be added within the term of the lease and in many cases requires notice even for month to month leases. For example, if you have a 1 year lease, the terms of the lease cannot be changed until the lease term has expired 1 year after signing and even then may require 30 day notice under the law.\n\nIn other words, if it is not in the lease or in the law, the landlord cannot change the terms of the lease to create an additional burden. It is a contract and falls under contract law, landlord tenant law, and possibly other laws.\n\nWhile I understand the desire to have electronic payment, an additional fee is unnecessary and the requirement not likely legal. For example, not everyone is able to or can afford to make online payments. It requires a computer, computer skills, an Internet connection, etc. Even without these things, it could require making a payment using a computer at the library or at a payment center. Not everyone is able to travel at will such as the elderly or poor. Additionally, this likely requires a bank account. Many do not have bank accounts and make payments using a card such as one provided for social security or disability payments. Often, these folks have little options except to use cash, money orders, or cashiers check. Simply requiring an electronic payment, even if specified within the lease, can be a burden that is not enforceable or wise.\n\nAlso consider State and Federal Law. It may likely be illegal to refuse cash payments or payments via money orders or cashiers checks. While some businesses can require payments other than cash, many businesses cannot refuse cash payments. It has been a long while since I researched this, however, as an example, a retail business likely cannot refuse cash.\n\nAlso consider that electronic payments of one type may not be legal. For example, while it is wise to require a variety of electronic payment options, requiring only one payment method may require a burden that cannot be enforced. It is possible that some states require that if an electronic payment is to be required, then a variety of payment methods will be required. Some may require accepting payments from payment centers which can be a store or bank.\n\nOne last consideration. Some states define commercial rental businesses as being more than *X* units and have different laws that govern how they can operate. These are often significant. It is possible that if your landlord is a commercial rental business, they are required to take cash, checks, money orders, cashiers checks, etc., and require an office with standard office hours for such things.\n\nFurther research on this may be required and would be wise.\n\nAs a personal opinion, electronic payments are not always as easy to track or as convenient as your landlord thinks. I used to make and take electronic payments and have stopped simply because it is a pain. Each payment method has its rules and laws that are harder to keep track of. Personally, if a tenant wants to pay me in cash, my hand is out while I say \"Thank You.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Utah implements a new online payment system and charges all tenants a $20 fee, which is not mentioned in the original lease.

According to the information provided, the landlord likely cannot charge this fee as it constitutes a unilateral change to the lease terms. The documentation states that \"No lease can contain an open clause that allows the landlord to simply add fees at will. This would not be enforceable under contract law.\" Additionally, it mentions that \"Unless otherwise stated, no additional burden can be added within the term of the lease.\" Since the $20 fee was not mentioned in the original contract and represents an additional financial burden on the tenants, it would likely be considered an illegal modification of the existing lease terms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the equal application of the fee doesn't make it legal if it wasn't in the original lease. Option B is incorrect because even providing a free alternative doesn't allow the landlord to add new fees not specified in the lease.

Espionage consists of the access, generally on behalf of a state (or belligerent party), to information that is held by another and considered as confidential or strategic, in the military, security, or economic field. Identities of personnel is very much confidential and strategic information, so passing that information to the government seems to qualify as espionage. Whether or not this equates to being \"involved in hostilities\" is unclear.\n\nThe case could certainly be made that an informant, especially one who does not go out of their way to gather intelligence or receive compensation is a civilian.

It isn't 100% risk free, however.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nAll of the questions in this answer are governed entirely by federal law. Both basic copyright law, found in Title 17 of the United States Code, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (which amended Title 17 of the United States Code in part, and also added 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001 related to movie licensing) are federal statutes that do not have parallel state law counterparts.\n\nCopyright cases are in the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts when they arise in the United States. *See* 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (\"\\[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to ... copyrights .... Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in ... copyright cases.\").\n\n### This isn't a DMCA case\n\nThis strategy doesn't really utilize Section 230 of the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) (DMCA), however, which protects online hosts of sites from liability for user generated content, if the host honors DMCA takedown notices (subject to an exception for human trafficking content). DMCA takedown notices aren't strictly speaking applicable in this fact pattern.\n\nWhen Bob is the website's author, his content isn't user generated content from which he is protected from liability by Section 230\\. His Internet Service Provider is protected from liability for his content, but Bob isn't protected from liability for his content, because he isn't a third\\-party user of his own website.\n\n### The Basic Copyright Law Analysis\n\nOnce you understand that nuance that this isn't a DMCA question, the question collapses into a simple copyright infringement issue.\n\nThe bottom line in this copyright analysis is that if you take a snipper of material from a copyrighted source and link to the source copyrighted material, are you not likely to face copyright liability.\n\n**Links Are Basically Liability Risk Free**\n\nThe link itself, pretty much categorically, and without lots of additional relevant facts (basically some sort of conspiracy behind the scenes that can't be discerned from looking at the work itself), [will never give rise to copyright infringement liability](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/linking-copyrighted-materials).\n\n**Snippets Are Copyright Infringements That Fair Use Usually Excuses**\n\nSo, the remaining issue is whether a snippet of a copyrighted work flagged for educational purposes, creates risk of copyright infringement liability.\n\nThere is always some risk any time you publish a copy, no matter how small, of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nThe snippet is undeniably a publication of a copy of copyrighted work (by virtue of the premise of the question). This is a prima facie case of copyright infringement and your inclusion of a link to the source makes it fairly likely that your publication of this copy will be discovered by the copyright owner. So, this is a copyright infringement that gives rise to copyright liability unless this liability for copyright infringement can be overcome or excused by [the affirmative defense to copyright liability of fair use](https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use).\n\nThe risk that the snippet will not be considered fair use, and therefore will be found to be a copyright infringement giving rise to copyright liability is relatively higher if the snippet is a photograph or a sound recording than it is if it is merely quoted words from the source.\n\nBut, usually, a reasonably small snippet of a copyrighted work published for educational purposes will come within the fair use defense, even though that really needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\n### Practical Context And Analysis\n\nThe fact that this mode of expression, with a snipped and a link on a blog for educational purposes is pervasive on the Internet, as a practical matter, means that generally speaking, this will be considered fair use.\n\nUsually, this strategy will prevent someone who uses it from facing litigation for copyright infringement, even though, in theory, the determination is highly fact and context specific.\n\nIt isn't a guarantee of no liability, but it is low risk.\n\nMost marginal cases where someone arguably slightly exceeds fair use are resolved with a cease and desist letter (with which Bob should comply even if he thinks his use is fair use), rather than litigation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Bob runs a blog where he shares how-to tutorials.

See [*Housen v. Nikolaisen*, 2002 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1972/index.do):\n\n> On a pure question of law, the basic rule with respect to the review of a trial judge\u2019s findings is that an appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the trial judge with its own. Thus the standard of review on a question of law is that of correctness ...\n> \n> \n> There are at least two underlying reasons for employing a correctness standard to matters of law. First, the principle of universality requires appellate courts to ensure that the same legal rules are applied in similar situations. ...\n\nIt is not open to the lower court to come to a conclusion that is different from that which the appellate court declares to be the correct one on a question of law. Even if lower court's interpretation would be one \"open to a reasonable person,\" it will be overturned if it does not match that of the appellate court.\n\n### Questions of law are reviewed on a lower standard (*reasonableness*) in judicial reviews of administrative decisions\n\nThe alternative standard, *reasonableness*, is applicable in the judicial review many administrative tribunals and agencies, even on questions of law. That is unless the statutory scheme invites more strict review by courts or if it is a constitutional question or a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or relate to jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies, in which case, the administrative decision\\-maker's interpretation of law *will* still be reviewed on a *correctness* standard. See [*Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov*, 2019 SCC 65](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18078/index.do).\n\nBut even in this regime of judicial review, a decision will not be upheld simply because it was *open to a reasonable person* to come to the decision. The review looks like this:\n\n> A reviewing court must develop an understanding of the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process in order to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. To make this determination, the reviewing court asks **whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision**\n\nThis is significantly more robust that merely inquiring whether the outcome was open to a reasonable person.\n\n> a court conducting a reasonableness review properly considers both the outcome of the decision and the reasoning process that led to that outcome was recently reaffirmed in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, \\[2018] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 12\\.

The full faith and credit clause was never used to force a state to recognize a marriage it did not wish to recognize.\\[16] However, the existence of a common\\-law marriage in a sister state (still available in nine states and the District of Columbia) has been recognized in divorce or dissolution of marriage cases.\n\nThis seems to imply that DC was treated as if it was a state, but FF\\&C was not used to restrict Virginia and other states with similar laws.\n\nIn regard to the public policy limitations of the FF\\&C clause, the same article, quoting *Pacific Employers Insurance v.

Same question, 100% coverage, everybody now responds \"yes\". The public meaning has changed (right?).\n\nIn fact, there are now very few red squirrels: in the past 20 years, the meat of the red squirrel was found to be very tasty, or the fur very fashion, and so on. In particular, there are 2 red squirrels in all the USA, one male and one female, so we are still in time to save the species.\n\n1.

In fact, the *actual* [Endangered Species Act](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-4.html) does exactly that:\n\n> DEFINITIONS\n> \n> \n> SEC. 4\\. (a) GENERAL.\n> \n> \n> (1\\) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of ...\n\nSo, it's very clear for the purposes of this Act what an \"endangered species\" is. Red squirrels are an endangered species and you are going to jail if at the time you killed one the secretary of the Environment Department had determined they were and had promulgated that decision as required by the act.\n\nHowever, that just begs the question ...\n----------------------------------------\n\nLet's assume the Act did not define \"endangered species\". It doesn't have to. So what happens?\n\nWhen you go to trial, the judge will determine what \"endangered species\" means and whether red squirrels fit within the definition.\n\nIf you are not the first person tried under the act, then there will be a precedent that the judge will either be required to follow (if it's from a court higher in the hierarchy) or is likely to follow (if it's at the same level or lower in the hierarchy or in a parallel hierarchy).\n\nIf you are the first person, then they will probably start with a dictionary. Merriam Webster is a solid US based dictionary and it [says](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endangered%20species):\n\n> a species threatened with extinction\n\nThe lawyers for both sides will introduce evidence as to what that means and if it does or doesn't include red squirrels. The polls will be inadmissible because opinions aren't allowed as evidence unless they come from an expert. So your trial is likely to see a bunch of zoologists, ecologists, climatologists, etc. giving their opinion on what endangered species are and if red squirrels are one.\n\nIt is possible that on a case decided at a given time, red squirrels are no endangered under the accepted definition and that another time, they are endangered.

An originalist judge would likely start with contemporary dictionary definitions to understand the original public meaning of \"endangered species.\" They would then consider expert testimony and other evidence to determine if a particular species meets that definition at the time of the alleged offense. This approach allows for the possibility that a species' status could change over time based on population changes, while still adhering to the original meaning of the term as understood when the law was enacted. The judge would not rely solely on public opinion polls (A), consider the meaning entirely fixed (B), or automatically defer to current public understanding without evidence (D)."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33765/what-law-designated-the-u-s-marshals-as-non-military", "docs_id": 33765, "title": "What law designated the U.S. Marshals as non-military?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the code that says that the United States of America Marshals will not be seen as the military anymore?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Marshals (now the US Marshals Service) was \\-\\- as described in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service) \\-\\- created by the [Judiciary Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789) during the first term of the US Congress (and also during the first term of office of George Washington as President of the United States).

Some of the facts you are presenting are entirely wrong.\n\nPatents have inventors, copyrights have authors. Inventorship has strict rules.\n\nInventorship cannot be denied without consequence in almost any jurisdiction, but you'll need to get local legal advice. In the US, \"A patent is invalid unless it lists the first and true inventor or inventors of the claimed invention.\" (See Stark v. Advanced Magnetics, 119 F.3d 1551, 1553, 1556 (Fed.

It's very common to have you sign an agreement as a condition of your employment that you grant full assignment to your company for any patentable material created under their employ. If you did not, it is possible that the company would need to give you consideration for the right to assignment, e.g., they would have to pay you something to own the patent. If you are no longer there, that \"something\" can be substantial, because the patent is invalid without it, and they have little leverage over you.\n\nBring all written records, emails, etc. to a licensed attorney who specializes in patent litigation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee discovers that their name was omitted from several patents issued by their former employer, despite being a key contributor to the inventions.

I just wonder what would have happened had I said nothing.\n\nI just phoned my insurance company to arrange my car insurance for next year. We went through all the details and I was about to accept the offer when I mentioned that my brother was visiting from the US. At that point the salesperson informed me that the insurance would not cover my brother, as they must be resident in the UK. At no point prior to this had they mentioned such a requirement. I therefore declined their offer. I have done this many times before an it has not been an issue. However had I not mentioned this I would have accepted the offer.

I have two old car insurance contracts and neither mention such a residence requirement. I have found many more \"Certificate of Insurance\" with my brother as a named driver and they make no mention of the requirement. It is those that must be shown to the police on request to prove one has insurance. [I have found a policy document online that does not appear to mention such a requirement](https://assets.wearemarmalade.co.uk/shared/assets/files/privatecar/Classic-PolicyWording.pdf).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In any sane jurisdiction, the clause would hold.\n\nBy and large, the legal fiction is that one has read and agreed to execute the entirety of the contracts they signed. If it was otherwise, no contract of substantial length would ever be enforceable upon individuals; yet such contracts are routinely offered and enforced (look at the terms\\&conditions of any internet website that sells stuff).\n\nIt is absolutely normal that a phone sale would gloss other minor details of the contract, and implicitly refer to the written text for the finer points. If the specific point had been raised in the phone call, and the salesperson erroneously told you X when in fact the contract read Y, you might have a case, but even then it is not necessarily a strong one (you signed the contract *after* having called; you might have changed your mind when reading the actual text, and you paying the insurance monthly bill is evidence that you agreed with the contract as\\-formed).\n\nThere are some exceptions to that general principle:\n\n1. **General conditions of validity of a contract.** For instance, in [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), a contract must have a [\"definite and legitimate content\"](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032040911). If we sign a contract for \"a few apples against a few euros\", and then I give you five apples, you owe me zero euros because the contract was not specific enough to be enforceable. If the whole contract is unenforceable, the clause falls with it.\n2. **General conditions of a validity of a clause.** Specific clauses can be invalidated without bringing down the whole contract (for instance, \"in case X fails to perform their obligations under clause 70Z, Y is allowed to take a pound of flesh from X\").\n3. **Specific conditions on certain clauses.** Consumer laws in some jurisdictions make certain clauses of certain contracts either invalid entirely, or only valid if they were read aloud to the prospective buyer, or only valid in certain forms. (For instance, in France, a sale of real estate between individuals must be notarized.)\n\nI would be extremely surprised if the rule in the OP\u2019s example (residence condition to bring another driver on the insurance policy) would fail under any of those.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer arranges car insurance over the phone and pays for it.

In most jurisdictions, clauses in written contracts are generally considered valid and enforceable, even if not explicitly discussed during a verbal agreement. The legal principle assumes that individuals have read and agreed to the entire contract they've signed. While there are exceptions, such as for unconscionable terms or specific consumer protections, a residency requirement for additional drivers is likely to be considered a reasonable clause. The fact that it wasn't mentioned on the phone doesn't typically invalidate it, as written contracts are usually given precedence over verbal discussions. Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the importance of the phone conversation in relation to the written contract.

[Tulsi Gabbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) is a Hawaii Army National Guard major. She is also a serving member of the House of Representatives. \n\nOn the face of it, it seems to be a violation of the separation of powers for any person to retain an officer commission while also being a legislator. She may, after all, (at least in theory) have to take orders from the commander\\-in\\-chief, who is in a different branch of the government.\n\nI do not think that her situation is unique. I am sure there have been many other legislators who were either in reserve or on active duty.\n\nWas there a SCOTUS case which provided guidance on why this is allowed? Or does this arrangement rely on a good faith belief that (a) a President would not interfere with the legislature by issuing orders which may interfere with an enlisted legislator's Congressional duties or that (b) such a legislator would not use her position to influence the armed services?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, this issue doesn't come up for people on active duty. [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 973](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/973) forbids active\\-duty military officers from holding or exercising the functions of an elective federal office; [DoDD 1344\\.10](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/134410p.pdf) extends that to all active\\-duty personnel. Both the law and the directive also apply to reservists or retirees on long\\-term active duty (more than 270 days).\n\nSecond, for status reasons, this is much less likely to come up with enlisted personnel. The sort of people who serve in Congress are generally also the sort of people who'd be officers. Many of the relevant restrictions apply to people holding *office* in the executive branch, and enlisted personnel do not hold office (only commissioned and warrant officers do).\n\nThird, an interesting quirk that makes this even more significant: Retired military personnel do not technically leave the military. They're no longer in active service, but they are still military personnel, bound by the UCMJ, and subject to both voluntary and involuntary recall. In fact, people retired from active\\-duty components are bound by the UCMJ at all times, whereas non\\-retired reservists are only bound by it when called up. If this is an issue for reservists because they might be called up, it's also an issue for retirees.\n\n---\n\nNow that we've handled preliminaries, the central issue comes from the Incompatibility Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n> \\[N]o person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House \\[of Congress] during his continuance in office.\n\nThe question is whether reservists count as holding an \"office under the United States.\" If it does, you have to resign from the reserves before entering Congress. However, *Congress* decides whether or not someone is qualified to be a member, and Congress has generally refused to explicitly decide if reservists are allowed (implicitly meaning that yes, they are).\n\n[6 Cannon's Precedents \u00a7\u00a7 60\\-\\-62](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/pdf/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-11.pdf) covers the situation as of World War I: the House Judiciary Committee recommended that members of Congress who had accepted National Guard commissions be considered to have forfeit their seats in Congress, but the full House didn't act on the recommendation. After the war, the House decided to pay members who had been on military service the difference between their congressional pay and military pay. In the second debate, the House considered the difference between temporary and permanent office. It was pointed out that in past wars, members had served as officers in short\\-term volunteer units and then returned to their seats at the end of their service. It was also pointed out that an \"office\" is an inherently permanent thing: a temporary commission for the duration of a war might not necessarily be an office.\n\n[2 Deschler's Precedents \u00a7 14](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2-1-4-6.pdf) discusses how things played out in World War II and beyond. Here, the US involvement was much longer, and there was more consideration given to the problems with holding both offices. The *executive* branch was the one that complained; they decided that serving in Congress was more important than serving overseas, and that military personnel who were also in Congress would be told to pick one (either go back to Congress and serve there, or resign from Congress and be in the military). In 1965, the Defense Department issued an order (currently found in [DoDD 1200\\.7](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/120007p.pdf)) which provides for the involuntary transfer of people in key positions (including all members of Congress) from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve. Congress did not like that, and they (finally) struck back in the 2016 NDAA: they amended [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 10149](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/10149) to ban transfers to the Standby Reserve based on service in Congress. This certainly seems to promote the idea that Congress thinks reserve service is allowable, but when Barry Goldwater tried to get a resolution to that effect in 1963, Congress didn't act on it.\n\nSo in summary: Congress (which enforces the Incompatibility Clause) hasn't explicitly said simultaneous reserve service is allowable, but has essentially let it happen. The executive branch has tried to discourage it, but Congress has opposed that (personally, my guess is that members of Congress want the political benefit of saying \"I'm currently in the military,\" while the military would prefer not to have them).\n\n---\n\nI've discussed how Congress handles it, and Congress does have the final authority to judge the qualifications of its members. There was one Supreme Court case (cited in Deschler's Precedents) where a group tried to get the two positions ruled incompatible, but it was dismissed on standing grounds (the group could not establish that *they* were particularly harmed by the alleged violation). A lower court had held that the offices were incompatible, but that ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, there was another opinion issued in 2006 where the courts couldn't duck the question. Sen. Lindsey Graham was also an Air Force lawyer (he's since retired), and while a Senator he was tapped to be a military judge on the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. An airman was convicted at court martial and appealed to a panel that included Graham, then appealed again to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. There's no question that a criminal defendant has standing to challenge whether his judge can legally be a judge, and Congress does *not* have the final say over whether someone's qualified to be a military judge. In *US v. Lane*, the CAAF held that Graham's office in the Senate was incompatible with service as a military judge. However, the CAAF cannot tell Congress \"you can't be an active reservist and a sitting member of Congress.\" Even the Supreme Court is limited in its ability to interfere with Congress's decisions on the qualifications of its members: the Court did hold that Congress can't add qualifications, but this is a question of \"does this provision apply to this person,\" which Congress has final authority over.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. Senator who is also a reserve military officer is appointed as a military judge.

While there are concerns about incompatibility, it's not automatically void in all capacities.\n\nOption C is correct based on the U.S. v. Lane case, where the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that Senator Lindsey Graham's role as a Senator was incompatible with serving as a military judge. However, this ruling did not extend to prohibiting his service as both a Senator and a reserve officer.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The Supreme Court has not made a definitive ruling on the compatibility of congressional and reserve military service.

I often see the usage of 'Jedi' word in the life, but I am also not sure if it's ok to use it for commercial purposes?\n\nI mean without referring to any images/authors/any context, supposing everybody already knows what is it or will guess if not.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is probably a word that can be used, but not definitively.\n\nMany words of general applicability coined by authors enter into the general lexicon.\n\nThe process is similar, but not precisely identical, to the dilution of a trademarked term to become a generic descriptive term for anything in the category of items so trademarked. Early examples of originally trademarked words that entered the general lexicon are \"elevator\" and \"escalator\".\n\nFor example, the word \"grok\" coined by Robert Heinlein, is now part of the general lexicon, as is the word \"quark\" coined by James Joyce (although its current meaning has shifted). The word \"robot\" from K. \u010capek's play R.U.R. \u2018Rossum's Universal Robots\u2019 (1920\\), would be another example of a word coined in fiction that has entered general use.\n\nThe scene a faire doctrine also authorized public domain use of tropes and terms that have achieved wide use in a genre. As a rule of thumb, if three different authors have used a term to mean the same thing, or an author who is no longer in copyright has done so, it can be used freely.\n\nFor example, regardless of who originally used it, the term \"mecha\" would not be protected by the doctrine due to its used by multiple authors and commentators in a particular science fiction sub\\-genre.\n\n\"Mentat\" is a close case, because it is overwhelmingly used in a specific series of books written by Frank Herbert and his son with licensing from his estate, and because the series has produced so many published properties, not only in books, but in TV and movies, it has been close to maximally protected from an IP perspective by the Herbert Estate, his publishers, and his audio\\-visual licensees.\n\nThere is at least a colorable argument that use of the term in a fictional setting would be a derivative work, intended to evoke and be derived from the extended series of creative properties.\n\nThe best counterargument that the term has entered the general lexicon, or in any case is not a protected derivative work, would comes from use of the term in a non\\-fiction sense which is not negligible, even though it isn't terribly common.\n\n[Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat_(disambiguation)) two (probably unlicensed) commercial uses, one as a trademark and the other as an IT company name, in addition to two minor fictional uses, one with a similar meaning and one with a somewhat shifted meaning.\n\nFurther, to the extent that the non\\-fiction use was great enough to show that it entered the general lexicon, at that point, fictional use would no longer be a derivative work because the work could be derived from many sources in which the Herbert estate does not have copyrights.\n\nA Google N\\-gram search could be used to evaluate that argument empirically. The use of the word in the early 19th century (before Herbert was born) is particularly promising, although the senses in which it was used pre\\-Herbert would have to be evaluated, and the context in which it was used post\\-Dune would also have to be evaluated (if all the uses are in his licensed books, it hurts the cause).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)\n\nA quick scan suggests that in the early 19th century that it was often used as a Latin or French word used untranslated for foreign flavor in English language works, so there is an argument that it is really a loan word not specific to Herbert. Much of the modern use is in fair use commentary expressly referencing Herbert's works and in obvious misspellings of the word \"mental\".\n\nParticularly encouraging in the N\\-gram search are the uses of the word in independent science fiction novels including \"The Search for Snout\" (2014\\) by Bruce Coville, \"Dorsai!\" (2013\\) by Gordon R. Dickson, \"Eye of the Storm\" (2009\\) by John Ringo, and \"The Ghost Brigades\" (2007\\) by John Scalzi. Also, particularly notable is the use of the word in an independent non\\-Dune novel in \"Clockwork Lives\" (2015\\) by Kevin J. Anderson and Neil Peart, since Kevin J. Anderson was a co\\-author of some of the Dune novels and would have contractual obligations to the Herbert Estate as well as copyright obligations; signifying a concession of non\\-ownership of the term by the estate. This use in five independent fictional cases in the same genre in works published long enough ago for the statute of limitations for infringement to have lapsed (with late filed suits used to muddy the waters). This strongly advances the scene a faire doctrine validation of the word.\n\nThe term is also used in a scientific journal article in 2008 in the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, but in a related but not identical sense of the word.\n\nAnother litmus test regarding whether a word is part of the general lexicon is whether it appears in more complete dictionaries, such as the OED, or Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, or in a notable published thesaurus, None of the dictionaries and no thesaurus that I have in hard copy have that word, but this could be because mine are dated. An updated dictionary and thesaurus search would be probative evidence of this question. A thesaurus search for \"genius\" or \"prodigy\" that came up with \"mentat\" listed would be a good thing to look for.\n\nA third issue for general lexicon v. derivative work analysis would be whether the word can be derived by obvious use of affixes and suffixes and retroflex letters from words that are in dictionaries. For example, a word plus \\-ology (for the study of), or \\-itis (for medical conditions) would not generally be beyond the scope of legally permissible public domain use. This again is a close call in the case of \"mentat\".\n\nSingle words are also harder (but not impossible) to protect as derivative works, if not trademarked as well, than extended passages either verbatim or paraphrased or translated, which would weaken the derivative work claim, although it wouldn't be entirely without merit just because it was a single word.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of using the word \"Mentat\" in commercial materials?\n\nA) It is definitively protected by copyright and cannot be used without permission from the Herbert Estate.\n\nB) It is clearly in the public domain and can be freely used without any legal concerns.\n\nC) Its use is probably permissible, but there are some factors that make it a close case legally.\n\nD) It can only be used if it appears in a major dictionary like the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The use of \"Mentat\" is a complex legal issue. While it's not definitively protected by copyright, it's also not clearly in the public domain. The answer suggests it's \"probably a word that can be used, but not definitively.\" Several factors contribute to this conclusion:\n\n1. The word is heavily associated with Frank Herbert's Dune series, which could support a derivative work argument.\n2. There are some non-fiction and commercial uses of the term, which suggest it may have entered the general lexicon to some degree.\n3. The scene a faire doctrine might apply, as the word has been used by multiple authors in science fiction.\n4. Its appearance in dictionaries would be relevant, but not definitive.\n5.

I asked them what this is used for, and why it's required by the regulations (ie, what is the rationale and principle of the said regulation), and they couldn't tell me.\n\nI was hoping someone here could shed some light on this question instead. I am quite interested in the princple and rationale behind the requirement (and, why can advice not be dispensed simply on a hypothetical basis?), however, more significant is where it gets sent, what its collection's purpose is, and what it's used for.\n\nEdit: It would also be great if you could supply a citation of the specific regulation that imposes this requirement.\n\nNote: a bit new here, but don't really know necessarily what the most suitable tags to be used are, so if any others have suggestions for more applicable and relevant ones, please don't hesitate to suggest!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The purpose is to avoid the possibility that the solicitor will inadvertently end up providing advice to more than one side of the same dispute or transaction, putting the solicitor in a conflict of interest situation.\n\nIn the simplest case, the solicitor might already represent the landlord that the tenant is seeking to discuss legal rights vis\\-a\\-vis.\n\nEven if the advice is merely hypothetical, this is not O.K. A solicitor has a very high duty of loyalty to the solicitor's clients. Providing aid of any kind to someone adverse to the solicitor's clients that benefits that person, even if another solicitor would probably say the same thing, is a serious breach of that duty and is forbidden and sanctionable. It could get the solicitor kicked out of the profession in a worst case scenario. The duty of loyalty includes a duty to take reasonable care not to inadvertently or negligently act disloyally.\n\nThere is also a risk of a more subtle sort of conflict that has to be evaluated since many disputes and transactions are not just two sided.\n\nFor example, perhaps a solicitor a big commercial tenant client on the brink of a settlement with a particular landlord after lengthy and extensive negotiations (perhaps in a business lease renewal deal), and another prospective tenant client might, for example, have an interest in leasing the same property as your existing client at a higher rate. Representing both tenants/prospective tenants could creating a conflict between your two tenant clients. Screening clients based upon their landlord relationships helps solicitors to identify these conflicts and to prevent them from arising.\n\nMore generally, the best practice is for a solicitor to make sufficient inquiry prior to providing any legal advice to a prospective new client, to avoid having clients that have a conflict of interest with each other. This regulation (to the extent that it is really as specific as suggested) is simply a codification of this general rule in a specific, commonly recurring situation.\n\nIn large law firms, every single legal professional in the firm typically spends the first half hour or so of every day reviewing lists of new prospective clients and parties related to them in order to screen for potential conflicts of interest. (I used to have to do that when I worked in a large, international law firm for a while.) There would typically be one or more paralegals or administrators in the firm who do nothing but manage that conflicts of interest screening process.\n\nObviously, however, this requirement is a lot less burdensome if you are solo practicing solicitor who almost entirely represents individual human being and family tenants with isolated residential leases, and works in a large city where few clients have any connections to each other.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A solicitor is approached by a tenant seeking advice on a landlord-tenant issue.

This allows the solicitor to check if they already represent the landlord or have any other clients with conflicting interests in the same property or transaction. Even if the advice is hypothetical, providing aid to someone adverse to an existing client could breach the solicitor's duty of loyalty. This practice helps maintain ethical standards and prevents situations where a solicitor might inadvertently advise multiple sides of the same dispute."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30859/gdpr-user-invitation-functionality-within-learning-and-development-platform", "docs_id": 30859, "title": "GDPR - User invitation functionality within learning and development platform", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are similar answers to queries around this but I just wanted to introduce this scenario to get some advice.\n\nCompany A provides pharmaceutical products to Company B\nCompany B is a pharmacy\n\nCompany A has created a learning platform which Company B will use to track training modules.\n\nThere is invitation functionality on the site where a supervisor of company B can invite their employees to sign up the learning platform.\n\nSo the supervisor is entering their employee's name and email (could be company email or personal) but this is all personal data. \n\nSo based on previous answers to similar questions.

Company B wants its employees to know how to use those products.\n\nIn that case Company B has a legitimate interest to add its employees to the learning platform.

But I don't know if that is the case.\n\nAlso note that in many EU countries, consent would not even be possible because there is a imbalanced relationship between an employer and an employee, see for example the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/when-is-consent-appropriate/) or [this page](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/how-my-personal-data-protected/can-my-employer-require-me-give-my-consent-use-my-personal-data_en) from the European Commission:\n\n> The employer\\-employee situation is generally considered as an imbalanced relationship in which the employer wields more power than the employee.

Consent is not the only legal basis for processing personal data under GDPR, and in employer-employee relationships, consent is often not considered valid due to the power imbalance. However, the use of personal email addresses instead of company email addresses could be problematic, as this may not adhere to the principle of data minimization and may involve using personal data for a purpose it wasn't originally collected for.

Even though the service is marketed as \"free,\" there is still a contract between the company and the users, as users provide value in the form of their data and metadata. The company's liability is not automatically waived just because no money changes hands. However, the company's liability is governed by the Terms of Service that users agreed to when signing up for the service. If the TOS was properly presented and includes a disclaimer of liability, the company's responsibility would be limited to exercising due diligence as outlined in their TOS. The fact that the company is based in Pennsylvania is not directly relevant to their liability in this case. Option A is incorrect because \"free\" doesn't mean there's no contract or potential liability. Option B is too absolute, as the TOS can limit liability if properly constructed and presented.

The term \"solicitors\" is used in the plural form because it traditionally refers to the law firm as a whole, rather than just the individual lawyer handling the case. This practice stems from the historical structure of legal practices, where solicitors operated as sole traders or in partnerships, collectively referred to as a firm. Even when a single lawyer is managing a case, they are seen as representing the entire firm, hence the plural \"solicitors\" is used. This convention has persisted even as legal practices have evolved to include different business structures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not a grammatical error, but a deliberate convention. Option C is plausible but not the primary reason for the usage. Option D is incorrect because the term is still widely used and is not being phased out."}}
