There may also be others I want later on.\n\nNow, the question is, as these are remixes of original songs that are copyrighted, do I still have permissions to put the tracks in my app or would I still have to contact the original artist of the song first? If it makes a difference, this app will be free and not for profit. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are, under US law, two separate copyrights (at least) in any musical recording. The first is the copyright on the recording itself. The second is is the copyright on the musical composition that is being recorded. If that composition is an arrangement or modification of an original, there will be a separate copyright on the original, as well. \n\nThe copyright on the performance will be initially held by the musicians, but may have been signed over or sold to a recording company or someone else. If the performance was recorded before 1972, there will be no copyright under US Federal law, but there may be limited protection under state law.\n\nThe copyright on the composition, and on the arrangement if any, has terms basically the same as on a printed work. Works published before 1923 will be in the public domain. Later works may have a term of 95 years, or 70 years after the death of the author. See [the cornell chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) for details. Such copyrights are initially owned by the composer or composers, and possibly the writer of the lyrics, or in some cases the employer of the composer(s)/lyricist(s). They may well have been sold or transferred and be owned by some company.\n\nThe exact rules will differ under the laws of other countries, but the general structure is much the same, i understand.\n\nTo use a recording you must obtain permission (a license) for the recording itself, for the composition (unless it is out of copyright) and for any arrangement (unless the arrangement is out of copyright). [Performing rights societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights_organisation)  are how professional performers and venues usually secure such rights. They charge fees which depend on the use someone wants to make. They offer licenses to a variety of music for a single payment.\n\nA recording released under a creative commons license may or may not include a license for the underlying composition. Often it does not. Also, someone who uploads a recording to an online site such as YouTube stating that it has a creative commons license, may be lying, have no rights to the recording at all, and expose any reusers to the chance of lawsuit. If you want to use and reproduce such recordings, you must verify that you have proper licenses from all copyright holders.\n\nThe site [Jamendo](https://licensing.jamendo.com/en/static/termsofsales) says that it offers \"royalty free\" music for various purposes. It says that the recordings it offers have all needed rights included. It charges various fees depending on the kind of license purchased, with discounts for bulk purchases. It offers a guarantee against claims of infringement by 3rd parties, but the terms seem to make this guarantee quite limited. It appears that for use in an online/mobile app, one must purchase their 'large\" license or higher. Its terms do not seem to be compatible with creative commons licenses. I know nothing about this site, or its reputation, beyond what it says of itself.\n\nMost of its licenses seem to permit creation of derivative works with the licensed music part of an audiovisual or multimedia work, but not the unaltered distribution of the music by itself.\n\nI am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

However, the developer should verify that this license indeed includes rights for the underlying compositions. If it doesn't, they need to secure separate licenses for the original songs, unless those songs are in the public domain. This is because there are separate copyrights for the recording and the musical composition. Even though the app is free, copyright laws still apply. Simply purchasing the Jamendo license may not be sufficient if it doesn't cover the original composition rights.

If the plaintiff never files a lawsuit, the defendant is under no obligation to continue interacting with the plaintiff, and can simply wash their hands of the matter.

Jean Carroll has sued him for battery, but the government cannot prosecute Trump for the crime because enough time has passed that the criminal statute of limitations has expired.

(See CJEU case C\\-131/12\\)\n\nIn your particular case, there's nothing to do but to wait. Google regularly checks and updates the pages that it has crawled and indexed. This can easily take multiple weeks. But once Google sees that the page no longer contains the information in question, the information will no longer appear in search results. Any process you'd try to accelerate this will probably take longer than just waiting.\n\nOther sites may be keeping archives of the old version of the page, e.g. the Wayback Machine (<https://web.archive.org>) or <https://archive.is>. These will not typically be deleted automatically, and due to the way how these sites operate they might not be subject to GDPR.\n\n---\n\nDetails on the RTBF:\n\n* The GDPR enshrines a Right to Erasure / RTBF in Art 17\\.\n* This right only applies under certain circumstances, for example if the personal data was collected based on a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d and you successfully \u201cobjected\u201d to further processing. Such an objection would have to override the legitimate interests, and depends on your particular situation \u2013 why you want this data to be gone. Sometimes, there might be very good reason to keep the information, for example politicians should not be able to use this mechanism to censor reports of past misconduct.\n* More relevant in this context is Art 17(3\\): when the website on which the information was published fulfilled your request to erasure, then,\n\n> taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, \\[it] shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform \\[other] controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.\n\nThis is legalese for: if someone removed personal data from their public website, they're supposed to tell Google that the information is gone and should be deleted from Google's indexes.

If there is a single person, she could be able to convince it to settle for Z amount (Z \\< X), or to forgive she hasn't paid a dime in all those years. If there are multiple heirs, all of them would probably need to agree on that lower amount, not to mention that any of them could want to sue her for non\\-payment of the mortgage. If she was to make all the agreed payments, this shouldn't really be an issue for her, as your heirs wouldn't be entitled to receive an higher amount anyway.\n\nYou might want to please her by leaving that mortgage to a single person, but that complicates providing a balanced will, and getting payed this mortgage seems a can of worms on itself. A way to let your heirs off from this might be to set up a trust tasked to collect these payments, although that comes with its own costs (she will probably hate you for that as well, but at that point it's likely you won't care, and you are avoiding that trouble from your heirs).\n\n**I recommend you not to file that mortgage as satisfied when it's not.** I see no benefit for you (and not that much for her, unless she is planning not to pay it).

The documentation strongly advises against filing the mortgage as satisfied when it is not. Doing so would remove the mortgage holder's legal recourse if the homeowner stops making payments again. There are no significant benefits for the mortgage holder in this arrangement, and it could potentially result in a substantial financial loss. The homeowner's concern about selling the house after the mortgage holder's death is not a valid reason to satisfy the mortgage, as the process for selling a mortgaged property remains largely the same whether the original mortgage holder is alive or not.

S. Constitution that is, in practice, considered.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does this mean that all four of the above are \"equipotent\"?\n\nNo. The inclusion of these foundational documents in the *Front Matter* of the United States Code does not indicate anything regarding their legal status. It is more of a political statement, as a preamble to all laws in today's sovereign federal state, describing the foundation of the United States of America and its constitutional order.\n\nThe only constitutional law in force today in the U.S. is the *Constitution for the United States of America*, beginning with\n\n> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nand the subsequent amendments.\n\nThe ratification of the Constitution replaced any previous constitutional orders in effect between the States. A new government was [created by the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-7/ratification-clause) and replaced the old one under the Articles of the Confederation:\n\n> Both Governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The New Government did not commence until the old Government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution being ratified by the ninth State; for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new Government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a Government until it dissolved on the 1st of November, by the successive disappearance of its Members. It existed potentially until the 2d of March, the day proceeding that on which the Members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\n> \n> \n> *[Owings v. Speed](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18/420)*\n\nThe States abandoned their old agreement (the Articles of Confederation) and subjected themselves to the new Constitution.\n\nOf course, the other documents remain historically very significant and may shine lights on the interpretation of the present Constitution, for example, in *[Texas v. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._White)*, the reference made to the concept of \"perpetual union\" found in the Articles.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence is not so much a legal document per se but a declaration of the existence of the States sovereign from the British Crown; but such sovereignty is not a result from the declaration, but from the acts of war.\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787, while remaining in effect under the Constitution by Acts of (the new) Congress, is in any case spent as its territorial extent is extinguished by the establishment and admission of states, who enjoy equal status under the Constitution. See for example, [*Permoli v. Municipality No. 1 of the City of New Orleans*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/44/589/) and [*Strader v.

The main example is the\u00a0[redaction of Grand Jury Testimony](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-attorney-general-grand-jury-information/)\u00a0that cannot be unredacted under any circumstances (as I understand the article on the case cited). I did not see an exception for Grand Jury Testimony, or other forms of redaction, in the subpoena\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nGiven the situation above, can Barr be able to legally fully comply with the House Judiciary committee's subpoena?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best course of action for Barr would be to file an objection to the subpoena in the proper court (probably the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia) under or by analogy to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(d)](https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-vi-trials/rule-45-subpoena/) (which governs disputes over subpoenas in civil cases in the federal courts), if he thinks that there are matters he cannot lawfully divulge or thinks it is improper to divulge even if they are not privileged, and to let a judge decide.\n\nGenerally speaking, in a civil action, you can only object to a subpoena by following this process and Congress has increasingly used the civil lawsuit discovery process as a benchmark. Failure to file an objection with the proper court, or at least in a response to Congress by the date required in the subpoena to produce the materials, will generally constitute a waiver of the objections that might otherwise have been asserted to the subpoena. \n\nSimply not responding without explanation by the due date would be a pretty clear case of Contempt of Congress which is the basis for both a civil action and criminal contempt charges. \n\nFor example, in the *Lynch* case, cited below, the Court stated with respect to information that was withheld without any claim of privilege:\n\n> Failure to provide any grounds for withholding particular records does\n>  not comply with the order or enable the Court to resolve defendant\u2019s\n>  privilege claims as to those documents. Accordingly, defendant must\n>  produce the material withheld without any proffered justification.\n\nThis said, in any dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch there is always some uncertainty, and the courts strongly favor negotiation and conferral between the parties before bringing these matters to a head.\n\nA general discussion of Congressional subpoenas can be found [here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/congressional-subpoena-power-and-executive-privilege-coming-showdown-between-branches), recognizing, however, that while there are a variety of grounds for redaction asserted in the Mueller report case, \"Executive Privilege\" is not among them and so the special considerations that apply to an assertion of executive privilege do not apply. The authority of the judicial branch to resolve these issues has been upheld, for example, in the cases of *[United States v. Nixon](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep418/usrep418683/usrep418683.pdf)* (U.S. 1974\\) and *[Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Lynch](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012cv1332-117)* (D. D.C 2016\\) (both of which involved the more difficult scenario of an assertion of executive privilege in addition to the more ordinary assertions of privileges like the grand jury privilege).\n\nNot infrequently, the judge will review the unredacted material *in camera* (i.e. privately in chambers without showing it to the requesting party) to determine if the claim of privilege or other basis for redaction is really valid (e.g. maybe something that was redacted under the label grand jury testimony is not, in fact, grand jury testimony). But, there is case law to support the notion that Congress would have to demonstrate some specific reason why it doubts the accuracy of the assertions of the executive branch regarding redactions in this particular case to make it necessary for there to be an *in camera* review.

Is there anything we can do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Until the estate is settled and the interest in the house is definitively resolved, the estate has to pay property taxes. There is no requirement for the house to be insured, unless there is a mortgage and insurance is mandated by the lender. The duties of the personal representative generally include taking reasonable steps to protect the assets of the estate, which would include reasonable insurance coverage \\-\\- which the estate would pay for. Necessary maintenance would also be included in the things that are to covered by the estate, for example the cost of repairing a broken water pipe (which can cause serious loss, if not repaired). Freshening up the paint in preparation for selling the house, assuming that the house is to be sold and the assets divided, would also be covered by the estate. Utilities, on the other hand, are not within the realm of things that need to be done to protect the interests of the beneficiaries: that is a benefit to whoever lives there, making it their responsibility.\n\nThe question is foot\\-dragging is a separate issue, one that should be resolved with the aid of your lawyer.

While the most recent agreement is generally presumed to supersede previous ones, this is not automatic or absolute. The specific language of the contract, particularly any clauses that explicitly state it supersedes previous agreements, is crucial. Additionally, the parties' mutual understanding at the time of signing, as evidenced by details such as deposit amounts and timing, can indicate whether previous issues were considered resolved.

Should I however, provide an example text which the court can then insert into their injunction? Where can I find example text I can use? Can I just go to the court and ask to see all their injunctions and read through them?\n\nIn my case the ideal text will be something like \"The court orders the XYZ Corporation of 123 Main Street to make available to Joseph Plaintiff any all their financial records from 2015 through 2017 and to return a sworn statement to the court that this has been done by June 1, 2017\\.\" Is there standard text for such injunctions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There really is no standard form for orders imposing injunctions. They are, in general, arguably the most customized documents in the entire legal system, because they are a court order to do or not do something. They would generally, however, say to whom they are directed and might provide for how they should be served.\n\nAlso, it is hard to find examples in public records because injunctions are documents entered by trial courts whose orders are public records but are not indexed or easily accessible. Decisions of appellate courts reviewing injunctions are much more widely available, but they rarely quote the entire language of the injunction in full.\n\nYour best bets to find models in accessible sources with full text are the PACER system which has the full text of every federal trial court pleading and order at a minimal cost, and the SEC's EDGAR system in which publicly held companies must disclose documents such as court orders entered against them in litigation that are pertinent to the fair market value of the company.\n\nEither way, you really need to know in advance of searching the particular case with the particular parties in which some injunction you would like to use as a model was issued (e.g. from newspaper or trade press accounts), and then either search in PACER or EDGAR using that information.\n\nLaw libraries also often have treatises with forms in them, as practice guides, and sometimes there will be examples there.\n\nIn general, a court order will have a court caption, recite the information it considered (pleadings, hearings, etc.) to reach its decision, sometimes will restate the arguments of each party and the findings of fact and conclusions of law it reached in light of those arguments with the factual and legal basis for that decision, and then will set forth in as precise language as possible the terms of the order it chooses to impose. If there is a bond requirement, it will set a bond, direct its form (e.g. cash, personal recognizance, property) and explain the reasons for the bond required. Often it will set forth a deadline and expressly state who is bound by the order. It will close by saying something like \"Done the \\_\\_\\_ day of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, 2017\" and have a signature line for the judge with the judge's name and title appearing below that line).

While there is no standard form for injunctions, and courts ultimately craft their own orders, it is common and often helpful for lawyers to draft proposed injunction text. This gives the court a starting point that addresses the specific relief sought by the client. However, the court has full discretion to modify, rewrite, or completely disregard the proposed text when issuing its order. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while lawyers may draft proposed text, it's not typically a complete, finalized document for the court to simply sign.

If the house was bequeathed specifically to the beneficiaries then the executor must arrange for the legal transfer. However, if there is no will or the will just bequeaths assets without identifying them then the executor/administrator has discretion on whether to transfer the house or to sell it and distribute the proceeds. If this is shortly after the death and the sister was the administrator, she could decide to sell.\n\nThe house could be owned by a company. If so, the director(s) would be able to dispose of it. The director(s) are appointed by the shareholders and if the sister had more than 50% of the shares, well. This is not a particularly common way of owning residential property because it has tax disadvantages but it is a common ownership method for industrial or commercial property: many companies own the land where they do business. Perhaps the house is a small part of a large factory complex?\n\nThe property could be inside a trust with the brother and sister as beneficiaries but the sister as trustee. Trusts can be discretionary (i.e. the trustee decides who gets what) or unit trusts (like having shares in a company \\- you get it in proportion to your holding). The latter is the way publicly traded property trusts work.

Joint ownership typically requires agreement from all parties to sell, regardless of ownership percentages.\nD) Incorrect. Outright ownership in equal shares would require both siblings to agree on selling the property.\n\nThe correct answer is B because during the transitional period where the property is still part of the estate, the administrator (in this case, one of the siblings) has the authority to decide whether to transfer the house to the beneficiaries or sell it and distribute the proceeds, especially if there's no specific instruction in the will regarding the property."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42660/under-gdpr-are-service-operators-allowed-to-record-all-clicks-of-logged-in-user", "docs_id": 42660, "title": "Under GDPR, are service operators allowed to record all clicks of logged in users?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Under GDPR, service operators (e.g. people who run websites or web apps where users login in a browser) are not allowed to collect information about users unless either:\n\n* The user consents to having that piece of data collected while being able to maintain access to the service if the decline to consent\n* There is a direct business need to store that data\n* There is a legal need to store that data\n\nHowever, consider the following scenario: \n\n* There is a web app that requires users to log in to access\n* Users can not log in unless they agree to the terms and conditions\n* Once logged in all button clicks (and keystrokes on the site) by users are recorded (on the service operator's servers)\n* This recording behavior is described in the terms in conditions\n* The service operator needs to collect this data in order to identify how to improve their service in the future\n\nIs such a scenario allowed?

You are one of the three owners and the two others are resident abroad. You're assuming that jurisdiction is in the US and your defendandants are the two other partners, not the business entity. To me, it looks like this assumption is correct but I don't know the details of your case.\n\nIn this case, it will likely not be possible to use domestic process service; However, since international process service tends to be a dark art that is associated with a lot of red tape, you should first try to figure if you can use domestic service after all.\n\nOptions for domestic service include:\n\na) Service while travelling: If your defendants travel to the US, you can serve them personally as long as they are on US soil. Residency doesn't matter. You just need to get a US process server to ambush them whereever they are in the US.\n\nb) Service on service agent: If your defendants have arranged a US\\-based service agent who is allowed to be served on their behalf, you can serve the service agent. (I'm mentioning this for the sake of completeness, because international contracts sometimes include a clause that requires the parties to appoint a domestic service agent just in case there will be a lawsuit.)\n\nc) Service on subsidiary, Service on legal counsel: There have been cases where a US court decided that service on 1\\) a lawyer who used to represent the respondant in the past or 2\\) service on a subsidiary of the respondant is sufficient. I would be careful with these options because this looks like making up a service authorisation that doesn't exist.\n\nIf none of the above is available to you, you will have to serve process abroad. (Nota Bene: This doesn't mean that you have to exhaust your options for domestic service before intl service is allowed.) International process service is quite different from domestic service; In many cases, it involves some red tape, costs more than domestic service and it is much slower. In most cases, you are **not** allowed to hire a process server directly as this would (in most cases) be considered a violation of the Hague service convention, a violation of the destination country's national sovereignty and/or assumption of powers without authority.\n\n**The exact procedure varies for serving abroad varies heavily between countries; For further reading, I recommend this blog: <https://www.haguelawblog.com/>**\n\n**If you tell me in which country you need to have your documents served, I may also be able to tell you more about service in that country.**", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. company with three owners is facing a lawsuit from one owner against the other two, who are international residents.

Note I don't think it's debated that non\\-infringing derivatives gain their own copyright, including unauthorized derivatives that nevertheless fall into a copyright exception such as fair use.\n\nDr. Daniel Gervais points out in *[The Derivative Right, or Why Copyright Law Protects Foxes Better than Hedgehogs](https://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gervais.pdf)* section III.B that there's a bit of history here. The original Berne Convention 1886 text stated that \"Lawful translations shall be protected as original works.\" However, the word \"lawful\" was struck out in the 1908 Berlin Convention coming up with wording similar to today's Article 2(3\\). Gervais's article cites *\u00c9tude sur la Convention de Berlin de 1908 pour la Protection des \u0152uvres Litt\u00e9raires et artistiques* by Andr\u00e9 Petit implying disagreement between the countries about whether or not to protect unlawful derivatives, thus leaving it unsaid. Unfortunately, I'm unable to locate any copies of this source.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to a fortunate snippet Google Books displayed, I know that *[La conf\u00e9rence de Berlin (14 octobre\\-13 novembre 1908\\)](https://books.google.ca/books/about/La_conf%C3%A9rence_de_Berlin_14_octobre_13_n.html?id=3wNCAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)* by Georges\\-Fran\u00e7ois\\-Joseph Martin also discusses this exact point on page 187, quoting someone who thought unlawful derivatives would be protected now, though I couldn't get enough context to really determine anything. While I could find available copies of this book, for now it's a little on the expensive side for me.\n\nOverview of various jurisdictions\n=================================\n\nIn the **EU**, the derivative right is not harmonized and so the question is punted to the Member States. There is no implementation of either Berne Convention Article 2(3\\) or Article 12 in the *[Information Society (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML)*, Article 12 being specifically acknowledged by the Court of Justice in the *[Allposters](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=161609&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1)* case.\n\nIn the **UK**, infringing derivatives are probably protected, see *Redwood Music Ltd. v. Chappell \\& Co. Ltd.*, \\[1982] R.P.C. 109 (Q.B. Div.) at 120\\. I can't find the judgement text outside a paywall, but an [article by William J. Braithwaite](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1990&context=ohlj) (PDF) quotes the relevant part on page 209 (the square brackets are his):\n\n> \\[T]he idea that \\[the owner of the underlying copyright] should be entitled to reap the benefit of another's original work, by exploiting it, however extensive such work might be, however innocently it might have been made, offends against justice and common sense.\n\nAdditionally, the justice noted the argument that unlawful derivatives are not explicitly excluded from copyright protection and that parliament has declined to make this explicit.\n\nIf I understand the [English court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_England_and_Wales) correctly, this decision was two appeals away from the Supreme Court (House of Lords back then), but there doesn't appear to have been any appeal.

For example if Client A provided the company with a specific algorithm and asked for that algorithm to be implemented, the company could not use that algorithm (even if the code is different) for Client B. However if Client A came to the company and said \"we want software that does X, Y, Z\" and the company developed the algorithm to do that, it would be free to use that with Client B.\n\n> How the company A can handle the legal situation \\[...]\n\nTechnically speaking this is done in a number of ways depending on how the company wants to implement it. It may have a well\\-documented development process which documents where these methods come from and a source control system that can show that the code is independently written. Separation of data (for example, completely unrelated source repositories) and even having different individuals working on the projects. \n\nUsually though there is some kind of documentation exchanged between the contractor and the client at the beginning of the project that outlines very carefully where the intellectual property belongs (and clearly defining the scope of work and any intellectual property output). This may include such provisions as:\n\n* Assignment of any patents\n* Documentation and assignment of algorithms\n* Non\\-disclosure agreements\n* Release and removal of all documentation/source/notes/etc from the contractors system related to the developed system via signed affidavit\n* Documentation of trade secrets\n* Marking sensitive documents as such (Confidential/Internal use only, etc)\n\nAnother important step from the client side is an indemnification agreement, which basically would say that if Client A were to sue Client B for an IP violation arising from work produced by the contractor, that the contractor would be the one to pay for that particular violation (and court costs/lawyer fees, etc). This is a huge incentive for the contractor to clearly demonstrate that while the output is similar, it was developed independently.\n\nThe important thing here is to remember that Intellectual Property and Expertise are two different legal concepts.

A failure to do so means that no rent is due until such time as the landlord complies (but he can then request all outstanding rent retrospectively) (section 48(2\\)).\n\nYou can also request the landlord's address from the person you pay the rent to and they must provide that information in writing within 21 days or commit an offence pursuant to [section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/70/section/1).\n\nNote these are two slightly different things. The first is an address in England and Wales to which notices can be served, but doesn't necessarily need to be the landlord's address. The second is the landlord's actual address (which might not be in England and Wales). Usually these will be the same address.\n\nConsequences to the landlord\n----------------------------\n\nNot having a written agreement is generally worse for the landlord than for the tenant. This is because it is typically the landlord who would draft the tenancy agreement and a well drafted one will have lots of terms favouring the landlord and relatively few favouring the tenant.

What is the best course of action for the inspector to maintain the integrity of their investigation?\n\nA) Wait until returning to the office to make all necessary corrections to the notes\nB) Immediately destroy the incorrect notes and rewrite them with the correct information\nC) Make corrections on the original notes, clearly indicating the changes and reasons\nD) Create a separate addendum noting the corrections while preserving the original notes\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Creating a separate addendum to note corrections while preserving the original notes is the best practice for maintaining the integrity of an investigation. This approach allows the inspector to:\n\n1. Preserve the contemporaneous nature of the original notes, which is crucial for credibility in potential future legal proceedings.\n2. Clearly document any corrections or updates without altering the original document.\n3. Demonstrate transparency in the investigation process.\n4. Avoid potential accusations of tampering with evidence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because waiting to make corrections increases the risk of forgetting important details and diminishes the contemporaneous nature of the notes. \n\nOption B is incorrect and potentially illegal, as destroying original notes could be seen as tampering with evidence.\n\nOption C, while better than A or B, is not ideal because it alters the original document. This could raise questions about when and why changes were made, potentially compromising the integrity of the investigation.\n\nBy choosing option D, the inspector maintains the highest standard of professionalism and preserves the evidentiary value of their notes."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83618/is-it-ever-illegal-to-change-a-lock-so-as-to-exclude-your-landlord-access", "docs_id": 83618, "title": "Is it ever illegal to change a lock so as to exclude your landlord access?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Most leases say you can never do it without permission but permission wouldn't be unreasonably withheld but if you ever do it then you absolutely must give LL notification and issue of the new key.\n\nAre these terms valid or overridden by the common law covenant doctrine of exclusive possession?

While changing locks without permission may indeed breach the lease terms, it doesn't necessarily override the landlord's right to enter in genuine emergencies. The documentation suggests that landlords may even be required to gain access in emergencies like gas leaks, regardless of lock changes. However, for non-emergency situations, the tenant's action could be seen as a violation of the agreed terms.

For example, if a science fiction movie presents a race which has a particular habit or nuance which is not known to exist elsewhere, can an author make use of that habit or nuance to create a fictional race which also portrays that habit or nuance? This could apply to many art forms including, written stories and poetry among others.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright never protects ideas as such, whether in movies, novels or text books or any other kind of work. However, if an aspect of work, such as a character, place or fictional society are sufficiently distinctive, and if another work uses that aspect, with **detailed** similarity to the previous work, it might be found to be a derivative work of the original. A derivative work requires permission from the copyright holder of the original work.\n\nFor example, in Ursula K. LeGuin's famous SF novel *The Left Hand of Darkness* a fictional race or species, the Gethenians, is portrayed which is neither male nor female most of the time, but becomes sexually active and gendered a few days a month, and an individual may be male one month and female the next. This is an original and distinctive idea. Another author could create a different group of people with a similar nature without infringing copyright, but if the detailed description of how the process worked, or how it felt to the individuals involved was similar, that might make it a derivative work, and LeGuin's estate might be able to sue and win.\n\nThis is something that gets decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and such decisions are highly fact\\-based. But if the new work has a society or species which is clearly different from any previously invented one, even though it shares some aspect, and if there is no detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity, an infringement suit seems unlikely. Several SF authors have said \"Its not the idea, it's what you do with it that matters.\"\n\nFilmmakers, because of the money involved, tend to be more cautious than book authors. For example, Paramount bought rights to the \"flat cats\" from Robert A. Heinlein before filming the *Star Trek* episode \"The Trouble with the Tribbles\", although the similarity was quite probably not enough for a successful infringement suit (but no one will ever know for sure, since they bought permission). This is described in some detail in David Gerrold's book about the making of that episode. Gerrold wrote that his conscious model was the importation of rabbits into Australia, not RAH's flat cats, but there are some similarities, and DG had read *The Rolling Stone* (where the flat cats appear) years before.\n\nIn any specific case. consulting a lawyer with expertise in the area would be a good idea, as the details will matter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of copyright law and creative works, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of ideas from existing works?\n\nA) Ideas expressed in movies or books are protected by copyright and cannot be used by other creators without permission.\n\nB) Any use of a distinctive aspect from an existing work, such as a character trait or societal feature, automatically constitutes copyright infringement.\n\nC) Copyright does not protect ideas themselves, but the detailed expression of those ideas may be protected, and significant similarity could lead to claims of derivative work.\n\nD) Creators are free to use any ideas from existing works without concern, as long as they change the names of characters or places.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Copyright law does not protect ideas themselves, but rather the specific expression of those ideas. While creators can be inspired by concepts from existing works, if they reproduce distinctive aspects with detailed similarity, it could be considered a derivative work requiring permission. The key is to avoid point-by-point similarity while developing the idea in a unique way. Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the protection of ideas and distinctive aspects. Option D is incorrect because it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the potential for creating a derivative work even if names are changed."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5028/if-livestock-damages-my-car-on-a-public-road-is-the-owner-liable-uk", "docs_id": 5028, "title": "If livestock damages my car on a public road, is the owner liable?

My car is stationary on a public highway. Would it be the farmer?

If a cow damaged a car when a herd of cows was being moved, the driver *could probably* make the case that it is the farmers fault, as they are using and operting on the highway in much the same way as any other traffic: car, truck, horse drawn carraige, etc. And much the same way if the farmer was driving a car and collided by his own fault with the driver.\n\nIn the US West, \"Open Range\" laws can work in the opposite manner; in some cases, you hit a cow, you pay for it, and pay for the damage to your own vehicle.

In this scenario, the farmer is using the public road to move his livestock, which is legal but also puts him in a position of responsibility. The farmer is expected to control his animals, similar to how a driver would be responsible for controlling their vehicle. If a cow under the farmer's care causes damage to a stationary vehicle on a public road, the farmer would likely be held liable. This is analogous to how a driver would be responsible if their vehicle caused damage to another while using the road. The other options are less likely: the driver isn't at fault for legally using the road, the local council isn't directly responsible for the actions of individual animals, and it wouldn't be considered an \"act of God\" since the animals are under human control."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67663/can-european-union-countries-make-vaccination-against-covid-19-compulsory", "docs_id": 67663, "title": "Can European Union countries make vaccination against COVID-19 compulsory?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: * Malta bans unvaccinated travellers\n* France makes COVID\\-19 vaccine mandatory for health workers  \n\nMacron considers \"vaccination compulsory for the entire population\"\n\nThese are two countries from the European Union and Schengen Area, making vaccination compulsory.\n\nHowever, isn't this completely against of what's been approved by the Parliament?\n\n<https://pace.coe.int/en/files/29004/html>\n\n> 7\\.3\\.1 ensure that citizens are informed that the **vaccination is not mandatory** and that **no one is under political, social or other pressure to be vaccinated** if they do not wish to do so;\n> \n> \n> 7\\.3\\.2 ensure that **no one is discriminated against for not having been vaccinated**, due to possible health risks **or not wanting to be vaccinated**;\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1.

The policy should name a beneficiary, which could be Sarah alone, both siblings, or even another party. Without knowing these details, we can't determine John's claim to the payout.

There's an employee I work with that has stolen money and property multiple times, and that has created a hostile environment for the rest of us via the use of intimidation and threats of violence. However, our HR have their hands tied regarding any form of further discipline due to our country's laws, and his threat of a lawsuit if he is ever fired. Some employees have decided to see if they can not provoke, more trick, him into losing his cool (he has a history of a foul temperament) and attack a colleague physically, ergo providing HR a credible excuse to finally fire him, and protect themselves at the same time. The main part of the plan is not to involve the cops, as we have no intention of causing unnecessary hassle, we just want rid of him. Would such an action be illegal under law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, many jurisdictions have criminal offenses outlawing behavior that may include what you're describing here. \n\nIn Ohio, for instance, [disorderly conduct (R.C. 2917\\.11\\)](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2917.11v1) includes \"insulting, taunting, or challenging another, under circumstances in which that conduct is likely to provoke a violent response.\" \n\nIn Indiana, there's the offense of [provocation (IC 35\\-42\\-2\\-3\\)](https://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-35-criminal-law-and-procedure/in-code-sect-35-42-2-3.html), which is even broader and includes \"recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally \\[engaging] in conduct that is likely to provoke a reasonable person to commit battery.\" It looks like this has been interpreted to include even actions that don't directly involve the provoked person, such as [kissing another man's wife](http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/porter/it-s-the-law-don-t-provoke-anyone-to-fight/article_8fc16f6b-ae4b-577c-a823-7360df90fd59.html).\n\nBeyond the criminal offense, there are also jurisdictions that will permit a civil suit for damages resulting from the criminal act.

The plan to intentionally provoke a coworker into a violent response could be considered criminal behavior in many jurisdictions.

At this point, continuing to hold the person becomes kidnapping. The act of auctioning off a person would likely involve additional crimes beyond kidnapping, potentially including human trafficking.

The IDs could, for example, be ordered as follows:\n\n[![catalog of text with their respective IDs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPJhU.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPJhU.png)\n\nWhere individual texts in the catalog are separated by red bars, and the blue numbers are their respective IDs.\n\nThis website happens to be a harbor for internet piracy. One user, for instance, discovered the numerical ID referring to the entire text of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, and has distributed the ID to their friends so that they may read the novel at their leisure.\n\nIt's unclear to me where the copyright infringement occurs. Is it the website for \"storing\" every possible non\\-public domain text? Is it the user for finding and sharing a number that has apparent meaning to this website?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not clear to me that your website is, *per se*, illegal. (Though good luck finding a webhost with a hard drive large enough to store it. *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is roughly 38,000 characters. If I've done my calculations correctly, storing all of the strings of this length or shorter would require something like 1053760 GB of storage. Give or take.)\n\nThe main problem is in distributing the \"index\" of the string containing the text of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. This index is just the integer obtained by taking the entire text as a string and treating it as a number in base 26 (A \\= 1, B \\= 2, etc.) In other words, all of the information contained in the book is also contained in the index number, and in a relatively simple way.\n\nDistributing this number is therefore entirely equivalent to distributing the text; you don't need the website at all. It's entirely analogous to e\\-mailing the text to someone else; in that process, the text is transformed into a number (in binary, under a different encoding scheme) along the way. But you couldn't seriously argue in a court of law that you were not distributing the text, you were just telling a friend about a very large number.\n\nJust to back this up with some actual law citation: US copyright law gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to make and distribute copies of the work. And a \"copy\" is defined as follows:\n\n> \u201cCopies\u201d are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\n\nIn other words, J.K.

It doesn't actively distribute copyrighted material, but rather contains all possible sequences.\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete. While the user sharing the ID is infringing copyright, they are not solely responsible.\n\nOption C overstates the website owner's liability. The owner isn't actively distributing copyrighted material, so they may not be equally liable.\n\nOption D is correct because, as explained in the answer, the numerical ID contains all the information of the copyrighted work in a simple encoding.
