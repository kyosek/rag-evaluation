Suppose that the University wants to hire a new professor of mathematics but can't find any qualified LDS candidates for the position, and so gives the job to Alice, knowing full well that she is an atheist. Some time into Alice's contract, the university finds Bob, who has similar qualifications as Alice but is an LDS member.\n\nCould the university terminate Alice's contract on purely religious grounds in order to give her professorship to Bob? (That is, assume that there exist no other grounds on which the university could justify a dismissal\u2014i.e., Alice has been maintaining satisfactory job performance, has not been violating the school's honour code, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on whether Alice is a \"minister.\"\n\nThis case plays on the tension between employment\\-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, and the First Amendment, \u201cwhich protects a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.\u201d [*Hosanna\\-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church \\& Sch. v. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n*, 565 U.S. 171, 188 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-sch-v-equal-empt-opportunity-commn).\n\nWe resolve the question by asking whether Alice is a \"minister,\" i.e., whether the religion has entrusted her \u201cwith the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith\u201d [*Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey\\-Berru*, 140 S. Ct. 2049, 2069 (2020\\)](https://casetext.com/case/our-lady-of-guadalupe-school-v-morrissey-berru). If so, she falls within the First Amendment's \"ministerial exception\" to employment\\-discrimination laws.\n\nBut the precise definition of that term remains rather squishy, so we don't really have a test that can give us a reliable answer. In *Hosanna\\-Tabor*, for instance, a teacher at a religious school brought an ADA claim after the school fired her after she missed a semester on disability leave. The court rejected her claims based on the religious character of her work, and the Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that she was a minister based on the job title she received (Minister of Religion, Commissioned), her own use of the minister title, the religious character of many of her job responsibilities, her religious training, and other factors.\n\nAlthough she was a minister who was replaced by another minister, the Court suggested that the outcome might be the same if she were not a minister. Noting that the school in that case \u2013 just like in your hypothetical \u2013 hired lay teachers only when ministers were not available, it rejected the argument that an employee falls outside the ministerial exception simply because there are non\\-ministers with the same job functions:\n\n> Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions\u2014particularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.\u201d *Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 193\\.\n\nAnd a few years later, the Court indicated that perhaps none of those factors from *Hosanna\\-Tabor* are actually required. Instead, it directed courts to ask whether the school \u201centrusts a teacher with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith.\u201d *Our Lady of Guadalupe School* at 2069\\.\n\nSo in your hypothetical, the courts would probably look to see whether BYU treats its professorships as ministerial positions. Although the answer could vary from one religious school to the next, it seems quite likely that the courts would treat BYU professors as ministers, given their Personnel Conduct Policy:\n\n> It is a condition of employment that all personnel (including student employees) act in accordance with university policies and the Church Educational System Honor Code, including the Dress and Grooming Standards, and refrain from behavior or expression that seriously and adversely affects the university mission or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\\-day Saints. Examples include behavior or expression that\n> \n> \n> * Contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy;\n> * Deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or\n> * Violates the Church Educational System Honor Code.\n> \n> \n> All personnel are expected to be role models of a life that combines the quest for intellectual rigor with spiritual values and personal integrity, and to conduct their work in a professional manner consistent with the values espoused by the university and the Church. Members of the Church in nonstudent positions also accept as a condition of employment the standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges. The university regularly contacts ecclesiastical leaders concerning the temple eligibility of all nonstudent personnel who are members of the Church.\n\nI couldn't find any cases applying the ministerial exception to Brigham Young, but given its expectation that employees act as \"role models\" for the church's \"spiritual values\" and conduct their work in a manner consistent with \"values espoused by ... the church,\" I would be surprised to see a court get in the middle of the school's decisions to fire Alice and replace her with a member of the church, even if she had not run afoul of those policies herself.\n\n> The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way.\n\n*Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 196\\.\n\nStill, Alice could have other bases for suing the school. Based on your tags, I'm assuming you're most interested in employment\\-discrimination claims. While those might be barred by the First Amendment, *Hosanna\\-Tabor* explicitly held open the possibility that a contract claim might still be viable. *Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 196 (\u201cWe express no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers.\u201d).\n\nSo if the school signed a contract agreeing to employ Alice for three years, she would have a strong argument that it had waived its right to discriminate on the basis of religion for that period."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Brigham Young University (BYU), affiliated with the Church of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), hires Dr. Jane Smith, a non-LDS member, as a professor of biology. After two years of satisfactory performance, BYU discovers an LDS member with similar qualifications and wants to replace Dr. Smith.

The legality of terminating Dr. Smith's employment primarily depends on whether her position as a biology professor at BYU is considered \"ministerial\" under the First Amendment's ministerial exception. This exception allows religious institutions to make employment decisions for certain roles without being subject to anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court cases Hosanna-Tabor and Our Lady of Guadalupe School have established that the ministerial exception applies to employees who are entrusted with educating and forming students in the faith, even if they are not formally recognized as ministers. Given BYU's Personnel Conduct Policy, which expects employees to be role models of spiritual values and conduct work consistent with church values, a court might consider Dr. Smith's position as ministerial.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while BYU may have some leeway in making employment decisions based on religion, it's not automatically legal to terminate an employee solely based on non-LDS status without considering the ministerial exception.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because if the position is considered ministerial, BYU could potentially terminate Dr. Smith's employment on religious grounds without violating employment discrimination laws.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while violation of the honor code or poor job performance could be grounds for termination, they are not the only factors.

A sitting president cannot pardon state-level crimes, as presidential pardons only apply to \"Offenses against the United States\" (federal crimes). The president also lacks the authority to order his own release from state custody. In this scenario, President Smith would remain incarcerated in state prison, unable to fulfill his duties as president. As a result, the Vice President would likely assume the role of Acting President under the 25th Amendment until either Smith's release from prison or the end of the presidential term, whichever comes first. Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the president's authority in relation to state-level crimes and incarceration.

If I knew something like \"all European cars since 2004 use CAN for the internal communications between electronic parts\" that would help me a lot.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nObviously the CAN bus is somehow mandatory since 2008 in the US at least. However, I do not know to a what degree in detail \\- usually there are CAN bus pin\\-outs on the OBD\\-II connector. However, there may be multiple CAN buses present within a single vehicle \\- one for critical functions like ABS, ESP etc. and another for infotainment like radio etc. I wonder if any of these buses has to be connected to the OBD pin\\-out...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Good timing: I just got a new OBD II scanner yesterday.\n\nSince this might hit a wider audience, I'll take a foundation\\-first approach. Your vehicle is comprised of things like brakes, ABS, fuel injection, gear box. Nowadays, these parts are operated by electronic controllers.\n\nThe physical path by which the controllers receive and transmit electronic signals is called a bus. (It performs the same function as the internal bus in your computer, which connects the CPU, memory, etc.) CAN is simply a protocol for how information travels on the bus. So it does all the things you'd imagine a protocol does (boring things like dictating message formats be 64 bits and exciting things like determining priority).\n\nProtocols are defined by standards. Prior to widespread implementation of CAN, there were other standards (four, I believe) used by various manufacturers. CAN is widespread, but it's important to note that it's only standard on lighter vehicles.\n\n> **40 CFR 86\\.005\\-17(h)(3\\)**\n> \n> \n> Beginning with the 2008 model year and beyond, ISO 15765\\-4\\.3:2001 \u201cRoad Vehicles\\-Diagnostics on Controller Area Network (CAN)\u2014Part 4: Requirements for emission\\-related systems\u201d, (December 14, 2001\\) shall be the only acceptable protocol used for standardized on\\-board to off\\-board communications for vehicles below 8500 pounds.\n\nThe statute goes on to discuss other standards for heavier vehicles.\n\nWhat's unique about CAN? It's faster, but more importantly, it's a protocol that doesn't require a central computer. All the controllers get all the messages. It's kind of like having a bunch of people in a room yelling things out: everyone hears everything. And that's what you want in a car. However, the messages have to be interpreted by the controllers themselves, and that requires a separate \"higher\\-layer\" protocol.\n\nElectronic components *need* CAN to function, and if you have a car with electronic components, you *need* CAN in order to make it run. On the other hand, a vehicle can run without OBD\\-\\-it's just a nice secondary feature to help diagnose system performance (and problems). It obtains access to component information like speed, RPM, fuel trim, etc. Likewise, that pesky \"check engine\" light gets activated by a diagnostic code.\n\n**CAN is not mandatory for OBD.** OBD is designed to use a number of different standards, and CAN is one of those (remember, light vehicles makes beginning with 2008 use CAN, but OBD is in use in other types of vehicles, too). At it's heart, OBD II is just another protocol: it specifies message format and the connector's pinout. In the best teaching document I've seen on the CAN vs. OBD subject, [Michael Wen](http://www.oneminuteinfo.com/2014/02/can-bus-obd-ii-explained-for-dummies.html) mentions you can often deduce which signaling protocol is in use by looking at the pins in the connector (remember, CAN should be standard for light vehicles after 2008, but you might see one of the other four formats in older vehicles).\n\n**How do OBD and CAN work together?** OBD sends messages over the CAN bus (that is, the vehicle bus with the CAN protocol). OBD basically queries components by sending specially formatted messages via the CAN bus. The components respond via the CAN bus. That information goes either to a warning light on the dashboard or to a diagnostic scanner attached to the connector."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between CAN bus and OBD-II in vehicles?\n\nA) CAN bus has been mandatory for all OBD-II systems since 1996 in the United States.\n\nB) OBD-II requires CAN bus to function, as it's the only protocol that can communicate with vehicle components.\n\nC) Since 2008, CAN bus has been the required protocol for OBD-II communication in light vehicles (below 8500 pounds) sold in the United States.\n\nD) CAN bus and OBD-II are interchangeable terms, referring to the same vehicle diagnostic system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because CAN bus was not mandatory for all OBD-II systems since 1996.

What does this type of response typically indicate about the Court's view of the case?\n\nA) The Court was evenly divided on the merits of the case\nB) The justices unanimously agreed with Trump's arguments but couldn't intervene due to procedural reasons\nC) The Court found the issues raised weren't serious enough to merit their attention\nD) The Court wanted to avoid political controversy by not attaching names to the decision\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The brief, unsigned order with no noted dissents is a common way for the Supreme Court to handle cases that it doesn't consider to be serious enough to warrant full consideration. This type of response is routinely used for many of the thousands of petitions the Court receives annually but chooses not to hear. In this case, it suggests that none of the justices, regardless of their ideological leanings, found Trump's arguments compelling enough to merit further review or even a dissenting opinion. Option A is incorrect because a divided Court would likely result in noted dissents. Option B is implausible given the lack of any dissent or explanation.

This answer is focused on conceptual misunderstandings in the question itself.\n\n> Where does fault lie in the following situation; and what tickets if\n> any should be issued according to Illinois Motor Vehicle Code and why?\n> \n> \n> Again who is at fault or what %'s of fault should be applied and why?\n\n**Lawsuits v. Traffic Citations**\n\nIt is important to understand that whether tickets could be issued according to the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, and legal fault in a lawsuit arising from an accident involving a motor vehicle are two very different legal concepts.\n\nAlso, there isn't necessarily only one person at fault or only one person who has violated the Motor Vehicle Code.\n\n**Motor Vehicle Code Violations**\n\nViolations of the Motor Vehicle Code are analyzed one by one in a criminal or quasi\\-criminal traffic court proceeding where the issue is whether a fine or other punishment should be imposed for violating it. One person being cited does not mean that another person can't be cited as well. These proceedings would be brought by the \"People of the State of Illinois\" against each defendant by a government official at government expense.\n\nThe government also has no legal obligation to bring charges for every violation that could in theory be legally supported by the facts.\n\nThe outcome of the traffic court proceedings would be inadmissible evidence in a lawsuit arising out of the accident. Usually the police report will also be inadmissible evidence unless the police officer who wrote it is brought into court to testify in support of it, or the parties stipulate otherwise.\n\n**Civil Liability In A Lawsuit**\n\nIn a lawsuit, brought by the private lawyer for a person who has suffered damages from the accident (called a \"plaintiff\") must show that someone else was negligent, which means that they failed to act with reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent harm to others, that this caused their damages, and must prove their damages. Private lawyers for the defendants whom the Plaintiff seeks to assign fault to are usually paid for by the defendants' insurance companies and argue against their clients having liability.\n\nA jury hears all of the evidence and assigns a percentage of fault to each party including the plaintiff. If the person injured is found by a jury to be at least 50% at fault, then there is no recovery. If the person injured is found to be less than 50% at fault, then the other parties at fault have legal liability to the plaintiff based upon their percentage of fault. *See*\n735 ILCS 5/2\\-1116\\.\n\nNegligence in a lawsuit doesn't necessarily have to involve a violation of the Motor Vehicle Code. A jury can find, for example, that someone was driving too fast for the conditions despite not violating the speed limit, or stopped too abruptly, even if those aren't Motor Vehicle Code violations and can find a percentage of fault based upon that conduct.\n\nA violation of the Motor Vehicle Code does not automatically translate to fault either. Violations of the Motor Vehicle Code are a basis for a finding of fault, in what is called *negligence per se*, if the code section violated was intended to prevent the kind of accident that actually happened. Failure to use a turn signal, for example, will rarely constitute *negligence per se* in an accident where one car rear ends another car.\n\nThere are very simple cases where one can truly state with absolutely certainty that only one party is at fault for purposes of a negligence lawsuit.\n\nFor example, comparative fault is hard to argue in a case where a garbage truck hits and damages a building while the driver isn't paying attention and the building owner sues the garbage truck driver and his employer, although even then the issue of what damages should be awarded can be litigated. (Full disclosure: I litigated this case for a building owner until it had to be transferred to new counsel due to a merger of my law firm with another law firm that represented the other side in the case.)\n\nBut usually (at least in cases that go to trial) there is at least some colorable argument that more than one person involved failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances and if so, the jury must allocate fault percentages on a basis that it feels best allocates responsibility for the harm caused to a particular plaintiff by the accident as it sees fit in their good judgment using common sense. And, this allocation of percentage fault is almost impossible to overturn on appeal if there is any argument based upon any evidence introduced at trial that the people to whom fault were allocated indeed not totally without fault.\n\n**It is impossible to say, as a matter of law, what percentage of fault should be assigned to each at fault party when more than one party is potentially at fault.** This is question purely for the finder of fact (usually a jury, but the judge in a bench trial)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit arising from a motor vehicle accident in Illinois, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the determination of fault?\n\nA) The outcome of any traffic court proceedings for Motor Vehicle Code violations will be used as definitive evidence to determine fault percentages in the civil lawsuit.\n\nB) If one party is found to have violated the Motor Vehicle Code, they will automatically be assigned 100% fault in the civil lawsuit.\n\nC) The jury must allocate fault percentages based on their judgment of how each party's actions contributed to the accident, even if no Motor Vehicle Code violations occurred.\n\nD) The judge will assign specific fault percentages to each party based solely on which Motor Vehicle Code sections were violated.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In a civil lawsuit arising from a motor vehicle accident, the jury is responsible for allocating fault percentages based on their judgment of how each party's actions contributed to the accident. This allocation is based on the concept of negligence, which doesn't necessarily require a Motor Vehicle Code violation. The jury can find a party negligent even if they didn't violate any traffic laws, and conversely, a Motor Vehicle Code violation doesn't automatically translate to fault in a civil case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the outcomes of traffic court proceedings are generally inadmissible in civil lawsuits. Answer B is wrong because fault can be distributed among multiple parties, and a Motor Vehicle Code violation doesn't automatically result in 100% fault. Answer D is incorrect because it's the jury, not the judge, who determines fault percentages, and these are not based solely on Motor Vehicle Code violations."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4975/my-nickname-violate-the-google-names-policy-how-about-my-privacy", "docs_id": 4975, "title": "My nickname violate the Google+ Names Policy, how about my privacy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to use my [nickname](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/86257/22759) instead of full name when commenting on random posts within Google network.\n\nHowever when I wanted to enforce that (by changing my Full Name into nickname), I found out that:\n\n> The nickname that you've chosen appears to violate the [Google\\+ Names Policy](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1228271).\n\nI believe they meant this [policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/policy/content.html).\n\nHowever I am worried about my privacy and this was applied quite recently.\n\nBy which law I am enforced to share my personal details (such as my full name) on forum publicly to on\\-line people which I even don't know (when commenting on random posts)?\n\nIn other words, based on what law Google tries to enforces its restrictive policy, if any?\n\nCan I do anything in that situation (e.g. my privacy is protected by any law), so I can enforce on my privacy rights without removing my Google Plus account?

The maxim \"nulla poena sine lege\" (i.e. \"no punishment without a prior penal statute\") was historically applicable to *civil* law systems, such as are found in continental Europe. In common\\-law systems, there was never a tradition in which a crime wasn't a crime unless it violated a penal law, because crimes themselves were traditionally defined by court precedent instead of by statute.\n\nIn US federal court, the only allowable common\\-law offense is contempt of court. This is due to a court decision (*United States v. Hudson*), in which the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have the constitutional authority to hear a case in which someone is accused of committing a common\\-law crime. Even so, and even though there is a federal contempt statute, the Supreme Court has ruled that contempt is an inherent power of any court, and statutes around it only regulate the power (but the power would be there even without a statute).\n\nAt the state level, some states have explicitly passed laws saying something is not a crime if it doesn't violate the penal code (although this doesn't necessarily apply to contempt); see section 6 of the California Penal Code for an example. In other states, like Florida, common\\-law crimes still exist; Florida has a statute saying that any common\\-law offense is still a crime unless a statute has explicitly covered that same subject matter (section [775\\.01](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.01.html)), and specifies a generic penalty for anything which is an offense at common law and not addressed by any Florida penal statute (section [775\\.02](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.02.html)).

There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. In federal courts, common law crimes are generally not recognized, with the exception of contempt of court. This suggests a lean towards the principle, but not an absolute adherence.\n\n2. At the state level, there's significant variation:\n   - Some states, like California, have explicitly codified this principle in their penal codes.\n   - Other states, like Florida, still recognize common law crimes, which means actions can be illegal even if not explicitly forbidden by statute.\n\n3. The principle \"nulla poena sine lege\" (no punishment without law) was historically more associated with civil law systems, not common law systems like the U.S.\n\n4.

This presumption can be rebutted by evidence showing that the \u201cspoliator\u201d did not intend to affect the litigation by destroying the evidence ([McDougall v.

However, the leading text book in this area \u2013 Documentary Evidence by Charles Hollander QC\\- suggests in paragraph 10\\-06 of the 10th edition that \"there might be cases where it was appropriate to draw adverse inferences from a party's conduct before the commencement of proceedings.\" **In my judgment there would have to be some clear evidence of deliberate spoliation in anticipation of litigation before one could legitimately draw evidential \"adverse inferences\" in those circumstances.** There is no such evidential basis in this case.\n> \n> \n> 29 After the commencement of proceedings the situation is radically different. In Woods v. Martins Bank Ltd \\[1959] 1 Q.B. 55 at 60, Salmon J. said \"It cannot be too clearly understood that solicitors owe a duty to the court, as officers of the court to make sure, as far as possible, that no relevant documents have been omitted from their client's list\".\n> \n> \n> 30 In the case of documents not preserved after the commencement of proceedings then the defaulting party risk \"adverse inferences\" being drawn for such \"spoliation\": Infabricks Ltd v.

This legal principle applies when there is intentional destruction or alteration of relevant evidence in existing or pending litigation. In this scenario, the DPO deliberately omitted or damaged damaging footage, which could be considered spoliation if Bob files a lawsuit.\n\nA) Res judicata is incorrect as it refers to a matter that has been adjudicated by a competent court and may not be pursued further by the same parties.

The intentional omission or damaging of the CCTV footage by the DPO fits the definition of spoliation, especially if Bob files a lawsuit.\n\nC) Estoppel is incorrect. While it prevents someone from asserting something contrary to what is implied by their previous actions or statements, it doesn't directly apply to the destruction of evidence.\n\nD) Laches is incorrect.

In early years, it may be that your benefit is gaining an appreciating asset without paying your share of bills like council tax; but at some point you will have to charge your parents rent (nullifying some of the point of giving them additional money), or risk the taxman treating the transfer as void (which would presumably mean you had *increased* the amount in the estate, and the tax payable).\n\nDo let us know what you decide: this is an interesting question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John wants to help his elderly parents financially by gradually purchasing their home while allowing them to continue living there.

Law enforcement and prosecutors have broad discretion regarding which crimes they prosecute and for which charge. \n\nAbout 1% of people arrested for committing rape are female, and while some of those cases involve materially aiding and abetting a male perpetrator (e.g. by holding down a victim while the male perpetrator engaged in the act), some of those arrests involve the fact pattern that you describe. \n\nIn part, the low rate of female arrest for rape arises from the fact that women commit violent acts, in general, at a much lower rate than men. The low rate of female arrest for rape also almost surely involves underreporting of rapes committed by women against women, in part, because women are less likely to conceptualize what they have experienced as rape and, in part, because law enforcement is often insensitive or dismissive of these charges in many places."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the United States Department of Justice definition, which of the following scenarios would NOT be classified as rape?\n\nA) A woman forcibly penetrating another woman's vagina with an object without consent\nB) A man forcibly penetrating another man's anus with his penis without consent\nC) A woman forcing a man to perform oral sex on her without his consent\nD) A doctor performing a legitimate medical examination of a patient's genitals with consent\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe U.S. Department of Justice defines rape as \"Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\" \n\nOptions A, B, and C all involve non-consensual penetration and would be classified as rape under this definition, regardless of the gender of the perpetrator or victim. \n\nOption D, however, involves a legitimate medical examination with the patient's consent.

I'm seeing now that, while it used to be AGPL and CC0, it's now entirely AGPL, and by some mechanism which I do not fully understand this seems to apply to products and meshes created with it.\n\nThat is, if I produce a model while using this software, I am required to release the model, and any software dependent on the model (say, a game or a web app), under the same license. This feels extraordinarily aggressive.\n\nThis is very strange to me. It feels like a paintbrush manufacturer demanding royalties on all paintings done with their brush. Additionally, when AGPL was created, it was apparently to close a gap in GPLv3 which allowed companies to alter software on a server and open it to the public via a web interface; which was phrased loosely enough to potentially apply to all products created by the program.\n\nWhile I'm historically a big fan of GPL\\-created works and feel that they have done wonders for the whole of the software and multimedia community, this AGPL oddity is a total deal\\-breaker for the software\\-in\\-question. I'm no longer even entirely certain about my rights to my videos. What is the nature of this reach? Do I need to make my application AGPL simply because I used an AGPL\\-produced resource in it? And, perhaps most importantly, *has this ever been enforced in a court of law, or could it be in the United States?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: OK, seems I was right to begin with, but after building some work with this I had to be sure. The problem seems to step from a lot of not\\-lawyers overinterpreting the reach and applicability of copyright law, which, with a few asides, is the full extent of the AGPL. Additionally, the software is not based in an English\\-speaking country, which may have thrown the interpreted meaning of \"derivative product\", as opposed to simply \"product\".\n\nThe AGPL is indeed in almost all ways the same as the GPL version 3; in fact you can see this by `diff`ing the two documents. The only extension of the GPLv3 made for AGPL applies to software being run on a server. While it is indeed possible to include code in the final files, which might, in theory, constitute a significant portion of this program, that does not happen.\n\nThe AGPL is apparently also meant almost exclusively for software, though the wording does include the ambiguous phrase \"and other products\"; this concerned me as it felt as though it might apply to the resources created by the work.

In this case, a 3D mesh created using AGPL software is not considered a derivative work of the software itself. The AGPL's provisions mainly apply to modifications of the software and its distribution, especially when run on a server. The confusion often arises from misinterpretation of copyright law and the scope of the AGPL. Therefore, the video game developer is not obligated to release their game under the AGPL license simply because a mesh created with AGPL software was used in its development."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30739/do-the-gdpr-and-cookie-law-regulations-apply-to-localstorage", "docs_id": 30739, "title": "Do the GDPR and Cookie-Law regulations apply to localStorage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We use the localStorage API to store information about the login data to keep the user logged in through various sessions (we do not store personal information), furthermore the localStorage data is not accessible by third\\-parties.\n\nShould we show the banner asking for permission to use cookies (the legislation requires to use the name cookie also for similar technologies) anyway? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The official EU\\-legislation does not use the word \"cookies\", except in the recitals.

The other parties did what they were supposed to do, now you are legally required to pay up.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that your agreements included a clause to the effect that if they don't get the money from you within a particular short time\\-frame, the ticket is free. There can be a statutory limit on how long a civil claim (unpaid debt) is valid, but that is measured in years, not months.\n\nYou can certainly negotiate with the party seeking payment (I assume it is the travel agency). If the agency clearly, unambiguously and explicitly states that they will accept half payment to settle the debt, then if they try to sue you in court, you can produce that email plus proof of payment as evidence that there is no debt.

However, his voluntary and earnest efforts to prevent the completion of the act shall suffice if the act is not completed without his contribution or is committed independently of his earlier participation.\n\nIf you started the offense but stopped, so you don't fulfill offense, you don't get sanctioned, if you stopped **voluntarily** (*freiwillig*), \u00a7 13 III OWiG. (The details are more complicated.) This may be the case in your example, but beeing seen by a police officer is no reason for *Freiwilligkeit*.

The prosecution must establish that the defendant knew they had no legal right to the goods at the reduced price. \n\nOption A is incorrect because if the customer genuinely believed they had the right to purchase at the displayed price, it would not be considered dishonest appropriation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Act specifically states that a person's appropriation may be dishonest even if they are willing to pay for the property.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because the customer's exclamation provides clear evidence that they were aware of the machine's malfunction and were intentionally exploiting it. This demonstrates the kind of knowledge and intent that could be used to establish dishonesty.\n\nOption D is incorrect because simply completing the transaction without comment does not provide sufficient evidence of dishonesty.

This would make every soldier ever to serve in war a murderer according to civilian rules.\n\nSo, what is the cutoff for soldiers in an active war to commit murder?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with all international law, it depends on \"who says so\": I will draw on the [Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war) as most relevant. Article 3 distinguishes combatants from non\\-combatants, saying that\n\n> Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of\n> armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de\n> combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in\n> all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction\n> founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or\n> any other similar criteria.\n\nThey then specifically prohibit murder:\n\n> Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,\n> mutilation, cruel treatment and torture\n\nbut this only applies to non\\-combatants. There simply is no prohibition against killing combatants (unsurprisingly). Liberia acceded to that treaty, so for instance if one of their soldiers murdered a non\\-combatant, in principle they should try that soldier for the crime of murder under Liberian law. If some random dude (not a soldier) murders anybody in Liberia,\nin principle they should try him for the crime. Soldier may kill enemy soldier, even when the killed soldier is sleeping and poses no immediate threat to the soldier who kills him. That's the nature of war.\n\nIn the case of Massaquoi, he might have been prosecuted by Sierra Leone, but negotiated immunity in Sierra Leone in exchange for information on his RUF colleagues. There was no such tribunal or arrangement w.r.t. his involvement in Liberia, and Finland opted to conduct an extraterritorial trial based on war crimes (not the killing of combatants).

Killing enemy combatants, whether they are actively fighting or sleeping, is considered a part of warfare and is not prohibited. However, violence against non-combatants, including civilians and soldiers who have surrendered or are unable to fight (hors de combat), is strictly prohibited. Specifically, the convention states that \"Persons taking no active part in the hostilities... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely\" and explicitly prohibits \"Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" against such individuals. Therefore, a soldier could be charged with murder if they kill a civilian who is not taking part in hostilities (option C) or an enemy soldier who has surrendered (option D), but D is not the most comprehensive answer.

Often the lowest level of laws and ordinances are only in a city database, and sometimes not on the internet.\n\nAs a result, there is already an impossibility to get all the laws in the US in one database \\- and there are even countries that have not taken any steps to make their laws accessible on the internet at all.

Often, such changes are not announced too loudly for the lowest levels, and with the number of cities in a single federal state, it's near impossible to keep the database up to date on a complete level. This is why different databases usually only scrape the federal levels.\n2. Scraping will break *quickly*. Each of the websites I pointed to in Germany has a different system setup, making scraping these websites for the relevant information basically useless. Compounding that, City ordinance pages are redesigned at a somewhat elevated pace, resulting in the scraping of these pages to break quickly, even if you manage to set it up.\n3. Citability. In a court of law, only the official text is relevant. If an update is missed, then the whole text is useless \\- you'll have to look up the actual, currently in\\-force version of the law or ordinance, so the conglomerate is not helping.\n4. You want a ginormous database. In some countries, judgments also make law as precedent. So you want **every** judgment in your database. Which quickly runs into a different problem: [The US alone generates **millions** per day.](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56593/10334)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the challenges of creating a comprehensive global database of all laws and legal documents?\n\nA) It's impossible due to the sheer volume of data, with the US alone generating millions of legal judgments per day.\n\nB) The main obstacle is that some countries, like North Korea, do not make their laws accessible on the internet.\n\nC) The primary difficulty lies in the fact that laws are written in different languages across various countries.\n\nD) The challenge is primarily technical, as websites hosting legal documents are frequently redesigned, breaking scraping attempts.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nWhile options B, C, and D all present valid challenges to creating a comprehensive global legal database, they are not the most significant obstacles. Option A captures the core issue most accurately.\n\nThe sheer volume of legal data is overwhelming, with the US alone generating millions of judgments daily. This volume makes it practically impossible to collect, store, and maintain an up-to-date database. \n\nAdditionally, the problem is compounded by several factors mentioned in the text:\n1. The multi-tiered nature of legal systems (federal, state, local) in many countries.\n2. Frequent updates to laws and regulations at various levels.\n3. The need for absolute accuracy and currency in legal documents.\n4. The inclusion of case law and precedents in some legal systems.\n5. The diverse platforms and formats used to publish legal information across different jurisdictions.\n\nWhile language differences (C) and technical challenges with web scraping (D) are real issues, they are secondary to the fundamental problem of data volume and complexity. The inaccessibility of some countries' laws (B) is a concern, but not the primary obstacle to a global database."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30045/can-a-psychotherapist-offer-lower-rates-to-african-american-clients-as-reparatio", "docs_id": 30045, "title": "Can a psychotherapist offer lower rates to African-American clients as reparations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a friend who has started offering lower rates to African\\-Americans, as her contribution to reparations.

While federal civil rights laws may not explicitly cover this situation, many states have broader anti-discrimination laws. For example, California's Unruh Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in \"all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,\" which would likely include a private psychotherapy practice. However, other states may have narrower definitions or exclusions for professional services. Additionally, even if legal, such practices may violate professional ethics codes.

Yet, the Google platform is a commercial product and is there to make money by displaying ads. Even non\\-profit websites like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) or [CC search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) which ask for donations (i.e. money making albeit not for profit), thereby using images in a ['commercial' (money making) context](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxKFa.png).\n\nIn the UK, commercial use of images *may* require a licence (a written permission). The licence must be obtained from **the author** (the photographer) **and** sometimes **the landowner** (I believe this is a branch of what is collectively known as 'third\\-party' rights, property rights in this instance, assuming the author didn't obtain such permissions).\n\nOne example could be the UK's famous [Durdle Door](https://www.google.com/search?q=Durdle+Door) which requires a [licence](https://lulworth.com/the-estate/services/film-photography-locations/location-enquiry/), if photographs are to be used for commercial purposes. It appears to be a very similar story for sites belonging to [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrustimages.org.uk/photographic-access) and [English Heritage](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-people/terms-and-conditions/). Yet, there is no shortage of images used in a commercial context without obtaining such licences (apparently) e.g. [CC Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/search?q=durdle%20door&license_type=commercial), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/durdle%20door/), [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g1420384-d546417-Reviews-Lulworth_Cove_and_Durdle_Door-West_Lulworth_Dorset_England.html), Google and many others.\n\nI appreciate this is a branch of the civil law and requires a 3rd party to actually raise it as an issue. I highly doubt any of the websites showing images in a commercial context request a permission from landowners around the UK \\- an unmanageable task. Yet, it feels like Google (or other websites) would not risk a lawsuit to show images unless they had solid basis they are allowed to do so.\n\n**Question**: given that photos of many landmarks in the UK require a written permission (i.e. a licence) to be used for a commercial use, how exactly do websites (e.g. Google, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia and others) operate without infringing on 3rd party copyrights?\n\n---\n\nClarification: I am less concerned with the author's copyright claims (like those in [Perfect 10, Inc. vs Amazon.com, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_10,_Inc._v._Amazon.com,_Inc.)) and more with the 3rd party claims. The [UK's government website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-access-land-management-rights-and-responsibilities) is pretty clear on that (emphasis mine):\n\n> What people cannot do on your land\n> The CROW Act has a list of general restrictions that limit what people using their open access rights may do, unless you give them permission to do something on the list, or the right to do something already exists.\n> \n> \n> They cannot:\n> \n> \n> \\[..]\n> \n> \n> run commercial activities on the land such as:\n> \n> \n> * trade or sell\n> * charge other visitors for things they do on your land\n> * film, **photograph** or make maps\n> \n> \n> \\[..]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends.\n\nWikipedia is quite strict on its policies, and it only allows uploading images (and other media) that either are in the public domain or with a licence that allows to be reproduced (often, Creative Commons, CC).\n\nIf you go to the [details of the image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Durdle_Door_Overview.jpg) it claims that the picture is licenced under CC, with attribution to Saffron Blaze. So most probably Saffron Blaze got permision to take the picture, and he distributed it with the CC\\-Attribution licence.\n\nWhen scrapping a web site for data, Google and other engines usually search for metadata (the *robots.txt* file) that tells them what to index and what to not. If a user gives them permission to index a picture by not stating restrictions in the robots.txt, they can do index it.\n\nOf course, in both cases it might be that someone uploads a picture that he does not have permission to share. In this case the situation will, of course, depend on jurisdiction, but many laws have provisions that ensure that, if the content provider is dilligent in addressing copyright issues caused by the users, they are protected.\n\nFor example in the USA the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) establishes \"safe harbor\" provisions that protects content providers if they give a way to denounce copyright infringiments and address those in a given timeframe."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A popular travel website displays user-submitted photographs of Durdle Door, a famous landmark in the UK, without obtaining explicit permission from the landowner.

While UK law does require permission from landowners for commercial use of photographs taken on their property, websites that host user-generated content often benefit from \"safe harbor\" provisions. These provisions, similar to the DMCA in the US, protect content providers if they have a system in place to address copyright infringements when notified and act promptly to remove infringing content. \n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate legal consequences are unlikely if the website has proper procedures in place. Option C is wrong because it ignores the landowner's rights, which are relevant in the UK.

(This mechanical part is not a software protection dongle, it is really necessary for those extra features to work).\n\nAccording to the specific state of the market, the \"premium\" Bar can be sold at a significantly higher price than Foo, despite the production cost difference being very small. Foo is, however, planned to also be produced in large numbers for a market segment which is unable or unwilling to pay for Bar, but it has a very small profit margin. Bar, on the other hand, is planned to be sold at a very high profit margin.\n\nThe problem is, that Foo can be converted into Bar by adding a relatively simple mechanical part. Some users might do it for themselves, on their own risk of course, but this in itself is not a problem as it requires some fine mechanics skill (making the part, not adding the part. Adding the part is easy) and most users are expected to buy Bar instead, or buy an official conversion kit (sold at a very high profit margin)\n\nHowever, what prevents another company from producing such a conversion kit?

They publish a standard, [NFPA 1710](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=1710), which outlines emergency response time goals. Unfortunately, the only places I can find the actual standard requires membership in the NFPA to view it.\n\nI have, however, been able to find summaries. In [this summary](https://services.prod.iaff.org/ContentFile/Get/30541) you can see Emergency Medical Services (EMTs, Paramedics) are expected to leave the station within one minute of a call being dispatched. Note that being dispatched isn't the time from when one initially calls emergency services; it is the time from when emergency services is able to determine what is needed and issue the dispatch request. [This article describes](https://www.lexipol.com/resources/blog/understanding-and-measuring-fire-department-response-times/) how fire and rescue organizations differ in how they measure responsiveness including identifying how some organizations start measuring response time at the point a call is first received.\n\nFirst arrival on scene for EMS is targeted at four minutes after \"turnout,\" when EMS is dispatched. EMS treatment levels include:\n\n* First responder (includes provisioning of an Automatic External\nDefibrillator (AED))\n* Basic Life Support (BLS)\n* Advanced Life Support (ALS)\n\nNote that this standard is based on how quickly life sustaining measures can be delivered to the person or people who need them. Transportation times to hospitals will depend on the specific transportation protocols that will be implemented once EMS has assessed the situation.\n\nThe State of Maryland, as an example, manages protocols through the [Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems](http://miemss.org/home/) (MIEMSS). Their [current protocol is available](http://www.miemss.org/home/Portals/0/Docs/Guidelines_Protocols/MD-Medical-Protocols-2018-WEB.pdf?ver=2018-04-11-134820-493) for reading. On page 17, one of the steps EMS has to determine is the \"mode of transportation.\"\n\nMaryland's protocols highlight that transportation isn't to the closest hospital but, rather, to the closest ***appropriate*** hospital. The closest appropriate hospital is determined by EMS in consultation with their support system. The protocols and infrastructure that Maryland has put in place are designed to get the patient stabilized and to the most appropriate treatment facility based on the patient's need.\n\nThe NFPA is a recommended code and it is up to each state or local governing body to determine if and how they will implement them.\n\nFor the State of Maryland, the MIEMSS is an independent state agency appointed by the Governor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1710 standard, what is the target time for first arrival on scene for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) after dispatch?\n\nA) 1 minute\nB) 2 minutes\nC) 4 minutes\nD) 6 minutes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The NFPA 1710 standard sets a target time of 4 minutes for EMS first arrival on scene after \"turnout\" (when EMS is dispatched).

Which of the following actions is the most appropriate and legally compliant?\n\nA) Take the flash drive home, examine its contents to find the owner, and keep it if you can't identify them within a week.\n\nB) Hand the flash drive to a library employee, provide your contact information, and request to claim it if the owner isn't found after the legal abandonment period.\n\nC) Claim immediate possession of the flash drive as abandoned property and use it for your own purposes.\n\nD) Look through the flash drive's contents at the library computer, then decide whether to return it based on what you find.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate and legally compliant action. According to the information provided, when you find lost property, you must try to locate the true owner and take care of it until it can be returned. Handing it to a library employee is the best first step, as they may have procedures in place for lost items. Providing your contact information allows you to potentially claim the item if it remains unclaimed after the legal abandonment period (which varies by jurisdiction but is often around 5 years for personal property). This approach respects the owner's rights, follows legal procedures, and still allows for the possibility of claiming the item if it truly becomes abandoned property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not legal to examine the contents yourself, and a week is far too short for the legal abandonment period. Option C is wrong because you can't immediately claim possession - you must first attempt to return it to the owner.

She didn't wake up because of her medication which makes her sleep pretty heavily.

So in VA, you can do many things to someone who is asleep provided that if they wake up and tell you to stop, you stop.\" (quote from friend paraphrasing investigator).\n\nI find it extremely hard to believe that you can sexually assault a person so long as they remain unconscious don't resist you. Is this really how the law in Virginia works? What are the limits of what you are legally permitted to do to an unconscious person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nNo. This is not legal under Virginia law. It is a serious crime.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### The basic reasoning\n\nThis would be actionable as aggravated sexual battery and punishable by up to 20 years in prison, because the facts demonstrate a touching of intimate parts with an intent to molest (i.e. sexual abuse) and this is accomplished through the victim's physical helplessness, which includes being unconscious at the time for any reason.\n\n### Intent to Molest, Gratify or Arouse\n\nContrary to user6726, I don't think that groping in the factual context of the question can be reasonably interpreted as lacking an intent to molest under the statute. An interpretation that requires an effect on the victim would be contrary to the fact that the statute is talking about the intent of the perpetrator and to the fact that the statute expressly authorizes prosecutions in cases where the victim is physically helpless a definition that includes unconscious or drugged. One could probably get the court to provide an extra non\\-standard jury instruction if this was raised by the defense at trial as an issue.\n\nThe intent to molest, gratify or arouse intent requirement is designed to distinguish between, for example, giving a sponge bath to an unconscious patient at a medical facility or by a family member, or touching someone's breasts in order to get a bra size for a tailor, and \"groping.\" The intent requirement also excludes unintentional conduct such as slipping and falling into someone by accident. The admission by the perpetrator in the question doesn't suggest any possible non\\-sexual reason for the contact, and is inconsistent with unintentional conduct.\n\n### Corroboration From Actual Recent Prosecutions\n\nThis reading is consistent with the fact that Virginia prosecutors have brought charges in similar circumstances such as [the rape of an unconscious woman at a house party](http://www.eveningsun.com/story/news/2017/03/22/two-men-charged-rape-unconscious-woman-house-party/99453734/?cookies=&from=global) and [charges against a Virginia DJ for his conduct towards unconscious women](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-Accused-of-Assaulting-Unconscious-Women-215867991.html). The only material difference between rape and aggravated sexual battery under Virginia law is that rape requires penetration, while sexual battery merely requires sexual contact.\n\n### Additional Commentary\n\nReaching this conclusion is a bit tricky, because usually aggravated sexual battery would have a narrower definition of the crime than \"plain vanilla\" sexual battery.\n\nBut, in Virginia, there is conduct that constitutes aggravated sexual battery which does not constitute \"plain vanilla\" sexual battery, including molestation by accomplished through physical helplessness which is defined broadly in the relevant statute.\n\nIn other words, in this fact pattern, \"sexual battery\" is not a lesser included offense of \"aggravated sexual battery\" under subsection A(2\\) of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3 of Virginia's statutes. Plain vanilla sexual battery includes the circumstances of subsection A(4\\) of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3 of Virginia's statutes and some special \"statutory rape\"/\"position of trust\" type conduct that is outside of the scope of both A(4\\) type conduct and aggravated sexual battery generally.\n\nI would attribute the statements of the investigator as symptom of poor training about sexual assault cases and a generally regressive state of law enforcement attitudes about sexual assault in Virginia. Your friend should insist on talking to the investigator's supervisor and reviewing the relevant legal citations, with a lawyer, if necessary, if she wants to press charges.\n\nOf course, the prosecutor has no obligation to prosecute the case even if the prosecutor had a videotaped confession to every element of the crime. But, there is no reason for a prosecution to be prevented due to a non\\-lawyer investigator's misunderstanding of the law. A letter of complaint to the investigator's supervisor or the head of the department or the politician to whom the department reports would also be in order.\n\nThe Statutes\n============\n\nThe statute creating the crime is as follows, with all of the pertinent language in bold. I have put the word \"or\" when necessary to see how the statute fits together (which could be omitted in a block quotation showing omissions with \". . .\") in italics and have left the remainder of the relevant statutes in plain text to allow a reader to confirm that the reading I am giving to the statute is correct.\n\n> \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3\\.

If the intent of the authority was that you were allowed to drive at 45 mph, you would have a speed limit of 45 mph, not a speed limit of 40 mph. If you go at 41 mph, you are breaking a law and can be punished.\n\nThat said, law enforcement officers usually have some leeway on how to enforce the law, and they could very well let it pass with just a warning (or even ignore it if they have more pressing issues); the circunstances of it are specific to every situation and officer.\n\nThe only point that could be made would be if the difference was so small that it could be argued that it can invalidate the evidence on the basis of margin of errors. If the radar catches you driving at 41 mph but the error margin of the radar is 5%, you could argue that you were driving at 39 mph and that the reading is due to the error in the radar1.\n\nThat would enable you to challenge the evidence (but here the point is not that you are allowed to drive at 41 mph but that there is no proof that you were driving at 41 mph). From what I know, most police forces will be aware of that and avoid issuing fines unless you are well above that margin of error2.\n\n---\n\n1In fact, in Spain word of the street is that radars are set to account to possible margin of error of the radar, plus possible margin of error of the vehicle speedometer \\-*even if it is the vehicle owner's responsibility to ensure that it works correctly*\\- and some leeway.\n\n2Some people post on the internet the \"magic formula\" of how many % of speed you can go over the posted speed limit based on those calculations.

I am not sure if this \"respectively\" means \"parties to the Agreement, parties to the Schedule, and parties to the Attachment\" or \"incorporates respectively\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is a general rule of legal interpretation that all words are to be given effect, which means that you don\u2019t just throw words away, you have to include them in the interpretation. The word \u201crespectively\u201d distributes referents and their attributes, in the specific order given, and that means we have to have at least two things. For example, \u201cThe mother and father shall receive $100 and $20, respectively\u201d means that the mother shall receive $100 and the father shall receive $20\\. \u201cThe mother and father shall receive $100, $20 and $5, respectively\u201d violates the grammatical rule pertaining to \u201crespectively\u201d (each thing is to be distributed to a different referent and we have one too few referents given the items to be distributed), so such a structure would be technically meaningless. It does *not* mean \u201ceach\u201d, that is it does not mean that both shall receive $125\\. In such a case, the courts would have to discern some deeper intention or principle of justice where the mother gets $100 and the father gets $20\\+$5, though it could go $100\\+$20 and $5 \u2013 the wording does not tell you.\n\nApplying this tool to the final clause in the snippet, we first look for three things to be distributed (Agreement, Schedule and Attachment). If the text had said \u201cAgreement, and Schedule and Attachment\u201d, we could parse this as two things to be distributed \u2013 but that\u2019s not what it says. If \u201crespectively\u201d distributes Agreement, Schedule and Attachment, that would have to mean three different parties: the agreement\\-parties, the schedule\\-parties, and the attachment\\-parties. The problem is, you can be a party to an agreement, but it makes no sense to be a party to a schedule or an attachment. The interpretive canon known as the last antecedent rule favors assigning meaning to the nearest preceding referent (the three\\-term conjunction), but that has to give way to \u201csensible interpretation\u201d, and the problem of being a \u201cparty to a schedule\u201d. (\u201cAgreement\u201d is both a document and an act: being a party being \u201cbeing a party to an act\u201d).\n\nThe clause can, however, be sensibly divided at the level of the verb \u201cincorporate\u201d, though the interleaving of conjunctions makes this hard to see. Editing the snippet down to essentials, it says \u201cThis agreement \u2026 incorporates by this reference\u2026 \\[the terms and conditions set forth in the Schedule \u2026], and \\[the Agreement and Attachment(s) set forth \u2026by \u2026 the parties to the Agreement, Schedule and Attachment], respectively\u201d. The first bracking is the noun phrase \u201cT\\&C\u201d terminating with the first comma (for conjunction). The second comma, \u201cin such Schedule, by and between the parties\u201d is the non\\-restrictive relative clause reducing comma, which is equivalent to \u201cin such Schedule, where the Agreement and Attachment(s) are set forth by and between the parties\u2026\u201d. That comma is necessitated by the fact that \u201cin such Schedule\u201d has been shoved in between \u201cset forth\u201d and \u201cby and between\u201d.\n\nWe still have to deal with the meaning of \u201cparties to the Agreement, Schedule and Attachment\u201d. It makes no sense if you interpret this as identifying three independent sets of parties. However, you don\u2019t have to interpret this as a three\\-way conjunction of parties, instead, it refers to simple unconjoined parties, and they are parties to the \\[Agreement, Schedule and Attachment], that is, the whole shebang. \n\nGiven the linguistic challenges of the text, the courts will probably have to look at the entire document and surrounding circumstances to discern the true intent of the parties.\nIt would be better to rewrite the sentence.

A plaintiff in a civil case can compel disclosure prior to trial of all evidence in the custody, control, or possession of the defendant that is relevant or is reasonably calculated to be relevant to a disputed issue identified in the complaint, answer, and other pleadings (e.g. counterclaims, replies to counterclaims, third\\-party complaints, cross\\-claims, etc.).

First of all, a failure to disclose when there is a duty to do so is a ground to exclude presentation of that evidence at trial. Secondly, in civil cases, attorney fees incurred to obtain the discovery can be awarded, facts that might have been disclosed can be declared to be true as a matter of judicial sanction where there is not disclosure, claims can be dismissed, etc. The main relevant federal rule in civil cases is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37\\.\n\n> It is an unlawful request that must nonetheless be followed with only\n> a hypothetical remedy left to the defendant as is the case in most of\n> these united states to comply with an obviously unlawful arrest that\n> doesn't present an immediate threat to life?\n\nI don't understand this long and convoluted sentence.
