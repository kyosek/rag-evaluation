They want to maintain 75% ownership but split profits equally. Which of the following approaches would best achieve this goal while being legally binding?\n\nA) Create two classes of shares: 75% voting shares for the founder and 25% non-voting shares for the co-founder, with equal profit distribution rights for both classes\nB) Issue 75% of shares to the founder and 25% to the co-founder, then create a separate profit-sharing agreement outside the corporate structure\nC) Structure the company with 75% of shares to the founder and 25% to the co-founder, then implement a shareholder agreement specifying equal profit distribution\nD) Form a partnership instead of a corporation, with a 75-25 ownership split but equal profit sharing in the partnership agreement\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of corporate structure options and integration of multiple concepts from Quebec corporate law. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. It maintains the desired 75-25 ownership split through share distribution, which aligns with corporate governance and voting rights.\n2. It uses a shareholder agreement, which is a legally binding document that can modify how profits are distributed among shareholders, regardless of their ownership percentages.\n3. This approach keeps everything within the corporate structure, which is generally preferable for legal and tax purposes compared to option B's separate agreement.\n4. Unlike option A, it doesn't require creating different classes of shares, which can be more complex and may have unintended consequences.\n5. It avoids the partnership structure of option D, which wouldn't provide the limited liability protection of a corporation.\n\nThis solution leverages the flexibility of corporate structures mentioned in the documentation, where rights can be customized, while maintaining the legal framework of an incorporated entity.

Users upload a file in a specific format, it is converted *on the site's server* into a different format of their choice, without the need to install any software or applications on their device. Online file converters support a wide range of file types, including documents, images, videos, audio files, and more.\n\nLet's assume for the sake of simplicity that we're talking about ethical online converters that don't collect/sell/share any information about the files uploaded by the users, so the file really makes a private round trip.\n\n---\n\nI'm wondering about the legal responsibility of these online converters, as they're essentially redistributing derivative work of pretty much anything you give them, whether or not you're allowed to modify them in the first place. The derivative work is *downloaded from their servers* at some point in time.\n\nThis question is a bit related to the issue of uploading copyrighted material to social media (with the *Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act* in the USA), except that the files here are only supposed to be downloaded by the same person who uploaded them (a private link is created and will expire quickly).\n\n**Additional assumptions (bonus):**\n\n* What if a website detects that a lot of users upload the same files and implements a cache? The converted files would then be stored in the medium\\-long term, but still only privately accessible only by people who have the original file (and site owners). That would probably already be illegal in the UK but I don't know about EU or USA.\n* What if we have a cache **and** the files are encrypted with a hash of the source file, rendering their access practically impossible without the original, even for site owners?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Online file converters are legal: there is no law that prohibits a person from making a program available and executing online, including creating output in the form of a file. It is possible that some person may illegally copy copyright\\-protected material then use a website to modify that material, in which case the question of vicarious liability for copyright infringement could arise, so we appeal to the DMCA safe harbor provisions to see what the website must do. First, the owner of copyright must submit a properly constructed takedown notice to the website. Crucially, the notice must contain sufficient information that the website operator can find and take down the item(s) in question. Assuming that the complainant can supply the \"where is it\" information, then there is a notice and counter\\-notice routine where the uploader is informed and can deny the accusation \u2013 the website operator doesn't evaluate the merits of the claim, he only sees that the formalities were observed. If the operator follows the rules, he cannot be held vicariously liable.\n\nIf the link does not expire and if it is somehow promulgated, the technical potential for being a contributor to copyright infringement becomes very real, but it puts the operator in no worse a legal position than Youtube. So the question is not just related to OCILLA, it is entirely covered by that law. Questions of how users or website owners are \"supposed to\" act don't figure into this. If the website owner does not comply with those provisions, they have no access to the safe harbor provisions, and they can be sued.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) safe harbor provisions offer the strongest legal protection for online service providers in the US against copyright infringement claims.\n\n2.

The most significant challenge for Alice lies in proving that Bob breached his duty of care (element 2 of negligence). \n\nOption A is incorrect because, as friends traveling together, it's relatively easy to establish that Bob had a duty of care towards Alice. \n\nOption B is correct because it addresses the crux of the issue. Bob took precautions by driving below the speed limit and applying extra care, which might be considered reasonable conduct. His lack of knowledge about bridges freezing first is the only potential breach, but it's debatable whether this knowledge is something a reasonable driver in New Zealand should possess, especially if warning signs are uncommon in the area.\n\nOption C is not the most significant challenge because the causal link between Bob's driving and the accident seems clear.\n\nOption D is also not the main challenge because Alice has demonstrable damages (the doctor's visit and damaged jacket), even if they are minor.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the complexity of determining the standard of care in negligence cases and requires students to critically analyze what constitutes a \"reasonable person\" standard in the given context.

The news reporting exception would not apply, I think.\n\nThe selection of a particular set of games as \"notable\" or \"best\" would be protected by copyright. Selecting such games as a set, or indicting which games belonged to such a list would be infringement. Including some such games along with many others, and in no way indicating which belonged to such a list would probably not be infringement of the copyright on the list.\n\nA website or open database that provides data on such games may well have a TOS limiting how a user can access or use the data. For instance data scraping may be prohibited. Commercial use may be prohibited or restricted. Such a TOS probably forms a contract with each user, and any user is bound to its terms. Use of the site contrary to the TOS may be a breech of contract, and thus grounds for a lawsuit. What damages might be available would depend on the terms of the TOS, and the laws of the country where such a suit might be brought.

Should car sharing company explicitly notify about liability before booking?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How Are Liability And Insurance Matters Usually Disclosed?\n==========================================================\n\nNormally, in a car sharing arrangement, you must establish a membership or account with the car sharing firm that includes all of the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties (at least by reference to a document that you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to read), often in connection with downloading an app necessary to use the service.\n\nI also strongly suspect (as a comment below indicates) that if you dug around enough on the firm's webpage that a link to the relevant terms and conditions could be found, even if it wasn't in the most obvious place. But, this information will often not be on the firm's main landing page of their website, and can instead often only be reached with multiple clicks and/or drop down menus.\n\nSometimes this is called a \"terms of service\", sometimes this is called a \"master agreement\", sometimes it is called a \"membership agreement\" or \"account agreement\". My list of names for this agreement is not exhaustive. Often these terms are also described elsewhere in simplified form, such as a \"how to\" brochure, or information that is posted on the interior of the vehicle itself or in a sleeve of documents in the car.\n\nUsually, in the course of the sign up process there would typically be a box to click and a link or scrollable portion of the screen at which you can review all of those terms and conditions which are the terms of the contract.\n\nWhat Must Advertising Say And Why?\n==================================\n\nIt is not generally necessary for the advertising itself to disclose every term and condition and detail of the arrangement. Generally speaking, an advertisement is considered merely an \"invitation to make an offer\" to enter into a contract, rather than an offer which can be accepted directly and form a contract. Of course, a particular jurisdiction's legislature certainly has the power to require that a car sharing company disclose liability and insurance information in a particular fashion set forth in a statute or regulation, if that jurisdiction's legislative body chooses to do so.\n\nEven when these issues are mentioned in advertising (even when some disclosure is required by law in adverising), usually this would be in the form of a sentence that incorporates another document by reference like \"Additional terms and conditions, including terms and conditions related to liability and insurance, that can be found at . . . . apply.\"\n\nThis is due to the practical reality that TV and radio ads are usually just 15\\-60 seconds allowing about 25\\-100 words or perhaps a few more if the announcer speaks quickly, and that ads in print or on a screen also typically have room for only a very small amount of text.\n\nWebsites, in principle, provide an effectively infinite amount of capacity to host content, but considerations of ease of website use and the need to make the landing page striking for marketing purposes (as well as the need to make websites mobile user friendly when that is the only way that many Internet users can access the web) usually relegates the legal terms of the agreement to less attention grabbing locations.\n\nOften, these terms are disclosed more conspicuously when the terms and conditions change materially, something that often has its own little PR campaign accompanying it.\n\nUnilaterally Imposed Contracts of Adhesion\n==========================================\n\nOne reason that disclosure isn't such a huge issue is that car share agreements are almost always mass produced, not up for negotiation, \"contracts of adhesion\" that only senior management of the firm has the authority to modify. In the case of these intangible contractually agreed services, the terms of the agreement are more akin to a non\\-negotiable product design than to the paradigmatic haggled legal agreement between parties.\n\nThus, a customer has only two choices. Use the service according to the standard terms, or don't use the service.\n\nGiven this reality, the average buyer of the services relies upon the market place rejecting contracts of adhesion with bad terms, upon testimonials (good and bad) from prior users of the service, and upon media publicity for notorious terms or incidents that makes it look like the business doesn't treat it customers well, to keep the agreements reasonable, rather than upon individualized decisions to use or not use the service based upon a detailed review of the contract terms.\n\nThere are legal doctrines pertaining to contracts of adhesion that invalidate terms that are unconscionable or not within the reasonable expectation of a consumer unless those terms of conspicuously disclosed.\n\nA classic example, for example, would be that a car share agreement that imposed extraction of a kidney as a fine for being one days late in paying an invoice would be void as a matter of law, even if the referenced document said so in bold large face type and the customer clicked a box acknowledging having read the agreement.\n\nWhat Happens If There Is No Agreement Or Disclosure?\n====================================================\n\nIf there was never a step at which the terms and conditions were disclosed or accepted, then the default rules of law pertaining to personal property leasing, together with the laws pertaining to automobile accidents and insurance (both statutory and case law) in the jurisdiction in question.\n\nIn almost all cases, liability to third parties for accidents is generally a matter of tort law or statute imposed by the government, rather than being something that can be modified by agreement. Also, usually the government imposes minimum insurance requirements and the owner of the car also has an incentive (and often a legal requirement) to have car insurance in force.\n\nIn the United States, the default rules of law pertaining to personal property leasing, are set forth in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in every U.S. State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each self\\-governing U.S. territory with its own internal laws.\n\nIn countries Europe or Latin American or Asia known as \"civil law\" countries (i.e. in those countries outside the British common law tradition, the Islamic law legal tradition, tribal or clan or caste law, or legal systems with communist regime roots established in the 20th century), the equivalent default rules of law (governing personal property leases, contracts to provide services, leases and insurance) would be contained in either a civil code or a commercial code of that country in most cases.\n\nIn common law countries, the contractual agreements tend to be longer than the default provisions of law are skinnier. In civil law countries, the reverse is true.\n\nA hybrid of these two approaches which also limits the need of customers to monitor contract terms is the regulatory model commonly used in the insurance industry in the United States takes the reality that contracts of adhesion are the norm and gives it a regulatory twist. In this hybrid model, all of the boilerplate language of every insurance contract down to the last word of non\\-customized or only semi\\-customized language, and often fee schedules as well, must be substantively improved by a state agency that regulates insurance. In these models, a public official negotiates the terms of the contracts with the firms, subject to intervention in and participation in the process by industry associations and non\\-profits or interested individuals on behalf of consumers or other interested parties. In these hybrid systems, the approved contract language which can't be modified in the boilerplate language by either the firms or the customers, is on file with the regulatory agency and provides constructive notice to all parties in much the same way as a statute or government regulation.\n\nIf not enough material terms of the agreement (e.g. the rental rate) were disclosed to form a contract, then there would be no enforcement contractual arrangement involved in the car share and the car share company would have to rely on the law of unjust enrichment to recover the fair market value of the services provided in each case, which as a practical matter, wouldn't be viable as a business model.\n\nDistinctions Between The Two Kinds Of Car Sharing Arrangements\n==============================================================\n\nThere is some ambiguity in the question because there are a couple main types of car sharing arrangements.\n\nOne is more like a rental car and you drive the vehicle yourself (Car2Go is one of them). In this case, the firm typically provides car insurance and does a limited background of a prospective account holders driving record before allowing someone to use the service. But, the user of the service, who drives the car, would be primarily liable for any accident that the car gets into.\n\nThe other kind, sometimes called a \"car share\" and sometimes called a \"ride share\" is more like an Uber or Lyft, which is a glorified, on demand taxi service, in which a driver provides the services of the driver and the vehicle and takes car of insurance and will be primarily liable for any accident the car gets into as a driver and owner of the car.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A car-sharing company is facing a lawsuit from a customer who was involved in an accident while using their service.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1.

City of Hialeah](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/508/520), 508 U.S. 520 a law specifically designed to restrict Santeria animal sacrifices *is* an undue burden on religion. The Employment Division court cites [Cantwell v. Connecticut](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/296), 310 U.S. 296 and [Wisconsin v. Yoder](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/406/205), 406 U.S. 205 as the only cases where the First Amendment prevents a generally applicable law from applying in a religious context, which the court notes \"are distinguished on the ground that they involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but that Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections\".

The set of exceptions is large enough that one might conclude that this *is* an undue burden on the exercise of religion. The breadth of the number of exceptions undermines claims of \"necessity\" which are crucial to any order that closes churches.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A state governor issues an order limiting religious gatherings to 10 people during a pandemic, while allowing various exceptions for other businesses and services. A federal judge blocks this order, citing potential First Amendment violations. Which of the following best explains the legal reasoning behind the judge's decision?\n\nA) The order violates the Establishment Clause by treating religious institutions differently from secular ones\nB) The numerous exceptions to the order undermine its claim of necessity, potentially creating an undue burden on religious exercise\nC) The order fails the strict scrutiny test established in Wisconsin v. Yoder for laws affecting religious practices\nD) The governor's order is not neutral and generally applicable, as required by Employment Division v. Smith\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The judge's decision likely hinges on the peculiar nature of the governor's order. While it initially appears to be a neutral 10-person limit on gatherings, it includes numerous exceptions for various businesses and services such as schools, day-care centers, food pantries, detox centers, shopping malls, and restaurants. This broad set of exceptions undermines the order's claim of necessity, which is crucial for any regulation that restricts religious gatherings.\n\nThe correct answer (B) addresses this key point. The numerous exceptions suggest that the order may be creating an undue burden on religious exercise, as it allows various secular activities while restricting religious gatherings. This aligns with the principle established in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, where laws specifically burdening religious practices were found unconstitutional.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Establishment Clause isn't the primary issue here; the Free Exercise Clause is more relevant. Option C is incorrect because while Wisconsin v. Yoder is mentioned, it's not directly applicable to this case and doesn't establish a strict scrutiny test for all laws affecting religious practices. Option D, while related to an important precedent in Employment Division v. Smith, doesn't fully capture the nuance of this situation where the numerous exceptions make the law potentially not generally applicable.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, integration of the specific details of the case with broader constitutional principles, and application to a real-world scenario, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66652/can-a-pre-ticked-checkbox-be-used-to-recall-revoke-consent-under-gdpr-and-or-epr", "docs_id": 66652, "title": "Can a pre-ticked checkbox be used to RECALL/REVOKE consent under GDPR and/or ePrivacy/cookie law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wonder, can a pre\\-ticked checkbox be used to recall/revoke consent, or does revoking/recalling consent need to be a separate, explicit action?\n\nI have made a specific consent function like this:\nWhen user first visit website and uses the functions, there is a empty consent checkbox:\n\"Save my details in a cookie so I don't need to enter them everytime\".\n\nIF the user gives consent, checks the checkbox, and proceeds, the details are now saved in cookie.\n\nNext time user visit website, the checkbox will now be pre\\-ticked (as the user previously given consent). If the user wants to revoke or recall the consent, the user can now uncheck the checkbox and proceed, and the cookie will be deleted.\n\nTechnically, it works by checking for presence of the said cookie, if cookie is present, box is pre\\-checked, else box is empty.\n\nI wonder, is this valid consent according to GDPR, and is it permittable to use a pre\\-ticked checkbox to revoke/recall consent?\n\nI see two legal problems with this:\n1: If the user checks the checkbox, and then another user uses the same computer, or the user forgets he consented, the user could believe its an invalid consent as the box is pre\\-checked.\n2: If GDPR law requires the revocation of consent be a separate function and not built\\-in the consent checkbox, it could be problematic.\n\nAlso, I wonder, if I use this scheme and totally locally controlling this function, it will mean that I as a website owner will NOT be able to revoke consent on behalf of the user, only way for the user to revoke his consent is to uncheck the checkbox or delete his cookies.\n\nIs it valid to do this, or MUST I be able to revoke consent on behalf of a user if a user emails and wants to revoke consent, or can I refer user to uncheck that checkbox? Since the details is stored in a cookie, only way for me to revoke consent would be to somehow \"ban\" that cookie from being activated later on from the server side, requiring me to store personal details of users (either IP\\-adresses of computers which the cookies should not be respected from and immidiately deleted, or users email adress to \"ban\" the content of the cookie to be used, and immidiately delete all cookies containing that email adress)\n\nAnother thing is that since the function is locally controlled, it means that I don't know or store which users have consented, meaning I do not have any records of consent from users. HOWEVER, since the function is built in such a way that it will only place the cookie if consent is received, it would be sufficent as \"consent proof\" right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR doesn't impose specific requirements on how consent may be revoked, other than that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it. If the original consent is given via a checkbox, and if that checkbox is compliant, then withdrawing consent through the same checkbox should also be compliant. It might be appropriate to regularly remind the user that they can withdraw consent, e.g. by expiring the cookie after 12 months. It could also be a good idea to indicate that the user enabled this themselves, e.g. by showing the timestamp when consent was given.\n\nHowever, I am not convinced that consent is required in this scenario. While the definition of consent comes from GDPR, the cookie consent requirement comes from the ePrivacy directive which is then implemented in national laws. The ePD talks more generally about information stored on a terminal device of the \"subscriber or user\". Accessing such information (including but not limited to cookies) usually requires consent of the subscriber or user, but there is an exception for access that is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user to work. There are some consequences from this:\n\n* You might not need consent for setting the cookie if such storage is strictly necessary for your website to work. If your site features a log\\-in you could in theory also store the information server\\-side, but client\\-side storage might actually be more privacy\\-friendly.\n* At least, checking whether a consent cookie is set does not require consent since such access is strictly necessary for a consent mechanism to work.\n* It is not a problem if multiple people share a browser profile. Since this is an ePrivacy issue, you do not need the consent of the data subject but the consent of the subscriber or user.\n\nCookie consent is typically managed purely client\\-side, and I have *never* heard of functionality for a website operator to withraw consent on behalf of the user. If a website operator is concerned about this, they could offer a link that goes directly to a consent management panel.\n\nHowever, information about consent and withrawal events might be stored server\\-side. The GDPR requires that you can \"demonstrate\" that consent was given validly. For example, you should be able to show that the request for consent had enough information for the consent to be freely given, specific, and informed. Most cookie consent solutions also store a server\\-side timestamp for consent/withrawal events in order to have an auditable history that proves when consent was given or withdrawn. But unless there are user accounts, it's of course difficult to tie such events to a browser session.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A website owner implements a cookie consent mechanism using a pre-ticked checkbox for returning users. Which of the following scenarios poses the most significant legal risk under GDPR and ePrivacy regulations?\n\nA) The website doesn't provide a separate function for users to revoke consent apart from the checkbox\nB) The website owner cannot revoke consent on behalf of users who email requesting revocation\nC) The consent mechanism doesn't store server-side records of user consent\nD) The pre-ticked checkbox might be seen by a different user sharing the same device\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options present potential concerns, the absence of server-side records of user consent (option C) poses the most significant legal risk. The GDPR explicitly requires that data controllers be able to demonstrate that valid consent was obtained. Without server-side records, the website owner lacks a reliable audit trail to prove when and how consent was given or withdrawn.\n\nOption A is less problematic because the GDPR doesn't mandate a separate revocation function, as long as withdrawing consent is as easy as giving it. The checkbox method could be compliant if implemented correctly.\n\nOption B is not a major issue because it's uncommon and not required for website operators to revoke consent on behalf of users. The user can typically manage this through the website interface.\n\nOption D, while a practical concern, is less of a legal issue under ePrivacy regulations, which focus on the consent of the subscriber or user of the device, not necessarily the specific individual.\n\nThe lack of server-side records (C) is the most critical because it undermines the website owner's ability to comply with GDPR's accountability principle and demonstrate compliance in case of an audit or investigation.

The correct answer is C because contracts contain an implicit term that obligations will be carried out in a reasonable time, even when not explicitly stated. While a year may or may not be considered reasonable, the buyer doesn't have the right to keep the money indefinitely (eliminating option A). The seller cannot immediately reclaim the full amount without considering what constitutes a reasonable timeframe, making option B incorrect. Option D, while touching on a valid point about potential damages, is not the most appropriate immediate course of action.

The correct answer (C) aligns with the Rules of Professional Conduct in the United States, as explained in the documentation. \n\nThe attorney's primary ethical obligation is to the client (the elderly woman), regardless of who is paying for the services. The attorney must maintain client confidentiality and make decisions based on the client's wishes, not those of a third party (even if that party is paying the bills).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the son has no legal right to be included in communications or decision-making simply because he's paying.

This could consist of an unopened letter with a date stamp, a notarized copy, or some other scheme involving a third party. According to the wikipedia entry there is no specific provision for this in US copyright law.\n\nIs there any legal reason to use a \"poor man's copyright\"? Have these techniques been used successfully in court, or are they mostly useless? And if one wanted to use such a technique, what is the best way to go about it?\n\nI am looking for an answer for US law, but would appreciate other countries' perspectives too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [U.S. Copyright Office says of poor man's copyright](http://copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman):\n\n> There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration.\n\nThis means that the U.S. government will not grant you any special rights or protections for having undertaken poor man's copyright, unlike advance copyright registration, which confers the ability to collect statutory damages. In any case, as a prerequisite to legal action, you will need to register your work, even if you must do so after the infringement has taken place:\n\n> You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work.\n\nInstead, poor man's copyright is purely an evidentiary mechanism for proving possession of a work at a particular point in time. Suppose a best\\-selling author illegally uses huge verbatim passages of your unpublished work in a new novel. As part of your legal argument against the infringing author, you want to prove that you possessed your unpublished work decades before the author claimed to have started work on the infringing novel.\n\nThe truly serious issue with many types of poor man's copyright is that it simply *doesn't* prove what it intends to prove. If you have a sealed envelope that is postmarked with a date, that only proves that the *envelope* passed through the postal system on that day. It says nothing about what the contents of the envelope were at the time; notably, the envelope could be mailed unsealed and then filled and sealed at a later date.\n\nMore involved forms of poor man's copyright, like storing a work in an undisturbed bank safe deposit box, *might* carry more evidentiary weight, but such an approach could still be difficult to verify reliably: we must ask the bank to verify the negative that no one ever accessed the deposit box. This may or may not be something the bank is prepared to do, and they may or may not maintain such records perpetually.\n\nIf you really want to prove that you had possession of a creative work on a particular day (which, again, is not a complete legal argument, but may be helpful), you will need to find a trustworthy third party who can demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that the work has remained undisturbed in their possession since a particular date. A bank might be good at this, but the best agency I know of to carry out such a purpose is the *U.S. Copyright Office*! They allow you to register your work (for probably much cheaper than a decades\\-long deposit box rental) *and* confer the benefits of registration, e.g. statutory damages.\n\nI don't know of any legal cases that have tested a poor man's copyright in court. On a personal note, I suspect there are none, because the primary case that poor man's copyright is intended to protect against \\-\\- someone taking your unpublished work and making the baldfaced lie that it is their own, such that your only recourse is to prove a timeline that renders their claims impossible \\-\\- seems somewhat uncommon.

Let us start by discussing [Cour de cassation, Chambre civile 1, 04 juillet 1995, 93\\-16198](https://juricaf.org/arret/FRANCE-COURDECASSATION-19950704-9316198), where the highest French court endorsed a 1993 court of appeal ruling, because it illustrates some relevant principles.\n\nA jewelry store put up a ring for sale for 100 000 francs (equivalent to roughly \u20ac20 000 in 2021\\), which someone bought. The store later realized that there was a mistake in the price tag (the intended listing price was more than four times higher) and sued to revert the sale.\n\nThe court of appeals judged that\n\n* as a general rule, mistakes in price tags are a risk the seller takes;\n* the buyer could reasonably think the asked price matched the true value of the ring, and therefore it was not \"unrealistically low\"\n\nThe latter point refers to a statute [(Code Civil 1169\\)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032041120) that says a contract of something\\-for\\-money is void if the price is \"unrealistically low\". The ruling essentially says that the test for \"unrealistically low\" is whether the buyer should reasonably be aware that the price is due to a mistake from the seller.\n\nI doubt a store can rely on the \"unrealistically low\" provision in the case of shipping fees. A random consumer has no way to accurately know the price of overseas shipping. Even if they did think the shipping fees were much lower than expected, it might be because the store chooses to charge something else that their exact costs, for whatever reason (e.g. uniform shipping fees is easier to maintain on their website that one cost for each country; some stores are \"free shipping\" meaning they recoup their shipping costs with higher item prices).\n\nNo surprise fees\n----------------\n\nThe seller might argue that their shipping costs were unknown, and that the shipping fee they charged was a provisional estimate, or conditional on a later determination of the true cost.\n\n[Code de la consommation, L112\\-3](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032227327) says that when the total price of the item or service sold \"cannot be reasonably known in advance \\[of the sale]\", the seller must provide advance notice to the buyer, as well as the method by which the unknown components of the price will be later determined. No such notice appears to have been made.\n\nOnline sale: when is the contract formed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe seller might argue that clicking \"buy\" on an online shopping cart does not form a contract, but that they reserve acceptance at a later date. The other answers seem to indicate that is a valid practice in some common\\-law countries, but I believe that is not the case in France. I could not find court cases on exactly that point, and therefore cannot be sure that the rest of my answer is correct.\n\nI believe the seller is bound by the terms offered on the website, based on [Code Civil, 1127\\-1 and 1127\\-2](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGISCTA000032007249/).\n\n> Quiconque propose \u00e0 titre professionnel, par voie \u00e9lectronique, la fourniture de biens ou la prestation de services, met \u00e0 disposition les stipulations contractuelles applicables d'une mani\u00e8re qui permette leur conservation et leur reproduction.\n> \n> \n> **L'auteur d'une offre reste engag\u00e9 par elle tant qu'elle est accessible par voie \u00e9lectronique de son fait.**\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> Le contrat n'est valablement conclu que si le destinataire de l'offre a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier le d\u00e9tail de sa commande et son prix total et de corriger d'\u00e9ventuelles erreurs avant de confirmer celle\\-ci pour exprimer son acceptation d\u00e9finitive.\n\n> Whichever business proposes by electronic means the sale of goods or services must allow the contractual conditions be be recorded and reproduced.\n> \n> \n> **The author of an offer is bound by it as long as it is accessible due to his or her actions.**\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> The contract is formed only if the recipient of the offer could check the details of his or her order, its total price, and could correct possible mistakes, before confirming the order to formulate his or her definite acceptance.\n\n\"Due to his or her actions\" means I cannot screenshot an Amazon page (or duplicate it on my web server) and request the conditions of that screenshot two years later. However, it does not include provisions for mistakes in the listed price or sales conditions, and I would expect the general rule (price tag mistakes are on the seller) to apply on the internet.\n\nThe last paragraph cited is a consumer rights provision \\- essentially, \"no contract is formed unless the consumer did X\". However, it implies that once the consumer did X, the contract *is* formed.\n\nContract enforcement\n--------------------\n\nFor the above reasons, I believe clauses that allow an online store to unilaterally cancel an order once placed are unenforceable (unless *force majeure* or other narrow exceptions apply). That being said, the incentive to sue in such cases is low (and I could find no jurisprudence).\n\nIn France (and I believe in all [civil\\-law](/questions/tagged/civil-law \"show questions tagged 'civil-law'\") systems), civil liability is established by three factors: a damage, a wrongful action, and a causation link between the two. In the jewelry case, the store could easily prove the damage (difference between the price at which the sale was made and the price at which the item was estimated), and the causation link between the consumer\u2019s action and the damage; however, there was no wrongful action.\n\nIn the case where the exchange of goods against money has been blocked by the store, the consumer\u2019s problem is to prove damage. If they have not been charged, or if they have been charged but refunded, the direct monetary impact is zero. The consumer would have to prove other theories of damage: for instance, that they relied on the ordered item to do something, and could not find a replacement in time. However, in all such scenarios, the causation link will be hard to prove.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Bob, a New Zealand resident, purchases a bulky device from a Spanish online store for \u20ac2,000, including shipping.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. In civil law systems, listed prices are generally binding on the seller, even if mistaken. The documentation cites a French court case where a jewelry store had to honor a mistakenly low price.\n\n2. The shipping cost error is unlikely to be considered \"unrealistically low\" as consumers cannot reasonably be expected to know accurate international shipping costs.\n\n3. The store did not provide advance notice of potential price changes or conditions, which is required by consumer protection laws (as exemplified by the French Code de la consommation, L112-3).\n\n4. The contract is likely formed when the payment is processed, as implied by the French Civil Code articles 1127-1 and 1127-2, which state that an offer is binding as long as it's accessible electronically and that a contract is formed once the consumer has verified and confirmed the order.\n\n5.

Here's why:\n\n1. A prenuptial agreement is a legally binding contract that can specify how assets, including the house, should be divided in case of a divorce.

Since they're not required to file US taxes, do I still have to send the form to them?\n2. Is it fine to expose my TIN (taxpayer identification number) to individuals or companies who I send the form to them. Since the form requires me to write my TIN/EIN, what would be the risks of this and what precautions should be taken to avoid inappropriate/illegal use?\n3. I send payments via PayPal and wire transfer. Should I send form 1099\\-MISC or 1099\\-K?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr:**\n\n1. No.\n2. You don't have a choice.\n3. It depends, but the options are \"no form\" or 1099\\-MISC. You'll never send a 1099\\-K.\n\nThe only 1099 you would potentially be required to send for business payments is a 1099\\-MISC. The [IRS instructions on that](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099msc/ar02.html) are pretty clear as to when and how you must use that.\n\nNote that *you* don't send 1099\\-K's unless you are a payment settlement entity. Furthermore, if you transmit the funds using a payment settlement entity who will report the transaction on a 1099\\-K, then you don't need to report it on a 1099\\-MISC. (See \"Form 1099\\-K\" [ibid](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099msc/ar02.html).)\n\nFortunately, PayPal is a payment settlement entity, so you don't need to worry about reporting payments you send through them ... with one big exception: PayPal does not report \"payments to friends and family,\" and so if you're using that to avoid their fees then the IRS would consider you liable for reporting payments on a 1099\\-MISC. To my knowledge banks do not report wire transfers, so you would have to file 1099\\-MISC when required for payments sent that way.\n\nRegarding your TIN: Yes, these numbers get circulated in the course of business. But this is actually one of the few *legal* uses of those numbers, and it's required, so if you're worried about identity theft or something then buy insurance against that. And if you think *you've* got it bad, just think how your payment recipient must feel: Before you send funds that would need to be reported next year you are supposed to demand a signed [W\\-9](https://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Form-W9) from them (so that you can make the report).

Let's break down each option:\n\nA) is incorrect because PayPal is a payment settlement entity that will report this transaction on a 1099-K, exempting the business owner from filing a 1099-MISC. The affiliate being in Canada doesn't change this, as PayPal handles the reporting.\n\nB) is correct in that wire transfers typically require 1099-MISC reporting. However, this is not the best answer because there's a more complex scenario in option C.\n\nC) is the correct answer. Using PayPal's \"friends and family\" option to avoid fees is considered an attempt to circumvent proper business payment channels. In this case, PayPal does not report these payments, making the business owner liable for reporting on a 1099-MISC. The fact that the affiliate is in Germany doesn't exempt the owner from reporting, as the payment method is the determining factor here.\n\nD) is incorrect because payments to entities not subject to U.S. taxation (like a U.K.-based affiliate) do not need to be reported on a 1099-MISC. The documentation states that reasonable belief that the entity is foreign is adequate to omit them from 1099-MISC filings.\n\nThis question tests the application of multiple rules regarding 1099 reporting, international payments, and the impact of different payment methods on reporting requirements.

This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. Protection: By not naming a beneficiary, the insurance proceeds go to the estate, which can then be managed according to the terms set in the will. This prevents the ex-wife from directly accessing the funds.\n\n2. Flexibility: A testamentary trust allows the father to establish specific terms for how the money should be used for the child's benefit, including living expenses, education, and when the child can directly access the funds.\n\n3. Legal oversight: The trustee is legally obligated to manage the funds according to the trust's terms, providing a layer of protection and accountability.\n\n4.

I have included the relevant statutes in the longer answer below, but to summarize:\n\nUnder Federal Law, you may not receive as a gift a firearm from a person who resides in another state without going through a licensed dealer in your state.\n\nUnder New Jersey law, you must have a firearms purchaser identification card in order to possess a rifle that you own at a range or any other location. You may receive a rifle as a gift from a person who lives in New Jersey provided you have a firearms purchaser identification card and the transfer is registered with the chief of police of the municipality in which you reside or the superintendent.\n\nYou may possess a rifle at a shooting range in New Jersey without a firearms purchaser identification card if the rifle was lent to you by the licensed range or a licensed instructor.\n\nLet's start with transferring firearms from the federal perspective:\n\nFrom the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/0501-firearms-top-10-qaspdf/download):\n\n> Under Federal law, an unlicensed individual \\[someone without a Federal\n>  Firearms License] is prohibited from transferring a firearm to an\n>  individual who does not reside in the State where the transferee\n>  resides. Generally, for a person to lawfully transfer a firearm to an\n>  unlicensed person who resides out of State, the firearm must be\n>  shipped to a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) within the recipient\u2019s\n>  State of residence.\n\nThere is an exception for inheritances.\n\nFederal Law does allow one to purchase long\\-guns (rifles and shotguns) across state lines if the laws of both states are followed but the purchase must be from a licensed dealer.\n\n[New Jersey allows the purchase](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-2c/chapter-58/section-2c-58-3/) of rifles and shotguns across state lines but requires that a purchaser have a firearms purchaser identification card:\n\n> b. Firearms purchaser identification card. No person shall sell, give, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of nor receive, purchase or otherwise acquire an antique cannon or a rifle or shotgun, other than an antique rifle or shotgun, unless the purchaser, assignee, donee, receiver or holder is licensed as a dealer under this chapter or possesses a valid firearms purchaser identification card, and first exhibits said card to the seller, donor, transferor or assignor, and unless the purchaser, assignee, donee, receiver or holder signs a written certification, on a form prescribed by the superintendent, which shall indicate that he presently complies with the requirements of subsection c. of this section and shall contain his name, address and firearms purchaser identification card number or dealer's registration number. The said certification shall be retained by the seller, as provided in paragraph (4\\) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:58\\-2, or, in the case of a person who is not a dealer, it may be filed with the chief of police of the municipality in which he resides or with the superintendent.\n\nYou must have a firearms purchaser identification card in order to possess a rifle unless it is under one of two specific exceptions for the temporary possession of the rifle.\n\n[New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, \u00a7 Sec. 2C:39\\-5 Unlawful possession of weapons states](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-2c/chapter-39/section-2c-39-5/) in part:\n\n> c.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Federal law prohibits direct interstate transfers of firearms between non-licensed individuals. The gift must go through a licensed dealer in the recipient's state.\n\n2. New Jersey law requires a Firearms Purchaser Identification Card to possess a rifle, even if received as a gift.

In all likelihood, if a Dutch court was used, you would get a default judgment.\n\nThen, you would need to try to enforce the judgment some place where the defendant had assets. You could probably easily seize the Dutch account with a Dutch judgment if it wasn't closed as soon as the Defendant got word of the suit and before judgment entered.\n\nIn any other country, you would have to look to their law regarding the recognition of foreign judgments and follow the requirements of that law to convert your judgment into a judgment in a place where the defendant has assets. Recognition of foreign judgments for rent or other monies owed is usually more easily obtained than recognition of judgments for torts (e.g. damages owed from a car accident). In some U.S. states, this could be very straight forward and not involve a full fledged new trial on the merits, in other U.S. states, particularly if the Dutch judgment was obtained by default, it might be necessary to retry the case from scratch in the U.S.\n\nI do not know what the process is in Australia, but I suspect that it is similar.\n\nThe trouble is, that even though you could get a valid judgment in the Netherland and enforce it against the assets there, it would probably not be cost effective to pursue collection in the U.S. or in Australia for that amount of money.

The most strategic approach is option A for several reasons:\n\n1. Jurisdiction: The debt was incurred in the Netherlands, giving Dutch courts clear jurisdiction over the case.\n\n2. Evidence and ease of filing: The creditor has strong evidence (itemized list, messages) that would be easily presentable in a Dutch court.\n\n3. Asset accessibility: The debtor has a Dutch bank account, which, while containing less than the full amount owed, provides an immediate avenue for partial recovery if a judgment is obtained.\n\n4. Cost-effectiveness: As mentioned in the documentation, pursuing legal action in the US or Australia for this amount would likely not be cost-effective due to the complexities of enforcing foreign judgments.\n\n5. Default judgment: The documentation suggests that a Dutch court would likely grant a default judgment if the debtor doesn't appear, which is probable given their current location.\n\nWhile options B and C might seem tempting due to the debtor's current location and assets, they would involve significantly more legal complexity and cost. Option D, while comprehensive, would be unnecessarily expensive and complex for the amount in question.\n\nThe key here is balancing the likelihood of success with the cost and complexity of the legal action.

Greenman*:\n\n> The states are forbidden, but Congress is expressly authorized, to coin money. The states are prohibited from emitting bills of credit, but Congress, which is neither expressly authorized nor expressly forbidden to do so, has, as we have already seen, been held to have the power of emitting bills of credit, and of making every provision for their circulation as currency short of giving them the quality of legal tender for private debts, even by those who have denied its authority to give them this quality.\n> \n> \n> It appears to us to follow as a logical and necessary consequence that Congress has the power to issue the obligations of the United States in such form, and to impress upon them such qualities as currency for the purchase of merchandise and the payment of debts, as accord with the usage of sovereign governments.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> ... we are irresistibly impelled to the conclusion that the impressing upon the Treasury notes of the United States the quality of being a legal tender in payment of private debts is an appropriate means, conducive and plainly adapted to the execution of the undoubted powers of Congress, consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, and therefore within the meaning of that instrument ...\n\nThe reasoning in this case was not based on the paper being exchangable for metal, so any changes in that regard since will not have affected the outcome.\n\nFor a deeper history of how this power has been understood, and for an originalist lens on the topic, see Robert G.

They plan to improve the models and database content, refactor the code for flexibility, and make it available on an internal service platform. Which of the following scenarios would most likely require the company to release their modifications publicly under the GPL v2.1 license?\n\nA) Using the modified software strictly for internal research without sharing it outside the organization\nB) Providing access to the modified software to off-site contractors for collaborative research\nC) Releasing the refactored source code publicly but keeping the improved ML models and database content private\nD) Selling the internal research results that were produced using the modified software\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of GPL v2.1 requirements in the context of internal use and distribution. The key considerations are:\n\n1. Internal use without distribution doesn't trigger GPL requirements to release modifications.\n2. Providing copies to off-site contractors is considered distribution.\n3. The GPL applies to the entire combined work, but doesn't necessarily extend to output data or separately developed components.\n4. Commercial use of results doesn't necessarily require releasing the software.\n\nOption A is incorrect because strictly internal use, even with modifications, doesn't require public release under GPL.\n\nOption B is correct because providing copies to off-site contractors is explicitly mentioned as distribution in the GNU FAQ, which would trigger the requirement to release modifications under GPL.\n\nOption C is a tricky distractor. While releasing the refactored code publicly is compliant, keeping the improved models and database private might be acceptable if they're considered separate works or data, not part of the combined GPL work.\n\nOption D is incorrect because using the software internally to produce research results doesn't necessarily require releasing the software itself, even if the results are sold.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of GPL distribution rules, internal use exceptions, and the boundaries of what constitutes the combined work under GPL, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/236/what-is-unjust-enrichment", "docs_id": 236, "title": "What is &quot;unjust enrichment?&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is unjust enrichment under the law? It's understandable if associated with liability for wrongdoing. Apparently, this is not a necessary condition.

The classic example is: Jane hires Dan to mow her lawn and tells him where her house is. Dan mistakenly mows Bob's lawn next door. Dan has no contract to mow Bob's lawn, but Bob has been unjustly enriched based on Dan having mowed his lawn. In this case Dan would have an equitable claim of unjust enrichment against Bob for the value of his yard services mistakenly provided Bob.\n\nIn sum, any time someone receives the benefit from someone else's efforts, where the one providing the benefit **mistakenly** provides those services in good\\-faith, the one receiving the benefit has been unjustly enriched.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A software developer, Alice, mistakenly uploads a proprietary algorithm she developed for her previous employer to an open-source repository.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Unjust enrichment occurs when one party receives a benefit at the expense of another without a legal basis for retaining that benefit. In this case, the companies using the algorithm have received a benefit (the proprietary algorithm) without paying for it.\n\n2. The previous employer, as the rightful owner of the intellectual property, can claim unjust enrichment against the companies that have benefited from using the algorithm without permission or compensation.\n\n3. Alice's current employer is excluded from potential unjust enrichment claims because of the doctrine of \"unclean hands.\" They unknowingly benefited from their own employee's mistake, which complicates their position and likely prevents the previous employer from claiming unjust enrichment against them specifically.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because Alice's current employer did not create the algorithm and has no right to claim unjust enrichment against others.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because while Alice may be liable for damages, this doesn't preclude unjust enrichment claims against the benefiting companies.\n\n6. Option D is incorrect because the mistaken nature of the open-source upload doesn't negate the unjust enrichment that occurred.

She is a beautiful person whom I care about and I am, we are, in desperate need of help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Given there was no answer here, I will state what I know about child abuse response, but note I am not a lawyer nor am I in Illinois, so my statements are likely generalized for most US states (individual laws vary by state, and I reside in Pennsylvania).\n\nIn most US states, the police and child/youth services (that's what it's called in Pennsylvania but all states have similar services) work side by side and a complaint by the child to a police officer will have an emergency action taken to protect the child. The child is identified as a victim and the police and child/youth services have the obligation to protect the child and to keep them from harm. This is the main goal of police and children/youth services \\- to keep the child safe and act in the best interest of the child.\n\nUsually, a complaint to a child abuse center can take time to process. When a police complaint comes in it is more immediate, with police having more 'influence' with CYS (child/youth services). Especially when the child is in deadly danger (they were just stabbed, after all), the police may arrest the mother or abusive sibling or intervene therein to remove the child from the parents care with CYS\\-equivalent services working to find suitable alternative living situations for the child as a result of a order of removal/protection authorized by a judge. (PA at least had emergency situation response plans for these situations where a judge is just a phone call away).\n\nAs well, the child will likely be made a ward of the state if the courts determine the mother cannot care for the child or is a threat as such (not caring enough to stop the brother may count), insomuch that the child may be removed from the dangerous situation and placed in the care of a willing relative or if none can be found will be placed in temporary foster care in a safer environment.\n\nNote that nothing happens rapidly without the initial complaint to the police. At age 16 the child is likely going to be taken more seriously (compared to a 12 year old, for example), and has the right to be allowed to reach out to hospital staff to ask to speak to a police officer \\- otherwise it takes a child abuse complaint from someone who knows the child and situation and that can sometimes take longer to process (though, the distance factor in the original question may make a complaint from overseas given a lower priority due to not knowing the person on a more personal in\\-person level)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old in Chicago is hospitalized after being stabbed by her drug-using brother.

Given the complex legal and social welfare implications, what is the most appropriate immediate course of action to ensure the teenager's safety and well-being?\n\nA) Contact Child Protective Services and wait for their response within 2-3 weeks\nB) Advise the teenager to file a formal complaint with the local police department\nC) Recommend the teenager seek asylum at the nearest foreign embassy\nD) Suggest the teenager return home and attempt to reconcile with her family\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of multiple aspects of child protection and emergency response systems in the United States. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Immediacy of response: As stated in the documentation, \"When a police complaint comes in it is more immediate, with police having more 'influence' with CYS (child/youth services).\" This suggests that involving law enforcement is likely to prompt the quickest action.\n\n2. Severity of the situation: The teenager has been stabbed and faces potential homelessness, which constitutes an emergency requiring immediate intervention. The police are equipped to handle such urgent cases, especially those involving violence.\n\n3. Age factor: The documentation mentions that \"At age 16 the child is likely going to be taken more seriously,\" indicating that a police report from the teenager herself would be given significant weight.\n\n4. Integrated response: A police complaint would likely trigger a coordinated response involving both law enforcement and child/youth services, as the documentation states they \"work side by side.\"\n\n5. Legal protection: Filing a police complaint creates an official record of the abuse, which can be crucial for any subsequent legal proceedings or protective measures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because waiting 2-3 weeks for a response is not appropriate given the urgency of the situation. Option C is unrealistic and not a valid solution within the U.S. legal system.

There are other restrictions, as well, including on which patterns you can use (you can't use any clipart or patterns that depict an individual, for instance).\n\nThat answer masks a lot of gotchas, though. For one, you must set limits on the use of the t\\-shirt image. Consider this scenario: you do the image, make the t\\-shirts, and someone buys one. A third person sees the t\\-shirt and thinks it would make the perfect costume for a photograph. Recognizing your copyright in the t\\-shirt, he asks if he can put a model in your t\\-shirt and take a picture. On the language of the license, your answer must be, \"no.\" You do not have the right to sublicense the Corel clipart to the photographer, so you cannot authorize the photograph. Technically, you will need to be careful about using it in your online t\\-shirt store for this same reason: if you provide a final (non\\-downloadable) image for use in the store, you are probably fine. But if the store permits images to be downloaded and permanently stored, that use is forbidden.\n\nThe final image to be printed on the t\\-shirt, the clipart image, your intended and possible future uses of the final design, and much more information about the particular online t\\-shirt store would all be helpful in giving you a more complete answer.

Which of the following most accurately describes the legal landscape in this scenario?\n\nA) The pharmaceutical company has no liability protection because the vaccine only had EUA status when administered.\n\nB) The patient can only seek compensation through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) due to the liability immunity granted to the manufacturer.\n\nC) The pharmaceutical company's liability protection ended when the emergency declaration expired, allowing the patient to sue directly.\n\nD) The patient's ability to sue depends on whether the vaccine received full FDA approval within the three-year period.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because the documentation clearly states that liability immunity for manufacturers is granted through a declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, which covers products with Emergency Use Authorization. This immunity is not dependent on FDA approval status.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the information that immunity is granted even for products under EUA. Option C is a misconception; while the immunity does have an end date, it's not directly tied to the expiration of the emergency declaration, and the given scenario doesn't specify whether this period has ended. Option D is also incorrect, as the liability protection is not dependent on subsequent FDA approval.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of information about liability immunity, the conditions under which it's granted, and the alternative compensation mechanisms available to patients. It also addresses common misconceptions about the relationship between FDA approval status and manufacturer liability in emergency situations."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89479/can-a-researcher-use-youtube-videos-to-train-a-ml-model", "docs_id": 89479, "title": "Can a researcher use YouTube videos to train a ML model?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Manually migrating this from here because the answers were unsatisfactory: [https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26079/is\\-it\\-legal\\-to\\-scrape\\-youtube\\-videos\\-for\\-training\\-data](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26079/is-it-legal-to-scrape-youtube-videos-for-training-data)\n\nCan a machine learning researcher scrape youtube or use youtube videos/snippets of youtube videos to train a model?

Doing so might be a breach of contract. Some jurisdictions flat out ban surrogacy contracts (Arizona, D.C), perhaps even penalizes (Michigan, NY), or declares void (Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska). In California, surrogacy contracts are legal and enforceable. One possible challenging scenario is that the mother refuses a requested abortion, the other is that one or both of the intended parents seek to block the mother from getting an abortion. The former case in the case of [Melissa Cook](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1487/44751/20180426163111738_Cook%20v.%20Harding%20et%20al.%20Petition%20-%20Refile.pdf), where there was an attempt made to reduce the number of pregnancies from three \u2013 Cook carried the fetuses to term despite a contrary request from the intended parents (no action was filed to attempt to force an abortion). There has apparently been no attempted case to force a mother to carry a fetus to terms because of a contract (i.e. order for specific enforcement).\n\nUnder present US law, the woman carrying the fetus has the exclusive right to choose to terminate a pregnancy. No statutes or case law suggest that a surrogacy contract will override that right, and some laws explicitly deny the ability to force a mother to have an abortion (Utah Code Ann. \u00a778B\\-15\\-808(2\\) \\& (3\\), Tex.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, \"Under present US law, the woman carrying the fetus has the exclusive right to choose to terminate a pregnancy.\" This fundamental right applies to surrogates as well.\n\n2.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. At common law, \"pay when paid\" clauses are generally enforceable. The documentation states, \"At common law there is no prohibition such a term\" and explains that contracts are about risk allocation.\n\n2. The clause is not automatically unconscionable. The documentation mentions that unconscionability requires the term to be \"so onerous that no reasonable person would have agreed to it,\" which is not typically the case for \"pay when paid\" clauses.\n\n3.

How to? ... Is that a question really? Police should stop! Get another tank, a big excavator, fire a missile to it on a empty road or do whatever...\n is that good that he killed people, crashed machines and destroyed half the city??\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are various practical considerations such as the fact that a spike strip is not effective against a tank. The main legal reason is that in the US, a seizure (arrest) must be reasonable under existing interpretations of the 4th Amendment. A person has a constitutional right to his life and property, and police force potentially infringes that right. For example, stopping a jaywalker with a shotgun blast would be unreasonable force, and could open the government up to a section 1983 lawsuit (referring to [42 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983)). So while the police are motivated to protect lives and property and to enforce the law, their use of force has to be reasonable.\n\nThere is no mechanical procedure for determining, in any arbitrary instance, where the line is between reasonable and unreasonable force. The courts have determined that it is whatever force a reasonable officer would use in the given circumstances. More force is justified if the reasonable officer believe that he or others are in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, and lack of such a reasonable belief could lead to a protracted low\\-speed car chase to arrest a suspect. There are guidelines that help police make these decisions, see [this](https://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx) for example, and department will have specific rules about use of force. \n\nThere is a tradeoff between spending more time waiting for a suspect to stop, and using force to stop a vehicle. One way to stop a fleeing vehicle is with a spike strip, but that will destroy property and is likely to cause injury, so you need a policy. [Here](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Policy-and-Legislation/Vehicular-Pursuit/CORSA-Vehicular-Pursuit-Model-Policy.aspx) is a policy in Ohio, which begins by stating that\n\n> Due to the unique conditions within the community we serve the agency\n>  designee has determined that high speed pursuits are generally \n>  restricted to exigent circumstances, and when occurring are \n>  authorized and closely monitored by supervisors.\n\nSpike strips can be used in some circumstances, but not all.

What action would most likely be considered reasonable and legally justifiable for the police to take?\n\nA) Immediately use a spike strip to forcibly stop the vehicle\nB) Continue the pursuit indefinitely until the suspect voluntarily stops\nC) Use a police vehicle to perform a PIT maneuver, forcing the car off the road\nD) Gradually de-escalate the pursuit and switch to aerial surveillance if possible\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the balance between law enforcement and constitutional rights, the concept of reasonable force, and the specific considerations for vehicle pursuits.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that police must use reasonable force, balancing the need to apprehend suspects with the risk to public safety.\n\n2. The Ohio policy cited specifically mentions that \"high speed pursuits are generally restricted to exigent circumstances,\" which may not apply here given the relatively low-level crime (car theft) and lack of visible weapons.\n\n3. Entering a densely populated area increases the risk to public safety, which would likely prompt a reassessment of the pursuit's justification.\n\n4. De-escalation aligns with the principle of using the minimum force necessary, as outlined in the use of force continuum mentioned.\n\n5. Aerial surveillance allows continued tracking without the immediate dangers of a high-speed chase.\n\nOption A (spike strip) would likely be considered excessive given the circumstances and the policy's caution about their use. Option B (indefinite pursuit) ignores the increasing risk to public safety. Option C (PIT maneuver) would likely be seen as too aggressive given the known facts about the suspect and crime.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple principles from the documentation and critical thinking about proportional response in law enforcement."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27270/what-type-of-lawyer-do-i-need-for-suing-the-state", "docs_id": 27270, "title": "What type of lawyer do i need for suing the state?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So, let me get specific so I can get a more accurate answer. \n\nMy fiance's daughter had been in the custody of the State of Oregon for about 10 years.

Child support cannot be changed retroactively, even if the custody decision was wrong.\n\nIf his child was physically harmed (or, for example, raped) over that ten years, the child may have a cause of action for that harm which could be brought by the child when the child becomes an adult, or by a guardian appointed for the child. \n\nBut, no facts above suggest that this has happened, proving that the harm was caused by the wrongful actions of a responsible person (like a foster parent) rather than, for example, a fellow child in foster care, showing damages, and overcoming the qualified immunity of the persons who allegedly caused the harm, is pretty much an insurmountable barrier as well.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A family is considering legal action against the Department of Human Services (DHS) for a prolonged child custody case.

In reality, companies can discriminate in favor of certain users (like popular streamers) as long as it's not based on protected classes.\n\nOption C represents a grey area that might be considered misleading advertising, but isn't necessarily a direct breach of the ToS as stated.\n\nOption D is the correct answer because it represents a direct contradiction between the company's stated obligations in the ToS and their actions. If the company explicitly promises not to engage in real-world trading in their ToS, then doing so would be a breach of their own contract.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple concepts including contract law, discrimination in business practices, and the application of Terms of Service in online environments.

He has managed to escape from Iran to Canada legally with a work permit and also transfer the money he stole to Canada. Googling this case has no result since there is no treaty between the two countries. But I am sure there must be some way to bring the criminal back to justice. Especially because as long as he feels safe in Canada and is sure he will not be extradited, lives are in danger here (He pays people here to do the job for him).\n\nI am no lawyer, but as a citizen who has been involved in the issue for over a year, these are the only course of actions coming to my mind:\n\n* Contact the immigration authorities to prevent him from obtaining citizenship of Canada and extending the visa.\n* Try to contact the Canadian prosecutor and ask them to consider this case. Even though there is no treaty between the two countries, I believe it does not mean Canada wants to host dangerous Criminals and help them escape justice and the prosecutor might be willing to investigate at least.\n\nAm I thinking correctly?\nAny other suggestions?\n\nPlease consider that hiring a lawyer who is willing to charge me BEFORE I get my money back from this criminal (which is quite a considerable amount of money, well, basically, my whole 20 years of work savings!!), cannot be an option for me.

Typically applications for Visa or Work Permit include many question on your history including \"have you ever been convicted for a crime\". \n\nSo either he lied on the application or the Canada didn't care about his criminal record.

The documentation specifically mentions the possibility of immigration fraud if the criminal lied on their work permit application about their criminal history.\n3. Option B targets a potential violation of Canadian law, which Canadian authorities have jurisdiction over and interest in pursuing.\n4.

This method leverages several key principles of legal citation:\n\n1. It provides the highest authority by including the recent Supreme Court case, which is crucial in appellate argumentation.\n2. It demonstrates the continuity of the legal principle over time, showing that the concept has been reinforced rather than overturned or modified.\n3. It offers the benefits of a more recent precedent (the 2002 case in our example), which carries more weight in showing the current state of the law.\n4. By including both cases, it strengthens the argument by showing repeated precedent, effectively getting \"the weight of two judges for the price of one.\"\n5. It allows for the possibility that the more recent case may have refined or clarified the principle, providing a more nuanced or applicable statement of the law.\n\nThis approach requires the integration of multiple concepts from legal reasoning and citation practices, applying them to a real-world scenario that a junior lawyer might face.

That adds $75 to your taxable income.\n\nSay you charge a full rate of $100 and take a $25 charity tax deduction. That nets out to adding $75 to your taxable income, *same outcome*, **except the $25 is in peril, due to the complexities of the tax law.** For instance:\n\n* Charity deductions give no tax benefit at all until you achieve $12,000 of itemized deductions (from donations and mortgage interest, certain state taxes, certain medical expenses etc.) Deem that unfair *(we at charities certainly do!)* but the fact is, it's because you *already* get a $12,000 standard deduction as a 'gimme'.\\*\n* If you're a huge donor (I am *on certain years*, thanks DAF), you can only deduct 50% of income (with carryforwards, yay). Your donation\\-back reduces that. Doing it direct adds $75 to AGI ($37\\.50 to deduction limit), so you can deduct donations of $37\\.50 *to other charities*. The donation\\-back adds $100 to AGI (adding $50 to donation limit) **except $25 of that is spoken for by the donation\\-back**, leaving only $25 left.\n\nSo I consider the maneuver to be a \"lose lose\" unless you have some bizarre tax reason for wanting to do that.\n\nFurther, such an arrangement is likely to draw scrutiny from the IRS.\n\nBy the way, here's an origin concept.\n-------------------------------------\n\nIRS waives taxes on value which you create by your own DIY labor\\*. Say you mow your own lawn at an annualized cost of $100/year (lawnmower depreciaton and fuel) instead of $1100/year to hire it done. You created $1000 of value \"from the sweat of your brow\". **IRS's policy is not to treat that as income, and thus, not to tax that**.\n\nThus, when you are a craftsman, IRS views *the sale of service* as the taxable event, not the crafting itself.\n\nSimilarly, when you do volunteer work for a charity, \"the sweat of your brow\" does not create a cash value of interest to the IRS *in either direction*.\n\nReally, when you are a craftsman offering services, and you do services for a charity, that is considered volunteer labor.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\\* This used to only be about $5000, but Trump was keen on a postcard\\-sized tax form, so they folded the adult \"personal exemption\" into the standard deduction, removing 2 lines on the 1040 form.

Option A is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It simplifies the transaction and avoids potential IRS scrutiny.\n2. The documentation states that offering services at a discounted rate to a charity is essentially considered volunteer labor.\n3.

POTUS, Congress and state governors can do it, to some extent. Art. 1, \u00a79 (speaking of powers denied to Congress) says that \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\". Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus is one fundamental element of \"martial law\". Art. 2 \u00a72 (presidential powers) grants relatively little power to POTUS, but does say \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States\", so as commander in chief, POTUS can command the army, but in general requires authorization from Congress.\n\nAt the outset of the Civil War, Lincoln declared a numbered of things which Congress ratified, but this did not include a declaration of martial law. In [Ex parte Merryman](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F.Cas/0017.f.cas/0017.f.cas.0144.3.html), 17 F. Cas. 144, the Taney (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States) stated that \"the president, under the constitution of the United States, cannot suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, nor authorize a military officer to do it\". Congress eventually retroactively legalized the suspension of habeas corpus. Without Congressional approval of the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, a \"declaration of martial law\" would be meaningless and toothless.\n\nThe [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) further limits the ability of the army to meddle in domestic affair, and [18 USC 1385](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385) states that\n\n> Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized\n> by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the\n> Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the\n> laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two\n> years, or both.\n\nOne of authorizations by Congess is [The Enforcement Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Acts), which empowered federal intervention when states refused to protect the constitutional rights of citizens, and this was invoked more recently during the Eisenhower administration and in connection with the Mississippi Burning murders. Another much older authorization is the [Insurrection Act of 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act_of_1807), now at [10 USC Ch. 13](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-13) allows use of the military (\u00a7252\\):\n\n> Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions,\n> combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of\n> the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the\n> United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial\n> proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of\n> any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary\n> to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\n\nThe next section [\u00a7253](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/253) would, no doubt, be the statutory provision invoked for use of the military:\n\n> The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or\n> by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary\n> to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful\n> combination, or conspiracy, if it\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the\n> United States within the State, that any part or class of its people\n> is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in\n> the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities\n> of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right,\n> privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United\n> States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\n> \n> \n> In any situation covered by clause (1\\), the State shall be considered\n> to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the\n> Constitution.\n\nThe rhetoric that would need to be associated with such an executive order (sending in the troops) would resemble that in Texas v. Pennsylvania et al, which did not turn out well for POTUS. Moreover, nothing at all authorizes POTUS to declare elections void and to order new elections (therefore, the military cannot be employed to engage in such an illegal action).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical scenario where a sitting U.S. President claims widespread election fraud and seeks to declare martial law to oversee new elections in battleground states, which of the following legal and constitutional obstacles would be the most significant barrier to such an action?\n\nA) The Posse Comitatus Act's restrictions on using military forces for domestic law enforcement\nB) The President's limited authority to unilaterally suspend habeas corpus without Congressional approval\nC) The lack of explicit constitutional or statutory authority for the President to nullify and rerun state-administered elections\nD) The Insurrection Act's requirement for a clear state of rebellion or insurrection to justify federal military intervention\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options present significant legal obstacles, option C represents the most fundamental barrier to the proposed action. The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes do not grant the President authority to unilaterally nullify state-administered elections or order new ones, even under martial law. This absence of authority is the most direct challenge to the hypothetical scenario.\n\nOption A (Posse Comitatus Act) is relevant but can be circumvented through exceptions like the Insurrection Act. Option B (habeas corpus suspension) is a serious concern but doesn't directly address the election issue. Option D (Insurrection Act requirements) presents a high bar but could potentially be argued in extreme circumstances.\n\nThe lack of authority to interfere with state elections (C) is the most insurmountable obstacle because it goes to the heart of federalism and separation of powers. Even if martial law were declared, there's no legal mechanism for the President to order new elections. This would require either a constitutional amendment or new federal legislation, neither of which the President can unilaterally enact.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, integration of constitutional principles with statutory law, and application to a complex real-world scenario.

The correct answer is C because using the UUID to track user behavior across multiple devices for personalized content would likely make the UUID personal data under GDPR.\n\nThe key consideration, as mentioned in the documentation, is whether the data controller or another person can use the data \"with means reasonably likely to be used\" to identify a natural person. In this case, tracking user behavior and creating personalized content implies that the UUID is being used to build a profile of an individual, even if their name is not known. This makes the UUID identifiable information and thus subject to GDPR.\n\nOption A is less likely to require GDPR compliance as sharing UUIDs voluntarily doesn't necessarily make them identifiable.\n\nOption B is a gray area but less likely to trigger GDPR requirements than C, as simply knowing a user's country doesn't typically allow for identification.\n\nOption D is tricky because while it involves more data, if the company truly cannot access or link this data to individuals (due to encryption and local storage), it might not fall under GDPR.

Even just being able to check whether one person has a registered account raises the issue.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the EU GDPR (or in the UK, the UK GDPR as defined in sections [3(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/3) and [205(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/205) of the Data Protection Act 2018\\) are (emphasis added):\n\n> Article 4(2\\): **'processing\u2019 means** any operation or set of\n> operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal\n> data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,\n> recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or\n> alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, **disclosure by transmission,\n> dissemination or otherwise making available**, alignment or combination,\n> restriction, erasure or destruction\n\nSo, disclosure of the fact that a user has a registered account amounts to \"processing\".\n\n> Article 6(1\\): **Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that\n> at least one of the following applies:**  \n> \n> (a) the data subject has given **consent** to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;  \n> \n> (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a **contract** to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;  \n> \n> (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a **legal obligation** to which the controller is subject;   \n> \n> (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the **vital interests** of the data subject or of another natural person;  \n> \n> (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the **public interest** or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;  \n> \n> (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the **legitimate interests** pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nOf these, only (a) and (f) are likely to be of any relevance:\n\n* (a) is not too useful since it isn't feasible to design a sign\\-up system that depends on the user's consent (which they may not give).\n* That leaves us with (f). As noted by the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/), \"*Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always be the most appropriate. It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people\u2019s data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.*\".\n\nThe legitimate interest here would be that you need a sign up system which prevents duplicate registrations. Remember though that the processing has to be \"*necessary*\" for the purposes of the legitimate interest. One might argue that it is not since you could design the system to give the appearance of accepting the duplicate registration followed by sending an email to the account holder to inform them. On the other hand this will result in a less user friendly experience which could itself be a legitimate interest.\n\nUltimately this is a balancing exercise and it is hard to say whether you have struck the right balance until someone complains to the ICO or the court and a decision is issued. The fact that the practice is widespread among well\\-resourced and large companies would tend to indicate that it is lawful albeit this is not conclusive in the absence of a court decision. I'm not aware of any cases involving this particular issue but would be interested to hear from others on this point.\n\nIf the processing is unlawful then Article 18 is applicable:\n\n> 1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: \\[...]\n> (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the\n> erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use\n> instead\n> 2.

Of particular relevance here are the following items:\n\n> Article 13(1\\): Where personal data relating to a data subject are\n> collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time\n> when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of\n> the following information: \\[...] (c) the purposes of the processing\n> for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis\n> for the processing; (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of\n> Article 6(1\\), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by\n> a third party;\n\nSo even if you conclude that the processing will be lawful you will have to give some consideration to the basis so that you can comply with the above provision.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a new user authentication system for a popular e-commerce platform.

Furthermore, state and local regulatory officials often make judgment calls in deciding whether these licensing and/or permit requirements apply to a particular operation.

Thus, the states and the federal government would be free to pass laws banning abortion, if they so choose.\n\nI think many Americans would be surprised to learn that if Roe v Wade were overturned, it wouldn't mean abortion is automatically outlawed throughout the land. It means every state and the federal government would have the opportunity to make its own laws about it.

Does the Supreme Court ever rule that something is prohibited, or only protected/not protected?**\n\nNot exactly sure how this could go down anyway. The Supreme Court doesn't write laws, and a prohibition on abortion would have to involve not only the prohibitory statement itself, but also exact definitions, sentencing mandates, parole guidelines, etc. This sounds more like the state legal codes on homicide (first\\-degree murder, premeditated murder, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, accidental homicide, accessory to murder, etc.) than a Supreme Court ruling.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no higher court which can overturn a SCOTUS decision, so in theory (or, imaginarily) they can rule any way they please. The ruling could then be overturned by a later court, as happened in [these cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_overruled_United_States_Supreme_Court_decisions). However, justices of the Supreme Court can be impeached (impeachment is not subject to judicial review), so the individuals responsible for such a ruling could be impeached. Or, if the sitting president is favorable and the enabling legislation has been passed, additional members of the Supreme could be added, as was unsuccessfully attempted during the Roosevelt administration.\n\nThe court could not write specific enforceable statutes defining the crime and imposing a penalty. They could rule that there is such\\-and\\-such right which is protected by the Cconstitution, and that that right must be protected by the states (for instance, a state may not pass a law that prohibits practicing the Pastafarian religion). It would be unprecedented, though, for SCOTUS to order a legislature to pass particular legislation. That would not mean that a ruling could not be written which mandated that, but it would be a huge break from tradition and a clear breach of the separation of powers. Legislatures could respond \"[they have made their decision; now let them enforce it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia)\".\n\nDecades ago, existing state death penalty laws were [declared unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia) as defective with respect to the 8th Amendment, meaning that there was no death penalty in many states for some time. Homicide statutes could likewise be struck down *en masse*, perhaps as an Equal Rights violation, which would means that either homicide is now legal, or the Equal Rights violation in those statutes must be eliminated. All that SCOTUS would have to do is rule that a fetus is a person. Recall [Roe v. Wade](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/410/113.html):\n\n> If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case,\n>  of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be\n>  guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.\n\nA model for how this might take place is [McCleary v.Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCleary_v._Washington), where the Washington Supreme Court ordered the legislature to act to fund public education, on constitutional grounds that the legislature has an obligation to do certain things.

Which of the following best represents the legal principle underlying her decision and its implications for international treaty interpretation in UK courts?\n\nA) The principle of parliamentary sovereignty, suggesting that only domestically enacted laws are binding on UK courts\nB) The doctrine of treaty supremacy, implying that international treaties should always override domestic legislation\nC) The concept of judicial activism, indicating that judges have broad discretion to interpret treaties independently of legislation\nD) The principle of implied repeal, suggesting that newer domestic laws automatically supersede older international treaties\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Judge Baraitser's ruling is based on the well-established principle of parliamentary sovereignty in the UK legal system. This principle asserts that domestic legislation enacted by Parliament is the supreme law of the land, and international treaties do not automatically become part of domestic law unless specifically incorporated through an Act of Parliament.\n\nIn this case, the judge dismissed the defense's argument about the extradition treaty prohibiting extradition for political offenses because this provision was not included in the UK's domestic Extradition Act. This decision reflects the view that UK courts are primarily bound by and must apply domestic law, not unincorporated treaty provisions.\n\nThe ruling demonstrates the complex relationship between international obligations and domestic law in the UK. It highlights that while treaties may inform the context or spirit of legislation, they are not directly enforceable in UK courts unless explicitly incorporated into domestic law by Parliament.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the legal principles at play, understanding of the UK's dualist approach to international law, and consideration of the implications for treaty interpretation in the UK legal system.

The company's interest is in getting new clients, and in preventing giving rewards to spurious referrals, that is ones which were not genuine potential new business. Referring yourself (via the subterfuge of using a joint account that you have) would not be bringing in new business; nor would getting family (including \"same household\"). The first interpretation limits the prohibition of referrals to just \"yourself\", and fails to include a prohibition against referring all of your aunts, cousins and roommates (which they assume, reasonably enough, are not actual potential new customers). Furthermore, there is no sensible meaning to \"referring yourself via a family member\". This would mean having a family member tell you that you should do business with Company B.\n\nThere may be some stylistic preference for adding a comma before \"or\", but it is perfectly interpretable as it stands.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The clause's intent is clear when considering the company's goal of acquiring genuine new business. Despite its awkward phrasing, the clause aims to prevent rewards for referrals that don't bring in actual new clients.\n\n2. The second interpretation provided in the documentation (\"You cannot refer: yourself via a joint account; a family member; or a member of the same household\") is the most logical parsing of the clause.

The correct answer, C, is the most strategic initial response because:\n\n1. It addresses the key issue raised in the documentation about determining the authority of the copyright claim. As stated, \"A person or entity making a copyright claim need not respond to a request or 'demand' that s/he establish ownership of the copyright or authority to represent the owner.\" However, requesting this information is a prudent first step.\n\n2. It leverages the fact that in the US, \"before filing suit, the copyright must be registered, and the records of such registrations are public.\" By requesting proof of registration, the business owner can verify the legitimacy of the claim.\n\n3. It doesn't commit the business owner to any action or admission of guilt, unlike options A and D.\n\n4. It's more proactive than option B, which could lead to legal complications if the claim is legitimate.\n\n5. This approach forces the claiming company to provide evidence, potentially exposing copyright trolls who may not have the authority they claim.\n\n6. If the company fails to provide proof, it doesn't automatically estop them from pursuing the claim in court, but it does create a record of due diligence on the part of the business owner.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking and application of legal concepts in a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple pieces of information from the documentation."}, "91": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80476/recourse-to-public-funds-as-a-legal-aid-eligibility-criteria", "docs_id": 80476, "title": "Recourse to public funds as a legal aid eligibility criteria?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example, What is the overlap or general relationship between \"no recourse to public funds\" and eligibility for legal aid?\n\nIs legal aid encompassed by NRPF?

Option D is incorrect as file hosting services are not universally exempt from data logging regulations or false advertising laws.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the provided information, integration of multiple legal concepts, and application to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere recall."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78717/memberships-can-be-canceled-without-reason-and-without-refund", "docs_id": 78717, "title": "Memberships can be canceled without reason and without refund?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a club that sells paid memberships. In the application, it says upfront that the club can cancel memberships at any time, without reason and without giving a refund.\n\nIs this really an enforceable contract? Is it possible it could be unconscionable that one side has essentially 100% power and the other side has no recourse?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Two essential elements of a contract are that each part gives something of value (such as money, or whatever the club has to offer), and each part has an obligation (the member must give money and do certain things, the club must allow the member to use the facility). Without these elements there is no contract, meaning that the \"member\" has no obligation to pay (and the courts will then order the return of the membership payment). If indeed the club can revoke membership at any time and for no cause, there is no contract and no legal justification for the club to keep your money.\n\nThe status of social clubs is not entirely clear, and it's not clear whether \"membership\" is a contractual matter, however an organization like Elks is a corporation, and state laws regulate expulsion of members of a corporation. They will typically require termination that is fair and reasonable and is carried out in good faith, as discussed in [this article](https://www.wardandsmith.com/articles/Private-Country-and-Social-Clubs-Member-Discipline-and-Expulsion). In the cited cases where a person was expelled, it was for violation of the rules. It is unlikely that corporate laws of any state allow unilateral expulsion of a member for no cause.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A local fitness club offers annual memberships with a clause stating they can cancel memberships at any time without reason or refund. A member is unexpectedly expelled mid-year without cause. Which of the following legal arguments would be most effective in challenging this action?\n\nA) The club's cancellation policy violates consumer protection laws and is automatically void.\nB) The contract lacks mutuality of obligation, potentially rendering it unenforceable.\nC) Social clubs are exempt from standard contract law and can set their own membership rules.\nD) The member implicitly agreed to potential cancellation by signing the application.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of contract law principles and their application to the specific scenario of club memberships. The most effective argument is B, focusing on the lack of mutuality of obligation. As explained in the documentation, a valid contract requires both parties to have obligations. If the club can cancel at any time without reason or refund, they effectively have no obligation, which undermines the basic structure of a contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the policy may seem unfair, it's not automatically void under consumer protection laws. These laws vary, and the mere existence of an imbalanced clause doesn't necessarily violate them.\n\nOption C is incorrect and represents a common misconception. While social clubs have some unique legal considerations, they are not exempt from basic contract law principles, especially when it comes to paid memberships.\n\nOption D is a weak argument because simply signing an application doesn't necessarily make all terms enforceable, especially if the underlying agreement lacks the essential elements of a valid contract.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the documentation's statement that \"Without these elements there is no contract, meaning that the 'member' has no obligation to pay (and the courts will then order the return of the membership payment).\" This question tests the application of contract law principles to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking about legal enforceability."}}
