I know next to nothing about Canadian law and can't speak on that.\n\nFalsely claiming to have a license to practice medicine is probably illegal, depending on circumstances, and practicing medicine without a license is most certainly illegal, and there a numerous federal and state laws that would apply. But simply styling one's self as *Dr.* is unlikely to be held by a court as a claim to hold a medical license, or a particular degree.\n\nIt's, of course, misleading and generally frowned to use the *Dr.* prefix unless one has earned an MD or PhD. Some holders of honorary doctorates use it as well, though some debate whether that's acceptable or not.",

According to the information provided, there are no specific legal restrictions on using the title \"Doctor\" in the United States. While it may be misleading and frowned upon to use \"Dr.\" without an MD or PhD, it is not inherently illegal. However, practicing medicine without a license is illegal, as are false claims of holding a medical license. The key distinction is between using a title (which is generally not restricted) and engaging in medical practice or making false claims about qualifications (which are regulated and can be illegal). Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they suggest stricter regulations on the use of the title than actually exist in the US."

What happened was:\n\n* IOC agreed to sell 5,000 tons of salt to Mumtazzudin.\n* Atlas paid IOC for the salt on behalf of Mumtazzudin. Because Atlas paid, Atlas received the bills of lading. Thus, the salt was [pledged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_(law)) to Atlas to secure the money owed by Mumtazzudin.\n* Atlas endorsed the bills of lading over to Chabbra for value. In other words, Atlas sold Chabbra the right to be repaid by Mumtazzudin, and to take delivery of the salt as security for the debt.\n* Mumtazzudin persuaded the shipowner to hand over the salt without presenting the bill of lading.\n* Chabbra sued the shipowner for conversion (destroying the value of its security).\n\nWhat does \u201crefused to redeem the pledge when the bills of lading were tendered to them by Chabbra\u201d mean?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChabbra, as the pledgee of the bills of lading, was entitled to possession of the salt, until Mumtazzudin \u201credeemed the pledge\u201d by paying Chabbra the amount originally advanced by Atlas.

This action led to a breach of the pledge agreement between Chabbra (who held the bills of lading) and the buyers. As a result, Chabbra sued the ship owners for conversion, as their action effectively destroyed the value of Chabbra's security (the pledged bills of lading). \n\nOption A is incorrect because the initial payment for the salt was made by Atlas on behalf of the buyers. \nOption B is incorrect because the ship owners did release the cargo, but improperly without the bills of lading. \nOption C is incorrect because Chabbra held valid bills of lading as security for the transaction. \nOption D is correct and accurately describes the key issue that led to the legal dispute."

I am wondering about this, what about suspected planes from private companies or other countries. Can a private company or country sue for damage? Let's assume the country is the United States.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you're looking for is a convention, in international law, that governs international aviation, the [Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation](https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_9ed.pdf). Article 3 says\n\n> (a) This Convention shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, and\n> shall not be applicable to state aircraft.\n> \n> \n> (b) Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall be\n> deemed to be state aircraft.\n> \n> \n> (c) No state aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the\n> territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by a\n> special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms\n> thereof.\n\nArticle 1 also says that\n\n> The contracting States recognize that every State has complete\n> and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory\n\nThere is no separate international law governing the treatment of state aircraft entering the airspace of a nation without permission: the convention is entirely about protecting civil aircraft. From the recognition of sovereignty of the nation over its airspace and the absence of provisions protecting state aircraft, you may conclude that a nation has the \"right\" to shoot down state aircraft over\\-flying without permission. There are rules to the effect that a civil aircraft may be required to land, as opposed to shooting it down.\n\nAn aircraft operated by a private company (e.g. Delta airlines) might sue the government of a nation that shot its plane out of the sky, in contravention of the convention. However, the convention does not create a right to sue a government, so if a civil aircraft were shot down for incursion into a nation's airspace, there may or may not be a right to sue depending on the law of the relevant nations. In the case of the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, [a lawsuit *has* been filed](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e2c96399357e236fda551a5/t/5e2cb3696db1421c54669dab/1579987817799/SOC2020.pdf/) against Iran, in Ontario Superior Court. Given sovereign immunity, it is generally unlikely that a government can be successfully sued for shooting down a civil aircraft, unless there is a law allowing such lawsuits (like the US Federal Tort Claims Act)",

The U.S. government decides to shoot it down. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The U.S. government has violated international law and can be sued by the foreign country in the International Court of Justice.\n\nB) The U.S. government is protected by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and cannot face any legal consequences.\n\nC) The U.S. government has acted within its sovereign rights, but the foreign country may seek diplomatic resolutions or sanctions through international bodies.\n\nD) The foreign country can successfully sue the U.S. government in U.S. federal court under the Federal Tort Claims Act for damages to the aircraft.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation primarily governs civil aircraft and explicitly excludes state aircraft (including military aircraft) from its protections. Article 1 of the Convention recognizes that every state has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. There is no separate international law governing the treatment of state aircraft entering a nation's airspace without permission.\n\nTherefore, the U.S. government's action to shoot down an unauthorized foreign military aircraft in its airspace falls within its sovereign rights. However, this doesn't mean there are no potential consequences. The foreign country may seek diplomatic resolutions or push for sanctions through international bodies like the United Nations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the action doesn't violate international law, the ICJ might still hear a case if both countries consent to its jurisdiction.\n\nOption B is wrong because the Chicago Convention doesn't protect military aircraft or the actions taken against them.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Federal Tort Claims Act generally doesn't apply to foreign governments, and sovereign immunity would likely protect the U.S. government from such a lawsuit."

While examining the computer, the officer discovers an unencrypted spreadsheet containing Doe's usernames and passwords for various online accounts, including cloud storage services. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the officer's ability to access these online accounts?\n\nA) The officer can immediately access all of Doe's online accounts using the discovered passwords without any additional legal requirements.\n\nB) The officer needs to obtain a new search warrant specifically for each online account before accessing them.\n\nC) The officer can access only the accounts that are explicitly mentioned in the original search warrant.\n\nD) The officer needs to obtain a new search warrant to access any online accounts not covered by the scope of the original warrant.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The original search warrant likely covers the physical premises and items within it, including the computer and its contents. However, online accounts, especially those hosted on external servers (like cloud storage), are typically considered outside the scope of a warrant for physical premises. \n\nThe discovery of passwords does not automatically grant legal authority to access accounts not specified in the original warrant. To maintain the integrity of the investigation and respect Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches, the officer would need to obtain a new warrant specifically authorizing access to these online accounts. \n\nThis new warrant would be based on the probable cause established by discovering the password list. It ensures that the scope of the search remains within legal bounds and protects against potential challenges to the admissibility of evidence in court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it disregards the legal requirement for specific authorization to access accounts not covered by the original warrant. Option B is overly restrictive, as a single new warrant could potentially cover multiple accounts. Option C is incorrect because the original warrant likely doesn't explicitly mention online accounts, and even if it did, it wouldn't automatically cover accounts not specifically listed."

What are the rules regarding foreign ownership of real estate in Mexico now? Did any other rules regarding the rights of foreigners to participate in the Mexican economy change at the same time? Is this decided on a state by state basis in Mexico, or is this based upon national law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The current law in Mexico is that noncitizens are not allowed to buy property in the *restricted zone*, but they are allowed to buy property in the interior. The following two sites give details. Of course an expert in Mexican law should be consulted first. This appears to be subject to Mexican federal law.\n\n[Foreign Ownership of Property in Mexico](http://blueroadrunner.com/ownprop.htm) has a copyright date of 2002\\-2017 so it seems to be up to date and discusses the arrangements required to get a long term lease within the *restricted zone*.\n\n> The Mexican Constitution regulates the ownership of land and declares\n>  that ...within a zone of 100 kilometers from the border or 50\n>  kilometers from the coast, a foreigner cannot acquire the direct\n>  ownership of the land.

Mexican law allows foreigners to directly own property in the interior of the country. However, in the \"restricted zone\" (within 100 kilometers from borders or 50 kilometers from coastlines), foreigners cannot directly own property. Instead, they must use a fiduciary trust known as a fideicomiso to hold the property. This arrangement allows foreigners to effectively control and benefit from the property without violating constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership in sensitive areas. Option A is incorrect because there are restrictions in the restricted zone. Option B is too extreme and doesn't reflect the nuanced reality of the law. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't acknowledge that direct ownership is possible in the interior of Mexico."

And there probably is CA case law specific to roommates and contracts and civil statutes of limitation; I'll give someone else on LSE a chance to search for relevant cases and post that.\n\nYou are solely responsible to the utility company since you are named on the account (which I assume is the reason for your question), unless you are married. But if the roommates were sent bills \\- either in letters or simply posted in notes the door of the fridge \\- in the past and they paid them, and you have records of those payments, you can argue that they formalized the contract they had with you concerning the percentage of the utilities they paid while they were living there, and have now broken the contract for the utilities when they were residents. This also goes for rent payments; by paying rent, they formalized the contract they had for room rent and living there.\n\nBroken contracts are civil matters, and there are varying statutes of limitations for contracts; and those limits can depend of the last date of the roommates' residence and the bills you sent, and also the date of any civil filing you may do.\n\nRe: your question: it's not really personal injury, and it's not really rent, either, though I guess in a legal sense, utility bills could be associated with rent. (That is, unless part of your dispute really does concern rent).\n\nDepending on your interpretations (and the court's, too if you end up there), it's more likely either or both of these statutes:\n\n> Contracts: Written: 4 yrs. \u00a7337; Oral: 2 yrs.

It seems to me to be one of the following:\n\n1. To grant powers to the monarch\n\nDue to the language in the act, this was my initial interpretation. My understanding is, however, that the monarch would automatically have the named power unless there was some specific pre\\-existing law restricting such. Was this the case?\n\n2. To grant powers to the Privy Council\n\nThis was my second interpretation. The use of the text \"by and with the advice of the Privy Council\" suggests to me that this act may be a way of formalising the use of this power by the monarch under the request of the Privy Council.\n\n3. To restrict the powers of the monarch\n\nThe act states \"His Majesty may issue his Proclamation for the meeting of Parliament in not less than 14 Days from the Date\", perhaps meaning that the act only intends to take the monarch's existing power and prevent it from being used under certain circumstances?\n\nWhich interpretation(s) are correct (if any)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As originally enacted, this Act was named:\n\n> An Act to shorten the Time now required for giving Notice of the Royal Intention of his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, that the Parliament shall meet and be holden for the Dispatch of Business, and more effectually to provide for the Meeting of Parliament in the case of a Demise of the Crown.\n\nand the relevant provision was:\n\n> That whenever his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, shall be pleased, by and with the Advice of the Privy Council of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, to issue his or their Royal Proclamation, giving Notice of his or their Royal Intention that Parliament shall meet and be holden for the Dispatch of Business on any Day being not less than fourteen Days from the Date of such Proclamation, the same shall be a full and sufficient Notice to all Persons whatever of such the Royal Intention of his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and the Parliament shall thereby stand prorogued to the Day and Place therein declared, notwithstanding any previous Prorogation of the Parliament to any longer Day, and notwithstanding any former Law, Usage, or Practice to the contrary.\n\nThe Act is about \"prorogation\", which is a formal end to the Parliamentary session. Between general elections, there can be several sessions, each beginning with a King's Speech announcing the planned business.\n\nIt was within the power of the Crown to declare a prorogation to a named date. Parliament could not meet, and therefore could not pass laws and so on, until that date came around. The 1797 Act is saying that during that interval, the Crown can decide that Parliament can come back early. The new date must be fourteen or more days in the future, but can be before the originally named date.\n\nBefore this Act, there was a limited power to shorten the prorogation in case of certain emergencies. The Militia Act 1786 was an example (consolidating several earlier statutes), saying that in cases of \"actual Invasion or upon imminent Danger thereof, and in all Cases of Rebellion or Insurrection\", the King could call out the militia and also summon Parliament back if they were adjourned or prorogued. There does not seem to have been a general prerogative power to shorten a prorogation. See Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" (1800 ed.), vol. 1, footnote on [p. 187](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England/uEcOAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA187-IA2).\n\nThe Act therefore *does* give a new general power, because it is not limited to extreme emergencies. But it also *does* restrict royal authority, because the formula \"by and with the Advice\" means that the King is not the decision\\-maker: it's an action controlled by the government of the day.",

This is evident from several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The Act allowed for Parliament to be reconvened earlier than the originally prorogued date, which was not generally possible before except in extreme emergencies.\n\n2. It required the action to be taken \"by and with the Advice of the Privy Council,\" indicating that the decision was controlled by the government of the day, not solely by the monarch.\n\n3. It set a minimum notice period of 14 days, which balanced the need for flexibility with the need for adequate notice.\n\n4. Unlike previous acts like the Militia Act 1786, it wasn't limited to specific emergency scenarios, making it a more general power.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Act did not grant absolute power to the monarch, but rather required advice from the Privy Council. Option B is partially true but misses the main purpose of the Act, which was to provide flexibility, not to restrict. Option C is incorrect because it still required royal proclamation, not unilateral Privy Council action. Option D correctly captures the primary intent and mechanism of the Act."

The rental is a high value one (around \u00a34000/month) and the property is large, and fully detached. The initial tenancy is for 12 months. The property is rented basically unfurnished, with only a couple of items on the inventory, and our tenancy agreement grants us full use of it and its grounds.\n\nThe landlord lives abroad and operates through a local estate agent.\n\nWhen we viewed the property, we noted that the two garages and an adjacent storage room (which they call \"the basement\") were largely filled with the landlord's personal items \\- old exercise equipment, construction materials left over from building renovation, crates of old toys etc. We were assured by the agent that anything we didn't want to use would be removed. We subsequently made an offer, signed the tenancy agreement and begun our tenancy.\n\nWe collected all of the landlord's leftover personal items into one of the two garages, and requested our agent to collect them as agreed. However, we were then told that the landlord did not wish for some of their items to be removed. The agent copied us in, very unprofessionally, on an email from the landlord, where she said she was very upset that the tenant had gone through their basement and moved their personal items \\- and that they were to be moved back into the basement.\n\nWe replied and made it very clear that we did not agree to store the landlord's personal items in any part of our property, and that this was not part of our tenancy agreement. We also stated that if the landlord wished to store their personal items in the basement or other parts of the property, then that would have to be through a separate arrangement with us. We gave a date by which we would like these items removed, and finally pointed out that we are very concerned that we do not have full use of the property that we are paying for.\n\nThe agent acknowledged this, but have nevertheless now removed only a selection of the landlord's items, telling us that the landlord has instructed them to return the rest to the basement. At this point one of our garages is half filled with crates of the landlord's personal rubbish and unable to be used as a garage. None of this stuff is mentioned on the inventory.\n\nWe would really prefer not to burn bridges with our landlord and the agent by resorting to legal threats at this stage if we can avoid it, as we really like the house and would like to continue living there \\- but we would also really not give up some of our limited space to store the landlord's crap for free!\n\nWhat are our options in this situation, and what's our legal position? I have come across some sources stating that this sort of situation counts as partial eviction, due to the landlord denying us use of / access to some of the property \\- is that accurate?

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am considering applying for a trademark. The trademark I would like to register is the product name of a product that I am importing and selling. The name is an invented word (e.g. something to the effect of Bubbaloobaloobaloo), which is obviously neither descriptive of the product's character, depending on what you consider to constitute its character, nor its function. However, after first reading the Canadian Intellectual Property Office's [Trademarks Guide](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02360.html#understanding), and then quite a bit of the [Trademark Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/t-13/FullText.html), I am still uncertain as to whether or not the trademark is even registrable. Depending on the interpretation of a few particular clauses, I may be wasting my money if I apply.\n\nWith respect to filling out the application, the Trademark Act states in [30(2\\)(a) and 30(3\\)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/t-13/page-9.html#h-450811), \"The application shall contain a statement in ordinary commercial terms of the goods or services in association with which the trademark is used or proposed to be used; The goods or services referred to in paragraph (2\\)(a) are to be grouped according to the classes of the Nice Classification, each group being preceded by the number of the class of the Nice Classification to which that group of goods or services belongs and presented in the order of the classes of the Nice Classification.\" In addition to that, the Trademarks Guide provides the following example,\n\n\"Statement of goods and services\n\n\"Class 25\n\"Blouses, sweaters, pants, skirts, socks, underwear and pyjamas.\n\n\"Class 35\n\"Operation of an online retail clothing store; operation of an online retail jewellery store.\"\n\nIn the example, every single \"ordinary commercial term\" listed under 'Class 25' is provided the Nice Classification system, whereas only bits and pieces of the \"ordinary commercial terms\" listed under 'Class 35' can be found in the suggestions provided by the Nice Classification system. In light of all this, I am led to believe that \"ordinary commercial terms\" should be at least loosely interpreted for the most part as 'terms provided by the Nice Classification system', but I cannot be absolutely sure...\n\nNow on to the real issue.\n\nUnder the section 'What You Can't Register' of the Trademarks Guide, the examples it provides for 'Words in Other Languages' with respect to section [12(1\\)(c)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/t-13/page-7.html#h-450601) of the Trademark Act entitled 'Registrable Trademarks' are as follows, \"You would not be able to register the word 'gelato' (Italian for 'ice cream') in association with frozen confections; 'anorak' (Inuktitut for 'parka') in association with outerwear; or 'wurst' (German for 'sausage') in association with meat.\" The legislation merely states, \"A trademark is registrable if it is not the name in any language of any of the goods or services in connection with which it is used or proposed to be used.\"\n\nThe big question presents itself: Does the product name or the corresponding \"ordinary commercial terms\" provided by the Nice Classification constitute the \"name of the goods\"?\n\nI would really appreciate another perspective. Can anybody weigh in on this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does the product name or the corresponding \"ordinary commercial terms\" provided by the Nice Classification constitute the \"name of the goods\"?\n\nAs used here, \"name of the goods\" means the word used to denote that sort of thing generically. So if the article in question is a knife, the name of the goods in English is \"knife,\" while the name in French is \"couteau,\" in German is *Messer,* etc.\n\nYes, therefore, the name of the goods is the ordinary commercial terms for the goods. Or rather the ordinary commercial terms are among the many names of the goods that cannot qualify for trademark protection. If you are trying to register \"blouse\" as a trademark for the article of clothing, you will not succeed. Similarly, if you're trying to register \"Bubbaloobaloobaloo\" as a trademark for women's blouses, and that word happens to *mean* \"blouse\" in some language, you will not succeed.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to trademark the term \"Zephyria\" for a line of portable fans. The term is not descriptive of the product in English, but research reveals it means \"breeze\" in an obscure language. According to Canadian trademark law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The trademark can be registered since \"Zephyria\" is not a common English term for fans.\nB) The trademark cannot be registered because it describes the function of the product in another language.\nC) The trademark can be registered as long as it's stylized with a unique logo.\nD) The trademark's eligibility depends on whether \"Zephyria\" appears in the Nice Classification for fans.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Canadian trademark law, specifically section 12(1)(c) of the Trademark Act, a trademark is not registrable if it is \"the name in any language of any of the goods or services in connection with which it is used or proposed to be used.\" In this case, even though \"Zephyria\" is not a common English term, its meaning of \"breeze\" in another language directly relates to the function of fans. This makes it descriptive in that language, similar to the examples given in the Trademarks Guide such as \"gelato\" for ice cream or \"anorak\" for outerwear. The fact that it's an obscure language doesn't change its ineligibility. The Nice Classification is not the determining factor here, nor would stylization overcome this fundamental issue. Therefore, the trademark likely cannot be registered due to its descriptive nature in another language."

I'm wondering if I'm violating any copyright laws for taking the photos of copyrighted/trademarked products (e.g. Cheetos, Doritos, etc)? Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes you should gain permission from the copyright and trademark holders of the products. All packaging will have copyright as copyright is assigned to work upon creation, not upon registration, although in the USA registration prior to any infringement gives possibility of extra recompenses.\n\nAll packaging will have some trademark on them too as that is how you know what is in the box and/or who made it.\n\nThe contents of the packaging (the usable product) should be trademark and copyright free, there may be some very rare cases where the product is trademarked, e.g. froot loops may be trademarked as the multicolored loops are very recognizable and if they are not trademarked, Kellogg will have tried to trademark them and failed.\n\nIANAL but personally I would class what you are doing as a type of fair use, assuming you are not in any way pretending to be someone other than the retailer of the product. There are thousands of shops, big and small, that do what you want to do and none of them have any issues regarding copyright so I doubt you will either. \n\nTLDR technically you should gain permission, in reality you are probably fine not getting permission on the condition you are respectful in how you frame the products",

The key is to use the images in a way that's considered fair use - accurately representing the products for sale without implying any official relationship with the brand beyond being a retailer. This approach balances practical business needs with respect for intellectual property rights. Option A is too permissive, B is overly strict given common practice, and D misunderstands that both packaging and contents may have protected elements."

And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one. ([source](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/15/968044983/president-potential-legal-trumps-legal-battles-following-his-second-impeachment))\n\nHowever, given the past 4 years of discussion regarding the immunity of a sitting president, can Trump be prosecuted for alleged crimes he commited **while** being president, or is his immunity invalid only for crimes commited as a private citizen?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nThe rule against prosecuting a sitting President is not a law, it is a Justice Department opinion and policy. The justification for it is that dealing with a criminal case would be severely distracting to the President, and thus harmful to the nation. Besides, the opinion goes on, any serious issue can be dealt with by impeachment. That reasoning obviously does not apply to a former President.\n\nArticle I, section 3, paragraph 7 of the [US constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) says:\n\n> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: **but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law**. (*emphasis added*)\n\nThis clearly contemplates the criminal prosecution of a former office holder, after such a person was removed by an impeachment. There is no exception for a President. Therefor a President can be criminally charged and prosecuted for actions during the presidency, provided that the evidence to establish probable cause is there, and that a Grand Jury indicts said former President.\n\nSo far as I know there has never been a case where such a thing was done. President Ford's pardon of President Nixon stopped any Federal prosecution of him. I think there have been cases were former US Judges, after impeachment, were criminally prosecuted. But that is not quite the same thing \\-\\- no one claims that sitting judges are immune to criminal charges.\n\nTo be clear this would not apply just to issues that a President had been impeached for. A former President is no different from anyone else in this respect. Any such person can be prosecuted if there is probable cause, and convicted if there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of criminal violation of some law, even if the violation occurred while the president was in office.",

According to the documentation, a former President can indeed be prosecuted for criminal actions taken while in office, subject to the same legal standards as any other citizen. This is supported by Article I, section 3, paragraph 7 of the U.S. Constitution, which states that a party convicted in an impeachment case shall still be \"liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\" The immunity often discussed applies only to sitting Presidents, based on a Justice Department opinion, not a law. Once out of office, a former President does not retain this immunity. Option A is incorrect because there is no absolute immunity for former Presidents. Option B is incorrect because impeachment is not a prerequisite for criminal prosecution. Option D is incorrect because Congressional authorization is not required for prosecution of a former President."

The situation described appears to be a breach of contract. The company made an offer (free products for a review), which the customer accepted by providing the review. Since there was no expiration date mentioned, the company's refusal to honor the offer could be seen as a breach of contract. Small Claims Court is an appropriate venue for resolving such disputes, especially for relatively small amounts.\n\nD) While reporting the company to Amazon might lead to consequences for the seller, it doesn't directly address the customer's loss or enforce the contract.

That order cited two statues as authority for this action: [PA 302 \\- Emergency Powers of Governor](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ce4ouglm31syh4h1fr024dbl))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Act-302-of-1945) and [PA 390 \\- Emergency Management Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(adpgy5u0pndxd2ojzikbpchr))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-act-390-of-1976). On April 1st that was expanded to include a state of disaster in [Executive Order 2020\\-33](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705-524025--,00.html).\n\nThe challenge here (and I'll go into this more later) is that PA 302 and 390 seem to have some overlapping and conflicting portions.\n\nPA 302 doesn't place any specific time restrictions on the length of these declarations, while PA 390, [Section 30\\.403](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(adpgy5u0pndxd2ojzikbpchr))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-30-403) states that:\n\n> The state of emergency shall continue until the governor finds that the threat or danger has passed, the emergency has been dealt with to the extent that emergency conditions no longer exist, or until the declared state of emergency has been in effect for 28 days. After 28 days, the governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation declaring the state of emergency terminated, unless a request by the governor for an extension of the state of emergency for a specific number of days is approved by resolution of both houses of the legislature.\n\nOn April 7th (28 days after the initial state of emergency declaration) Michigan's legislators voted to extend the states of emergency and disaster for 23 days (until April 30th).\n\nOn April 30th Michigan legislators decided to not extend the state of emergency. The governor extended them nonetheless, issues 3 new executive orders [(source)](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/gov-whitmer-extends-state-of-emergency-until-may-28-in-trio-of-new-executive-orders): \n\n> \"[Executive Order 2020\\-67](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705-527717--,00.html), which clarifies that a state of emergency\n>  remains in effect under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of\n>  1945\\.

I can see that [PA 390, Section 30\\.417](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(adpgy5u0pndxd2ojzikbpchr))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-30-417) specifically mentions how it doesn't limit PA 302 in some capacity (emphasis added):\n\n> This act shall not be construed to do any of the following \\[...] (d)\n>  Limit, modify, or abridge the authority of the governor **to proclaim** a\n>  state of emergency pursuant to Act No. 302 of the Public Acts of 1945,\n>  being sections 10\\.31 to 10\\.33 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or\n>  exercise any other powers vested in him or her under the state\n>  constitution of 1963, statutes, or common law of this state\n>  independent of, or in conjunction with, this act.\n\nBut that seems to impact the proclamation, not duration, of the states of emergency or disaster.\n\nSo back to my question \\- is it legal to pull from the authority of PA 302 while somehow sidestepping PA 390? Or is that the point of 30\\.417 \\- does that clause prevent the duration restrictions in PA 390 from amending anything in PA 302? In that case I would like to know what the value of those restrictions in PA 390 is.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The situation is that Executive Order 2020\\-33 is no more, and a *new* order, 2020\\-68 exists. The old orders to stay home are now copied under this order, but it may be necessary for her to re\\-issue (a subset of) the orders so that they are pursuant to \\#68 and not \\#33 (live by the technicality, die by the technicality). If she does not do that quickly, I expect there to be legal challenges. The law ([30\\-403](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(adpgy5u0pndxd2ojzikbpchr))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-30-403)) doesn't say that orders issued pursuant to a declaration of a state of disaster expire when the authorizing declaration expires, but one can reasonably infer that that is what the legislature had in mind when this law was passed. But that is a matter for the courts to decide. Deference to the executive, which is the usual way that courts operate, would favor an interpretation where saying \"All previous orders that rested on Executive Order 2020\\-33 now rest on this order\" counts as re\\-issuing the same orders with a new number in the text.\n\nThe law does not say that the circumstances authorizing an emergency order have to be completely different. Perhaps the legislature will revise the law in the future, but it is what it is right now.",

Which of the following accurately describes the legal basis and implications of these actions?\n\nA) The governor's actions were illegal because PA 390 explicitly prohibits extending a state of emergency without legislative approval after 28 days.\n\nB) The governor's actions were legal because PA 302 allows for indefinite states of emergency, which supersedes the time limits in PA 390.\n\nC) The governor's actions created a new state of emergency under PA 302, while terminating the previous one under PA 390, effectively restarting the clock on emergency powers.\n\nD) The governor's actions were illegal because once a state of emergency is terminated under one statute, it cannot be immediately reinstated under another statute.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Governor Whitmer used a strategic approach by issuing multiple executive orders. She terminated the existing state of emergency under PA 390 (which has a 28-day limit without legislative approval) via Executive Order 2020-66. Simultaneously, she declared a new state of emergency under PA 302 (which doesn't have explicit time limits) via Executive Order 2020-67, and also declared a new state of emergency and disaster under PA 390 via Executive Order 2020-68. This approach allowed her to effectively restart the clock on emergency powers by creating a new state of emergency under different legal authorities. While this action may be subject to legal challenges, it is based on the governor's interpretation of the overlapping and somewhat conflicting nature of PA 302 and PA 390. The other options are incorrect because they either misinterpret the laws or oversimplify the complex legal situation created by the governor's actions."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in a state with stupidly expensive state\\-sponsored earthquake insurance. To get a 5% deductible, I basically have to buy 1/10 of a house over my lifetime... but the chance of losing my home to an earthquake over that timeframe is only 1/500\\. But then I noticed that for half the cost, I could buy a policy with a 20% deductible on the full value, and then a second policy with a 20% deductible on 20% of the value. To effectively get a 4% deductible.... at almost half the cost. Because of the lower deductible, the premium on the first policy drops by half. The second policy is 1/5 of that.\n\nThe payout with these two new policies is as good as one policy with a 4% deductible. For example, if the home is destroyed, then I collect 80% of the home value from policy 1, and another 16% of the home value from policy 2\\. So, in total, I get 96% of the value, just as in a 4% deductible plan. Neither policy is paying out any more or less than it would have if I had just one of the two new policies. So I am not causing any harm to either insurer by having the other one. Right?\n\nGenerally speaking, double\\-insuring things is legal. For example, I can insure stocks or mortgages that I don't own, and I can have 15 life insurance policies. Nonetheless, I have to ask: is there any potential legal issue with doubling up on earthquake insurance? Is it somehow illegal to attempt to avoid getting ripped off by the state?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It would depend on the law of that state, and the insurance policy. [Here](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/California-Earthquake-Insurance-Policies/Policy-Samples/Homeowner/Standard-Homeowners-Policy-Sample) is a sample policy from the California Earthquake Authority. \u00a78 on Other Insurance says\n\n> a. If there is other insurance that covers earthquake loss to the\n> dwelling or other property covered under this policy,we will pay our\n> share of the covered loss or damage. Our share is the proportion that\n> the applicable limit of insurance under this policy bears to the\n> combined limits of insurance of all policies that cover the same\n> property.\n\nAs you can see, they anticipate the possibility of having multiple insurance policies, so it's reasonable to conclude that it's not illegal to have two earthquake insurance policies, at least in this case.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An individual has discovered a way to potentially reduce their earthquake insurance costs by purchasing two separate policies instead of one. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and implications of this approach?\n\nA) This strategy is illegal in all states as it constitutes insurance fraud.\n\nB) While not explicitly illegal, this approach violates the principle of indemnity and would likely be rejected by insurers.\n\nC) This strategy is generally legal, but the policyholder must disclose the existence of other policies to each insurer.\n\nD) This approach is always legal and encouraged as a way to optimize insurance coverage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, having multiple insurance policies for the same risk (in this case, earthquake damage) is generally legal. However, insurance policies typically have clauses addressing \"Other Insurance,\" which require policyholders to disclose the existence of other policies covering the same risk. This allows insurers to coordinate their coverage and ensure that the total payout doesn't exceed the actual loss (maintaining the principle of indemnity).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because double-insuring is not inherently illegal, as evidenced by the sample policy language provided.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while insurers may have concerns about over-insurance, the principle of indemnity is typically maintained through coordination of benefits clauses, not by outright rejection of multiple policies.\n\nAnswer D is overly broad and incorrect. While this approach may be legal in many cases, it's not universally encouraged or always the best option for all policyholders in all situations."

The [MA Dept. of Education maintains](http://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=7585) that public schools must purchase at public expense textbooks and other instructional materials and supplies intended for use and re\\-use over a period of years, and computers fall in the category of materials intended for schools to purchase and use and re\\-use. There is no legislative authority to compel parents to purchase equipment or sign up for internet services. If there is a choice between in\\-person and online instruction, the legal requirement to attend school can be satisfied by in\\-person instruction.\n\nThe second sub\\-question is whether, if a child does have the technical ability to be connected to class via the internet, can they legally require the camera to be turned on? Every district has rules, so if there is a rule requiring parental consent in this situation, then parental consent is required. If it is legal at that level, there is still a legal\nrisk to the school. Schools can generally do those things that are reasonably necessary for educating students as long as it doesn't infringe on fundamental constitutional rights, and the camera\\-on requirement is educationally reasonable.\nThe risk to the school is violating the federal law FERPA, specifically a potential violation of the privacy requirements. Schools must protect personal information, which includes anything streaming from the camera (pictures, for example, are personally identifiable information). If you assume that they have an absolutely secure connection, then there is no risk of privacy violation. However, if you believe, even reasonably so, that a school practice creates a risk of breach of privacy, that still does not create a special right to avoid school.",

However, it carries risks related to potential violations of FERPA (Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act) if the school cannot guarantee absolute security of the video stream. Additionally, schools cannot legally compel parents to purchase equipment or internet services, so the policy cannot be enforced for students who lack the necessary technology. The school must provide alternatives, such as in-person instruction, to satisfy legal attendance requirements. While the policy isn't outright illegal, it exists in a grey area with potential legal risks and limitations on enforcement."

Does that law still exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Vatican has its own postal operator (Vatican Post) while Italy has liberalized the postal sector, i. e. besides the incumbent operator (Poste Italiane) there should also be a few smaller operators. THis means that in order to get a letter from Italy, to the pope, it must be handed over from Poste Italiane to Vatican Post. Assuming that the arrangement you described is still in place, this would raise the question how those letters would be billed on the wholesale level. Usually, when you send a letter abroad, the operator of origin has to pay wholesale postage to the destination operator; However, for certain services, there are billing arrangements that derogate from this rule:  \n\n\u2022 For postage due and paid response items, wholesale postage is billed in reverse so the destination operator has to pay.  \n\n\u2022 Cecogram items and war prisoner service are free on the wholesale level.\n\nNow the question is, if the arrangement still exists, how is it billed on the wholesale level? Possible options would be:  \n\n\u2022 Poste italiane treats those items as International Postage Due. In this case, it would be free for the sender but the pope has to pay.  \n\n\u2022 Poste italiane eats the fees and hands the items over to Vatican Post as postage paid. For this to work, Poste Italiane would have to slam a \u201cPort Pay\u00e9 / Italie\u201d rubber stamp on each pope letter. (Without the rubber stamp, Vatican Post would treat the letter as postage due)  \n\n\u2022 Poste Italiane and Vatican Post have a special bilateral agreement to exchange pope letters on a cost\\-neutral basis similar to cecogram and POW items.\n\nIf it's the first option, there may be no legislation on the italian side at all governing free pope letters because international postage due is a regular service.  \n\nIn the third case, we would have to look for a bilateral arrangement betwenn Poste Italiane and Vatican Post.   \nIf it's the second option, the legislation we look for could be either an Italian law or a bilateral treaty.",

This approach would honor the spirit of the original law by making it free for Italian senders while ensuring that Vatican Post receives proper documentation of paid postage. It places the financial burden on Poste Italiane, which aligns with the historical intent to mollify the Pope. Options A and D would not fulfill the law's purpose of free postage for senders. Option C introduces a complex reimbursement system not mentioned in the original context and would still require citizens to pay upfront, contrary to the law's intent."

On the face of it, the statute itself doesn't make any provision for any kind of \"*de minimis*\" exception. And yet, it's black\\-and\\-white stated in the official government\\-published guidance.\n\nWhere does the authority for such a statement come from (its source or principle in law), and what is its standing in UK law (i.e., could it be relied on as a matter of law and if so on what basis)?\n\nI'm sure such a strong statement wouldn't be included in official guidance without some kind of legal standing/authority, but if so, what exactly is it and how far does the underlying legal principle stretch, which underpins this statement/exception?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The starting point of any analysis has to begin with asking what the scope of the Act's application is i.e. what acts fall under its remit and what does not. The question is whether Parliament intended the Act to apply to ANY alteration to the structure, or only a certain class of acts. Clearly it is not the former. With the latter then in mind, statements like that you pointed out merely acknowledge that the Party Wall Act does not cover every single conceivable alteration to a shared structure, as that statement has to be viewed in its entire context. You have left out the second half of the statement that stipulates the core principle of the Act, which is that the Act only imposes the req to serve notice only if, generally, the alteration would cause much structural change or damage.\n\nThe de minimis threshold can be inferred from the list of activities covered under section 2\\.

If this software includes and allows users to choose what god/deity they believe in (or their favorite god/deity), is this legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under the First Amendment, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\". Consequently, there can be no government action requiring the expression of beliefs of a particular religion, nor prohibiting such expressions \u2013 or, requiring or prohibiting expression of a general belief or disbelief in religions as a whole. This neutrality requirement holds only of governments, therefor a person can in his dealings with others require or prohibit expression of a religious viewpoint to the extent that they can make such a (non)expression a pre\\-condition for such dealings. Such dealings can be purely social, or they can be financial.\n\nHowever, there are currently some limitations arising from commercial dealings and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which allows Congress to regulate business.\nFor example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against employees based on religion. This limits an employer's right to religious expression, for example if they announce that Pastafarians need not apply. Title VII only addresses employment. Title II has an analogous prohibition against consideration of religion in \"public accommodations\" (theaters, hotels, restaurants...). The Fair Housing Act similarly prohibits religious discrimination in housing.\n\nWe need not get into the question of whether prohibitions against religious discrimination contravene the First Amendment. Until SCOTUS or Congress says otherwise, there are specific narrow limits on one's First Amendment rights w.r.t. religion. There is no software anti\\-discrimination law, so no basis for thinking about the question in terms of anti\\-discrimination laws. In lieu of a law that addresses religion and software, you may express your religious or non\\-religious views in software as you please.\n\nInsofar as all anti\\-discrimination law are based on the premise \"You may not consider X in making decisions\", and setting X to be \"religion\", an anti\\-discrimination law applied to software would at most prohibit the *prohibition* of a religious expression, that is, would make it illegal to prevent a customer from making a religious expression within the scope of the software. A law which required software to *suppress* religious expression would be a maximal contravention of the First Amendment. So it is legal to allow a user to use the FSM as his avatar.",

The court has served the notice of issue of my claim on what I believe to be the defendant's address \\-\\- my reasons for which are documented in the claim \\-\\- and the court considers it to be served two business days after posting. If the defendant does not respond within the required 14\\-day period, under the rules, they are not allowed to submit evidence of a defence without the court's explicit permission.\n\nYet what happens if they claim no service at all \\-\\- or would, if they responded to it? What if the address is wrong, they have moved, or similar? How, practically, in the UK, are these issues decided?\n\nUnder CPR \u00a7 7 (\"normal\") proceedings, if they did not respond, I could file a request for judgement (quite simply \\-\\- e.g. using form N225 if a specific monetary amount is claimed) and, if everything proceeded \"smoothly\" to my benefit, and the judge was satisfied the claim was served correctly, I would likely win, and could therefore claim damages through recovering money from the defendant's bank account(s) should I know them. Yet CPR \u00a78 specifically forbids requests for summary judgement, and as far as my reading goes, the entire rest of the procedures the rules as described assume that the defendant engages with them.\n\nWhat happens, frankly, if they don't? Would it be likely that one would win a successful judgement against a defendant at an incorrect address? Or would the defendant likely request that the judgement be set aside and the case started anew, once they had \"discovered\" my pending action?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Rule 8\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part08) covers what happens if the defendant fails to file an acknowledgement of service:\n\n> 8\\.4\n> \n> \n> (1\\) This rule applies where \u2013\n> \n> \n> (a) the defendant has failed to file an acknowledgment of service; and\n> \n> \n> (b) the time period for doing so has expired.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) The defendant may attend the hearing of the claim but may not take part in the hearing unless the court gives permission.\n\nIt may be possible that the defendant has a good reason for failing to file the acknowledgement of service, in which case the court may allow the defendant to participate in the hearing like a normal case. Otherwise, the hearing would proceed and the case would be decided as normal.\n\nThe reason you can't request default judgement per Part 12 when making a Part 8 claim is because of the nature of Part 8 claims:\n\n> \\[where the claimant] seeks the court\u2019s decision on a question which is unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact\n\nThe intended purpose of Part 8 is to seek answers to questions. For example, seeking guidance from the court on the proposed actions of trustees or what the correct interpretation of a deed of trust is. There's no real injustice to be remedied for the successful party in such cases\u2014as opposed to most Part 7 claims, where the successful party usually wants a financial award or some other material remedy\u2014so default judgement would be inappropriate to grant.\n\n> Would it be likely that one would win a successful judgement against a defendant at an incorrect address?\n\nThis is a mere technical defect to cure. The court would simply direct that efforts be made to ascertain the correct whereabouts of the defendant and a new notice of claim would be served upon them. The case would be adjourned until reasonable efforts to serve the claim were made. It is not a pre\\-requisite that the service be successful, otherwise people up and down the country could simply claim not to have been served and that's not in the interests of justice.\n\n> would the defendant likely request that the judgement be set aside and the case started anew, once they had \"discovered\" my pending action?\n\nAssuming that, for whatever reason, service was unsuccessful, and you managed to obtain default judgement (under Part 7 since Part 8 no longer applies here because Section 214 claims no longer need to be made under Part 8 per [Part 56](http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part56)), the defendant could apply to have the judgement set aside but whether that would be granted is highly fact\\-specific.\n\nIt would be perverse for a defendant to deliberately claim to be ignorant of a claim against them and seek to \"go back in time\" for their own advantage without compelling reasons why. The claimant deserves justice equally as much as the defendant does.",

I wished to leave immediately after the funeral; but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London: wither she was now at last invited now by her uncle, Mr. Gibson; who had come down to direct his sister\u2019s interment, and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble\\-minded quailings, and selfish lamentations, as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses.\n\n**The publisher was Smith, Elder \\& Co.**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A book (or any other creative work) published in the 1800s is now in the public domain everywhere in the world (excepting odd cases like *Peter Pan* where a special rule applies in some jurisdictions.) Anyone may legally quote from such a work at any length with no legal requirement for permission. In fact there is no legal requirement to attribute the quote to the author (although there is an ethical requirement).\n\nIn fact one may publish a new edition of such a work, unchanged or modified in any way one chooses, with no legal need to obtain permission from anyone or to pay any royalties or fees.\n\nIf the work were recent enough to still be protected by copyright, a limited quote could be used under fair use, fair dealing or another exception to copyright under the laws of most countries. The exact rules vary by country, and are often highly fact\\-dependent, so the exact details will matter.\n\nIf one wanted to quote enough from a recent work that permission is required, the copyright holder, who is often not the publisher, would need to grant permission. That is often the author or the author's heir, but it can be a person or firm to which the author transferred the rights. Sometimes the rights\\-holder can be hard to identify.\n\nUpdate: it would be possible for a work published in, say, 1890 by an author then young who lived to a fairly old age, dying in, say 1960, to still be protected in some countries, although not in the US. (Anything published before 1925 is now PD in the US.) But Charlotte Bronte died in 1855, and all of her work has long been in the public domain",

This means the work is firmly in the public domain worldwide. As such, anyone can legally use any amount of the text without permission or legal requirement for attribution. However, it's ethically recommended to attribute the quote to the original author.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the work is in the public domain, so heirs no longer have any copyright control. Option B is wrong because the publisher's status is irrelevant for public domain works. Option C is close but incorrect because while attribution is good practice, it's not legally required for public domain works."

Would the new President then be automatically removed from office? \nOr would he remain President even if it turns out he was sworn in by error? \n Would he be obliged to step down? Could he refuse?\n\nIf he didn't step down, would the one higher up in the succession have a claim on the office? Could he too be sworn in, and become sort of an \"anti\\-President\" (like how there were two Popes \u2013 the Pope and an \"anti\\-Pope\")?\n\nWould it matter who resurfaced? For example, is the answer different if it was the Vice President who was later found alive, or some other elected official (e.g., the House Speaker) instead of \"just\" another (but higher\\-ranking) appointee?\n\nAnd what if the President himself was found to be alive days later (and still able to perform his functions)? Would that compel the new acting President to step down?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Once a person is sworn in as POTUS, there are only two legal mechanisms for involuntary removal of that person from the office:\n\n[Article II Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii) provides only that:\n\n> The President ... shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and\n>  conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and\n>  misdemeanors.\n\n[The 25th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv) was passed to establish clear procedures of official succession. Its Section 4 also provides an elaborate mechanism whereby \"the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide\" can precipitate a process that would allow Congress, within 21 days, to transfer the office to the Vice President.\n\nOtherwise, there is no contemplation in the law of a \"backsies\" mechanism for removing a person from the office because \"it should have gone to someone else.\"\n\n(The idea that a person who *was* in the designated line of succession, but in the wrong order, was sworn into office does not seem nearly as problematic as other events that have happened in real history. For example, in the 2000 Presidential Election it was conceivable \u2013 and some people probably maintain in fact \u2013 that the \"loser\" of the election would be sworn into office. [The U.S. Supreme Court settled the legal questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore) before the inauguration. However, the realization at the time was that any legal challenges or decisions after that date would be moot, because \"election error\" is not a cause to remove a sitting U.S. President.)\n\nThe question of a previous President reappearing, and his successor refusing to cede the office, takes us to the height of speculation. In this case I would merely note that I can find no law pertaining to [Presidential Transition](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/presidential-transition/legislative-overview/presidential-transition-act-of-1963) in which an outgoing President is \"stripped of authority\" or \"removed from office.\" Rather, the acting POTUS is effectively *the most recent person sworn to the office, and not removed from it*.",

If they owe lots of money to creditors and they are the legal owners of the property, why cannot the creditors grab the property? Does the fact that the equitable title belong to somebody else protect the property from creditors in any way?\n\nI am seeking answers for any English\\-centric jurisdiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The controlling statute in the United States Bankruptcy Code is [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/541) which states:\n\n> **Property in which the debtor holds, as of the commencement of the case, only legal title and not an equitable interest**, such as a\n>  mortgage secured by real property, or an interest in such a mortgage,\n>  sold by the debtor but as to which the debtor retains legal title to\n>  service or supervise the servicing of such mortgage or interest,\n>  **becomes property of the \\[bankruptcy] estate under subsection (a)(1\\) or (2\\) of this section only to the extent of the debtor\u2019s legal title to such\n>  property, but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such\n>  property that the debtor does not hold.**\n\nFor the purposes of a trustee of a typical trust, only the language in bold is relevant (strictly speaking, this is not an exemption from creditors, which would be found at [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522), but a part of the definition of what a debtor owns).\n\nOnly property that is part of the bankruptcy estate is subject to distribution to creditors of the bankrupt.\n\n(The language in not in bold pertains to the special case of mortgages sold in the secondary market to new lenders in which the originator of the mortgage remains the nominee owner, which is economically important in financial company bankruptcies, but not a situation the average person would encounter very often.)\n\nIn general, under non\\-bankruptcy law, creditors of a trustee may not acquire an interest in property greater than that of the debtor (unless a statute such as the [holder in due course rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holder_in_due_course), *see, e.g.,* \u00a7 4\\-3\\-302, Colorado Revised Statutes, provides otherwise), so the same rule applies outside of bankruptcy. *See, e.g., [Casey v. Cavaroc](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/96/467/)*, 96 U.S. 467, 473\u201374 (1877\\).\n\nIndeed, this subtle rule of law governing the creditors of a trustee was actually the earliest form of limited liability in common law jurisdiction and was used as a model for subsequently devised limited liability entities such a corporations, as [explained by John Morley in the Columbia Law Review](https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-common-law-corporation-the-power-of-the-trust-in-anglo-american-business-history/) (open access). He explains:\n\n> If a trustee went bankrupt, his creditors could seize the property he\n>  owned personally for his own benefit but not the property he held as\n>  trustee in trust for others.43 The creditors could take the trustee\u2019s\n>  personal farm, for instance, but not the farm he held in trust for the\n>  beneficiaries. As Professors Henry Hansmann and Ugo Mattei have shown,\n>  this was an extraordinary innovation because it limited the rights of\n>  a trustee\u2019s creditors even if the creditors had not personally agreed\n>  to the limitations.44 This rule emerged gradually over time, but its\n>  essential contours were in place by the mid\\-1400s.45\n> \n> \n> 43 Henry Hansmann \\& Ugo Mattei, The Functions of Trust Law: A\n>  Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis, 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 434, 454\u201356\n>  (1998\\).\n> \n> \n> 44 *See id.*\n> \n> \n> 45 At first, the rule probably operated indirectly. Today, an\n>  unsecured creditor can seize any property\u2014real or personal\u2014of a debtor\n>  as long as the property is not already committed to a security\n>  interest. *Cf.* Edward M. Iacobucci \\& George G. Triantis, Economic and\n>  Legal Boundaries of Firms, 93 Va. L. Rev. 515 (2007\\) (noting the legal\n>  implications of how a firm is structured and arguing that a creditor\n>  of an entity has a formal right to any of that entity\u2019s property). In\n>  late medieval and early modern times, however, a creditor generally\n>  could not take land (as distinct from personal property) unless the\n>  owner had specifically given the creditor a security interest in it.\n>  *See* Claire Priest, Creating an American Property Law: Alienability and\n>  Its Limits in American History, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 385, 401\u201307 (2006\\)\n>  (describing limits on the alienability of land in late\\-medieval\n>  English law). Thus, there was no need for a rule in early trust law\n>  that protected real property from a trustee\u2019s unsecured creditors.\n>  Since no one could take real property from a trustee unless the\n>  trustee specifically pledged it, there was no point in cutting off the\n>  claims of creditors who had no pledge. It was enough simply to have a\n>  rule that protected property from the secured creditors who had\n>  received the pledges.

According to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(d) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, property in which the debtor (in this case, the trustee) holds only legal title and not an equitable interest does not become part of the bankruptcy estate beyond the extent of the debtor's legal title. In a trust arrangement, the trustee holds only legal title, while the beneficiaries hold the equitable interest. Therefore, the vacation home held in trust would be protected from the trustee's personal creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. This principle, which limits creditors' rights to the actual interests of the debtor, is a fundamental aspect of trust law and serves as an early form of asset protection and limited liability."

They want to continue with closing on schedule, and said there will be an exception on my title insurance which will be removed after the title action is completed. It all sounds like standard procedure to me, but I'm not a lawyer.\n\nThe one thing that concerns me is, what if the title action were to fail? Can this happen? So, for example, what if an heir of that deceased decides they want to fight me over the house? Could I lose it? What about the mortgage I took out to buy the house? Or am I getting overly concerned about nothing?\n\nIs this standard procedure?\n\nI am in Pennsylvania.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is unusual, but not unheard of, to do a quiet title action in connection with an arms length, non\\-related party sale of real estate.\n\nThe far more customary practice is for the seller to do the quiet title action (at the seller's expense) if it is necessary for the seller to have what is called \"marketable title\" to the property, before it is even listed for sale.\n\nIt would also be more customary for the closing to be extended to a date after which the quiet title action can be completed, and for you to lease rather than buy the property prior to closing.\n\nThis way, if the quiet title action fails to quiet title to the seller, the closing with you doesn't have to be undone, and you can just move your stuff out with reasonable notice from the landlord\\-seller, and you can look for somewhere else to live or can try to cut a deal with whoever is determined to be the true owner of the property.\n\nAlso, as a practical reality, it would be quite unusual for a mortgage lender to agree to provide you with a mortgage without title insurance in place. I very much doubt that the deal can go forward as planned, even if the you and the seller agree, if you need mortgage financing to buy the house.\n\nThis said, there is nothing particularly unusual about a title insurance company's requirement that a quiet title action be completed in a case where the current owner took title via a tax sale from a deceased owner's probate estate. Any irregularity in the tax sale process could vest the property back into the estate of the deceased owner, the tax sale buyer likely paid less than fair market value, and there are probably special notice requirements involved in a tax sale from a deceased owner's estate that don't apply (and extend the statute of limitations for contests of the tax sale) that wouldn't apply in the case of a tax sale from someone who is alive. Some of the potential irregularities wouldn't appear in the public record or in any other documentation that you could demand (e.g. a forged signature or an error in crediting payments of taxes to the wrong account).\n\nThe likelihood that a quiet title action will vest title in the name of the seller is high, but the fact that the title company is not willing to insure title in its current state is strong circumstantial evidence that the risk that the seller does not have good title to the property is real.\n\nYour concerns are not unreasonable, and the safer course of action would be to restructure the deal so that you do not take title unless and until the title is quieted in the seller in a lawsuit conducted at his sole expense and risk, even if you move in pursuant to a lease pending that process. The existence of an (amended) real estate contract between you and the seller should be sufficient to protect your interest in the deal that you have struck between now and closing. It is possible that your financing could fall apart between now and closing, but often the circumstances that would make that happen are circumstances that would cause you to wish you never did the deal in the first place anyway.\n\nWhen I represented some heirs of a decedent in a similar case (involving a fraudulent sale to avoid a tax sale, rather than a tax sale itself, from a probate estate), the deal ultimately struck was to have the heirs sell the house to the buyer who was under contract, with proceeds split between the nominal owner of record and the heirs who might have had a claim to undo a prior sale. Such a resolution if there is a contested quiet title litigation, in lieu of taking the quiet title dispute to trial, is another resolution that would be fine with you if the closing is postponed until after the title dispute is resolved.",

As explained in the documentation, it is \"more customary for the closing to be extended to a date after which the quiet title action can be completed, and for you to lease rather than buy the property prior to closing.\" This approach protects the buyer from potential complications if the quiet title action fails, allowing them to simply end the lease and look for another property without the need to undo a completed sale. It also avoids potential issues with mortgage lenders, who might be reluctant to provide financing without clear title insurance in place. While options B and D are potential solutions, they are less directly beneficial to the buyer. Option A carries the most risk for the buyer and is not recommended by the legal expert in the provided information."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legal for a landlord in the state of Tennessee to charge a tenant's debit card electronically (using information stored from a previous transaction) without the tenant's knowledge, presence (neither of card or card holder) or authorization?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic legal limits on card use are [here](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-580.html). The law is framed in terms of an \"access device\", which includes debit cards, PINs, telephones and so on (there are other laws about credit cards). It does not include checks and the bank account information that might be used for a one\\-time ACH debit. Rule 1005\\.2(k)(1\\) defines preauthorized electronic fund transfer\n\n> A preauthorized electronic fund transfer under Regulation E is one\n>  authorized by the consumer in advance of a transfer that will take\n>  place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and\n>  will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the\n>  transfer. In a bill\\-payment system, for example, if the consumer\n>  authorizes a financial institution to make monthly payments to a payee\n>  by means of EFTs, and the payments take place without further action\n>  by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized EFTs. In contrast, if\n>  the consumer must take action each month to initiate a payment (such\n>  as by entering instructions on a touch\\-tone telephone or home\n>  computer), the payments are not preauthorized EFTs.\n\nSo the answer is yes or no, depending. 2(m)(2\\) says\n\n> If a consumer furnishes an access device and grants authority to make\n>  transfers to a person (such as a family member or co\\-worker) who\n>  exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the\n>  transfers unless the consumer has notified the financial institution\n>  that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.\n\nThe literal words here say one thing, and surrounding circumstances suggest something else. A landlord is a obviously a person, but a landlord has a different relation to one than a family member or co\\-worker does \u2013 the parenthetical suggests that this clause refers to trusted individuals. The importance of that is that if a landlord is a \"person\" in this sense, then you are liable unless you have told the institution that he is no longer authorized.\n\nThe same section on unauthorized use indicates ties that concept on forced access (robbery at gunpoint) or cards that are stolen or obtained by fraud, also a class of reversals of direct deposits. None of these concepts covers the described use, assuming that the initial acquisition of the device was not by force or fraud. The fact of using a device without explicit permission in some instance does not constitute fraud (which involves making a material knowingly false statement that the consumer relies on to agree to an arrangement).\n\nThe use in question is covered in 3(b)(1\\), under the rubric \"Funds Transferred Covered\" (i.e. whether the use is an 'electronic funds transfer', which is regulated):\n\n> A transfer from the consumer's account resulting from a debit\\-card\n>  transaction at a merchant location, even if no electronic terminal is\n>  involved at the time of the transaction, if the consumer's asset\n>  account is subsequently debited for the amount of the transfer.\n\nThese regulations are about your relationship to the bank, the question being whether you have a legal basis for making the bank absorb the loss. There is little chance that this law would make you not liable to the bank (i.e. they would be required to return the money taken from your account). There could be some recourse in case your agreement with the bank specifically prohibits recurring charges with a debit card, but it is unlikely that there is any such restriction. Assuming you did not previously put the bank on notice that the landlord is no longer authorized to charge your card, then you have no recourse against the bank.\n\nAny recourse would then be against the landlord, where the specific issue is whether the charge is or is not within the scope of an agreement. If you use a debit card to pay rent and in some month you indeed owe rent, then the landlord has not torted you by charging the next month's rent. If, however, the landlord gets the idea that your bank account is a source of free beer money thus the use is not covered by an existing agreement, then the charge would be wrongful, and you can sue the landlord. I will assume (since you don't specify the purpose of the charge) that the charge is in connection with an amount owed by you.\n\nThere is no statute that requires specific \"for each use\" authorization of debit card charges: any such limitations would arise from explicit agreements between you and the bank, or you and the landlord. If you have such an agreement, say with the landlord, which says that the use of the card is a one\\-time use, then only a one\\-time use is authorized. Otherwise, there is no implicit requirement that each and every transfer must be specifically authorized. Informing the institution that the particular person is no longer authorized is your only recourse.",

The tenant had previously used the card to pay rent. Under what circumstances might this be considered a legal transaction?\n\nA) If the tenant had verbally agreed to allow the landlord to charge the card each month\nB) If the charge is for the correct amount of rent owed and there was no prior agreement prohibiting recurring charges\nC) If the landlord obtained written consent from the tenant before each transaction\nD) If the tenant had previously informed their bank that the landlord was authorized to make charges\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the provided information, the legality of the transaction depends on several factors. Option B is correct because if the charge is for the correct amount of rent owed and there was no prior agreement prohibiting recurring charges, it would likely be considered legal. The documentation states that there is no statute requiring specific \"for each use\" authorization of debit card charges, and limitations would arise from explicit agreements between the tenant and the bank or the tenant and the landlord.\n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal agreements are not mentioned as a determining factor in the legality of such transactions. Option C is incorrect because the documentation does not indicate that written consent is required before each transaction. Option D is somewhat relevant but not the most accurate answer, as informing the bank about the landlord's authorization is mentioned as a way to prevent unauthorized charges, not necessarily as a requirement for making the transaction legal."

The legal basis for the statement lies in property rights. The carton belongs to the company (in this case, Visy), and they have only rented or loaned it to the user under specific terms. Reusing the carton without permission would be taking someone else's property without consent, which could be considered theft (a crime) or conversion (a civil tort).

It is not sufficient for it to be somehow possible to see the terms. In [Specht v. Netscape, 306 F.3d 17](https://www.law.unlv.edu/faculty/rowley/Specht.pdf), the company put a link to license terms \"on the next scrollable screen\". The court was \"not persuaded that a reasonably prudent offeree in these circumstances would have known of the existence of license terms\". The salient characteristic of that agreement is that customers were \"responding to an offer that did not carry an immediately visible notice of the existence of license terms or require unambiguous manifestation of assent to those terms.\" It might have been possible for a customer to guess that there was a license agreement because the download link did not position the scroll bar at the very bottom of the page, but really, who pays attention to the scroll bar especially when there is usually a lot of junk at the bottom. Coupled with the overall presentation of the product as \"download free software now one click !!!\", nothing notified customers that there was an EULA.\n\nAnother relevant case is [Kwan v. Clearwater](http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020120104780/KWAN%20v.%20CLEARWIRE%20CORPORATION). In this case, the legal issue is whether there would be a trial at all, and the court determined that there would be since there were matters of fact to resolve, prominently whether plaintiffs had agreed to forgo litigation in favor of arbitration. Again, the court found that there was inadequate notice of the TOS: defendant provided information that could lead to seeing the TOS, but simple possibility of finding is not enough. There was no persuasive evidence that plaintiff had actually assented to the terms. In this case, plaintiff was presented with an opportunity to press \"I accept terms\" but did not do so (plaintiff testified that she declined to do so). \n\nSo the main concern would be whether the customer has legally\\-easy notice, and a bullet\\-proof means of agreeing (i.e. actually requiring an \"I agree\" button\"). You would need to pay an attorney to give a legal opinion as to whether your plan makes satisfies the \"notice\" requirement and the \"manifest agreement\" part in the way a click\\-wrap agreement does, or you could decide on your own, given these considerations and maybe cases cited in these two rulings.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, a homeowner installs a visible security system with cameras and microphones throughout their property. Which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered legal under Massachusetts wiretapping law?\n\nA) The homeowner secretly installs hidden microphones in addition to the visible cameras without informing visitors.\n\nB) The homeowner posts a clear sign at the entrance stating \"Audio and Video Recording in Progress\" but doesn't verbally inform each visitor.\n\nC) The homeowner only records video without any audio to avoid potential legal issues.\n\nD) The homeowner obtains written consent from every person entering the property before allowing them inside.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the correct answer because Massachusetts wiretapping law primarily prohibits secret recording of conversations. By posting a clear sign informing visitors of audio and video recording, the homeowner is making the recording known and not secret, which complies with the law. Verbal consent from each individual is not required if the recording is not secret.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it involves secret recording, which is explicitly prohibited by the law.\n\nOption C, while potentially avoiding legal issues related to audio recording, is unnecessarily restrictive. The law allows for audio recording as long as it's not secret.\n\nOption D goes beyond what's required by law. While obtaining explicit consent would certainly be legal, it's not necessary if the recording is openly disclosed through signs or other clear indicators."

Suppose this borrower had zero *legal* income during this time, but had income from illegal sources of over $100,000 a year?\n\nCould the borrower be found guilty of lying on the loan application about his income? Could the bank be found negligent for not verifying if the income was legal, even thought it was actually in excess of the reported $100,000 a year? Would the answers change if the illegal income was of a kind that can be reverted or \"clawed back\" because of conversion or other charges (such as drug dealing)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The financial institution is only likely to run afoul of anti\\-money laundering laws.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (1970\\) and the USA PATRIOT Act deal with anti\\-money laundering in the United States.\n\nNow, this may not necessarily be the financial institution that *funds* the loan. However, a financial institution will verify the income as part of the lending process. For example, these are some of the ways a bank may verify your income (this isn't exhaustive):\n\n* 1040 Tax return (Federal or state).\n* Wages and tax statement (W\\-2 and/ or 1099, including 1099 MISC, 1099G, 1099R, 1099SSA, 1099DIV, 1099SS, 1099INT).\n* Pay stub.\n* Self\\-employment ledger documentation (can be a Schedule C, the most recent quarterly or year\\-to\\-date profit and loss statement, or a self\\-employment ledger).\n* Social Security Administration Statements (Social Security Benefits Letter).\n* Unemployment Benefits Letter.\n\nNow, *really*, only the last two forms of verification would not be accepted by a financial institution. In the event that a financial institution completes its due diligence and verifies the income, the financial institution that funds the loan is unlikely to be found negligent.\n\nHowever, if this income passes through any single financial institution, they may have obligations under the BSA to report the transactions, either through a Suspect Activity Report or a Currency Transaction Report. Failure to comply with these obligations can result in sanctions placed on the bank.\n\nThe borrower, on the other hand, is only likely to be subject to the laws that outlaw whatever criminal activity the funds were a proceed of, and/or perhaps money laundering laws.",

In reality, the borrower had no legal income but earned over $100,000 annually from illegal sources. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The bank will definitely be found negligent for not verifying if the income was legal, as long as it was actually in excess of the reported amount.\n\nB) The borrower cannot be found guilty of lying on the loan application since the actual income exceeded the reported amount, regardless of its source.\n\nC) The bank is only likely to face consequences if it fails to comply with anti-money laundering laws, such as filing Suspicious Activity Reports or Currency Transaction Reports as required.\n\nD) The borrower can only be charged with crimes related to the illegal income source, but not for any misrepresentation on the loan application.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. The bank is primarily at risk if it fails to comply with anti-money laundering laws, such as those outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act. These laws require financial institutions to report suspicious activities and large currency transactions. The bank is unlikely to be found negligent if it performed standard income verification procedures using accepted documents like tax returns or pay stubs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the bank's negligence is not determined solely by whether the actual income exceeded the reported amount, but by whether it followed proper verification procedures.\n\nOption B is false because the borrower can still be found guilty of lying on the loan application, as the source of income is material information, not just the amount.\n\nOption D is incomplete, as the borrower could potentially face charges both for the illegal income source and for misrepresentation on the loan application."

In the United States legal system, prosecutors have the authority to file charges for criminal offenses independently of the victim's wishes. This is because criminal charges are brought by the state, not by individuals. In high-profile cases with clear video evidence, like the Will Smith-Chris Rock incident, a prosecutor could theoretically pursue the case even without the victim's cooperation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because victims don't have the sole authority to \"press charges\" - this is a common misconception.\n\nAnswer B is false because the prosecutor can still file charges even if the victim doesn't want to \"press charges.\"\n\nAnswer C is partially correct but overstates the necessity of the victim's testimony.

This technically allows one to activate new XP installations, safely and securely, without a crack, offline even though Microsoft has turned off all the activation servers.\n\nThis is particularly relevant for those with older scientific equipment that relies on an XP computer. I think these would usually be sold with quite permissive licences, allowing one to change the computer freely and reinstall Windows XP. However it would appear that using this software could be \"circumventing a technological measure or access control technology\", and therefore illegal in the US.\n\nIs this a reasonable interpretation of the law? Is there some exception that would apply in this case? Is there a way to utilise this application legally in such a situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The DMCA applies if the item being copied is protected by some mechanism that prevents copying.\n\nJust because that mechanism isn't very strong, doesn't mean DMCA doesn't apply. For example, there is a mechanism designed in the 1980s to prevent DVDs from being copied. This was cracked some time later by clever mathematical methods; today your home computer would be powerful enough to crack it using brute force without having to do anything clever. That doesn't mean it's not protected; it is, and therefore it is covered by the DMCA.\n\nSame here. The product activation algorithm is protected. Just because someone broke that protection doesn't mean it's not protected. This is like a burglar buying a new tool to open your locked front door, just because the burglar has this tool doesn't mean your front door isn't locked. So here as well DMCA still applies.\n\n(I assume this has been done because copy protection can have bugs and prevent legitimate users from copying, so they made the legal protection strong so that companies are not forced to create the strongest possible copy protection, which might hurt their customers. )",

Even though the lab may have a legitimate need and a valid license, the use of this tool likely violates the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions. The DMCA protects technological measures that control access to copyrighted works, regardless of the strength or age of those measures. The fact that the Windows XP activation algorithm has been \"cracked\" does not negate its status as a protected mechanism under the DMCA.

She has more assets so a victim could be fully paid sooner than just from her son.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nJurisdiction is Bonneville County, Idaho; inside Idaho Falls city limits.\n\nRe: previous question, I didn't word it well, and some users edited it to remove information which caused answers that weren't applicable anymore. I decided to narrow the focus and try asking again.\n\nUPDATE 2:\nDamages are about $5k. A cop told me later that she's alo responsible for costs because she didn't have insurance, that's where I got the idea about sueing her also. I don't know if he's wrong.\n\nIdaho is an at\\-fault state and requires proof of $25k/$15k bodily and property liability insurance before registering a car. He lives with her and drives her car; therefore he should be on her insurance. They also check VIN every two months with a nationwide database to ensure they still have insurance. Violations include suspended car registration, license suspension, and required SR\\-22 insurance (expensive). Second violation is up to six months jail and up to $1k fine.\n\nThe mom has court history of not having car insurance, but they've been dismissed. It's odd she didn't have card in car each time, so she either she really does forget to put in her car, or she buys a policy the same day as citation to prove to court she was insured and get charges dismissed.\n\nI think she does have insurance, but gave officer cancelled card so she only pays $75 ticket, her rates don't go up, and her son can make payments over several years. I hope by suing her with son, that I can force her to bring forth the insurance or risk a lien on her house, force sale of valuable items, etc.\n\nThat's why I'm hoping to include her in lawsuit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can't sue her for not having insurance. You sue for the damage you suffered.\n\nYou can name her as a defendant alongside her son on the theory that she contributed to the accident by letting her son use the car, and then let the judge sort out who gets landed with the liability. Depending on the rules in your jurisdiction you might have to pay her travel expenses and/or lost wages if the judge decides she wasn't to blame (and the same for her son, but that sounds like a slam\\-dunk).\n\nHowever you might be better off going for [victim restitution](https://www.cdaid.org/1271/departments/legal/prosecuting-attorneys-office/restitutioncrime-victim-compensation). That way the order gets made as part of the criminal case against the son. Less hassle for you, and the state authorities are responsible for actually getting the money out of them.\n\n**Edit:** It turns out that Idaho has the [Family Car Doctrine](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title49/t49ch24/sect49-2417/) in its law, so the mother is legally liable for her son's accident (thanks to ohwilleke for the pointer).",

Idaho has implemented the Family Car Doctrine in its law (Idaho Code \u00a7 49-2417), which makes the owner of a vehicle liable for damages caused by any person using the vehicle with the owner's permission.

In all likelihood, in both most state court systems, and in the federal courts, this would be coded as a robbery cases for statistical purposes, regardless of the actual offenses of conviction. Similarly, the statistical record keeping process might not distinguish between half a dozen different fraud offenses on the books and simply categorize all such offenses as \"fraud\".\n\nWorse yet, it would be common place for the statistical categories used by the judicial branch to be different from the statistical categories used by the department of corrections. In addition, each local jail would typically have its own separate statistical database for people held in its facility which would not have consistent categories with other databases in the state. At the federal level, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, has yet a third (and most detailed) approach to maintaining these records statistically for federal offenses. Also, it isn't uncommon for there to be more than one set of records maintained independently in a single state. This statistical information is typically reported in an agency annual report and sometimes in additional special reports or responses to legislative inquires (usually for budgeting purposes).\n\nFor example, in Colorado, criminal cases in state courts are maintained i a common database, but most municipal court ordinance violation cases are maintained in separate municipal court databases for each separate municipal court, with the exception of additional state databases for traffic offenses that count as \"points\" against your license handled by the DMV, and a separate state database where domestic violence offenses that disqualify someone from gun ownership are registered. In rural lower courts, the record keeping is often solely on paper or is in a computerized database that isn't even connected to the Internet. In urban areas and in federal courts, the records are kept electronically, but still aren't indexed or searchable in the manner you would like.\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, only commonly charged crimes have statistical categories to assign them to at all, with most crimes on the books which are only rarely prosecuted simply lumped into \"not elsewhere classified\" or \"miscellaneous\".\n\nIn addition to those records, the U.S. Justice Department does two kinds of surveys each year which use different categories still. One it does directly in a random statistical survey with a large sample size of crime victims. The other is done through an annual survey of most (but not all) law enforcement agencies in the U.S. on a standard justice department form that gets filled out by some police department middle manager or administrator in each responding agency.\n\nMurders are also kept track of in an independent vital statistics records maintained by coroner and forensic examiner's offices. U.S. immigration officials also keep a tally of deportable offenses reported to them and actions taken on those offenses.\n\nThe contents of the mittimus in a criminal case, which is the final summary statement of the precise offenses for which a criminal defendant was convicted, the sentence imposed for each offense of conviction, and the total sentence in light of which sentences are to be served consecutively and concurrently with each other, would generally not be included in a searchable database. There would be a databased from which you could pull the mittimus in a particular case for a particular offender, but the contents of the mittimus usually wouldn't be searchable. Maybe Oregon has better information systems than most, but I doubt it.\n\nTo get that kind of information, you'd need to do a freedom of information act request or the equivalent (and pay a state employee hefty hourly research fees), or have a legislative committee or administrative officer within the judicial branch or department of corrections authorize the search.\n\nAll of this information is a matter of public record (except in \"sealed\" cases). But gathering the information is very cumbersome.\n\nThere are a couple of social science databases maintained by particular academics, news organizations, or non\\-profit organizations, for particular purposes on a sporadic and incomplete basis that have some of this information, but the extent to which the manager of those databases will allow you to access that data varies wildly, and often that is also not complete.\n\nFor example, my small town hometown newspaper growing up, which published weekly, reported the offense of conviction (by name, not statute number) and the sentence imposed, for every conviction in the city's municipal court in the past week, with the name, age, and address of every convicted offender.\n\nOften the prosecutor's office, the public defender's office, and the leading criminal defense lawyers in a particular county maintain private databases of this information that is more specific, and is almost never shared.",

How long will the record stay in the register?\n\nI do not have a driving license.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. The fine would typically be around your monthly income.  \n\nLegal basis: drunk driving per \u00a7316 StGB is punishable by up to one year in prison, but per \u00a747 and \u00a740 StGB short sentences are converted to a fine that depends on your daily net income (Tagess\u00e4tze).\n2. There is likely no impact. Despite this being a crime, it will not appear in your criminal record that some employers need.  \n\nLegal basis: Per \u00a732 BZRG the criminal record will not show convictions with \u2264 90 Tagess\u00e4tze. However, other government departments can request full access.\n3. You will get three \u201c[Flensburg points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_system_(driving)#Germany)\u201d which has no immediate effect, but can lead to increased penalties for your *next* traffic violation. Where the points have been awarded for a crime, they will expire after 5 or 10 years. You can voluntarily visit seminars to remove points at a rate of one per five years.  \n\nLegal basis: per Appendix 13 FeV, drunk driving (\u00a7316 StGB) gives you two or three Flensburg points, depending on whether your license (implied for bikes) is suspended and the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream. Retention period is covered in \u00a729 StVG. Seminars are covered in \u00a74(7\\) StGB.\n\nOther effects:\n\n* You may be ordered to do the [MPU psychological evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical-psychological_assessment_(Germany)) and can be banned from using a bike if you fail.\n* You will also have to take an MPU if you want to get a driving license.",

Lowe\u2019s Home Centers, LLC,* 18\\-cv\\-03591, 2018 WL 6697181 (N.D. Cal. June 15, 2018\\). See also [Peterson v.

In those cases, arbitration is allowed, but there can be issues over whether the scope of the arbitration agreement includes credit reporting disputes. These tend to be resolved in favor of the party seeking arbitration, however, as was in the case in the 11th Circuit decision in *[Hearn v.

His assailants force him to wear a mask that seriously limits his field of vision. Guards of the plant open fire on John Doe and those that force him to take part at gunpoint.\n\nA person in a bat costume joined the scene during the firefight. We believe this to be the alter Ego of Billionaire Playboy Bruce Wayne. Corroborating testimony by members of the criminal syndicate under the name *Justice League* is outstanding, but we could not serve the Subpoena.\n\nHis mere presence, combined with the death of one of his assaulters, makes poor John Doe jump over a retaining fence into a chemical waste retaining pool that is not covered as standards require, and flushed \\- against regulations \\- its contents into the nearby bay.\n\nThe chemicals permanently disfigured John Doe. In later analysis, Doctors at Arkham Asylum determined, that the psychoactive substances in the pool most likely aided in destroying his sense of morals and empathy, as well as inducing a love\\-hate for the costume of Mr. Wayne.\n\nThe Jury is to refer to the sepia\\-colored pages in the *documentary* [\"The Killing Joke\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke) and not be handed any full\\-colored page, as they happen well after the events of this night and have no relevance to this case.

Are they contributary liable for the crimes this shattered person will commit after the exposure?\n\nPlaintiff concedes that he had no reason to be at Ace Chemical Processing but for the threat of being bodily harmed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ace Chemical would be liable to some extent if, and only if, it were found that they were *negligent*. That the chemical storage retaining pool was not properly covered would be evidence tending to suggest negligence, but the presence of a fence around the pool might tend to weigh against such a finding.\n\nThe question of negligence is always highly fact\\-based, and depends in most cases on what a reasonable person, knowledgeable about the situation, would have done to avoid reasonably foreseeable harm.\n\nThe specific events involving John Doe and Bruce Wayne do not seem foreseeable. But some risk of harm from such a noxious chemical pool does seem plausible, and reasonable precautions would be expected.\n\nIf Ace was found to have been negligent, it might be liable for the medical costs of Doe, and for his pain and suffering, mental distress, and loss of income. But I see no basis to hold Ace liable for the later crimes of Doe, and for the losses of the victims of those crimes.",

Ace Chemical Processing could potentially be held liable for John Doe's immediate injuries (medical costs, pain and suffering, etc.) if they are found to have been negligent in their chemical storage practices. The uncovered chemical pool and improper disposal methods suggest possible negligence. However, liability would depend on whether these practices fell below the standard of what a reasonable person would do to prevent foreseeable harm.\n\nImportantly, Ace Chemical would not be liable for John Doe's future criminal actions. The connection between the chemical exposure and subsequent crimes is too tenuous and not reasonably foreseeable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because automatic liability for all damages and future crimes is not supported by law. Option B is incorrect as Bruce Wayne's presence alone doesn't make him solely responsible for the accident or future actions. Option D is incorrect because while John Doe was trespassing, this doesn't automatically absolve Ace Chemical of all potential liability if they were negligent in maintaining safe premises."

There are a lot of things happening, of course, but there were two incidents that raised some \"legal\" questions in me.\n\nSorry, there may be spoilers.\nAlso, I am not a law person so my wording might not be correct.\n\nIncident one:\n\n> Hostage A is trying to secretly steal a weapon from the heist men,\n>  hostage B (which happens to be an employee of A) sees him \n>  and then A is threatening him that if he says\n>  anything he will fire him after the heist.\n\nIncident two:\n\n> Hostage A and three of the heist men (after a failed escape attempt) are pointing guns at each other, Hostage A threatens them to open the door, the Heist men try to convince him to put the gun down, then,\n>  Hostage C disables Hostage A.\n\nSince the heist is under police handling, could anything you do inside the heist considered as interference with the police work?\ne.g. if the behavior of Hostage A causes a shooting that results in people getting killed \\- but not by Hostage A. Will Hostage A then be responsible for those deaths since he interfered with police work?\n\nIf yes, are the Hostages B and C justified for their behavior for trying to stop Hostage A?\n\nSince the country may matter, just for the sake of it, let's assume that the events take place in Spain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since there hostage scenario has fire arms involved, this should be treated as an Active Shooter Event. In this situation, the common emergency response by the hostages would be first to flee (can't do that, they got trapped inside), the next is to hide/shelter in place and remain there until the police arrive. If a confrontation with a gunman or gunmen is unavoidable the official response is to take whatever measures you believe will get you out of that situation safely. If you have to fight back, fight back. If you feel it is better to talk it out with the gunman, do that. If you feel the need to stay where you are, do that. Each move is equally dangerous at this point and your priority should be saving yourself.\n\nWith that out of the way, Hostage A shouldn't play Bruce Willis, but if he is comfortable with using a weapon to affect his own freedom from the situation, that is his preoperative. The \"threat\" of firing from a job if Hostage B blabs is probably intended as dark humor. If Hostage B were to blab, Hostage A will likely be killed by the heist men, so Hostage B wouldn't get fired by Hostage A and Hostage A knows this... basically, he's admitting the plan is so suicidal that being killed is likely to happen regardless of the situation.\n\nIn situation 2, I don't see any legal repercussions for either Hostages. Hostage A is acting in self\\-defense and thus fighting back against legitment threats to person or persons and hostage C is thinking of their safety if he loses. I'm not sure if it would be the same in Spain, but in the U.S. from the first commission of a crime by the Heist men (taking a hostage), the lives and safety of the hostages are in the hands of the Heist men. Even if Hostage A gets someone killed in his attempt to get everyone free, he is not criminally liable for that death, even though it was his bullet from his gun. Rather, the heist men would be charged with the murder of anyone who died for any reason within the building while they were committing the crime (and some time afterwards). The stray bullet from Hostage A's gun and the life ending heart attack from Little Old Lady Hostage D are both on the heads of the hostage takers.\n\nEither way, unless some plot device accounts for the cops outside not hearing the gun fire, Hostage A will summon the Calvary (cops will hold out peaceful surrender of the heist men and the safe release of the hostages so long as they have assurances that the latter are safe. Gun fire will shatter that assurances and send SWAT in to take out the heist men), so the the 3 to 1 odds are not going to hold for long.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of a hostage situation involving armed criminals, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of a hostage's actions?\n\nA) If a hostage's actions lead to deaths, even indirectly, they would be held legally responsible for interfering with police work.\n\nB) Hostages are legally obligated to remain passive and any action taken to resist or escape could be considered unlawful.\n\nC) Hostages have no legal protections for actions taken in self-defense during the incident, as they should wait for law enforcement to resolve the situation.\n\nD) Hostages generally have legal protections for reasonable actions taken in self-defense or to escape, even if those actions indirectly lead to harm to others.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In a hostage situation, particularly one involving armed criminals, hostages are generally afforded legal protections for reasonable actions taken in self-defense or to escape. This is based on the principle that the hostages' lives are already in danger due to the criminals' actions. Even if a hostage's attempt to escape or defend themselves indirectly leads to harm to others, the legal responsibility for those outcomes typically falls on the criminals who created the dangerous situation in the first place. The law recognizes that hostages may need to take action to protect themselves in extreme circumstances. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they suggest unreasonable restrictions on hostages' rights to self-preservation in a life-threatening situation."

Terry the Troll goes up to Dave and starts insulting him and his mother (etc.), and Dave lashes out and starts trying to beat up Terry.\n\nMy question is if Terry \"cleaned Bob's clock\" in return, could it be considered self\\-defense? Or does Terry's initial taunting disqualify self\\-defense as an excuse?\n\nEdit: Editted to focus only on the self\\-defense question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That depends on whether the legislature has made this a disqualifier. In North Carolina, [G.S. 14\\-51](https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-51.4.pdf) disqualifies a person from using the self\\-defense defense when the person \"Initially provokes the use of force against himself or herself\", with an exception to the disqualification if the attack puts him in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and he cannot withdraw, or if the person has \"retreated\". The initial aggressor doctrine is also part of [Louisiana law](https://lawofselfdefense.com/jury-instruction/la-%C2%A7-623-aggressor-doctrine/). There is a [jury instruction](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Ief9fc262e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29) on this matter in Washington state which further clarifies that\n\n> No person may, by any intentional act reasonably likely to provoke a\n> belligerent response, create a necessity for acting in self\\-defense\n> \\[or] \\[defense of another] and thereupon \\[kill] \\[use, offer, or attempt\n> to use force upon or toward] another person. Therefore, if you find\n> beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the aggressor, and\n> that defendant's acts and conduct provoked or commenced the fight,\n> then self\\-defense \\[or] \\[defense of another] is not available as a\n> defense. \\[**Words alone are not adequate provocation for the defendant\n> to be the aggressor**.]\n\nUnder those circumstances, self\\-defense is not definitively off the table. One would then look at the [general instruction for self defense](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Iefa01084e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29), paying attention to whether Terry has an alternative to using force. On the one hand, in Washington there is no \"duty to retreat\". But force is legal only when necessary. That term is defined in [RCW 9A.16\\.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.010)\n\n> \"Necessary\" means that no reasonably effective alternative to the use\n> of force appeared to exist and that the amount of force used was\n> reasonable to effect the lawful purpose intended.\n\nThe solution, stated in the comments but not the instruction, is that \"the court may need to make clearer to the jury that the defendant was not obliged to retreat rather than defend\". But also, \"At the same time, the prosecutor should not be deprived of the argument that other alternatives to the use of force may have existed\". So the judge will have to also read the [no duty to retreat instruction](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Iefa01090e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29):\n\n> It is lawful for a person who is in a place where that person has a\n> right to be and who has reasonable grounds for believing that \\[he]\n> \\[she] is being attacked to stand \\[his] \\[her] ground and defend against\n> such attack by the use of lawful force. \\[The law does not impose a\n> duty to retreat.] \\[Notwithstanding the requirement that lawful force\n> be \u201cnot more than is necessary,\u201d the law does not impose a duty to\n> retreat. **Retreat should not be considered by you as a \u201creasonably\n> effective alternative.\u201d**]\n\nIn that case, the jury must decide whether it was really necessary for Terry to clean Bob's clock in order to stop Bob's assault.",

While some states have laws that may disqualify an initial provoker from claiming self-defense, others make exceptions if the response was disproportionate or if the provoker attempted to withdraw. Additionally, even if verbal provocation doesn't automatically disqualify self-defense (as noted in the Washington jury instruction), the necessity of the force used is still a key consideration. The jury would need to consider whether Terry had any reasonable alternatives to using force, although in some jurisdictions like Washington, retreat is not considered a \"reasonably effective alternative.\" Therefore, the specific laws of the jurisdiction and the circumstances of the case, including available alternatives to force, would be crucial in determining the validity of Terry's self-defense claim."

It was fired by the [*HMS Vengeance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Vengeance_(S31)) from the *Royal Navy* (Britain). In the preamble to the *Treaty on the Non\\-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons*, for which Britain was a [depositary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty), I read the following:\n\n> Desiring to further the easing of international tension and the\n>  strengthening of trust between States in order to facilitate the\n>  cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of\n>  all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national\n>  arsenals of nuclear weapons *and the means of their delivery* pursuant\n>  to a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and\n>  effective international control,\n> \n> \n> Recalling that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,\n>  States must refrain in their international relations from the threat\n>  or use of force against the territorial integrity or political\n>  independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with\n>  the Purposes of the United Nations, and that the establishment and\n>  maintenance of international peace and security are to be promoted\n>  with the least diversion for armaments of the worlds human and\n>  economic resources,\n> \n> \n> \\[ From the preamble of the [*Treaty on the Non\\-Proliferation of Nuclear\n>  Weapons*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty) (NPT) (1968\\) ]\n\nThere are also a series of international legal instruments such as [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing#Treaties_against_testing) which prohibit the formal testing of nuclear weapons which [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing) introduces as the \"experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability of nuclear weapons\".\n\n---\n\n* Would a country be technically conducting a *nuclear weapons test* according to any international legal instruments by doing what Britain was reported as doing?\n* Irrespective of whether such doings were formally a nuclear\nweapons test or not, would such a test infringe on any rule of\ninternational law?\n\t+ In particular, are there any rules of international law allowing or prohibiting a country from so testing *ballistic missiles*?

Nothing in the news piece you link to support that supposition, the general idea is a missile that was launched towards the Atlantic Ocean that steered off route.\n\n1. From your link:\n\n> The treaty recognizes five states as nuclear\\-weapon states.\n\nThe NPT limits **other states** from researching (including testing) nuclear weapons and/or delivery vehicles. In exchange, they get access to nuclear technology for civilian purposes.\n\nTreaty preambles are general, introductory texts that explain the intent of the treaty. They are not binding, and the language clearly shows it (Hint: It states \"Desiring to\", \"Recalling to\". Binding agreements use \"Shall\", \"Shall not\", \"May\" or \"May not\", and are more specific about what are the restrictions).\n2. As stated above, the test was not \"in North\\-America\". It was from international waters \"towards Africa\", probably to be sunk before it reached land1. There is no notion anywhere that there was an intention of violating the airspace of any country.\n\nCertainly, the UK would be responsable if one of their missiles test fails and the missile ends causing damages, and the USA can protest any violation of its airspace, even if unintentional. But it is not \"a test of ballistic missiles in North America\", and certainly the USA has no more rights outside its territorial waters than, say, Gambia does.\n\nThe only restriction would be the internationally stablished procedures for testing missiles, which are setup to avoid any kind of issues (the test scheduled date and path is published2 with time enough for third parties to take notice).\n\nSo yes, it is [business as usual](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38716446).\n\n---",

The UK, as one of the five recognized nuclear-weapon states under the NPT, is not restricted from testing delivery systems like ballistic missiles. The preamble of the NPT, while expressing desires for disarmament, is not legally binding. The test reportedly occurred in international waters, not North American territory, and would be permissible as long as proper international notification procedures were followed. There is no blanket prohibition on ballistic missile tests under international law, especially for NPT-recognized nuclear states.

A small child rushes under the car, s/he can't swerve, and kills the child. \n\nExample 2: Someone is driving in the same neighborhood at 30 mph, as recorded by a policeman who arrested him after he hit a child. That's well above the 15 mph considered \"safe.\" This represents a \"reckless disregard\" for safety.\n\nExample 3: Someone is driving at 10 mph, but is DUI, according to a breathelyzer test conducted by a cop shortly after he hit the child.\n\nAssume the facts are as stipulated above, and there are no evidentiary issues. Is it true that Cases 2 and 3 would be easy to prove in a tort action, and case 1 would be very difficult? Why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All torts have to be proved.\n----------------------------\n\n**In 99\\.99% of cases the proof is by admission of the tortfeaser.**\n\nThat is, they agree to pay damages with or without admission of liability.\n\nWhere liability is contested, there are never any \u201cslam dunks\u201d. There are strong cases, even very strong cases, but when someone else is deciding the case, there are no certainties. Remember, if your opponent thought they were going to lose, they\u2019d settle.\n\nLooking at your examples, it seems that the tort you are thinking of is negligence. In order to establish negligence as a Cause of Action under the law of torts, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant:\n\n1. had a duty to the plaintiff,\n2. breached that duty by failing to conform to the required standard of conduct (generally the standard of a reasonable person),\n3. the negligent conduct was, in law, the cause of the harm to the plaintiff, and\n4. the plaintiff was, in fact, harmed or damaged.\n\nWhere the issue is not one of evidence, that is, the facts are as you say and are not in dispute, the question is not \u201cwhat happened\u201d, but \u201cis what happened negligence\u201d.\n\nFor all the examples, 1, 3, and 4 are probably not in dispute: there was a duty, the conduct caused damage at law and the plaintiff actually suffered harm. The question to be decided is whether the driver failed to conform to the required standard of care.\n\nFor examples 2 and 3, most courts would conclude they didn\u2019t. For example 1, some courts might decide that the way the driver drove did conform to the required standard and others that they didn\u2019t.

The documentation emphasizes that there are no \"slam dunks\" in contested liability cases, even when the evidence seems strong. While cases involving speeding (Example 2) or DUI (Example 3) might appear easier to prove negligence, the key factor is whether the driver's conduct failed to meet the required standard of care.

Same as 2?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: National territory\n------------------\n\nIt depends on the nation. Some countries or jurisdictions have specific laws about meteorites, like the [Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia) [Museum Act 1969, ss. 43\\-45](https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/prod/filestore.nsf/FileURL/mrdoc_1471.pdf/$FILE/Museum%20Act%201969%20-%20%5B02-a0-11%5D.pdf?OpenElement), which provides that meteorites are Crown property (there are many meteorites in the Nullarbor Plain). Absent any specific rule like this, meteorites are likely to be treated in any of the following ways \\-\n\n1. **It's a rock.** Mineral rights (which often go along with ownership of the land in general, but can be separately assigned) may apply to meteorites on the grounds (haha) that they are rocks which can be treated as part of the land on which they fell. There may be special law vesting certain kinds of mineral finds in the State, should you be dealing with a meteorite made of gold, for example. Mineral law is a specialist topic even within national law, so the exact answer here may depend on a lot of factors \\- what the thing is made of, whether it's above ground or not, etc. \\- but the probable starting point is that rocks from space are no different in law from the rocks that were already there.\n2. **It's an object that has no clear owner.** There are longstanding principles for \"unowned things\" in civil and common law systems, typically applying to wild animals or other things that are naturally occurring and not part of the *land* as such. If a meteorite is \"res nullius\" in this sense, then it might belong to the finder or to the landowner, depending on exactly which flavor of legal tradition is followed.\n3. **It's a valuable find.** There are similar rules about \"treasure trove\", for example in the United Kingdom which gives rights to the Crown. But a meteorite would not be classed as treasure in the UK, because it is an \"[unworked natural object](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/24/section/1)\". Other jurisdictions might draw these boundaries differently.\n4. **It's an object of scientific importance.** A meteorite might be classed as \"cultural property\" within the meaning of the [U.N. Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 1970](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html), as transposed into local law. The Convention covers \"rare collections and specimens of \\[...] minerals\", and objects of paleontological or archaeological interest. This could affect somebody's ability to export or destroy the object (for the latter, see also the [2003 UNESCO Declaration](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17718&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html) which includes \"cultural heritage linked to a natural site\"). National law might contain its own similar provisions.\n\nInternational waters and the poles\n----------------------------------\n\nThe [U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, Part XI](https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf) governs mineral exploitation in \"the Area\", meaning the part of the seabed that does not belong to any nation. Activities of this kind are meant to be under the auspices of the [International Seabed Authority](https://www.isa.org.jm/), which has copious rules about application and approval, navigation, environmental controls, and so on \\- subject to the Convention principle of treating the seabed as \"the common heritage of mankind\". This Area includes the North Pole.\n\nThe South Pole is part of the area covered by the [Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, 1991](https://documents.ats.aq/recatt/Att006_e.pdf), which provides in its Article 7 that\n\n> Any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited.\n\nIn practice, as in international law generally, States might do all sorts of other things. But this is the broad legal position. It might be that States would agree a special regime applicable to the totally unprecedented circumstances, or that it would be a free\\-for\\-all.\n\nAgain, I'm assuming that the applicable principles for digging up a space rock for commercial purposes are the same as for other kinds of rock. There is international law about space rocks *when they are in space*, and about human\\-made objects *when they crash down to Earth*, but seemingly no special provision for meteorites.",

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal ownership of this meteorite?\n\nA) The meteorite belongs to the homeowner as it landed on their private property.\nB) The meteorite is considered \"res nullius\" and belongs to whoever finds it first.\nC) The meteorite is Crown property according to the Western Australia Museum Act 1969.\nD) The meteorite belongs to the International Seabed Authority as it's from space.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, Western Australia has specific legislation regarding meteorites. The Western Australia Museum Act 1969, sections 43-45, explicitly states that meteorites are Crown property. This law takes precedence over general principles of property ownership or finder's rights. \n\nOption A is incorrect because even though the meteorite landed on private property, local laws supersede general property rights in this case. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while the concept of \"res nullius\" (ownerless things) exists in some legal systems, it doesn't apply here due to the specific legislation in Western Australia.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the International Seabed Authority's jurisdiction is limited to the seabed in international waters, not objects falling from space onto land.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how specific local laws can override general principles of property rights, especially in unusual cases like meteorite landings."

Is it legal to carry the out\\-of\\-state ID card alongside a form of Texas identification?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Federal Code of Regulations (37\\.29\\)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2010-title6-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title6-vol1-sec37-29.pdf) Prohibits holding more than one REAL ID card or more than one driver's license:\n\n> (a) An individual may hold only one REAL ID card. An individual cannot hold a REAL ID driver\u2019s license and a REAL ID identification card simultaneously. Nothing shall preclude an individual from holding a REAL ID card and a non\\-REAL ID card unless prohibited by his or her State.\n\nIf the out\\-of\\-state identification card is REAL ID compliant then it is illegal at the Federal level to hold both that ID card and a REAL ID compliant driver's license.\n\nThe State of Texas has been [producing REAL ID compliant driver's](http://www.dps.texas.gov/driverlicense/federalrealidact.htm) licenses since 2016\\.\n\nThe State of Texas is required, when issuing a REAL ID compliant driver's license, to check if the recipient holds a REAL ID card issued by another state. If so, then Texas is required to take steps to confirm that the ID card from the other state has been, or is being, terminated.\n\n[Section 521\\.009 of the Texas Transportation Code](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TN/htm/TN.521.htm) defines two types of certificates: election identification certificate and personal identification certificate.\n\nUnder Section 521\\.451, it is a general violation to possess more than one driver's license OR more than one valid certificate.\n\nSection 521\\.183 states that a person only has to surrender identification certificates issued by Texas in order to get a driver's license.\n\nThis would seem to imply that it is not necessary to surrender, under Texas law, an ID card issued by another state in order to get a Texas driver's license.\n\nSome states, such as [California](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/realid), issue both REAL ID compliant and non\\-compliant driver licenses and ID cards. The recipient decides which type of card is issued.\n\nFrom the [Department of Homeland Security FAQ](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs) regarding non\\-citizens:\n\n> REAL ID allows compliant states to issue driver's licenses and identification cards where the identity of the applicant cannot be assured or for whom lawful presence is not determined. In fact, some states currently issue such noncompliant cards to undocumented individuals. These cards must clearly state on their face (and in the machine readable zone) that it is not acceptable for official purposes and must use a unique design or color to differentiate them from compliant cards. DHS cautions against assuming that possession of a noncompliant card indicates the holder is an undocumented individual, given that several states issue noncompliant licenses for reasons unrelated to lawful presence.",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding John's situation?\n\nA) John can legally keep both his Texas driver's license and his California ID card as long as he only uses one for official purposes.\n\nB) John must destroy his California ID card immediately upon receiving his Texas driver's license.\n\nC) John can keep both IDs if his Texas driver's license is not REAL ID compliant.\n\nD) John is in violation of federal regulations by possessing both a REAL ID compliant Texas driver's license and a REAL ID compliant California ID card.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the Federal Code of Regulations (37.29), an individual may hold only one REAL ID card and cannot hold a REAL ID driver's license and a REAL ID identification card simultaneously. Since John's California ID is REAL ID compliant, and Texas has been producing REAL ID compliant driver's licenses since 2016, John is likely in violation of this federal regulation. Texas is required to check for and confirm the termination of REAL ID cards from other states when issuing a new REAL ID compliant license. While Texas law doesn't explicitly require surrendering out-of-state IDs, federal regulations take precedence in this case, making option D the correct answer."

So, any U.S. law passed by Congress after 1949 could override the Geneva Convention of 1949 on this topic. I am not certain that Congress has passed such a law, but it seems likely that it has done so.\n\nIn Japan (and most countries), a domestic statute cannot override an international treaty which can only be abrogated in the manner set forth in the treaty.\n\nU.S. law is also more likely to hold that a treaty is not \"self\\-executing\" than Japanese law, on average, so many treaties are not considered directly enforceable under U.S. law until an implementing statute is passed, even though other countries would consider the same treaty to be directly enforceable without implementing domestic legislation.\n\nOf course, either country could argue that an \"AI\" was a person who just happened to give their instructions much earlier than a usual driver.

The key difference lies in how the two countries treat conflicts between domestic laws and international treaties. In the United States, when there is a conflict between a treaty and a statute enacted by Congress, the most recently enacted law takes precedence. This means that any U.S. law passed after 1949 could potentially override the Geneva Convention's requirements regarding drivers. \n\nIn contrast, in Japan (as in most other countries), domestic statutes cannot override international treaties. Treaties can only be changed or nullified through processes specified within the treaty itself. This means that Japan is more strictly bound by the treaty's language, which could pose challenges for testing autonomous vehicles without human drivers.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage doesn't discuss the relative strictness of domestic laws in Japan and the US. Answer B is incorrect because the information states that both countries have ratified the treaty.

I don't see a declaration of \"I\n> live here\" which is required by law in certain circumstances equates\n> to \"sending letters here will reach me\" ... and it is an assumption\n> made incorrectly and encoded in our current legal system\n\nI think that you've figured out the problem. This is encoded in our current legal system. There are all sorts of laws, case law precedents and contract terms that hold as a matter of law that a letter sent through the postal system addressed to your physical residential address is a reasonable way to give notice to you.\n\nProblems With Designating A Non\\-Residential Address As Your Residence\n======================================================================\n\nThis puts you in a bit of a bind.\n\nOn one hand, if you use the address where you usually do receive packages as your residential address, but you don't really reside there, you are being untruthful which could be a problem in and of itself, and it could have all sorts of unintended consequences (e.g. it could cause you office to be charged with violating land use laws that don't allow that building to be used as a residence, and it might cause you to pay commercial rather than residential rates for utility services at home).\n\nYou could also be accused of evading service of process via a process server if a process server shows up at your purported residential address and finds that it is not, in fact, a residence, which could cause you problems. Indeed, as a lawyer, I've encountered several cases where defendants who are con\\-men or otherwise engaged in fraudulent activities declare a residential address that is really a private mail drop even though the actually live in a house rather far from that location for the express purpose of making them harder to find or to serve with legal process, and have had to seek extraordinary relief from the courts to obtain substituted service of process on these defendants as a result.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think that there is a way to opt out of receiving physical post as an individual.\n\nCollective Abandonment Of Physical Addresses\n============================================\n\nI am familiar with some entire communities that manage that, however.\n\nFor example, at many colleges and universities, students can take mail exclusively at a post office box in a college mail room for the duration of their stay at college that is not attached to the physical address of their residence, without being viewed as deceptive or improper in any way.\n\nSimilarly, in a number of seasonal resort communities, mail is delivered only to a central mailroom and there is no mail delivery to physical addresses in the community, saving the postal service effort and providing greater convenience for seasonal residents.\n\nGeneral Delivery Addresses\n==========================\n\nIn the United States we also have a somewhat outdated concept called general delivery mail service, although I don't know if it exists in the U.K. This is useful mostly for mail intended for homeless people or urban nomads who have no fixed physical address. Instead, mail for these people is sent to the general delivery bin at a post office that is convenient to them and they can walk into the post office to ask if there is any mail for them in the general delivery bin from time to time without having to pay for a post office box of their own.\n\nGeneral delivery mail can sometimes be used in a manner similar to that of sending mail to the physical address of someone who usually doesn't take mail at a physical address to give them notice, which is a bad thing because most general delivery mail is never picked up.\n\nPractical Solutions\n===================\n\nFrom a practical perspective, probably the most viable option is to claim as your legal residence the physical home of a family member or close friend where you now and then stay overnight, and with whom you are in touch by phone, etc., and then to not inform the world or bureaucratic paperwork about where you actually rest your head most nights.\n\nThis is an approach that is often used by people with careers or the equivalent that leave them on the road most of the time (e.g. explorers, archaeologists, traveling salespeople, people in maritime occupations, circus people, retirees who travel often, people who actually spend most nights with a significant other but aren't married, etc.).\n\nAs long as you have some physical address that you can call home with a straight face even if you don't spend much time there, that meets the needs of having a postal address at which you can be reached, the bureaucracies of the world will generally tolerate you, even if you don't spend much time there.",
