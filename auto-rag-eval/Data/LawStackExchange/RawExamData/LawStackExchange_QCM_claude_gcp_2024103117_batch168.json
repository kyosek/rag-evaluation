These were qualified people who prepared briefs for barristers in the Common Law courts. The attorneys equivalents in the Chancellery courts were called solicitors.\n\nWhen the courts were merged in the UK in the late 19th century, the term solicitor was kept and attorney was abolished.\n\nAt about the same time, the courts in the US merged but the Americans kept attorney and abandoned solicitor. Solicitor is still used in some parts of the US to refer to a government lawyer, particularly in the office of [solicitor general](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States).\n\nThe US as well as Commonwealth countries have both an Attorney General and a Solicitor General.

The United States retained the term \"attorney\" as the primary title for legal professionals, evolving from the original meaning of a person appointed to handle legal affairs. While the UK merged attorneys and solicitors under the title \"solicitor\" in the late 19th century, the US kept \"attorney\" and largely abandoned \"solicitor.\" However, the term \"solicitor\" is still used in some parts of the US, particularly for government lawyers like the Solicitor General. This answer accurately reflects the historical development and current usage of these terms in the US legal system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the US did not abandon \"attorney\" in favor of \"solicitor.\" Option B is wrong because the UK did not adopt \"barrister\" as the merged title, and the US did not abandon \"attorney.\" Option D is incorrect because while \"lawyer\" is used colloquially, the official title remains \"attorney,\" and \"solicitor\" is still used in specific contexts."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18549/can-heirs-keep-living-in-the-house-of-a-missing-person-before-death-is-known-or", "docs_id": 18549, "title": "Can heirs keep living in the house of a missing person before death is known or assumed?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose someone went missing and no body is found, nor any other sign of what became of her.

These are illegal because they contain the melodies of famous songs and are sold without paying royalties to the songwriters. Until 2004 there was no legal version of these books available anywhere, yet it was impossible to be a professional jazz musician without one. So people copied and/or sold them illegally. Hal Leanord and Sher Music now publish legal versions that do pay royalties where required (which includes more than 95% of the tunes). \n\nI am looking for a way to legalize an old (originally illegal) copy of a Real Book, but I don't want to pay as much as one penny to either publisher because they are part of a \"music industry\" that I do not want to support. There are many reasons, for example the \"industry\" artificially narrows the focus of popular music to increase profit while reducing production costs. There are also practical reasons, for example the publishers changed the repertoire in the new legal versions of the books, so some of the old tunes are missing. Is there a way I can pay royalties where they are due, without conceding any benefit to these publication companies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Before you assume that the books are illegal, you need to inspect the terms of the agreement between author and publisher, if any. Very many publications are completely legal and give no royalties to the author (95% of mine are royalty\\-free). An author may transfer copyright to a publisher, or he may license its publication. An actual transfer needs to be in writing, but a license can be implicit (and often was, again most of my earlier papers). When you see a copyright sign and the name of the publisher, that does not mean that the publisher has the copyright to the entire content: it may only have copyright in the arrangement of works, and individual authors control their own works.\n\nA truly illegal work would be one where the publisher takes the author's work and copies it without permission. Publishers don't break into authors' property and steal manuscripts. The burden of proof does rest on the publisher to show that they have permission, which could be in the form of letters saying that a work was to be published in some compilation; corrected page proofs; and various other ways of signalling agreement.\n\nA likely source of truly illegal copying would be re\\-publishing previously published works, e.g. Smith licenses the right to re\\-print a work from original publisher Jones. In that case, (1\\) it matters whether Jones got a transfer of copyright, vs. relied on licensing and (2\\) whether in the latter case the original license prohibits sub\\-licensing. If Jones relies on implicit licensing, they would have a hard time establishing that sub\\-licensing was part of the implicit sub\\-license.\n\nSupposing that your copy is truly illegal, there is no way to make it legal, because the illegality is copying without permission, and the copying is a *fait accompli*. Permission would have to be granted by the rights\\-holder to the publisher: the owner of the book does not need permission from the author to own the book, they need the permission of the publisher or publisher's agent (e.g. the bookstore). And you have that, in the form of a standard sales contract (assuming you didn't steal the book).\n\nThe foregoing is general stuff about copyright: there is a second concern not about the book, but the right to publicly perform. [17 USC 106(4\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) gives the author the exclusive right\n\n> in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,\n>  pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to\n>  perform the copyrighted work publicly\n\nSupposing that you don't just want to own the book, you want to use it in performances, then you need a license to do so. You might directly contact an author and attempt to negotiate permission to perform, but this would be quite a burden (especially if the author is deceased), and also not foolproof. The problem is that the author may not actually know what the legal status of his copyright is \\-\\- he may have just signed a form without thinking about what he was signing, and might have transferred his copyright to the publisher.\n\nRegardless of the license / transfer question about the author and original publisher, the fact that you have acquired a copy of the book does not mean that you have a right to publicly perform. Presumably you know that, and have a performance license.\n\n[ASCAP claims](https://www.ascap.com/~/media/655449c494b748ba89edc4864655e1b6.pdf) that it rewards songwriters; [BMI](https://www.bmi.com/licensing/entry/business_using_music_bmi_and_performing_rights) and [SESAC](https://www.sesac.com/Repertory/Terms.aspx) do likewise. I have no idea how true that is and especially how vigorously they trace the legal history of a work. You can identify individual authors and directly compensate them for their work (assuming you can locate the author; then figure out a just reward).

Additionally, they would need to demonstrate quantifiable financial damages resulting from this activity, such as costs for psychological counseling.

This agreement should specify that Sarah is paying for the modifications and that these are considered gifts to the property, with no expectation of equity or ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because who pays directly for the items or contractors is not the crucial factor in preventing disputes.\n\nOption B, while maintaining financial separation, does not address the core issue of preventing future disagreements about ownership or equity.\n\nOption D is insufficient because verbal agreements can be disputed and are harder to enforce. A written agreement provides clear documentation of the parties' intentions.\n\nThe key point from the documentation is that a clearly written and signed agreement supersedes any presumptions that might arise from the parties' conduct alone, making it the most effective way to prevent or resolve potential disputes."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16808/is-there-any-way-to-renounce-citizenship-of-a-foreign-country-legally-in-the-u-s", "docs_id": 16808, "title": "Is there any way to renounce citizenship of a foreign country legally in the U.S.?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have dual citizenship of Japan and Iran, and I'm studying in the U.S. for the past six years through F\\-1 visa. I've lived in Japan for the first 15 years of my life, and I've never visited Iran. Since Japan doesn't recognize dual citizenship status, I needed to renounce Iranian citizenship, which I obtained by birth from my father of Iranian origin and is almost impossible to renounce. However, Japan recognizes renouncement of foreign citizenship just through a short paperwork, which is processed only within Japanese legal system. However, this renouncement system is local and not necessarily considered valid oversea. Does the U.S. have a similar system? If not, does this Japanese system of renouncement of citizenship have any effect in the U.S.? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We do not have a law requiring you to renounce citizenships that you might hold, like the [Nationality Law](http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html). I am not sure what you mean saying that renouncement is processed only within the Japanese legal system \\-\\- that is how it is everywhere, and there is no international authority or clearing house that handles citizenship renunciations. The effect of renouncing Japanese citizenship would be that you are then no longer a citizen of Japan: I can't find an explicit law prohibiting an exclusively\\-Japanese citizen from renouncing his citizenship and becoming stateless. A dual citizen would then be exclusively a citizen if \"the other country\", thus you would become strictly an Iranian citizen.\n\nAccording to the [Civil Code of Iran](http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf) you would be an Iranian citizen under clause 2 of Article 976\\. Article 977 allows accept a different citizenship but that would not apply if you have an Iranian father (and I guess does not actually get rid of your Iranian citizenship). Article 988 sets conditions for Iranians to abandon their nationality: you must be 25 or older, have renounced all property rights in Iran by transfer to Iranian nationals, have done your military service, and, have approval of the [Council of Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iranian_officials#Council_of_Ministers). So yeah, not possible.\n\nArticle 14 of the Japanese Nationality Law requires you to \"choose either of the nationalities\" before reaching 22, and furthermore\n\n> Choice of Japanese nationality shall be made either by depriving\n>  himself or herself of the foreign nationality or **by the declaration\n>  provided for in the Family Registration Law in which he or she swears\n>  that he or she chooses to be a Japanese national and that he or she\n>  renounces the foreign nationality** (hereinafter referred to as\n>  \u201cdeclaration of choice \u201d)\n\nArticle 16 says \"A Japanese national who has made the declaration of choice shall **endeavour** to deprive himself or herself of the foreign nationality\". \n\nThe bold part above seems to resolve that paradox, although that is based on a US\\-style interpretation of law and working from a translation of the law. That is, the requirement is that you try, not that you succeed (which is impossible in the case of a person with an Iranian father).\n\nThere would be an effect in the US. If you renounce Japanese citizenship, you're strictly an Iranian national, and that has one consequence. What is not clear is whether the US recognizes, in any way, a renunciation which Iran doesn't recognize. [This case](http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/industrial/06-25183.h1.pdf) features a person with renounced Iranian citizenship (he is also a US citizen), who was approved for a security clearance based in part on his renounciation.

The information provided suggests that the U.S. may recognize an individual's attempt to renounce Iranian citizenship, even if Iran itself does not accept the renunciation. This is supported by the mentioned case where a person with renounced Iranian citizenship was approved for a security clearance, indicating that the U.S. does not necessarily require Iran's acceptance of the renunciation.

One video dealt with a group that had kicked out their DM and gotten another DM, and DM1 had then gone after DM2 for \"stealing his campaign\". No actual legal threats were made, but this got me wondering if DM1 might have had some sort of standing.\n\nAs a quick overview, in a tabletop RPG, the Dungeon Master (exact nomenclature varies between rpg systems) creates an outline for a narrative he wants the players' characters to participate in. This outline is generally called a campaign. The players, for their part, design their characters with more or less input from the DM. They players and DM then get together to flesh out the outline of the narrative through basically improv theater and combat simulation using polyhedral dice.\n\nSo, clearly this is a group effort and the players have a great deal of input in the creative process of fleshing out the storyline. Ergo, they'd have some degree of copyright to the ongoing story outlined by the DM.\n\nMy question is, do the players have enough copyright to ask someone else to pick up from where the previous DM left off and essentially create a derivative work? Or, can an ousted DM pretty much vindicate the group's decision by taking the new DM to court to prevent them from continuing the story?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That is going to depend on the details of exactly who does what, and how much is written down. It will also depend on the agreements between the people involved, which may well be verbal or implied. I don't know of any actual cases where such a dispute came to a copyright lawsuit. As copyright suits largely deal with **financial** harms and damages, and in most individual game there is little or no financial impact, a suit might be unlikely in most cases. But lets look at some possibilities.\n\nIn the typical case, the game organizer or DM creates a setting and outline for a series of sessions. This is likely to include maps, descriptions of rooms or locations, descriptions of artifacts, descriptions of non\\-player characters, locations and types of monsters and other hazards, and other such background. This is probably mostly or fully written down (which includes being recorded on some sort of computer file.) It is therefore protected by copyright, and the initial owner of that copyright is its creator, probably the DM. (In some cases the DM uses a published \"module\" and makes only limited changes, in which case the DM would only hold copyright on those changes, if anything.)\n\nThen the players create characters, in a process that may be supervised by the DM, and possibly participated in by other players. Each player would probably hold copyright to the description of his or her own character, but the DM or other players might be considered to be co\\-authors of that, depending on their degree of participation.\n\nThen the players start having playing sessions, each player controlling the actions of a character (or perhaps more than one), and the DM more\\-or\\-less controlling the rest of the world, guided by the pre\\-created maps and descriptions. Some of those will be shared with the players, or modified (partial) versions of them will be. Events of the sessions may or may not be written down (or otherwise preserved in a tangible form). If they are not, there is no copyright on them. If they are, there is a copyright, and all the players and the DM are probably co\\-authors.\n\nNow lets look and agreements and ownership. The DM probably owns his or her notes, S/he has at least permitted players to use any that have been revealed to the players. The group has probably agreed (implicitly) to co\\-create the adventure as it happens. There probably are no written agreements about any of this.\n\nIf a dispute arises, the DM is legally free to withhold the campaign notes, maps, etc that have not been shared with the players. Whether s/he can legally demand that the players not further use the parts of the setting that had been previously revealed is not so clear. It would depend on what the agreement between the DM and the players said; on, in effect, what license the DM had granted to the players. And since there was probably no written agreement, and quite likely not even an explicit verbal agreement, it would depend on what a court found they had agreed on by implication, based on their actions, and the usual customs of such groups. Sorting that out would be loads of fun. It might involve significant legal fees.\n\nThe DM is unlikely to hold any exclusive copyright on the previous events of the campaign. Most likely everyone who participates would be a co\\-author of those. Unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary, any co\\-author of any shared work has the right to use, and license the use of, the shared work, although s/he must account to the others for any profits.\n\nThe DM certainly has no legal right to forbid the same group from playing together with a different DM (absent a very improbable contract giving such a right). The DM can only control the maps and notes s/he created independently.\n\nIf a professional DM is involved, as a comment mentions is possible, it might be more likely that an explicit wri9tten contract between the players and the DM will have been agreed to, If so, its terms will control, whatever they are, unless they are somehow contrary to law. Such a pro DM might be more defensive of copyrights, but would not have any more rights than any DM, except as a specific contract might have provided them.\n\nI doubt that the courts will see many actual lawsuits over such issues.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a tabletop roleplaying game, a dispute arises between the original Dungeon Master (DM1) and a new Dungeon Master (DM2) over the continuation of a campaign.

DM1 would likely own the copyright to their original campaign notes, maps, and other materials they created independently. However, the events that occurred during play sessions would probably be considered co-authored by all participants (DM and players), as they all contributed to the narrative. This co-authorship complicates any potential legal action, as any co-author typically has the right to use and license the shared work. Additionally, there are often implicit agreements and customs in gaming groups that further complicate the legal landscape.

States may also have specific provisions relating to the possession of falsified documents, but generally it is not criminal unless the possessor is aware it is a false document, and that it will be used to secure some advantage.\n\n**Fraud**\n\nFor example the [Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s192E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s192e.html) states: \n\n> (1\\) A person who, by any deception, dishonestly:  \n> \n>  (a) obtains property belonging to another, or  \n> \n>  (b) obtains any financial advantage or causes any financial disadvantage,  \n> \n>  is guilty of the offence of fraud.\n\n**Forgery**\n\nAdditionally, [s253 of the same Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s253.html) states:\n\n> A person who makes a false document with the intention that the person or another will use it: \n> \n> \n> (a) to induce some person to accept it as genuine, and \n> \n> \n> (b) because of its being accepted as genuine:  \n> \n>  (i) to obtain any property belonging to another, or  \n> \n>  (ii) to obtain any financial advantage or cause any financial disadvantage, or  \n> \n>  (iii) to influence the exercise of a public duty, \n> \n> \n> is guilty of the offence of forgery.  \n> \n> Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.\n\n... and s255 (also see s254, which contains very similar provisions for the actual *use* of false documents):\n\n> A person who has in his or her possession a false document, knowing that it is false, with the intention that the person or another will use it:\n> \n> \n> (a) to induce some person to accept it as genuine, and \n> \n> \n> (b) because of its being accepted as genuine:\n> \n> \n> (i) to obtain any property belonging to another, or  \n> \n>  (ii) to obtain any financial advantage or cause any financial disadvantage, or  \n> \n>  (iii) to influence the exercise of a public duty, \n> \n> \n> is guilty of an offence.  \n> \n> Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.\n\n... and [s307C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s307c.html):\n\n> (1\\) A person is guilty of an offence if:\n> \n> \n> (a) the person produces a document to another person, and  \n> \n>  (b) the person does so knowing that the document is false or misleading, and  \n> \n>  (c) the document is produced in compliance or purported compliance with a law of the State.  \n> \n> Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years, or a fine of 200 penalty units, or both. \n> \n> \n> (2\\) Subsection (1\\) does not apply if the document is not false or misleading in a material particular. \n> \n> \n> (3\\) Subsection (1\\) does not apply to a person who produces a document if the document is accompanied by a written statement signed by the person or, in the case of a body corporate, by a competent officer of the body corporate:\n> \n> \n> (a) stating that the document is, to the knowledge of the first\\-mentioned person, false or misleading in a material particular, and  \n> \n>  (b) setting out, or referring to, the material particular in which the document is, to the knowledge of the first\\-mentioned person, false or misleading. \n> \n> \n> (4\\) The burden of establishing a matter referred to in subsection (2\\) or (3\\) lies on the accused person.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord forges a tenant's signature on a security bond refund form to claim half of the bond without the tenant's knowledge.

Sign language is recognized as a legitimate form of communication in legal contexts, equivalent to spoken language. The Miranda warning's use of the word \"say\" is interpreted broadly to include all forms of communication, not just verbal speech. This includes sign language, written statements, and even non-verbal gestures like nods or head shakes. The purpose of the Miranda warning is to inform suspects that any form of communication they use to express themselves can be used as evidence, regardless of the method of communication. Therefore, false statements made in sign language during a police interview can indeed be used against the suspect in court, just as spoken false statements would be."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6090/marital-property-in-nj-spouse-have-right-to-use-car", "docs_id": 6090, "title": "Marital property in NJ: spouse have right to use car?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The question is simple, but the situation is anything but. The bare bones info: my friend's son is a new driver who just had a minor, but scary, brush with the law. There is an extra car in this family, as my friend's husband kept his existing car when he purchased a newer one. \n\nHoping to get her son's attention, my friend would like to store his somewhat sporty car at another location, while her son would drive her own 15 year\\-old car, and she would use her husband's older car. This way the stored car would be an incentive toward some improvement and responsible behavior on her son's part, before it would be his to use again.\n\nMy friend's husband is refusing to \"allow\" her to use the car, as his way of forcing his own idea that the sporty car should be sold as a punishment. Does my friend have a right to the car as marital property, even though it's in the husband's name only? \n\nThey've been married 25yrs, so everything mentioned here has been acquired during the marriage, and, if it matters, she is the primary earner, but did not pay for the car.\n\nI'm not intending this as a discussion of parenting, and no one is talking divorce or any other legal action, I would simply like to know whether the car is jointly owned (and hers to use) under NJ law, even though his name is the only one on the title. \n\nI hope this is an ok question for this site. \nThanks much!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: New Jersey is not a community property state, but it is an [equitable distribution](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-jersey-law/new-jersey-marital-property-laws.html) state. This means that in a divorce marital property is divided, not automatically 50\\-50, but in a way that seems financially fair to the supervising judge, or according to an agreement entered into by both spouses. This also means that the state considers a car bought during the course of the marriage \"marital property\". There are also special rules for property bought before May 28 1980, which do not seem to apply in the case in the question. \n\nHowever, \"marital property\" mostly applies when a marriage ends which the question says is not in view here. NJ does allow for a car to be titled to only one, or to both. A title with both names may read \"John Doe OR Mary Doe\" or \"John Doe AND Mary Doe\". In the AND case both spouses must sign to sell or borrow against the car, in the OR case either signature will do. If only one name is on the title, that person must sign to sell or borrow.\n\nIf it comes down to a dispute, the person whose name is on the title can decide where it is to be garaged, and who has permission to drive it. If the \"sporty\" car is in the name of both parents, either could move it to some other location, and either could move it back. Going back and forth could easily get ugly. \n\nIf both names are on the 'sporty' car's title with an OR, the husband could sell it without consulting the wife. if there is an AND he would need her to agree.\n\nIf the older car is in the husband's name alone, he could deny the wife or the son the right to drive it.\n\nThe wife could, of course, buy a different older (used) car and allow the son to use it.\n\nObviously it would be a good idea if the husband and wife came to a voluntary agreement about all this, but no law requires them to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In New Jersey, a married couple has been together for 25 years.

While property acquired during marriage is generally considered marital property for the purposes of divorce, the person whose name is on the car's title has the legal right to decide its use and location during the marriage.

It is illegal to drive with any amount of methamphetamine in one's body.\n\nThe main Minnesota law on driving while impaired (DWI) is [Section 169A.20 subdivision 1](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169A.20):\n\n> It is a crime for any person to drive, operate, or be in physical\n> control of any motor vehicle, as defined in section 169A.03,\n> subdivision 15, except for motorboats in operation and off\\-road\n> recreational vehicles, within this state or on any boundary water of\n> this state when:\n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (7\\) the person's body contains **any amount of a controlled substance\n> listed in Schedule I or II**, or its metabolite, other than marijuana or\n> tetrahydrocannabinols.\n\nThe schedules of controlled substances are at [Section 152\\.02](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/152.02). Methamphetamine is listed in Schedule II (subd. 3 (d) (3\\)).\n\n**However**, there is an exception if you were taking the substance as a prescription. [Section 169A.49 subd. 2](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169A.46):\n\n> If proven by a preponderance of the evidence, it is an affirmative defense to a violation of section 169A.20, subdivision 1, clause (7\\) (presence of Schedule I or II controlled substance), that the defendant used the controlled substance according to the terms of a prescription issued for the defendant in accordance with sections 152\\.11 and 152\\.12\\.\n\nNote that since this is an affirmative defense, the burden of proof falls on *you* to prove that you had a prescription, and that you were using the substance according to its terms (e.g. taking only the prescribed dose).

However, there is an affirmative defense for individuals using the substance according to the terms of a valid prescription. This means that while John can legally drive with methamphetamine in his system if he's using it as prescribed, he would bear the burden of proving this if charged with DWI. He would need to show that he was following the prescription's terms, including any instructions about driving.

Option B is incorrect because there is no specific legal limit for methamphetamine like there is for alcohol.

Consequently, [CA Health and Safety Code 25249\\.6](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25249.6.) says \"No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in [Section 25249\\.10](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25249.10)\".

At this point we can only conjecture about the defense's scientific argument (the ruling is still in the works, pending feedback from parties), but the judge said \"While plaintiff offered evidence that consumption of coffee increases the risk of harm to the fetus, to infants, to children and to adults, defendants' medical and epidemiology experts testified that they had no opinion on causation\" and that the coffee makers hadn't presented the proper grounds at trial to prevail. \n\nInsofar as human subjects testing of suspected carcinogens is illegal, any argument that \"but this only shows that it causes cancer in rats\" is legally empty: rats are a suitable proxy for humans. [This](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/proposition-65/chemicals/1007114meifindings.pdf) is a state report addressing a potential carcinogen, 4\\-Methylimidazole. The report notes that to have a No Significant Risk Level finding, the substance must have less than a \"daily intake level posing a 10^\\-5 lifetime risk of cancer\". A further requirement is that \"risk analysis shall be based on the most sensitive study \ndeemed to be of sufficient quality\" (whatever that is). This study mentions a previous study which was rejected because \"these studies do not meet the criteria specified in Section 25703(a) because the experiments were not designed to adequately control for and examine the potential carcinogenicity of 4\\-MEI\". Basically, Spiegelhalter's argument is too meta, and doesn't constitute a proof that acrylamide poses no risk of cancer.\n\nIf the defendants commissioned an independent scientific study to overcome earlier carcinogen findings, perhaps the study failed on technical grounds. The bar that has to be cleared is very high. The [EPA regulation](https://safewater.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211403878-4-What-are-EPA-s-drinking-water-regulations-for-acrylamide-) says that the maximum contaminant level goal for acrylamide is zero.

The court ruled against the coffee companies because they \"failed to meet their burden of proof on their Alternative Significant Risk Level affirmative defense.\" According to California Health and Safety Code 25249.10, the burden of showing that an exposure meets the criteria for exemption is on the defendant.

A company must have some capital, and Bob receives the shares in exchange. So it is not free (the exact minimum would depend of the requirements for incorporating).\n\nIn both cases, Bob is not only a shareholder but **the manager** of `Bob Limited`. Bob will not incur liabilities for being a shareholder, but he can be at fault for his actions as a manager (for example, if he gives false financial data about `Bob Limited` in order to get credit for investing). Do not confuse `Bob the Manager`and `Bob the Shareholder`, as they are different roles.\n\nOf course, if you are a trading company and Bob the Manager approachs you asking for credit for `Bob Limited`, you will have to consider which assets `Bob Limited` has to cover possible debts, and you will ask him the books or other proof. If Bob the Manager provides you the correct information about `Bob Limited` and does nothing \"funny\"1, Bob the Manager is off the hook; you did provide credit hoping to get profits but you knew that there was a risk, and you were given the data needed to evaluate that risk. \n\nIf Bob the Manager did things the wrong way (he did \"cook\" the books, he did provide false data or he did appropiate `Bob Limited` money) then Bob the Manager will probably be prosecuted. But Bob the Shareholder will not be liable for this, he will only lose the assets he did put forward as capital as the `Bob Limited` value will drop to zero.\n\nB) does not change much the situation, Matt still only loses his part of the company2. The difference here is that if Bob the Manager did \"funny\" things and did not manage the company correctly then Matt may sue Bob the Manager, too.\n\n---\n\n2Which is not valued at $50 but as half the net worth of the company.

However, Bob, as both a shareholder and the company's manager, could face separate liability if he engaged in misconduct such as providing false financial information or misappropriating company funds. Matt, as a shareholder who bought in later, would only be liable up to his $50 investment unless he also took on management responsibilities.

Please read the answer to [this question on this site](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o). \n\nThe question is whether the use of the song except would constitute \"fair use\". Several questions need to be asked:\n\n1. Would the use of the song in the film make it less likely to be purchased? That is, would someone who watched the film have 'satisfied\" any desire for the song, and not be as willing to pay money for it? If so that weighs against fair use. If not it weighs for it.\n2. How much of the song is used? the closer to the whole song, or the \"essential core\" is used, that weighs against fair use. If a song consisits of a verse plus a chorus repeated several times, and the film uses the verse plus one instance of the chorus, then the essential core of the song has pretty clearly been used. In the well\\-known *Harper vs Nation* case, a quote of 300 words was held to be the \"essential core\" of a book\\-length biography of President George H. W. Bush, and to be too much to count as fair use.\n3. What is the purpose of the use? is it trasformative? That is, is the film using the song in pretty much the same way that the singer would have? or is it there as an example of its genre, or perhaps it is used satirically. The more different the purpose from the original, the stronger the case for fair use.\n4. The character of the work being used. Since a song is a creative work, rather than a factual work like a news article, its protection is stronger, and the case for fair use weaker.\n\nNote that fair use is always a case\\-by\\-case, fact driven decision, and no one can say for sure if a particular use is a fair use unless and until a court has ruled on it. It is also a very specifically US legal concept, and does not apply elsewhere.\n\nAssuming that the use does not qualify as a fair use, permission would be needed for the copyright holder on the cover recording, **and** from the copyright holder on the song itself. The copyright on the cover recording might well be held by the cover singer, or by the (cover) recording company. The copyright on the song might well be held by the creator (shared by composer and lyrics authors if they are not the same person), or by the recording company that the creator has signed with. Or either copyright might be held by some other person or firm, as copyrights can be sold or assigned.\n\nThe film maker would need to contact these copyright holders and ask for permission to use the except. The holders might say yes or no, or ask for a fee. If there is no answer, that must be treated as a \"NO\". \n\nIf the film maker uses the song without getting permission, s/he could be sued for copyright infringement by the copyright holder, and possibly subjected to a court judgement for damages. This is true even if no money is made from the film, although damages will probably be larger is significant money is made. If the copyright holder does not choose to sue, nothing will happen.\n\n**EDIT**: \nAs a comment by @Dale M points out, the US has \"Mandatory licensing\" for music. This is provided under Section 115 of the Copyright law ([17 USC 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115)). This means that if someone wants to record and distribute a cover version of a song, this can be done without the permission of the copyright holder. Instead, a \"Notice of Intention\" (NOI) is sent to the copyright holder and filed with the copyright office, describing what music is to be used and how. Then royalties are paid at a statutory rate (which may be higher than the current market rate). This process is described in [Copyright Office circular 73](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ73.pdf) and in \"[Learn What a Compulsory License Is in Music](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-a-compulsory-license-in-music-2460357)\" from *The Balance*.\n\nHowever, a compulsory license is **not** available for the kind of use described in the question. A compulsory license permits making a new recording of a new performance of an existing non\\-dramatic musical composition. It does **not** permit distributing an existing recording without permission. And a compulsory license does **not** permit use of a musical work as part of an audio\\-visual work, such as a film or video.\n\n> A phonorecord does not include sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work.\n\n...\n\n> Section 115 does not cover sound recordings. Rather, it covers the reproduction and distribution of nondramatic musical compositions.\n\n...\n\n> You cannot engage in the following activities with the compulsory license. You will need to seek permission from the copyright owner to:\n>  ... \n>  Make, reproduce, or distribute a sound recording publicly distributed in phonorecords\n\n(From Copyright office circular 73, linked above)\n\nSo to use a published recording of a cover version of a publisahed song in a film, permission would need to be obtained from **both** the copyright holder of the recording (usually the performer), **and** from the copyright holder of the song itself (the creator or whoever the copyright might have been transferred to).\n\nThe general process of obtaining such permisison, not specifically for music, is described in \"[The Basics of Getting Permission](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/introduction/getting-permission/)\" from Stanford University.\n\nAlso, US compulsory licenses apply only to music of US origin.

Are those acting in an official capacity in those facilities legally required to adhere to the Flag Code as they are operating a public facility?\n\nFor example, Section 6, Clause g states, \"The flag should be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse.\" If a school were to fail to display the flag, would that be considered a crime?

In theory, the federal government should have very little power over the decision\\-making of state governments \\-\\- this is a principle of federalism and is expressly stated in the 10th Amendment. In practice, however, the federal government has a lot of power over state governments. Congress can condition the allotment of federal monies to states, i.e. block grants, as long as such a condition meets the five point test spelled out in [*South Dakota v. Dole*](https://openjurist.org/483/us/203). The most stringent of these points is that the condition \"must not be coercive\" so as to apply \"irresistible pressure\", creating a false choice where accepting money is the only realistic option (thus complying with the conditions). I couldn't find a clause within USC Title 4, Chapter 1 for withholding funds from states in the event of noncompliance, [similar to one that exists for the national drinking age](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/23/158). Therefore states (state, county, municipal all treated as an extension of state power under the US Constitution) are not required to to adhere to the flag code. \n\nTheoretically, Congress could pass a new law that would condition the receipt of some federal funds on the states' compliance with the flag code.

If they can't prove they have a permit, can I file a lawsuit compelling them to demolish this building? Thanks for any advice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your question raises three issues:\n\n1. The building permit process;\n2. Building code enforcement; and\n3. Zoning ordinances/regulations.\n\nWe need more details on the jurisdiction because most building permit, building code, and zoning issues are governed by county and/or town ordinances.\n\nGenerally, the remedy for not having a building permit is paying enhanced fees\\-\\-assuming the structure is built to code, adheres to zoning requirements, and passes inspection. \n\nThe usual remedy for a building code violation is being forced to fix the issue by making it adhere to the applicable building code requirements. Sometimes you have to pay a fee for an additional inspection or have other hurdles to jump through that can slow down a project.\n\nThe remedy for violations of zoning ordinances is much stricter and can involve criminal or civil penalties. These civil penalties can involve a person being forced to demolish a building or enjoined from using their house a business. Zoning is a complicated area of law because the rules and regulations vary from one town to another.\n\nTo directly answer your question:\n=================================\n\n> Can I file a lawsuit compelling them to demolish this building?\n\n**Answer**: Get a lawyer familiar with local land use regulations. \n\n**Other thoughts/Considerations:** Most jurisdiction have a process for filing a complaint with the agency that regulates zoning laws. That's probably your first bet. Generally, people don't have the right to sue their neighbor for zoning issues unless they have exhausted their administrative remedies.\n\nIf the local officials don't take action because they're friends or connected with your neighbor, could could file *writ of mandamus* in court. In New York they call it an [Article 78 review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus#State_courts). Basically, a writ of mandamus/article 78 review is a lawsuit that is seeking to force a government official or government body to do something it is required to do. So you'd be filing a lawsuit asking the zoning board/building code enforcement to \"do it's job.\"\n\nHere is the law I am referring to: [NY CPLR \u00a7 7803](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/civil-practice-law-and-rules/cvp-sect-7803.html).

However, the article asserts that\n\n> the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan (1845\\), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality\".\n\n. . . and then the article mentions two later Supreme Court rulings saying this is a Constitutional principle.\n\nHowever, this has been asserted to apply only to states that have been admitted to the Union, not to state within the territory of the U.S.A. that have not been admitted to the Union but are nonetheless states. Here it may be asserted that no such states can exist, or at least that none have existed.\n\nHowever, look at the Northwest ordinance of 1787 and its amendment in 1789\\. The 1787 ordinance was enacted by Congress while the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, and it said\n\n> There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than three, nor more than five States; \\[\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0] And whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatever;\n\n(Ultimately that territory became five states and part of a sixth.)\n\nThis seems to say that before the population of one of the proposed states reached 60,000, they would not yet be admitted on an equal footing, but would nonetheless be states. The equal\\-footing doctrine applies only to states admitted to the Union, and not to any of these proposed not\\-yet\\-admitted states, but that they would still be in some substantial sense states. As states, presumably they would have constitutions enacted by the voters of the state and otherwise not be under federal jurisdiction in the way in which organized incorporated territories are.\n\nIn 1789, after the present Constitution was in effect, Congress altered the ordinance for the purpose of adapting it the the new Constitution, but the only adaptation was that reports that the territorial governor had been required to submit to Congress were to be submitted instead to the President.\n\nSo here we have an act of Congress under the present Constitution saying states could exist within the boundaries of the U.S. that would not yet be *admitted* states, thus although they were states, the equal\\-footing doctrine would not apply to them.\n\nNo such states were ever created under the authority of Congress. However, there was one occasion when Congress allowed that a certain entity within the boundaries of the U.S. was already a state but not yet an admitted state, and decided that it would get admitted. That was Vermont. When Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the 1786 \"Constitution of the State of Vermont\" continued in effect and the man who had begun a one\\-year term of office as \"governor of the state of Vermont\" in October 1790, succeeding the previous \"governor of the state of Vermont\", continued his one\\-year term of office uninterrupted, as did all other officers of the state. When he assumed office, Vermont had not yet assembled its convention that met in January 1791 to decide whether to apply for admission to the Union. Under Vermont law, no new State of Vermont was created at that time, but rather the same state continued to exist, and Congress said that the entity that had petitioned them for admission was \"the State of Vermont\", and they were granting the petition.\n\nOne can argue that Vermont cannot serve as a precedent because it was organized before even the Articles of Confederation were in effect and before the boundaries of the U.S. were defined (that first happened in the Preliminary Articles of Peace of 1782 and wasn't really in effect until the peace treaty of 1783 was effective) \\-\\- it was entirely unique. No other state can ever be in that situation. And throughout the 1780s, the state of Vermont took the position that Vermont was *not* within the U.S., even though the peace treaty, to which Vermont was not a party, said it was.\n\nBut there is the Northwest Ordinance, authorizing the creation of states that would be states but would be not\\-yet\\-admitted states, to which equal footing would not apply.\n\nIf one takes the equal\\-footing doctrine to be a part of the Constitution although nowhere explicitly stated in the document, could one say that (1\\) it applies to admitted states but (2\\) not to non\\-admitted states, but (3\\) those could exist within the boundaries of the U.S. and still be *states*?

Initially, the car thief had no knowledge of the baby's presence, so they cannot be charged with kidnapping at that point (eliminating option A). The mere discovery of the baby after 30 minutes doesn't automatically constitute kidnapping (eliminating option B).

The fact that the charge was later dropped does not retroactively invalidate the initial encounter if the officers had reasonable suspicion based on the report they received. The search, while conducted without consent, may still be legal if the officers had probable cause based on the reported threat. The signing of a formal statement by the accuser is not a requirement for the police to act on a reported threat.

Customers may get paid by publishing the advertising. The customers presumably want to do this in order to make profits. Some customers may be organized as nonprofit and they're not allowed to make profits, but individuals are not nonprofit and nonprofit organizations presumably want to do this in order to make surpluses. The company does not appear to serve primarily nonprofits.\n\nThe company requires a contract, which is a contract of adhesion. Ignore that the contract may have been sloppily drafted. Assume the company will defend it as written now. The contract forbids customers from doing anything \"commercial\". The contract does not explicitly define \"commercial\" but implicitly relies on one or more legal definitions inferrable from outside of the contract. While it is possible for a customer to enter into the contract and then do nothing so as not to do anything \"commercial\", the customer would then earn no revenue and therefore no profit or surplus, and such a possibility is therefore a trivial case not considered here. Therefore, while the company is not in violation of the contract, all customers, except nonprofits, are always in violation. The only cure is to cease doing anything with the company.\n\nIf I, an individual, enter into the contract and I then do something \"commercial\" in relation to the company, is the company barred from treating me as violating the contract because what I do under the contract is \"commercial\" when what everyone is doing under the contract is \"commercial\"? For example, might the bar be due to estoppel?\n\nCompanies are usually presumed to legally exist in perpetuity, so assume perpetuity for this company. Does it add fuel to the legal fire if enforcing the bar to commercialism against all customers would put the company out of business? In this case, customers would not publish the advertising supplied by the company, no one in the world would act on the advertisements, advertisers would stop advertising through this company, the company would stop receiving any revenue, and the company therefore would have no more profit. Indeed, the company could not pay any obligations still outstanding, and that would force it into bankruptcy. Does that mean the company cannot enforce contractual violations grounded solely on commercialism?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If such a case came to court, the court would presumably rule that merely publishing the advertising could not be considered to be doing something \"commercial\". (Otherwise the contract would be absurd, as the question points out.) The court would therefore define \"commercial\" as some act beyond merely displaying the advertising \\-\\- perhaps charging for the website on which it is displayed, or using it to sell goods. \n\nMoreover, since the company apparently wrote the contract, any ambiguity in it would be construed against the company, if there is another reasonable interpretation. \n\nThus the contract would not be void, and could be sued on, but the company would win only if it established some conduct that the court was prepared to consider as \"commercial\" in light of the circumstances and the purpose of the contract.\n\nBy the way it is not really on point, but it is a common misunderstanding that:\n\n> some customers may be organized as nonprofit and they're not allowed to make profits\n\nNonprofit entities may do business and make income that would be considered \"profit\" for an ordinary corporation.

Courts typically try to interpret contracts in a way that gives them meaning and effect, rather than invalidating them entirely (ruling out A). They would likely recognize that the mere act of publishing ads (the core of the service) couldn't be considered \"commercial\" in this context, as that would make the contract self-defeating (ruling out B). The court would probably interpret \"commercial\" more narrowly, perhaps applying it to additional revenue-generating activities beyond simply displaying the ads.\n\nOption D is incorrect because nonprofit status doesn't automatically exempt an organization from contractual terms, and the question doesn't suggest that the contract makes this distinction. Additionally, the provided information clarifies that nonprofits can engage in profit-making activities, they just can't distribute those profits to individuals.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the principle that ambiguities in contracts are often construed against the drafter (in this case, the company), and that courts generally seek reasonable interpretations that preserve the purpose and functionality of agreements."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55596/buying-contracts-agreements-from-another-company", "docs_id": 55596, "title": "Buying contracts/agreements from another company", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Company A** creates agreements/contracts with instructors who have created courses to sell online.

What is the point of this?\n\nAre judges deliberately encouraging this behavior to increase business for legal professionals?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are misinformed. \n\nIn fact, approximately the reverse is true: in a typical jurisdiction in the United States today in excess of 95 percent of criminal cases that begin never reach a verdict. (The exact number varies a little, depending on which exact court system we're talking about.) Or never reach a trial at all, in fact. Or never even come close to making it to the trial date. \n\nNow, in some of those instances the charges wind up being dismissed. In some others defendants are diverted outside of the traditional criminal justice system when the circumstances seem better suited to other resolutions (examples: a petty criminal who steals to feed a drug addiction is diverted into a process where he or she will get drug treatment, a non\\-violent mentally ill person is put into a process where he or she will get mental health treatment); if they complete the diversion program the criminal charges are dropped. But in the vast majority of cases a defendant winds up pleading guilty, in court, to something. Sometimes in exchange for the prosecutor dropping certain other charges. Sometimes in return for the prosecutor downgrading a charge he or she would otherwise pursue in court to a charge for a lesser offense. Sometimes just in return for perhaps getting some credit in the eyes of the judge for \"acceptance of responsibility\" when sentencing rolls around. But make no mistake: there are few elements more central to the way modern American criminal justice works than plea bargaining. \n\nBut don't feel too bad: for what it's worth you are certainly not alone in thinking otherwise. In fact, in my personal experience almost everyone outside the legal profession and the court system/s holds at least a few large misconceptions about the way criminal justice in the U.S. actually works. General news media outlets contribute quite a bit to helping those misconceptions form by typically focusing solely on the rare, high\\-profile, controversial (and thus ratings\\-grabbing) cases rather than the vast, vast number that end in a whimper instead of a bang. Law drama shows and movies almost invariably bear little relation to reality. (And that's is totally fine, BTW, as long as you *realize* they bear almost no relation to reality.) Which makes sense: *Law \\& Order: SVU* probably wouldn't have stayed on the air year after year if most episodes just consisted of an endless stream of one rote, dull plea hearing after another, each featuring some otherwise\\-unremarkable sleezeball who's been caught dead\\-to\\-rights downloading and re\\-distributing child pornography.\n\n(And, BTW, the misconceptions aren't limited to criminal law \\& justice, by any means. In fact, in my view other high\\-profile legal arenas like civil litigation, intellectual property disputes, constitutional law battles, and many others are even *more* misunderstood. But I digress...) \n\nAnyway, to sum up: very frequent plea bargaining \\= one of the foundations of how modern American criminal justice operates at a practical level. For tons more stats, background info, and analysis corroborating and analyzing that fact, see the links commenters have already posted and/or any of the many, many good items on the topic indexed via our friend [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=plea%20bargaining&ie=&oe=).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the reality of criminal case resolutions in the United States?\n\nA) The majority of criminal cases go to trial, with defendants rarely pleading guilty.\n\nB) Approximately 95% of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargaining or other means before reaching a trial verdict.\n\nC) Judges actively encourage defendants to go to trial to increase business for legal professionals.\n\nD) Most criminal cases are resolved through diversion programs outside the traditional justice system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The passage clearly states that \"in excess of 95 percent of criminal cases that begin never reach a verdict.\" It goes on to explain that while some cases are dismissed or diverted, \"in the vast majority of cases a defendant winds up pleading guilty, in court, to something.\" This directly contradicts the common misconception that most cases go to trial.

During the existence of such a territory, if it was decided to change the term served by the governor from two years to fours year, or make some other change, the change was enacted by Congress, not by the voters in the territory.

That is, the APP shares with other applications and uses the user's personal information without user consent, such as device identification information, product browsing records, search usage habits, and commonly used software application lists.\n4. \"Force users to use directional push function\". That is, the APP does not inform the user, or does not mark it in a prominent way, and uses the collected user search, browsing history, usage habits and other personal information for targeted push or precision marketing, and does not provide the option to turn off the function.\n\n(3\\) Unreasonable request for user rights\n\n5. \"Do not give permission without permission\". That is, when the APP is installed and running, the user is asked for rights that are not related to the current service scenario. After the user refuses to authorize, the application exits or closes.\n6. \"Frequently apply for permission\". That is, after the user explicitly rejects the permission application, the APP frequently applies to open the address book, positioning, SMS, recording, camera and other permissions that are not related to the current service scenario, harassing the user.\n7. \"Excessive permission\". That is, when the user does not use related functions or services, the APP applies in advance to open the address book, positioning, SMS, recording, camera and other permissions, or exceeds its business functions or services, apply for address book, positioning, SMS, recording, camera and other permissions .\n\n(4\\) Setting up obstacles for user account cancellation\n\n8. \"It is difficult to cancel the account.\" That is, the APP does not provide users with an account cancellation service, or sets an unreasonable obstacle to the cancellation service.\n\nThat is the problem statement, the announcement says they want the companies collecting information to fix the problem themselves or it will be legislated on them.\n\n---\n\nIt's now 2020 and the Ministry has engaged a third\\-party testing agency to verify applications, and has given a small number of them notice to fix problems or be removed by specific dates).

The TSJ has shown in the past (e.g., with the presidential term limits ruling) that it may interpret the constitution in ways that are not immediately obvious from the text. The law could potentially be justified under Article 18 regarding health or by arguing that arresting a pregnant woman effectively arrests an innocent person (the fetus).

In addition, some licenses restrict the format of backup copy allowed, for example they may allow a book to be photocopied in hardcopy format but not scanned, or they may allow a CD to be copied to another CD but not extracted to MP3 files or other electronic music formats or used from mobile devices other than portable CD\\-players. \n\nThe original copy must be kept by the rightsholder (i.e. you can't buy a DVD, copy it while you own it, then sell the original while retaining the copy), and in order to avoid any doubt about legality of the copy, it should be marked as a backup copy including details of the rightsholder (name, purchase date etc) written on it (i.e. it should not be printed to appear like a counterfeit).\n\n> If I own a DVD or a book, I can\\* rip that DVD and scan that book to a PDF. But what if you where not an expert on video codecs, or did not want to buy an expensive scanner and a professional image to text software to do a scan of the book justice? You could theoretically pay someone else to copy your book or DVD.\n\nGenerally speaking with media such as film DVDs or music CDs it should be cheaper to buy a second copy than to pay someone for their time/effort to go through the hassle of making a usable (similar quality) copy. Depending on the license you may not have the rights to pass the originals or any copies onto any third party for any purpose.\n\n> But considering that your copy is identicle to millions of other copies of the original copyrighted work, what if technically your backup was a copy of one of these identicle other copies?

Or would the law require them to individually copy each book, creating identicle pdfs every time, and send the specific pdf to the corresponding customer?\n\nHow would the customer be able to proove to this company that they legally own a copy themselves without sending it? For the company to store a copy legally after returning the original, it would surely also need to purchase an original, otherwise they are just storing up copyright material without having purchased any licenses in the material nor obtained the permission of the copyright owners.\n\n> Expanding this, if I own a book or dvd, can I just download a backup someone else made?\n\nThe person who made the first backup has not been granted the rights to publish or distribute the copyright material by the copyright owners so they would likely be breaking the law by making it available to you, and this would likely be considered an illegal copy even if you also own an original because of how it was obtained (i.e. you didnt not exercise a right to take a backup copy from the original, you transferred an illegal copy over the Internet).\n\n> \\*Some of this can be a legal grey area, but that is outside the scope of this question.\n\nYes, other issues might include bypassing or circumventing copyright protection technologies, computer misuse laws, counterfeit laws etc.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company offers a service to create digital backups of books for customers.

Short of materials that are: child pornography, restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Libelous/Fraudulent, encourage or aid others in breaking the law, or seditious/treasonous/ terroistic/other credible threats there is almost nothing that can't be published. There is another example where supposedly [The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments](http://bbark.deepforestproductions.com/column/2013/07/07/banned-books-awareness-the-golden-book-of-chemistry-experiments/) was banned by the US Government, but I cannot find any evidence or action against the author to support the claim.\n\n*The Political Mofia* by Schiff was not neccessarily banned, but an injunction from publishing was issued against the authors in [US v. Schiff, 379 F. 3d 621 \\- Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit 2004](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11776545211757471117&q=Irwin%20Schiff&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) per [26 U.S.C. 7408](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7408) on grounds that the books was fraudulent.\n\nEssentially it is the Federal courts that can ban a book from commerce with cause. Schools, libraries and other institutions may ban it from their collections, but not from public commerce.

It's a building built in the 70's to my knowledge, and it's a high rise apartment (around 25 floors).\n\nMy question is, is this a cause for concern, or are the regulations/compliance in Ontario good enough that I can rest assured the asbestos is sealed and not a danger to health? Or is it just a legal cover, and there's still a risk present that it's not inspected or maintained properly (or it's common to ignore/violate this regulation in a place like Toronto)?\n\nI'd really like to move into this place, but if there's more than 1% chance that there might be exposed asbestos in the unit, that is too high a risk to take in my opinion.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Regulations concerning asbestos management in residential tenancies is set out in [O. Reg 278/05](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/050278), under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. As your apartment building is already aware of asbestos\\-containing materials, [they are bound to the responsibilities listed under s. 8](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/050278#BK6). In particular, they are required to give you a record of information pertaining to your apartment:\n\n> (3\\) If this subsection applies, the owner shall,\n> \n> \n> \n> > (a) prepare and keep on the premises a record containing the information set out in subsection (4\\);\n> > \n> > \n> > (b) give any other person who is an occupier of the building written notice of any information in the record that relates to the area occupied by the person;\n\nYour building should be aware of all asbestos\\-containing materials in your apartment, and they should be taking the necessary steps to safely contain the material as needed.\n\nThe fact that your apartment told you the apartment has asbestos shouldn't alarm you. Almost all older buildings used asbestos, and it's safe so long as it isn't disturbed. Your building is aware of asbestos, and it's not trying to cover it up or hide it from you.

It *might* be interpreted as saying \"it doesn't belong to us\", but you can't count on that (it's virtually guaranteed that at least *some* of the content there is owned by the website owner). A more informative statement would be \"You will have to get permission from the content owner to copy their stuff\", and \"We're not going to spend time figuring out who owns what\".\n\nYou could read the terms of service (try this with Stack Exchange) to see what the site tells people. The [TOS here](http://stackexchange.com/legal) says that if you contribute anything, it \"is perpetually and irrevocably licensed to Stack Exchange under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license\". You can then look up what that license says and learn what that allows. Websites are kind of tricky, though, because it's not hard to change the wording of a TOS, and you need to know what specific TOS was promulgated at the time a particular contribution was unleashed. Usual practice is to think it through carefully and not frequently tweak the TOS, but it's not illegal to change the TOS. Note that copyright law does not prohibit you from using other people's stuff, it prohibits you from *copying*. The distinction is clearer when you see a post that explains an algorithm with actual code, you read and learn and make use of that, but write your own code. As a user out there, if there isn't a clear indication that stuff posted is there for the taking, under some public license (as is the case with SE), then getting specific permission to copy, from the owner of the content (possibly untraceable), would be necessary.\n\nNow assume that you're a moderator or site\\-owner of some forum: presumably (hopefully) you have a TOS that addresses that situation, which says that moderators have the right to edit or delete content at their sole discretion, and also you say what kinds of posts are prohibited. Such an statement is not absolutely mandatory for all things, but it may be necessary to avoid litigation over some acts. One one end of the spectrum, it would be illegal for a forum to host child porn, stolen credit card numbers, or protected digital content. If a user were to post such stuff, the site would need to eliminate that stuff, and the poster could not legally rely on an argument of the type \"That's my stuff, you have no right to mess with it\".\n\nOn the other hand, if a forum actually requires paid membership, then there may be a strong contractual expectation that the user is getting something of value, so you would have to watch for statements that could be interpreted as broad permission to put stuff out there without any interference. (For instance, a file\\-hosting service would have only minimal restrictions on content, aimed at protecting their own legal interests; whereas a political\\-advocacy site would have maximal interest in prohibiting the expression of views counter to the cause). Thus the SE TOS has you \"grant Stack Exchange the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify, create derivative works\", which allows moderators to correct typos, delete offensive wording, and obliterate entire posts. If a site fails to have any such clauses in their TOS, then it might be a matter that has to be settled in court, whether they have the right to eliminate \"spam\" (i.e. advertising for a service, especially if the reason for getting an account was to provide an advertising platform).\n\nIn light of the limited use sanctioned by the TOS, per the below comment, legal copying will be quite limited. However, \"fair use\" a situation where copying is allowed, regardless of what the TOS may say. (You could be banned from the site, but you could not be sued for infringement). Fair use was invented precisely so that people could make comments like \"Jones advocates an absurd law, saying '...\\[quote from Jones]...'\".

To the extent that the insurance does not cover them, or if it does not exist, the pedestrian will be, well, liable for the rest.\n\nTo the extent that the pedestrian cannot afford to cover the (remaining) liability, your insurance may do so, if it includes coverage for losses that you've incurred but cannot collect from the liable party.\n\nIf there remains any uncovered amount, you will have to pay that out of pocket.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, if a pedestrian runs a red light and collides with a motorcyclist, causing damage to the motorcycle, what is the correct order of financial responsibility for covering the damages?\n\nA) Pedestrian's personal liability insurance (if any), motorcyclist's insurance, pedestrian's personal assets, motorcyclist's personal assets\nB) Motorcyclist's insurance, pedestrian's personal liability insurance (if any), pedestrian's personal assets, motorcyclist's personal assets\nC) Pedestrian's personal assets, pedestrian's personal liability insurance (if any), motorcyclist's insurance, motorcyclist's personal assets\nD) Motorcyclist's insurance, motorcyclist's personal assets, pedestrian's personal liability insurance (if any), pedestrian's personal assets\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct order of financial responsibility is:\n1. Pedestrian's personal liability insurance (if any): This would be the first source to cover the damages, as the pedestrian is assumed to be fully liable.\n2. Motorcyclist's insurance: If the pedestrian's insurance is insufficient or non-existent, the motorcyclist's insurance may cover losses that cannot be collected from the liable party.\n3. Pedestrian's personal assets: If insurance doesn't cover all damages, the pedestrian is personally liable for the remaining amount.\n4. Motorcyclist's personal assets: As a last resort, if there's any uncovered amount after all other options are exhausted, the motorcyclist would have to pay out of pocket.\n\nThis order ensures that the liable party (the pedestrian) is responsible first, followed by insurance options, before the victim (the motorcyclist) has to bear any costs personally."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45808/howd-parties-negotiate-around-the-remedy-to-share-the-profits-or-savings-f", "docs_id": 45808, "title": "How&#39;d parties &#39;negotiate around the remedy&#39; to &#39;share the profits (or savings) from breach rather than allow the contract breaker total retention&#39;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Mindy Chen\\-Wishart.

Apparently the author's point is that, when a party incurs breach of contract, negotiating \\-\\-and reaching a settlement\\-\\- is more beneficial than seeking a strict or full enforcement of remedies for the breach as provided in the contract.\n\nThis makes sense even from the injured party's perspective. That is because breacher is likelier to dispute and obstruct remedies if the full extent thereof is sought by the counterparty. Accordingly, breacher's resistance is likelier to result in litigation, whence also the injured party would inevitably incur expenses.\n\nThe author does not really define the odd term \"*contract\\-breaker full retention*\", but from the example on [page 313](https://books.google.es/books?id=Vb66BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=%22total%20retention%22&source=bl&ots=OtTyDI_8Iz&sig=ACfU3U1vtN2JefQE4K9ZjvRifdA8o6k7eQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7pdD11rXlAhWsxIUKHd9fAUAQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22total%20retention%22&f=false) (well past page 24\\) it appears that the term means the full extent of remedies available in the event of breach of contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company breaches a contract with its supplier. The supplier is considering their options for addressing this breach. Which of the following statements best reflects the perspective presented in the excerpt from Chen-Wishart's \"Contract Law\"?\n\nA) The supplier should always seek full enforcement of remedies as outlined in the contract to maximize their compensation.\n\nB) Negotiating a settlement is typically less beneficial than pursuing strict enforcement of contractual remedies.\n\nC) The breaching company should retain all benefits from the breach to incentivize future compliance.\n\nD) Negotiating a settlement is often more advantageous for both parties than seeking full enforcement of contractual remedies.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The passage suggests that negotiating and reaching a settlement is generally more beneficial than seeking strict or full enforcement of remedies for breach of contract. This aligns with option D, which states that negotiation is often more advantageous for both parties. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the excerpt argues against always seeking full enforcement. Option B directly contradicts the main point of the passage. Option C misinterprets the concept of \"contract-breaker full retention\" and does not reflect the author's perspective on beneficial outcomes.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the author's view that negotiation can lead to better outcomes by avoiding costly litigation and increasing the likelihood of cooperation from the breaching party."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13804/does-windows-10-home-non-oem-license-work-forever", "docs_id": 13804, "title": "Does Windows 10 Home non-OEM license work forever?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm considering buying a Windows 10 Home 64\\-bit (not OEM) license.

The license is [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm), theoretically, but keep the piece of paper in your box, if you have a piece of paper, just in case the online version disappears / changes. Part 2(a) says:\n\n> The software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you\n>  the right to install and run one instance of the software on your\n>  device (the licensed device), for use by one person at a time, so long\n>  as you comply with all the terms of this agreement.\n\nThe expression \"on your device (the licensed device)\" could easily make one think that it is tied to a specific machine, but that is only true in the sense that it is for a single machine (at a time). Regarding changing machines, part 4(b) would be relevant (this assumes you didn't acquire the software in Germany, where there is special law):\n\n> If you acquired the software as stand\\-alone software (and also if you\n>  upgraded from software you acquired as stand\\-alone software), you may\n>  transfer the software to another device that belongs to you.

Every time you transfer the software to a new device,\n>  you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not\n>  transfer the software to share licenses between devices.\n\nSo you can continuously transfer from machine to machine, as long as you uninstall the OS from machines that you are done with \\-\\- you cannot multiply copies by serially upgrading hardware. If you only need 1 machine, you're set for life (your life, or the person why acquires it from you, but no further than that).
