Often these ads will claim that \"these are real reactions from regular people, not actors.\"\n\nSuppose such an ad lied about the people not being actors, but everything it said about the product was objectively true. Would this constitute false advertising?\n\nI am primarily interested in the law in the U.S., specifically Utah if the U.S. is too broad. However, I'd also be interested in hearing about other jurisdictions as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\n[australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\")\n\nThis is a straight up and down case of \u201cdeceptive and misleading conduct\u201d. There is plenty of case law to support that testimonials (which this is) must be genuine, not paid for as they are from an actor.\n\nFurther, they cannot be cherry\\-picked. If 5 real people reacted and 2 reacted negatively, you cannot just show the 3 who reacted positively \\- you have to show them all or otherwise disclose that 3 out 5 people loved the product.\n\nWhen actors (or people who are otherwise getting paid) are used that fact must be disclosed if it is not clear from the context. In a typical ad where people are just shown using the product without giving a personal endorsement it\u2019s sufficiently clear that they are actors. However, in the type of ad you describe if they were actors this would need to be stated.\n\nTelevision and radio personalities must disclose when they are being paid for an endorsement under enforceable codes. Influencers are required to do so under non\\-binding codes, however, it is likely that breach of these codes would also be a breach of the law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company runs a television commercial featuring people reacting positively to their new product. The ad states \"These are real reactions from regular people, not actors.\" However, the company actually used paid actors and cherry-picked only positive reactions. The product claims in the ad are factually accurate. Which of the following statements is most correct regarding the legality of this advertisement?\n\nA) The ad is legal because the product claims are true, and using actors is a common practice in advertising.\n\nB) The ad is illegal due to deceptive and misleading conduct, regardless of the accuracy of the product claims.\n\nC) The ad would be legal if they disclosed that actors were used, even if they only showed positive reactions.\n\nD) The ad is legal as long as at least one of the featured reactions came from a non-actor.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The advertisement constitutes deceptive and misleading conduct, which is illegal regardless of the accuracy of the product claims. The ad falsely claims that the people are not actors when they are, and it only shows positive reactions when negative ones also existed. This violates the principles of honest advertising, where testimonials must be genuine and not cherry-picked. Even if the product claims are true, the misrepresentation of the people's status and the selective presentation of reactions make this ad illegal. Disclosing the use of actors (option C) would help, but cherry-picking reactions would still be problematic. Using one real person (option D) wouldn't negate the overall deception. The common use of actors (option A) doesn't justify false claims about their status."

Fortunately, I have recently acquired citizenship in an EU country, and so (I would think) have the right to work in the EU. Unfortunately, I do not yet have an EU passport or ID card \\-\\- and getting one would probably take several months.\n\n**Question:** Do I need a EU passport or EU ID card to legally work in the EU (or establish that I have the right to work in the EU)? Or is a certificate of citizenship sufficient?\n\n*Addendum*: in fact, the document that I have is not exactly a certificate of citizenship. Rather, it is a \"Notification of the acquisition of citizenship\" (there is a separate citizenship certificate that I can apply for). I'm not sure if this makes any difference.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Question: Do I need a EU passport or EU ID card to legally work in the EU (or establish that I have the right to work in the EU)? Or is a certificate of citizenship sufficient?\n\nLegally, your right to work is not contingent on this and there is no Europe\\-wide rule that makes holding any document mandatory. Importantly, if you do start working anyway, you are not committing a crime and cannot possibly be banned or forced to leave the country. You do have the right to work from the day you became an EU citizen and if any doubt arises down the line, you should be able to clear it up later.\n\nIn practice, employers are sometimes supposed to check you are allowed to work (and for that would require some proof of your citizenship) but they don't necessarily need a passport or ID. What's typical on the other hand is that you have to provide an official proof of address (in the countries where you have to register your address with the authorities) and the local social security, insurance, or national tax number. Both of these will require dealing with the authorities and will be considerably more difficult, if not downright impossible, without a national ID card or passport (in fact it can even be difficult *with* a passport).\n\nI worked in multiple EU countries and I don't recall always having to present my ID to employers. I recall at least one instance (in Germany) where I could start working without one (it had just been stolen) and another one (in the Netherlands) where I started on the day after I arrived, without official address nor tax number (BSN). In both cases, I was expected to solve these issues within the first month and you risk a fine if you don't register within a week or two but it was neither illegal nor impossible to start working before all the formalities were completed.\n\nNone of this means I would be completely comfortable about being *months* without a passport. But the main issue for you will be entering the country and what your employer's HR department is prepared to tolerate, not any sort of legal obligation to hold a passport to work.\n\n*Note that in one of the cases I described above I went to the local consulate to get an emergency passport. It wouldn't have been possible back in my country of citizenship but there are some special procedures when you reside abroad. These rules change all the time and depend on your country of citizenship but that could be worth a try.*",

The individual has the legal right to work from the day they became an EU citizen. While there may be practical challenges in terms of proving citizenship to employers or obtaining necessary local documents (like proof of address or social security numbers), the fundamental right to work exists regardless of documentation. Employers may have their own requirements, but legally, the individual is not committing any offense by working without these documents.

An employee with the property management company had told me to reach out before the period ended to see if we could extend the promotion period indefinitely, because they had done so for previous tenants.\n\nIn November, I reached out via email to formally request the promotion be extended, and if not, I would move out immediately in January. The property manager at the time replied via email, saying she would get back to me shortly. (Note that I'm not sure of her official title, but all communications with the management company was through this employee.) \n\nAfter 2 weeks of no response, I emailed again. An unknown amount of time after that email, I called in and reached the property manager directly. She then said casually that yes, they already agreed to let me continue with the same rent.\n\n**Current situation**\n\nFast\\-forward to April 2018, where I receive notices at my apartment door that management has changed, and the employee mentioned above no longer works with the company. Another notice is later posted, saying I owe backdated rent from January. I reached out via phone and leaving voicemails, and I also send emails to ask for clarification. \n\nI also contacted the building manager who resides in the same building, and he had told me to not worry as other tenants were receiving the same notices.\n\nFast\\-forward again to May, when I finally receive a phone call from the new staff with the management company, saying I owe the backdated rent due. I forward my email correspondence with the previous employee, and today, I am told over phone that the lack of written documentation means I owe the backdated rent. She also indicates that other tenants have been getting the same notices and phone calls, so this situation is not unique to me.\n\nI then give my 30\\-day notice over email, as requested, and I receive a call back from the same employee, saying the owner will continue honor my rent discount promotion from June onwards, but only if I pay the backdated rent.\n\n**Question**\n\nDo I actually owe this backdated rent? \n\nIt's suspicious that there were no notices for late rent payments until after new staff was brought in. Aren't verbal agreements binding? \n\n(Jurisdiction is US, state of California.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your title doesn't quite match your question. \"Reneging\" would mean saying that a lease would be offered at the reduced rent, and then not offering the lease. Here, they offered the lease, and you accepted. So now the question is not whether they can refuse to offer you the reduced\\-fee lease, but whether they are owed the back rent. \n\nVerbal agreements are indeed binding, but they are rather sticky from an evidential point of view. Also, there are other possible complications. If your original lease stated that verbal agreements are not binding, or that only specific people are authorized to modify the terms and the person you talked to is not such a person, then this is not binding. If after they said you could keep the rent reduction, you signed a lease for the full amount or otherwise indicated acceptance of the full amount, then it may be considered not binding.\n\nEven if the agreement is not binding, you have further arguments. If you believed that it was binding, and did so out of good faith, then there was not a meeting of the minds, and they can't go after you for breach of contract. They may have other claims, such as damages if they can show that they could have gotten more money from another prospective client, but them accepting the rent makes that difficult to pursue.\n\nNow, again, verbal agreements do have evidentiary problems. If your case were nothing than your word claiming that they agreed, you would not have much of a case. But here, you have:\n\n\\-They were willing to take the lower rent for the initial period  \n\n\\-You stated that you would leave unless given a continued discount, and you stayed   \n\n\\-They didn't make any attempt to collect the full rent for three months  \n\n\\-They are willing to give you the discount if you pay the back rent\n\nAll of this points rather strongly towards your claim being true. You also say \"this situation is not unique to me.\" It's not clear what they means, but if other tenants also got verbal assurances that the discount would continue, and they testify to that effect, then your case is even stronger.",

These elements strengthen the tenant's case despite the lack of written documentation.\nD is incorrect because there's no clear basis for suing the former property manager, and the tenant's case is against the current management, not the former employee."

You would follow up on complaints to the extent that you have the time, budget and manpower to do so and you would prosecute cases where you believe that you have a reasonable prospect of getting a conviction and where prosecution is, in your opinion, in the public interest. In the real world, that means where the police hand you a brief of evidence that is a lay\\-down [misere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mis%C3%A8re) and (for statutory rape) where there is a real power imbalance between the perpetrator and the victim \\- giving 2 willing 15 year old kids the label of 'sex offender' for life is probably not in the public interest.\n\n> But suppose there were no complaints or smoking guns.

For purposes of this example, the user says\n\n> I am actually 18 years old.\n\nMy questions are\n\n1. Whether or not the Discord server is legally required to ban this user after voluntarily saying they are 12 years old, even if they then say it was fabricated, either in the public chat or via private DM.\n2. Outside of banning the user, is there any other action the server administrators are required to take?\n3. Hypothetically speaking, could the server owner/server be held liable if god forbid something happened to or on behalf of that individual?\n\n**Useful Information**\n\n[Discord TOS says](https://discord.com/terms):\n\n> By using or accessing the Discord application (the \u201cApp\u201d) or the website located at <https://discord.com> (the \"Site\"), which are collectively referred to as the \u201cService,\u201d you agree (i) that you are 13 years of age and the minimum age of digital consent in your country, (ii) if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by the Terms, and (iii) if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms.\n\n[A recent Tweet from Discord](https://twitter.com/discord/status/1022190648932401154?lang=en):\n\n> Anyone under the age of 13 cannot use Discord per our Terms of Service. If a server owner is aware and ignores it, we will take action on the server and/or owner.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes (probably), under COPPA\n---------------------------\n\nThe FTC has stated that [YouTube content creators could be held liable](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/youtube-creators-may-also-be-held-liable-for-coppa-violations-following-ftc-settlement/) under the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act), a United States law that \"imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.\" ([source](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule))\n\nThe [FTC's FAQ on complying with COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0) notes that \"operators will be held to have acquired actual knowledge of having collected personal information from a child where, for example, they later learn of a child\u2019s age or grade from a concerned parent who has learned that his child is participating on the site or service.\"\n\nIt also has the following question/answer (emphasis added):\n\n> *I operate a general audience video game service and do not ask visitors to reveal their ages. I do permit users to submit feedback, comments, or questions by email. What are my responsibilities if I receive a request for an email response from a player who indicates that he is under age 13?*\n> \n> \n> Under the Rule\u2019s one\\-time response exception (16 C.F.R. \u00a7 312\\.5(c)(3\\)) you are permitted to send a response to the child, via the child\u2019s online contact information, without sending notice to the parent or obtaining parental consent. ***However, you must delete the child\u2019s online contact information from your records promptly after you send your response.***\n\nAssuming the FTC is correct that content creators (not just the service itself) are responsible for COPPA compliance, a Discord server administrator would likely be required to ban/delete the account of a user upon discovering (acquiring actual knowledge) that the user is under 13\\. It *may* be a defense that they believed the user's retraction and claim that it was a lie, but I wouldn't want to be stuck arguing that in court (an underage user who doesn't want to be banned certainly would have a good reason to lie about their age upon finding out that they would be banned for having admitted their actual age).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Discord server administrator discovers that a user has publicly claimed to be 12 years old in a chat, but later privately messages the administrator claiming to actually be 18. What is the most appropriate course of action for the administrator to take under COPPA regulations?\n\nA) Ignore the situation entirely, as the user's true age is unclear\nB) Immediately ban the user without further investigation\nC) Allow the user to remain but closely monitor their activity\nD) Ban the user and delete their account information, despite their later claim of being 18\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to COPPA regulations and the FTC's guidance, once an operator acquires \"actual knowledge\" of a user being under 13, they are required to take action. In this case, the public claim of being 12 years old constitutes actual knowledge. The later private claim of being 18 does not negate this, as it could easily be a lie to avoid being banned. The safest and most compliant action is to ban the user and delete their account information. This aligns with Discord's own terms of service and public statements about users under 13. While it may seem harsh, it's the most legally protective stance for the server administrator to take given the information provided and the potential liabilities under COPPA."

Now they want me to work on something similar to one of my projects.\n\nBefore I started working there, I planned to expand that particular project into a small side business. I might close the open source project as I turn it into a business. My employer does not know of my plans to start a small side business. My side project is not identical to what I would do at work, but it is similar.\n\nMy open source project has nothing to do with their products, so it would not compete against them. It would simply make some of their internal business and software development activities easier to do.\n\nThere are 4 tests for what is considered acceptable as a personal project.\n\n1. I don't compete against company interests.\n2. I don't work on it during company time, but on my own time.\n3. I don't work on it with company resources, but with my own computer.\n4. I don't reveal any company secrets.\n\nMy side project would certainly pass items 3 and 4\\. \\#2 is iffy because I can rewrite similar code at home as what I would at work. \\#1 is iffy because although the project is not even remotely related to the company's product, it does make the company a little more efficient.\n\nYet, I signed an agreement when I started saying I would turn over any intellectual property to the company that is developed during the course of my work.\n\nCan I retain ownership of any open source code I write which is similar to what I would do at work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **How can you get in trouble?**\n\n1. If they see any code you wrote for them show up in your open source project.\n\nThey own the code you write on company time. Even if your code goes into an open source project owned by the company, you still don't own that code. The only way you can own it is if they directly tell you that you may put it into your open source project.\n\n2. If you make your open source project private so nobody else can see the source code, but they see your side business has the same features you wrote for them.\n\nYou can try to get around problem \\#1 by hiding your open source project. But if they see the same features in it that they told you to write for them, they can become suspicious. They might force you to reveal the source to them in court. If you don't want them to see it, they may force you to share it with a third party who is bound by an NDA. The third party can compare your code to theirs and report if you copied any code.\n\n3. Even if your work is not directly related to the company products, your work for them can be a company secret. You reveal that, and you are in trouble.\n\nYou say your work improves internal procedures, but is not directly related the company products. If a company can reduce its cost, it can lower its prices and still make more money than their competition. That gives them a competitive edge over other businesses. By revealing how your employer does its internal work, you give that competitive edge to their competition.\n\nAlthough you say your open source project does not violate rule \\#4 \\- \"does not reveal company secrets\" \\- all three explanations mentioned above say it does.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. Quit and start your own company based on your open source project.\n\nIf you quit, you should do it before you write any code related to your project for your employer.\n\n2. Ask your company to fund your project.\n\nTalk to your boss and anybody else there who might be a stakeholder. Tell them what you can do. Make a deal with them that you get to work on your project during work hours. Maybe they could turn it into an additional source of revenue for the company. That changes you from a potential loss into a valuable asset. Their competitors might end up buying products based on your code. Many companies would love for their competition to pay them.\n\n3. Ask your employer to allow you to turn your work into your open source project.\n\nSome companies require employees who work on open source projects to give their employers a royalty\\-free license to use and modify the work as they wish.\n\n4. Ask your employer if they would use a product based on your project.\n\nYou can start a side business (with your employer's blessing), and turn them into your first customer. They get access to a beta product before their competitors do. Promise them they get it free or at a hefty discount for a year or two before the competition even knows what you have.\n\nThe first option is win/lose. You win and your employer loses. The other three options are win/win.\n\nGood luck!",

Using default credentials is similar to using a default code on a combination lock - while it's unwise from a security standpoint, it still serves as a legal barrier. Accessing the device without explicit permission from the owner, even with good intentions or using default credentials, is considered unauthorized access and therefore illegal.

Which means you can express the game rules in a different way.\n\nAlthough there were a couple landmark cases in the world of video games where courts ruled that although a game did not literally copy any of the game assets, their reimagining of the game as a whole was so close to the original that it was still copyright infringement.

The TV show's name and logo are likely protected as trademarks, which could be a basis for legal action if used without permission. \n\nAdditionally, while the developer hasn't directly copied graphics or sound effects, there have been cases (like Pac-Man vs. K.C.

However, these cases typically involved games in the same medium, and it's less clear how this would apply when transferring a concept from a TV show to a video game.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while game mechanics aren't copyrightable, other elements like trademarks could still be an issue. Option B is too strong, as similarity of format alone is unlikely to be sufficient for a successful copyright claim. Option D is incorrect because copyright infringement isn't definite in this case, especially without direct copying of protected elements.\n\nThe correct answer, C, acknowledges the potential legal risks while recognizing that trademark issues are likely to be the primary concern in this scenario."

Option A is incorrect because the documentation emphasizes that intent is crucial, and it's unlikely to be proven in this scenario where the ambassador was simply speaking at a press conference.

According to the information provided, shareholders do not have the authority to make decisions for the company or to make offers on behalf of the company, regardless of the size of their ownership stake. Major decisions, including CEO compensation and stock options, must be decided and approved by the board of directors. A shareholder acting independently to offer stock options to a CEO candidate without the board's knowledge or approval would be considered unethical and potentially illegal, as they are overstepping their role and authority within the corporate structure. Even major shareholders must work through proper channels (i.e., electing board members and voting on resolutions at general meetings) to influence company decisions."

What about products that do not contain BPA?\n\nI realize there is an issue of liability, and that labeling isn't necessarily to eliminate consumer confusion regarding products with BPA.\n\nCompare these 2 products from Target:\n[Lindt Chocolates](http://www.target.com/p/8-oz-lindt-chocolates/-/A-21498057) which are wrapped in a plastic, which could contain BPA;\nand [M\\&Ms](http://www.target.com/p/m-m-s-milk-chocolate-candies-theater-box-3-4-oz/-/A-17294021) which are sold in a cardboard box, that AFAIK does not contain BPA.\n\nLet's assume the M\\&Ms and its container do not contain BPA.\n\nIs it unlawful to provide the warning for BPA in a consumable product that doesn't contain BPA?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The warning that you link to is completely compliant with the law, in fact it is verbatim the warning that the state mandates. The regulations pertaining to warnings can be found [here](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I49EA2F10D45011DEA95CA4428EC25FA0&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1). Health and Safety Code 25249\\.6 states that\n\n> No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and\n>  intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state\n>  to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear\n>  and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in\n>  Section 25249\\.10\\.\n\nThe burden is legally on the business to establish whether a substance is contained in a product \u2013 the state does not inform businesses \"Your product has X, you must label it\" (they, or a plaintiff's attorney, *will* inform you that you have violated the law). 25249\\.10(c): \"In any action brought to enforce Section 25249\\.6, the burden of showing that an exposure meets the criteria of this subdivision shall be on the defendant\".\n\nThe regulations do not contain any provisions which forbid such warnings, thus providing a warning is legally prudent if it is possible that a regulated substance can be detected in the product. Since litigation is expensive (over a half a million was claimed by plaintiff's side in the below case), courts would not penalize a business for being overly\\-cautious. In [Consumer Defense Group v. Rental Housing Industry](http://ag.ca.gov/prop65/pdfs/G035101.pdf), the issue was that apartment buildings had parking lots, which lacked the mandated warnings regarding carcinogenic substances in a parking lot; also, tenants were allowed to smoke in their units, and there were no warning signs. Since microscopic BPA particles *might* be present in the packaging (stuff gets in the air during manufacturing), a warning is legally prudent, not to mention allowed. \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nSuciu et al 2013 \"Recycled paper\u2013paperboard for food contact materials: Contaminants suspected and migration into foods and food simulant\" studies contaminants in recycled paper and paperboard, and find \"BPA was the only substance present in all the samples\".

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under California's Proposition 65, a company is considering whether to include a warning label for Bisphenol A (BPA) on their product packaging. The product is candy packaged in a cardboard box made partially from recycled materials. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's legal obligations?\n\nA) The company must only include a BPA warning if they have definitive proof that their product packaging contains BPA.\n\nB) The company is legally forbidden from including a BPA warning if they believe their product does not contain BPA.\n\nC) The company can include a BPA warning as a precautionary measure, even if they are not certain their product contains BPA.\n\nD) The company is required by law to test their product packaging for BPA before deciding whether to include a warning label.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, companies are allowed to include Proposition 65 warnings as a precautionary measure, even if they are not certain that their product contains the substance in question. This is because:\n\n1. The burden of proof is on the business to establish whether a substance is contained in a product.\n2. Providing a warning is legally prudent if it's possible that a regulated substance can be detected in the product.\n3. Courts are unlikely to penalize a business for being overly cautious with warnings.\n4. The regulations do not forbid such precautionary warnings.\n5. Given that studies have found BPA in recycled paper and paperboard, and the product uses packaging that likely contains recycled materials, there's a reasonable possibility of BPA presence.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because definitive proof is not required. Answer B is incorrect because the law does not forbid precautionary warnings. Answer D is incorrect because while testing might be advisable, it's not specifically required by law before deciding on a warning label."

This opens the door for the prosecutor to challenge the credibility of that statement and, by extension, the credibility of the witness. The prosecutor would be allowed to bring up evidence of the Driving Safety Course to contradict the defendant's claim of a spotless record.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the prosecutor cannot bring up prior bad acts unprompted, they can challenge claims made by the defendant about their character.\n\nOption B is too restrictive.

(IOLA is called IOLTA in some states.)\n\nOur client has to pay restitution to Walmart. It has taken me months to get payment instructions from Walmart but now we have everything set. (I had to get them to assign a magic reference number.)\n\nThe easiest way to make the payment is to use a web form and enter a credit card number. That will generate an email receipt. The slightly harder way is to mail in a check and then try to wring a receipt from the office that took three months to issue a reference number.\n\nOur client tried to make the payment to the court months ago but the court wouldn't accept payment. The client wanted to get the money out of his bank account asap so he wouldn't spend it, so he wrote a check to our firm. My supervising attorney (SA) put it in his IOLA account. Now what?\n\nI think it's okay to briefly transfer the funds from IOLA to operating (business) and then make the credit card payment online. SA disagrees and thinks the only kosher way to do this is to write a check on the IOLA account. I'm going to do it his way but I'm curious whether his concern was a bit over the top. He thinks what I'm proposing would constitute commingling of funds.\n\nIf you prefer a more general question, consider almost all of the above background for why I'm asking the question. Basically what I'd like to know is, is it okay to transfer a sum out of IOLA into Operating (Business) for five minutes in order to make an online payment using a credit card. (IOLA accounts don't have credit cards associated with them.)\n\nWhat about writing a check on the IOLA account, to make a credit card payment? (To me, that would not really make things more transparent....)\n\nIt would be great to have an actual reference but a conceptual answer would be helpful too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [indiana](/questions/tagged/indiana \"show questions tagged 'indiana'\")\n\nNote: The sources below are for client escrow/trust accounts rather than IOLA accounts per se, but IOLA appears to be substantially similar in the sense that they represent funds that the lawyer is not free to spend administratively. In other words, they *are* trust funds subject to fiduciary duty and not ordinary operating accounts.\n\nThe Staff of the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission considered such a possibility in their opinion [TRUST ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: HANDLING CLIENT AND THIRD PARTY FUNDS](https://www.in.gov/courts/discipline/files/trust-account-materials-2012-03.pdf). While not stating outright that such commingling is unethical if there is neither intent to defraud nor recklessness, it gives two reasons why it could cause serious trouble:\n\n> 3. Risks of Lawyer Commingling Client Funds in Lawyer's Personal or Business Account\n\n> > (a) Client funds become available to the lawyer's personal creditors in the event of an attachment of those funds pursuant to proceedings supplementary to execution or otherwise under the Depository Financial Institutions Adverse Claims Act. IC 28\\-9\\-1\\-1, et seq. Even if the identity of the funds is later clarified, the client funds may be frozen for up to ninety (90\\) days by virtue of the automatic hold provision of IC 28\\-9\\-4\\-2\\.\n\n> > (b) Upon bankruptcy, dissolution of marriage or death of the lawyer, client funds may become a part of the lawyer's bankruptcy, marital or probate estate. Once again, there may eventually be a separation of interests in the funds, but in the meantime, client funds will be unavailable to their true owners.\n\n> > (c) ...\\[a scenario involving actual fraud and/or misappropriation]\n\nWhat they are saying is that even if you 100%, really and truly intend to just use your operating account as an \"in and out\" tool with full intention to devote your entire attention to promptly disburse the funds to their proper destination, that five minutes of commingling could coincide with some sort of legal event that would greatly complicate the payment.\n\nFor example, you transfer the client's funds from the escrow account into your firm's operating account at Time\\=0, morally confident that the transfer will be complete at Time\\=5\\. Unbeknownst to you, an earthquake occurs at Time\\=3 in which you are knocked offline and you and your entire firm are killed by falling debris. The contents of your operating account are frozen by your bank and sent to probate. Your client and Walmart hire another attorney to spend the next few months arguing over what your intentions were and why all of that \"operating\" money needs to be paid over to Walmart.\n\nSimilar to the above, you are in the middle of the transfer when a court order is served on your bank to freeze your operating account as part of some investigation into something entirely unrelated to your representation of your current client. Now, you are making your case to the court to unfreeze certain funds while Walmart is still waiting and your client is upset that you messed up something that should have been \"simple\".\n\n### A potential solution:\n\nThe same opinion, in Attachment G, provides:\n\n> Lawyers are permitted to advance filing fees for their clients out of operating funds, see, Ind. Prof. Cond. R. 1\\.8(e). In that event, no trust account questions arise from the use of a debit card that draws funds from an operating account.\n\nThe opinion then seems to indicate that debit cards should not be used, but in this case they are talking about linking cards directly to the escrow account:\n\n> May lawyers use debit cards to pay client funds for filing fees directly out of trust? The answer has two parts. First, current rules appear to prohibit it. Second, even if the rules were not an impediment, many banks refuse to issue debit cards on trust accounts.\n\nThe professional rule [cited above in the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct](https://casetext.com/rule/indiana-court-rules/indiana-rules-of-professional-conduct/client-lawyer-relationship/rule-18-conflict-of-interest-current-clients-specific-rules) provides that lawyers may \"advance court costs and expenses of litigation\". If the payment to Walmart can be considered a court cost or expense, it may be reasonable to pay the amount out of your operating fund and then immediately reimburse it with a client reimbursement from their escrow funds.\n\nThe pay\\-then\\-reimburse model also mitigates the issue mentioned above about intervening causes stopping the transfer. If you have a heart attack right after advancing the funds from your operating account but before filling out the paperwork to reimburse yourself, neither the client nor the other party (Walmart) has been adversely affected.",

The attorney wants to make an online payment using a credit card, which cannot be done directly from the IOLA account.

This method, known as the pay-then-reimburse model, aligns with the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct, which allow lawyers to \"advance court costs and expenses of litigation.\" By paying from the operating account first and then reimbursing it from the IOLA account, the lawyer avoids any potential commingling of funds and mitigates risks associated with unexpected events that could freeze accounts or complicate transfers. This approach ensures that client funds remain protected in the IOLA account until the payment is confirmed, and it provides a clear paper trail of the transaction. Options A and B involve potential ethical issues related to commingling funds or using IOLA accounts improperly, while Option D shifts the responsibility back to the client, which may not be in the client's best interest given the complexity of the payment process."

A brand is an advertising construct which identifies certain goods or services. For example, Microsoft is both a company name and a trademark while Windows is only a trademark.\n\nCompany names are regulated by whomever it is in your jurisdiction who is responsible for this: in Australia this is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). In general, within the same jurisdiction, you cannot have two company names that are the same. So, if you are not registering your company in the UK you should be fine.\n\nTrademark is about protecting brands and ensuring that there is no scope for confusion by the consumer that your goods and services are theirs (and vice\\-versa). Generally, if there is no room for confusion there is no trademark infringement. E.g., if your brand is about software and theirs is about agriculture then this is probably OK. If you both make software but you are a game company and they make accounting software this might be OK too, or it might not.",

Which of the following options would most likely be considered constitutional under the First Amendment?\n\nA) Banning all political speech using sound amplification devices between 10 PM and 7 AM\nB) Prohibiting the use of any sound amplification devices between 11 PM and 6 AM, regardless of the content of the speech\nC) Allowing sound amplification for political speech at any time, but restricting all other forms of amplified sound at night\nD) Requiring a special permit for political speech using sound amplification after 9 PM, with stricter requirements for opposing political parties\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption B is the most likely to be considered constitutional because it is content-neutral and applies equally to all forms of speech, not just political speech. This aligns with the principle that restrictions on free speech must be content-neutral to be considered constitutional.\n\nOption A is unconstitutional because it specifically targets political speech, which would be considered content-based discrimination.\n\nOption C is problematic because it favors political speech over other forms of speech, which could be seen as content-based discrimination.\n\nOption D is unconstitutional because it not only targets political speech but also discriminates based on political affiliation, which would violate the First Amendment.\n\nThe correct answer balances the right to free speech with the government's interest in maintaining peace and quiet during nighttime hours, without favoring or disfavoring any particular type of speech."

Unlike in some other countries, the Indian President has the power to keep a bill pending indefinitely, which is referred to as a \"pocket veto.\" This power effectively renders the distinction between an absolute veto (where the president actively rejects a bill) and a pocket veto (where the president simply takes no action) largely meaningless in practice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because both types of vetoes result in the bill not becoming law.\nOption B is false because neither type of veto can be directly overridden in the Indian system.\nOption C is incorrect because an absolute veto in India does not have a specific time limit.\nOption D is correct because the outcome of both an absolute veto and a pocket veto is essentially the same in the Indian context - the bill does not become law, and there's no time limit on how long the president can withhold assent.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances of the Indian presidential veto power and how it differs from veto powers in other systems like the United States."

Title I of the Act applied to information services, which were not subject to any statutory rules and over which the FCC had limited regulatory authority. Title II applied to telecommunications services and allowed for far more stringent regulation.\n\nContradicting this, Title 1 of the Act is \"TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES\", and Title 2 is \"BROADCAST SERVICES\".\n\nWhat was the SLPR referring to in that paper? Were they just paraphrasing, or were they referring to something else?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What they're really referring to is the act that the Telecommunications Act was largely an amendment of: the Communications Act of 1934\\. This is the big law the FCC deals with; in the vast majority of cases, someone citing a provision of telecommunications law (that's not FCC regulations) is citing this act. Title I of the act, like in many big setting\\-up\\-a\\-field\\-of\\-government\\-regulation acts, is general provisions; this is what the FCC can do for *all* forms of communication.

Please see his book and his television interviews for those certain circumstances that he argues would create a unconstitutional conviction.\n\nHowever the circumstances that he puts forward are **not** what prompts me to ask the question above. \n\nGenerally US citizens expect the judiciary to be the arbiter of constitutionality, with the US Supreme Court to be the **final** arbiter of in the event of an appeal. So, are US Senate impeachment convictions reviewable by the judiciary and or the Supreme Court\n\nIn the event that the answer to the title question is \"yes\", have any impeachment convictions been reviewed by the Supreme Court?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only relevant case heard by SCOTUS is [Nixon v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/), 506 U.S. 224, where a federal judge was tried and convicted for actual crimes, but would not resign his position so continued to draw his salary. The key legal question was whether the matter is \"justiciable\" (meaning, not a political matter but a legal matter). Nixon's argument was that Senate Rule XI violates the Impeachment Trial Clause, and the court held that the question (more specifically what it means to \"try\") is nonjusticiable. White \\& Blackmun, and Souter, wrote concurring opinions (which might be called on in a subsequent impeachment case) that reminds the reader (and future court) what was not part of the holding of the court, and what might therefore allow future impeachment review. White writes\n\n> The Court is of the view that the Constitution forbids us even to\n>  consider his contention. I find no such prohibition and would\n>  therefore reach the merits of the claim. I concur in the judgment\n>  because the Senate fulfilled its constitutional obligation to \"try\"\n>  petitioner.\n\nHe observes that \n\n> the Senate has very wide discretion in specifying impeachment trial\n>  procedures and because it is extremely unlikely that the Senate would\n>  abuse its discretion and insist on a procedure that could not be\n>  deemed a trial by reasonable judges.\n\nBut,\n\n> I would prefer not to announce an unreviewable discretion in the\n>  Senate to ignore completely the constitutional direction to \"try\"\n>  impeachment cases. When asked at oral argument whether that direction\n>  would be satisfied if, after a House vote to impeach, the Senate,\n>  without any procedure whatsoever, unanimously found the accused guilty\n>  of being \"a bad guy,\" counsel for the United States answered that the\n>  Government's theory \"leads me to answer that question yes.\" Tr. of\n>  Oral Arg. 51\\. Especially in light of this advice from the Solicitor\n>  General, I would not issue an invitation to the Senate to find an\n>  excuse, in the name of other pressing business, to be dismissive of\n>  its critical role in the impeachment process.\n\nSouter in his opinion states that\n\n> One can, nevertheless, envision different and unusual circumstances\n>  that might justify a more searching review of impeachment proceedings.\n>  If the Senate were to act in a manner seriously threatening the\n>  integrity of its results, convicting, say, upon a coin toss, or upon a\n>  summary determination that an officer of the United States was simply\"\n>  'a bad guy,'\", judicial interference might well be appropriate. In\n>  such circumstances, the Senate's action might be so far beyond the\n>  scope of its constitutional authority, and the consequent impact on\n>  the Republic so great, as to merit a judicial response despite the\n>  prudential concerns that would ordinarily counsel silence.\n\nIn other words, review of an impeachment is largely but not entirely off the table, at least until SCOTUS declares that impeachments are completely unreviewable, no matter what, period (unlikely to ever happen).",

US, which of the following statements best describes the current stance on judicial review of Senate impeachment convictions?\n\nA) The Supreme Court has ruled that all aspects of impeachment proceedings are completely unreviewable by the judiciary under any circumstances.\n\nB) The Supreme Court has declared that impeachment proceedings are fully reviewable by the judiciary, including the specific procedures used by the Senate.\n\nC) The Court held that impeachment proceedings are generally not justiciable, but left open the possibility of review in extreme circumstances.\n\nD) The Supreme Court established clear guidelines for when and how the judiciary can review impeachment convictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Nixon v. US, the Supreme Court held that the question of impeachment procedures is generally not justiciable (reviewable by the courts), considering it largely a political matter. However, the concurring opinions, particularly those of Justices White and Souter, suggested that there might be extreme circumstances where judicial review could be appropriate. For instance, if the Senate were to convict based on a coin toss or declare someone guilty for being a \"bad guy\" without any proper procedure, such actions might warrant judicial intervention. This leaves open a narrow possibility for review in cases of egregious violations of constitutional norms, while maintaining that under normal circumstances, impeachment proceedings are not subject to judicial review.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Court did not completely close the door on all possible reviews. Answer B is wrong as it goes too far in the opposite direction, suggesting full reviewability. Answer D is incorrect because the Court did not establish clear guidelines, but rather left the issue somewhat ambiguous for potential future cases."

They've stated that they must have received the notice no later than 00:00 (12AM) on the 10th for the twenty day notice. This to me seems more like a 21 day notice, but that's less of an issue.\n\nHowever, after I handed them a written notice, they stated that I must sign a notice to vacate that they have prepared as well, otherwise they would not acknowledge receipt of mine. I had already sent a certified letter through the post office, so they really couldn't avoid acknowledgment of the letter, but as of the time of me going into the office to hand in one personally, it hadn't arrived yet (according to the tracking number). Not knowing if my twenty days was twenty days or not, and that they hadn't received my letter, I agreed to sign theirs and everything looked fine on the paperwork.\n\nHowever, after everything was signed, that stated that because I would still be there on the first of the month, I would need to pay the entire month's rent for April, *and* that after the date mentioned on the notice (April 30\\) that they would be able to market the apartment as available. I objected to this, stating that if I'm paying for an entire month's rent, that I have a right to be there for the entire month. They said absolutely not, as it is their right as a leasing agency in Washington to do this. I haven't been able to find anything in my research that would indicate that this is the case, but IANAL.\n\nIs there precedent for this in Washington? Do they get to double\\-dip in this manner? Because as written, it seems like they could have someone start their lease at the first day after what I mentioned in my noticed (May 1\\), and have the new tenant pay for May, after I have already paid for May.\n\nRelevant section from the lease\n\n> NOTICE TO VACATE Resident understands Washington State Law requires that to terminate residency, twenty\n>  (20\\) days written notice must be given to Landlord or to Resident by Landlord prior to the end of the monthly\n>  term. Resident agrees that if he/she remains in possessions of said unit after date of intention to vacate, he/she will pay a\n>  daily rental of $75\\.00 thereafter.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [law in Washington](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.200), RCW 59\\.18\\.200 (also stated in [59\\.04\\.20](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.04.020)), states that\n\n> When premises are rented for an indefinite time, with monthly or other\n>  periodic rent reserved, such tenancy shall be construed to be a\n>  tenancy from month to month, or from period to period on which rent is\n>  payable, and shall be terminated by written notice of twenty days or\n>  more, preceding the end of any of the months or periods of tenancy,\n>  given by either party to the other.\n\nI assume you have a month\\-to\\-month agreement (otherwise, you would be at the end of the lease and you don't have to give notice). The law simply requires written notice, and does not require any special form or signature. The misunderstanding by the agency about what 20 days is is common enough (after all, 30\\-20\\=10\\). One possible cause of confusion is over whether the law is stated in terms of tenants giving notice versus landlord receiving notice. The statute is not clear on this, but the above clause says \"given by either party to the other\", not \"received by either party from the other\".\n\nIf it is concluded, somehow (contrary to your attorney's argument) that your notice was not sufficiently timely, one option is to simply pay the next month's rent (at whatever the agreed rate is) and not leave until the end of the next month (giving timely notice early in the month). Under that option, landlord may not re\\-rent or otherwise illegally enter the premise, until the end of the subsequent month. A tenant may physically stay beyond the end of the lease, without paying \u2013 this is known as \"[unlawful detainer](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.12.030)\": under that circumstance, the landlord can take you to court to have you evicted and recover their damages (which would include attorney fees as well as lost rent), so that is not the best course of action). A third option is to abandon the unit. [The law](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.230) provides\n\n> If the tenant defaults in the payment of rent and reasonably indicates\n>  by words or actions the intention not to resume tenancy, the tenant\n>  shall be liable for the following for such abandonment: PROVIDED, That\n>  upon learning of such abandonment of the premises the landlord shall\n>  make a reasonable effort to mitigate the damages resulting from such\n>  abandonment\n\nThe liability clause says:\n\n> When the tenancy is month\\-to\\-month, the tenant shall be liable for the\n>  rent for the thirty days following either the date the landlord learns\n>  of the abandonment, or the date the next regular rental payment would\n>  have become due, whichever first occurs.\n\nThere is a problem with \"the date the landlord learns of the abandonment\": when (or what) exactly is \"the abandonment\", and does \"learning of the abandonment\" have to follow \"the abandonment\"? It may be tempting to think that signalling the intent to abandon starts the clock, but [Washington case law](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1215159/moore-v-northwest-fabricators-inc/) states that \"Abandonment, as applied to leases, involves an absolute relinquishment of premises by a tenant, consisting of act or omission and an intent to abandon\", citing NJ [precedent](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3577143/schnitzer-v-lanzara/). There does not appear to be any case law clarifying the meaning of \"learning of the abandonment\": it would probably require expensive litigation to establish that this means \"learning of the intent to abandon\", so you might as well assume that the abandonment clock starts from when you are really out of the unit. If you leave at the end of the month, indicate an intent to abandon the unit, and do not pay rent, then you will have abandoned the unit, and you will be liable for 1 month rent. However, they law also imposes an obligation to mitigate the damage, which basically means, no double\\-dipping.\n\nLeaving aside unlawful detainer, both the abandonment approach and the \"keep it another month\" approach entail paying another month's rent. In the former case, you have no claim on the unit but they can only ding you for rent for the number of unoccupied days. In the latter case, there is no option to pay less than a month's rent, but you retain full tenant rights (they cannot enter or re\\-rent). In neither case is there an avenue for both keeping the full month's rent from you, *and* re\\-renting the unit.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Washington state gives a 20-day notice to vacate on the 11th of the month, planning to move out on the 30th. The landlord claims they must receive the notice by the 10th and insists the tenant pay the full next month's rent while also allowing the landlord to market the apartment as available after the 30th. Which of the following is correct according to Washington state law?\n\nA) The landlord is correct in all aspects - the notice was late, full month's rent is due, and the apartment can be marketed immediately after the 30th.\n\nB) The tenant's notice is valid, but they must pay the full month's rent and allow the landlord to market the apartment after the 30th.\n\nC) The tenant's notice is valid, and if they pay the full month's rent, they have the right to occupy the apartment for the entire month. The landlord cannot market it during this time.\n\nD) The tenant's notice is invalid, but the landlord cannot require both full month's rent and the right to market the apartment early.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Washington state law (RCW 59.18.200), a 20-day notice is required \"preceding the end of any of the months or periods of tenancy.\" The law states the notice must be \"given\" not \"received,\" so the tenant's notice on the 11th is likely valid. If the tenant pays for the entire month's rent, they have the right to occupy the unit for the full month. The landlord cannot \"double-dip\" by collecting full rent from the current tenant while also marketing and potentially renting the apartment to a new tenant during the same period. The landlord has an obligation to mitigate damages, but this only applies after the tenant has truly vacated the premises."

[Reynolds v. Sims](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/377/533/), 377 U.S. 533 and related cases held that districts within a state have to be comparable in population, but does not directly rule on whether a state can decide to leave a certain geographical area entirely out of the subdivision into districts (the issue there was districts that were lopsided, population\\-wise). [\u00a72 of the 14th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) does maintain that\n\n> when the right to vote...is denied to any of the male inhabitants ...\n> or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or\n> other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced...\n\nso the state\\-wide basis for counting representatives would be reduced.\n\nNo existing constitutional amendment, federal law, or supreme court ruling expressly denies this possibility. The reasoning of Reynold v. Smith does, however, strongly point to the outcome that SCOTUS would find such an exclusion to be unconstitutional, because as that ruling says at the top of \u00a7II,\n\n> Undeniably, the Constitution of the United States protects the right\n> of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as well as in federal,\n> elections.\n\nBeing a minor or a felon are the only two recognized grounds for depriving a citizen of the right to vote in Congressional elections in their state.",

Sims strongly suggests that such an action would be found unconstitutional. The Supreme Court stated in that case that the Constitution protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote in both state and federal elections. Deliberately excluding a major city would likely be seen as abridging this fundamental right.

The question confuses the concepts of property ownership with rental agreements. Joint tenancy and tenancy in common are ways of owning property, not leasing it. As tenants, Alex, Ben, Charlie, Dana, and now Emma are simply renting the property and do not have ownership rights. Their addition or removal from the lease does not affect the ownership structure of the property, which remains with the landlord. The lease agreement can be modified to include Emma without changing the fundamental nature of their tenancy or the landlord's ownership status. The other options incorrectly assume that the tenants have ownership rights or that their rental agreement directly impacts the property's ownership structure."

You can socialize just fine, to an extent, through applications like Slack, but there's also something to be said for having some in\\-person socialization throughout the day. Therefore shared workspaces and things like that have a solid purpose.\n\nHowever whereas shared workspaces can be expensive, public libraries are free. So assuming someone just needs their laptop to work, and not two huge monitors or anything else like that \\- assuming they can just throw everything in a normal\\-sized laptop bag \\- what's stopping them from using the public library 8 hours a day, 5 days a week indefinitely?\n\n(Just to be clear, I'm not talking about chatting with people throughout the day. It's just the idea of having other people in close proximity, as an ambient aspect, and that sort of thing in general. Occasionally having someone to nod to while walking by and that kind of thing. The thing that's being avoided is being completely alone inside one's apartment all day or something.)\n\nLibraries will often have free wi\\-fi, a free place to charge the laptop, free everything except coffee. And if it's just the occasional person doing this, they probably won't mind. However, especially considering the work\\-from\\-home situation with COVID\\-19, what's stopping these places from being swarmed and overcrowded indefinitely with people of this nature?\n\n***In particular, in a typical US municipality, what legal setup blocks public libraries from being swarmed by people using them indefinitely as free work offices? What are the normal legal limits that allow libraries to get used like this in moderation, while preventing them from getting overrun?***\n\nFWIW, the main reason this has come to my mind is that, for certain reasons, I've been spending a few weeks on the other side of the US from where I live. During this time, I've found working inside the local library to be usually fairly preferable to working inside the hotel/hostel. So much so, that it's tempting to keep doing this once I'm back home next week, and I'm wondering how much is too much, and how that's reflected in a typical legal setup.\n\n---\n\nThis question was suggested as a duplicate: [Legal Doubts Regarding Park Rules](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61107/legal-doubts-regarding-park-rules)\n\nThe important thing here is that I am ***not*** talking about breaking any rules. The second the library tells me to pack up the computer, I will. However no such limit has been imposed for several days, and they've actually acted fairly friendly and accommodating up to this point.\n\nTherefore, *is there anything in the **law** (in a typical setup) that places a major limit on this type of usage?* If it is nothing more than just simply waiting until the library staff say something, then that answers the question. I just want to make sure there's nothing in a typical *legal setup* that places a meaningful limit on this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First point: During the pandemic, most libraries have ceased in person services and only do downloads, pre\\-arranged loans, pick up and drop off.\n\nSecond point: In non\\-pandemic times, typical U.S. municipal library is a somewhat odd mix of young children with parents or nannies, homeless people, remote workers who don't need to talk on the phone much, retirees, and middle school and high school students studying and reading for pleasure (with the studying more common among students whose home situations aren't well suited to studying due to poverty, many siblings or housemates, or noisy family members or neighbors who play instruments). Libraries are usually incentivized to be well occupied as it helps when they seek municipal budget contributions or tax levies.\n\nFWIW, I've used municipal libraries for lengthy research projects as a lawyer now and then, both in times when I've been between offices (e.g. at one point tenant finish wasn't done at my new office but my old lease has expired and I was mostly working from home), and when I need to concentrate and the phone and colleagues interrupting me with innocent reasonable questions that aren't urgent keep interrupting me.\n\nThird point: It is rare in practice for libraries to be overwhelmed with remote workers, in part, because you can't really talk on the phone or attend Zoom meetings, or meet with people. It is also poor for spreading out with a lot of dead tree paper, especially if filing is necessary. Coffee shops which allow for talking and allow food and drink are more popular and commonly used by low volume realtors and lawyers without offices (I used them for meetings when I was a newly admitted solo practitioner), day traders, freelance and novel writers, graduate students, etc. The prohibition on talking and on consuming food and drinks in the library mostly solves the problem. Also, lots of remote workers don't want to work someplace that has little children squealing during story time and lots of homeless people. In my experience, the most common kind of remote workers in municipal libraries are day traders.\n\nIt is much more common for municipal libraries in the U.S. (which are one of the only places you can just be without spending money) to come up with ways to limit homeless people (or to better accommodate them) than to boot them out. Many municipal libraries in urban areas have hired social workers in lieu of security staff to regulate things, place limits on sleeping in the place, and sometimes place a maximum number of hours in place.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHT: Libraries are publicly owned property, and as such, library managers have not only the regulatory authority of a representative of the government, but also all of the rights of a property owner at their disposal legally. This gives them wide discretion to adopt and enforce rules that couldn't be imposed otherwise.",

This gives them wide discretion to adopt and enforce rules that couldn't be imposed otherwise.\" This clearly indicates that library managers have broad authority derived from both their governmental role and property ownership rights, allowing them to set and enforce a wide range of rules for library use. Options A, B, and D are too limited in scope and do not accurately reflect the extent of authority described in the passage."

I realize that they the airline has deep pockets / insurance so from that standpoint they are \"ripe\" for the picking. That being said, they did not arrest Mr. Lowe and the video evidence should have immediately exonerated Lowe. IANAL.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem was that the arresting officer and the investigating officer were two different people. After American airlines misidentified Mr Lowe as the suspect a warrant was issued for an arrest, and it wasn't until about a year later when officers in New Mexico ran his name and found that he had a warrant that they detained him. So their actions were perfectly proper. The length of his detention was primarily because the USA functions as separate legal jurisdictions, so you can be held for some time on a warrant for another state.\n\nPossibly the investigating officer should not have relied on American Airlines identification of the suspect. However, Mr. Lowe would have to overcome the qualified immunity bar to sue the PD.\n\nThe case against the airline is that of negligence: they had no duty to single out Mr. Lowe; they could just have turned over all the data, as requested. Having chosen effectively to carry out their own investigation, the claim is that they owed a common law duty of care to Mr. Lowe to do it competently. It's clear that misidentifying Mr. Lowe as the suspect was likely to do him harm, so it's a reasonable foundation for a claim. More than that, we will have to see.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Michael Lowe vs. American Airlines, what is the primary legal basis for Lowe's lawsuit against the airline?\n\nA) False arrest, as American Airlines directly caused Lowe's arrest\nB) Breach of privacy, for sharing Lowe's personal information with law enforcement\nC) Negligence, for failing to provide all requested passenger data and singling out Lowe\nD) Defamation, for wrongly identifying Lowe as a criminal suspect to the police\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) Negligence. The lawsuit against American Airlines is primarily based on their negligent handling of the police request for passenger data. Instead of providing \"any and all recorded travel data for all individuals\" on the flight as requested by the search warrant, the airline only produced identification for one passenger - Michael Lowe. This selective provision of information, which was not required or requested, forms the basis of the negligence claim. The airline had no duty to single out any particular passenger, and by doing so, they failed to exercise reasonable care, potentially causing harm to Lowe.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because American Airlines did not directly arrest Lowe; the arrest was carried out by law enforcement based on the information provided by the airline.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the airline was complying with a legal search warrant, so sharing information with law enforcement in this context would not constitute a breach of privacy.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the airline's actions did lead to Lowe being identified as a suspect, the lawsuit is not primarily about defamation but about the negligent handling of the information request."

To people that have shared my photos (again in private chats and groups) or to Facebook? I have already kindly asked to remove the photos to people but I have not received reply.\nHow can I have the proof that the photos have been deleted?\n\nIn my opinion, since the photos were shared using Facebook they cannot considered private as it is an online tool and social media. What do you think?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are trying to invoke your Art 17 GDPR right to erasure. However, this right has many limitations. As a rule of thumb, your GDPR rights might not apply if their exercise would negatively impact other people.\n\nIn this scenario, you're seeking to delete images from other people's private chats. Requiring Facebook to search their chat messages according to your instructions would likely be a disproportionate invasion into those people's privacy, unless those images are inherently illegal. Even if you were the copyright holder for these images, it would likely be disproportionate to retroactively search the chats and potentially delete images. But you can't be the copyright holder since you didn't create those photos.\n\nAll of this means:\n\n* Facebook will likely refuse to act on your requests.\n* Those other people will likely refuse your requests.\n* A court is unlikely to order Facebook or those other people to perform a search and delete offending images.\n\nYou are claiming that since the images were shared with Facebook that there wouldn't be any expectation of privacy. This is a valid argument in the US (see the [third party doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine)). However, this argument doesn't fly in Europe in the context of the GDPR. Under the GDPR, any processing of personal data requires a legal basis, such as a specific law, the user's consent, or a legitimate interest. Facebook is bound by its privacy policy to keep private chats private. It has no legal basis to search those chats for the purpose of fulfilling your requests, unless you can get a valid court order that compels Facebook.\n\nMost likely, you won't be able to prevent private use of these images, for example your ex shares them in private messages. However, you may have personality rights that prevent wider circulation and publication of these images. That is difficult to enforce in the context of the internet, but it's more enforceable than what you're currently trying to do. If you're in a photo and you don't like it, you can report the photo to Facebook.",

Searching private messages for photos would likely be considered a disproportionate invasion of other users' privacy. Facebook is bound by its privacy policy to keep private chats private and has no legal basis to search those chats without a court order.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Facebook is not legally obligated to search private messages, as this would violate other users' privacy rights.\n\nOption B is incorrect because individuals do have some rights regarding their personal data, but these rights are limited when they conflict with others' rights.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while this argument might work in the US under the third-party doctrine, it doesn't apply in Europe under GDPR. The GDPR requires a legal basis for any processing of personal data, even on social media platforms."

I do understand that many high level organizations such as the NSA, Intelligence Agencies in many countries etcetera do monitor these activities heavily. Therefore I'm sure any such research would be monitored one way or another\\-\\-\\- enough said on that.\n\nMy question here is, how is it possible to learn in this direction if my country and many others forbid even the possession of software for \"hacking\" despite intentions? This seems one of the main tools used to learn vulnerabilities and how to defend against them. For ones own security purposes as well as better security for others also and my own software development securities.\n\nWhile I understand the intentions behind such laws being directed at nefarious intentions, what about progress in this direction, what about people who want to enter the field or simply learn for ethical reasons?

If your state has passed a law making it a felony to be outside without a mask, you can perform a citizen's arrest (but no state has such a law).

Legal guardianship is not required for this process. Additionally, the child can leave the country with the grandparents to join their parents, provided there's a notarized letter of consent from both parents.

What is the most appropriate approach for the developer to use these logos legally?\n\nA) The developer can freely use any logos found online, as they are publicly available images\nB) The developer must create their own versions of the logos to avoid copyright issues\nC) The developer should follow each company's published logo usage guidelines and download official assets when available\nD) The developer should avoid using any logos and instead use text descriptions of the social media platforms\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is for the developer to follow each company's published logo usage guidelines and use official assets. Many large internet companies, including social media platforms, provide specific rules and guidelines for using their logos in third-party applications. These guidelines typically specify requirements for color, size, and placement of the logos. By adhering to these guidelines and using official assets provided by the companies, the developer can legally incorporate the logos into their app without risking trademark infringement. This approach balances the need for brand recognition with respect for intellectual property rights. Options A and B could lead to legal issues, while D unnecessarily avoids using valuable visual cues that can enhance user experience."

They are a long standing couple and have no desire to split up. Child was conceived due to a failure in birth control.\n\nThere is **no question or denial** of paternity.\n\nFather *does not* want the child.\n\nMother *does* want the child.\n\nAssuming abortion is legal in all instances. I know a mother can choose to have or abort a child *without* the father's consent. Should she morally be okay with that. (My goal is not a question on abortion) But what rights does the father have should he not want the child? If the mother decides to birth and keep the child, against the father's wishes, what legal responsibilities does the father have regarding support?\n\nRemoving abortion itself from the issue....\n===========================================\n\n**What can a father do to legally terminate all responsibility toward an unwanted child??**\n\nA mother may have several different options available to her, however what does the father have? It would seem ultimately the father has no rights to refuse an unwanted child. Is this true?\n\n(Note: I'm not even attempting to support or condone \"deadbeat\" parents in *any* way. Or provide an \"out\" to men that want to shirk responsibilities. That's not the question. If there is a responsibility to support a child, it should be honored in *all* instances without exception.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not much.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. The father can not force the mother to abort the pregnancy.\n2. *Ex post facto* agreements of non\\-payment are, in all likelihood, unenforceable.\n3. The father will be obligated to pay child support under the laws of the state with jurisdiction over the paternity.\n\nThe abortion angle won\u2019t work.\n------------------------------\n\nSetting aside commentary regarding the politics or ethics of abortion. I think we can agree it is a highly charged and emotional topic for some people. I point to the fact it always seems to be an issue during Supreme Court nominations and presidential elections.\n\nGiven the explosive nature of the issue of whether abortions should be legal or not (in the case where the mother does *not* want to carry full term) could you imagine how much more dynamite it would add to the debate if the question were whether or not to allow the father to force the mother to terminate the pregnancy **against the mother's wishes**!\n\nOne can only imagine how much more bombastic the abortion debate might then become.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape child support (most likely).\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTo give you a sense of how difficult it is to escape the obligations of child support. Consider the following...\n\n[A Kansas man was ordered to pay child support when he thought he was being a sperm donor only](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/23/justice/kansas-sperm-donation/) and signed numerous agreements with the lesbian couple he thought he was *helping*. In that case, the court justified its ruling on the grounds that a doctor was not involved in the insemination process.\n\nBut nothing prevents future courts from making the same ruling in cases where a doctor *is* involved in the insemination process. Especially if that state either withdraws from the ***The Uniform Parentage Act***, amends it, repeals it, or never adopts it in the first place.\n\nSperm Donors and Child Support:\n\n> Even in cases in which the donor is known, but holds himself out as unknown, some courts have held the donor legally obligated to pay child support.\n\n[Read more here](http://family-law.freeadvice.com/family-law/child_support/artificial_insemination_donor_obligation.htm).\n\n*Ex post facto* agreements are problematic.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNow that you've edited the question, the above link is even more useful for providing a possible avenue to try (albeit unlikely to work): a ***non\\-payment agreement***. The discussion in that link describes that even if you could somehow convince the mother to go along with it, it is unlikely (though not impossible) to be enforced by the courts. It depends on the facts (e.g., intercourse vs. *in vitro*), circumstances (e.g., relationship vs. no relationship between the parties), timing (e.g., before vs. after the agreement), etc. of the impregnation itself.\n\nNotwithstanding all the above, if you still have questions, you might consider floating an idea of an approach you think you might try (in a separate question) and get reactions to that specific proposal.",

The documentation clearly states that the father has very limited options to avoid legal and financial responsibility for the child. The father cannot force the mother to have an abortion, which rules out option A. While non-payment agreements are mentioned, they are described as \"problematic\" and \"unlikely to work,\" making option B incorrect. Option D is not supported by the information provided, as there is no mention of a father being able to unilaterally terminate all parental rights and responsibilities simply by declaring his intention.

I get annoyed when they have the anti racism campaigns in English football when they say that society has to eradicate all forms of discrimination. I think they may mean all forms of unfair discrimination but it still seems ignorant to what discrimination really means.\n\nThere was a landmark case in the Western Cape where a rich wine farm was left in a will to the land owner's nephews. The land owner's 5 daughters sought to have the will deemed invalid because the daughters believed it was discriminated based on gender, because right or wrongly the land owner believed farming was a man's job.\n\nAfter years of litigation the SA courts said that although the sister was indeed discriminated against that it does not invalidate a will. People are free to leave their possession in a will in accordance with any reason they may choose. In effect deeming it fair discrimination. Also noting an inheritance is a gift and nobody has a right to it.\n\nSo in closing, I would like to know if the US system has a similar concept of fair and unfair discrimination. If they even use those words. After all you discriminate against Pepsi everytime you buy Coke.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, what is \"fair\" and \"unfair\" is typically not a legal question, in large part because it is so subjective. There are some exceptions \\-\\- such as in copyright law or competition law \\-\\- but in the discrimination context, we use the lawful/unlawful distinction.\n\nBequeathing a house to your child solely because he is your child, for instance, is not fair but it is lawful. The same is true for giving more to your oldest child simply for being the oldest, or cutting a black relative out of your will: not fair, but lawful. Assuming there's a valid will, a court will rarely make a serious inquiry into the fairness of the decedent's discrimination among beneficiaries.\n\nThe same types of issues come up in contexts that are more routine subjects of discrimination law. In employment, for instance, you might have two employees: a lazy white salesman who's been around for 20 years and a new black woman who does an excellent job answering the phones.\n\nIf you only have enough money to give one raise, giving it to the black woman is both fair and lawful. Giving it to the white guy because he's been around longer is probably not fair but still lawful, while giving it to him strictly because he's white is probably neither fair nor lawful.\n\nThe inutility of the fair/unfair distinction can become especially clear in the affirmative\\-action context, where the question of fairness remains hotly debated.\n\nIf an employer has two equally qualified candidates, would it be fair to require him to choose a black applicant over a white applicant as a means of redressing centuries of discrimination against blacks? What if the black applicant is only marginally less qualified? What if the black applicant is far less qualified? There are many who think each of these would be fair, and there are many who think none of them would be.\n\nIn the end, then, the courts tend only to ask whether discrimination is lawful, which can usually be resolved by applying the facts to the law, leaving questions about what is fair to lawmakers and commentators.",

It rewards job performance without explicitly discriminating based on protected characteristics. Option A, while possibly lawful, may not be considered fair. Option C is both unfair and unlawful as it explicitly discriminates based on race. Option D, while lawful and potentially fair in some contexts, doesn't necessarily reward job performance like option B does."

While a stroke is not specifically mentioned in the FMLA documentation, the resulting medical conditions from a stroke would likely qualify as a serious health condition, especially if it requires ongoing medical treatment or incapacitates the family member. The leave is unpaid, not paid as suggested in option A. The 26-week provision in option B is specifically for care of covered servicemembers, not for general family health conditions. Option D is incorrect because a stroke and its after-effects would typically qualify as a serious health condition under FMLA guidelines."

The key factors are:\n\n1. The person's honest belief about the circumstances\n2. The necessity of using force\n3. The reasonableness of the force used\n\nIn this scenario, if Alice honestly believes Mallory is attempting to unlawfully kill Bob, she can use force to protect him.

In this situation, the deposit is likely considered liquidated damages to cover the broker's potential costs, even without a signed formal agreement. The act of giving a deposit constitutes some level of agreement, and there are usually circumstances under which such deposits are not refundable. This is not considered theft, but rather a contract dispute. The customer's recourse would be to sue for the deposit amount, arguing that the broker did not incur significant costs. Options A and C are incorrect because this situation does not meet the legal definitions of theft by unlawful taking or theft by deception.

See *Harper \\& Row v.

As explained in Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises, copyright law aims to balance First Amendment rights with the protection of authors' expressions. This balance is achieved by allowing ideas to be freely communicated while protecting the specific expression of those ideas.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while ideas are abstract, they can be protected by other forms of intellectual property law, such as patents for certain types of ideas (e.g., processes or methods).\n\nOption B is incorrect because the First Amendment does not prohibit all protection of ideas. In fact, ideas can be protected through patents, and the First Amendment is used to justify the idea/expression dichotomy in copyright law rather than prohibit all idea protection.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while some ideas (like processes) can be protected by patents, not all ideas fall under patent protection.

In the same vein, [Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/317/269/case.html) held that \"an accused, in the exercise of a free and intelligent choice and with the considered approval of the court, may waive trial by jury, and so, likewise, may waive his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel\". In [Faretta v.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the consumer's rights and the potential impact on their credit report?\n\nA) The debt will definitely appear on the consumer's credit report, and there's no way to dispute it after payment.\n\nB) The consumer has no right to seek reimbursement, even if they can prove they were up-to-date on payments before the account was closed.\n\nC) The debt is unlikely to appear on the credit report if paid promptly, and the consumer may be entitled to reimbursement if they can prove they were up-to-date on payments.\n\nD) The consumer should ignore the collection agency's request and wait for written notice before taking any action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the expert answer, if the consumer promptly pays the amount requested by the collection agency, it's unlikely to appear on their credit report. The answer also suggests that the consumer may be entitled to reimbursement if they can prove they were up-to-date on their payments before the account was closed. This aligns with option C, which accurately reflects both the potential credit report impact and the possibility of seeking reimbursement."

Is the warrant issued anytime cheque bounces by default ?\n2. Or B has to press charges against A for cheque to bounce ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A warrant is never automatically issued. A warrant (I assume you mean arrest warrant) can be issued under court orders, if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. If a court orders A to pay money to B and A does not, A can be arrested. A court will not *sua sponte* make such an order without some petition by a harmed party. So B could sue A for the amount owed, and the burden is on B.\n\nThere are criminal laws that pertain to check bouncing, for example in Washington under [RCW 9a.56\\.060](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.060) it is a crime, but not every check\\-bouncing is a crime. You have to have \"intent to defraud\", \"knowing at the time..that he or she has not sufficient funds\". If convicted you will be fined, and may be imprisoned. Even in the case of a fraudulent intent, there is no automatic warrant (the police do not know what has come to pass). B does not \"press charges\", but they can complain to the police who may investigate and find that there is evidence of fraudulent intent (which can lead to an arrest warrant). They may also conclude that the evidence of fraud is insufficient.",

An arrest warrant is never automatically issued when a check bounces (ruling out option A). Person B doesn't technically \"press charges,\" but can complain to the police, who may then investigate (ruling out option B). Not every bounced check results in criminal charges; there must be evidence of fraudulent intent (ruling out option D). \n\nThe correct process, as described in the documentation, involves Person B potentially complaining to the police, who may then investigate. If they find probable cause of fraudulent intent (such as Person A knowing they had insufficient funds), this could lead to an arrest warrant being issued. However, this is not automatic and requires a specific legal process, including a court order based on evidence of a crime."

The point is: there is a lawyer doing bad things (because a mix of love and money) and he must (following orders) write all of those things on a report. \n\nHowever, since he is a lawyer and he is not the mastermind behind those things, I'm thinking if there is something that he could write on this report, in a law perspective, to minimize his penalty if he gets caught. For example: \"according to article X, since I was just following orders, I appeal to my Y rights\" or anything like this.\n\nIt don't has to be a elaborate defense (but I will be glad if it will) since it is just a side note on a book full of proves of his crimes. If it matters, the story take place in Oregon, USA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's nothing he can really write that any court would have to listen to \\- after all, from the court's perspective, he could have been lying when he wrote it down. And following orders is generally not a defense (although if he was under actual duress, like they were threatening to kill him if he didn't do it, that could be a defense.) But being a pawn rather than a mastermind *can* impact the sentence.\n\nIf the crime is a federal one, the [Federal Sentencing Guidelines](https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2018-guidelines-manual/annotated-2018-chapter-3) adjust the offense level according to the role in the crime:\n\n> \u00a73B1\\.1\\.

Mitigating Role\n> \n> \n> Based on the defendant's role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows:\n> \n> \n> (a) If the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels.\n> \n> \n> (b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.\n> \n> \n> In cases falling between (a) and (b), decrease by 3 levels.\n\nThe lawyer would probably not qualify as a \"minimal participant\" if he's writing reports detailing the activity, as this shows he's aware of the extent of the illegality. He would, however, probably qualify as a \"minor participant\".\n\nIf the crime was a state crime, then according to [Oregon rules](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=265531):\n\n> (1\\) Subject to the provisions of sections (2\\) and (3\\) of this rule, the following nonexclusive list of mitigating and aggravating factors may be considered in determining whether substantial and compelling reasons for a departure exist:\n> \n> \n> (a) Mitigating factors:\n> \n> \n> (D) The offense was principally accomplished by another and the defendant exhibited extreme caution or concern for the victim.\n> \n> \n> (E) The offender played a minor or passive role in the crime.",

According to the information provided, repealing a regulation does not limit the executive's discretion in interpreting statutes. The executive branch can continue to assert the same interpretation even after a regulation is repealed. Moreover, if challenged, this interpretation would likely be entitled to Chevron deference, which is a principle in administrative law where courts defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because repealing a regulation does not prohibit the executive from maintaining the same interpretation. It simply removes the formal regulatory statement of that interpretation.\n\nAnswer B is partly correct in that the executive can continue to assert the interpretation, but it's wrong to say they would receive no deference. In fact, they would likely receive Chevron deference.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the executive branch does not need Congressional approval to interpret statutes within its purview. The power to interpret and implement statutes is part of the executive's role in enforcing laws.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the relationship between regulations and statutory interpretation, as well as knowledge of administrative law principles like Chevron deference."

The ADA does not require covered entities to modify policies, practices, or procedures if it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public. Nor does it overrule legitimate safety requirements. If admitting service animals would fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program, service animals may be prohibited.

When might a service dog's presence fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program provided to the public?\n> \n> \n> \n> > A. In most settings, the presence of a service animal will not result in a fundamental alteration. However, there are some exceptions. For example, at a boarding school, service animals could be restricted from a specific area of a dormitory reserved specifically for students with allergies to dog dander. At a zoo, service animals can be restricted from areas where the animals on display are the natural prey or natural predators of dogs, where the presence of a dog would be disruptive, causing the displayed animals to behave aggressively or become agitated. They cannot be restricted from other areas of the zoo.\n\nThis seems to indicate that the zoo exception exists because it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the zoo. I don't think that it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of a store with a mascot cat for the cat to be temporarily restricted to the upstairs living quarters or other area away from the customer areas where a service dog must be permitted to accompany a disabled customer.\n\nIn the FAQ document [Service Animals under the ADA](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&ved=2ahUKEwiPjc6Z2rniAhVic98KHQufCwYQFjAPegQIBxAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fadagreatlakes.com%2FPublications%2FLegal_Briefs%2FBriefNo015ServiceAnimals.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1WqMqFp4MSRGQsX4cPQMPs) from the Great Lakes ADA center, on page 7, it is said that:\n\n> In General Covered entities must modify policies,\n>  practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a\n>  disability in any area open to the general public, unless the entity can demonstrate\n>  (1\\) that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the\n>  entity\u2019s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n>  accommodations, (2\\) the safe operation of the entity would be jeopardized, or (3\\)\n>  such modifications would result in an undue financial or administrative burden.\n> \n> \n> 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 35\\.130(b)(7\\), 35\\.136, 35\\.150 (a)(3\\), 35\\.164, 36\\.301(b), 36\\.302 (c)(1\\),\n>  and 36\\.303(a). \n> \n> \n> DOJ commentary suggests that Congress intended the ADA\n>  to allow service animals the \u201cbroadest feasible access\u201d to public\n>  accommodations and public entities and to avoid unnecessarily separating service\n>  animals from from their owners. 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, App. C.\n> \n> \n> Covered entities that have blanket policies or practices that exclude service animals\n>  may be subjected to court orders or settlement agreements requiring modification of the relevant policy or practice.\n\nOn pages 8\\-9 of the same document it is said that:\n\n> It is the entity\u2019s burden to allege and prove the existence of a fundamental alteration. The outcome of such defense will depend on the distinct\n>  facts of each case.\n\nThe document cites [*Lentini v. California Center for the Arts, Escondido*, 370 F.3d 837 (9th Cir.2004\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1371927.html), in which (according to the document) an attempt to exclude a service dog which had previously barked during musical concerts was not allowed, and a \"fundamental alteration\" defense was denied at both the distinct and circuit court levels.\n\nThe Great Lakes document also cited *Johnson v. Gambrinus Company/Spoetzel Brewery*, 116 F.3d 1052 (5th Cir. 1997\\), in which a brewery attempted to exclude a service dog for a tour open to the public, Citing FDA regulations in support of a \"no animals\" policy, and argued that to admit animals would constitute a \"fundamental change\". The Fifth Circuit ruled that the brewery must modify its policy, and awarded damages under a parallel state law.\n\nThis seems to confirm that the \"zoo exception\" is limited to a situation where the animals on display are a \"fundamental\" part of the operation of the facility, as is surely the case with a zoo, but would not be the case in a store as described in the question. \n\nI have not found any case law directly on point.

The ADA requires businesses to make reasonable modifications to accommodate service animals, and the presence of store cats does not qualify for the limited \"zoo exception.\" The store owner cannot legally deny entry to a service dog based solely on the presence of cats. Instead, they should make a reasonable accommodation by temporarily relocating the cats to allow the service dog to accompany its handler. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a retail store with cats does not create a \"zoo-like\" environment that would qualify for the exception. \n\nOption B is incorrect because requiring a service dog to be muzzled is not a standard accommodation and could interfere with the dog's ability to perform its tasks. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the presence of a service dog in a retail store is unlikely to fundamentally alter the nature of the business, and the burden of proof for such a claim would be on the store owner."

There are no students posting on my entry at RMP website.\n9. How would I be able to force RMP to remove my information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You would need a court order to force them to take it down. There is virtually no chance a court will order them to take it down, because it would be almost impossible to do so without violating the First Amendment. \n\nYou would have to prove that forcing a publisher to stop saying that you teach at the university would advance some compelling governmental interest, and that there isn't a better way to advance that interest. \n\nIt's not clear what you mean by \"cyberstalking,\" but if you're talking about someone sending you harassing messages, then the court would probably conclude that the better option would be to punish the harasser, rather than limit the publisher's speech. \n\nYou could try paying them off or sending a threatening legal demand, but I doubt either would go far. I suspect that the best course would be a persistent campaign to escalate up their chain of command to find a sympathetic person willing to help. Even that, though, I would expect to be tough, because I'm sure you wouldn't be the first person trying this.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A professor at a state university is concerned about their personal safety due to cyberstalking and wants their information removed from RateMyProfessors.com (RMP). Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the professor's ability to force RMP to remove their information?\n\nA) The professor can easily force RMP to remove their information by citing cyberstalking concerns.\nB) The university has the authority to demand RMP remove the professor's information.\nC) The professor would need a court order to force RMP to remove the information, but it's unlikely to be granted due to First Amendment protections.\nD) RMP is legally obligated to remove any professor's information upon request for safety reasons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, forcing RMP to remove the professor's information would require a court order. However, it's highly unlikely that a court would grant such an order because it would likely violate the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The court would need to be convinced that removing the information serves a compelling governmental interest and that there isn't a less restrictive way to achieve that interest. In cases of cyberstalking, courts typically prefer to address the harasser's behavior rather than limit a publisher's speech. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they overstate the ease of removing information or misrepresent the legal obligations of RMP and the university's authority in this situation."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is the District of Columbia a state? Does it operate like a state? Does the District of Columbia have a govenor? Is it special in the way it operates?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The District is not a state, and does not function as one.\n\nThe District does not elect any Senators, nor any Representatives. It does elect one \"Delegate\" who sits in the House, and may speak in debate, but does not have the right to vote.\n\nThe Constitution allows congress to exercise \"Exclusive legislation 8in all cases whatsoever\" over the District. However, since 1973 the Congress has allowed limited \"home rule\" in the district, although it could cancel this at any time by a new law.\n\nThe district has a local government, but it more closely resembles the government of a major city than that of a state. It is led by a Mayor and a city council.\n\nIt is specified in some Federal laws, and one Constutiuonal provision that for certain limited purposes the Districtm should be treated \"as if it were\", a state.\n\nThere have been a number of proposals to make the District into a state. The most recent ones have proposed to do this by redefining the \"Capital District\" into the White House, the Capital building, the Mall between them, buildings adjacent to the mall, and a small adjacent area. The rest of the district would, under such proposals, be admitted as a new state. Congress has the power to admit new states, so this would not require a Constitutional Amendment. But no such proposal has yet passed Congress.\n\nThere are some special provisions in the way the District is Governed. For one thing, to compensate for the many public building and facilities (which pay no taxes) and the special demands on the District of the Federal Government, Congress provides some of the funds needed to run the district, with the rest coming from local taxes. Congress must approve the District Budget, and can veto local laws.\n\nSee [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.#Government_and_politics) for more detail.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the unique governmental structure of the District of Columbia?\n\nA) The District of Columbia is led by a governor and has full voting representation in both the House and Senate.\n\nB) The District of Columbia has a mayor and city council, with limited home rule granted by Congress since 1973, but Congress retains the power to revoke this autonomy.\n\nC) The District of Columbia functions exactly like any other state, with the only difference being its smaller geographical size.\n\nD) The District of Columbia has complete autonomy in its governance and budget, with no oversight from the federal government.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The District of Columbia has a unique governmental structure that differs from both states and typical cities. It is led by a mayor and city council, not a governor. Congress granted limited home rule to D.C. in 1973, allowing for some local governance, but Congress retains ultimate authority and can revoke this autonomy at any time. \n\nOption A is incorrect because D.C. does not have a governor and lacks full voting representation in Congress. It only has a non-voting delegate in the House.\n\nOption C is false because D.C. does not function like a state. It lacks voting representation in Congress and is subject to congressional oversight in ways that states are not.\n\nOption D is incorrect because D.C. does not have complete autonomy. Congress must approve the District's budget and can veto local laws, demonstrating significant federal oversight."
