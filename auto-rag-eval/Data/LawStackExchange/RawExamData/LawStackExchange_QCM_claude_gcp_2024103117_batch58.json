A neighbor kid, who lives about 3/4 of a mile from me, and I are training a team of oxen. We walk them on their leads along the road a couple of time a week. There are no houses between my house and the neighbor's. Since only one or two vehicles go by during our walk, often none, we can hear any vehicles from about half a mile away. When we hear a vehicle approaching, we get the team as close to the side of the road as possible, and hold them still. There is no shoulder, one side of the road goes up a hill and the other side down a steep bank to a creek, about 50 feet below road level. Most of the drivers slow down, smile and wave, but there is one driver who, when he sees us, guns his motor, races straight toward us, and swerves at the last minute, passing within two feet of us at 45\\-50 mph. He drives a big, double cab diesel pick\\-up. We can hear him coming, and can tell that he changes how he drives as soon as he sees us, speeding up and heading straight for us. The speed limit is not posted, but is technically 50 mph, although no part of the road is appropriate for that speed. Most drivers go about 30\\-35 mph. I don't know the driver, since he's never stopped to talk.\nMy question is what can be done about this rude, dangerous, intimidating driving, short of not using the road for walking. It is zoned agricultural. This is in the United States, in Oregon. Is what he's doing perfectly legal, or would this be considered reckless endangerment?

This will give you documentation to prevent a \"he said, she said\" situation with the driver and the district attorney and sheriff's department.\n\nThis is really a combination legal and law enforcement situation: you need to bring your own evidence to the attorney, as the sheriff's department isn't going to be able to patrol in hopes of seeing one of these incidents themselves.\n\nGet a smart phone or small video camera and tape one or more of these incidents. Start a log of the dates and times this has happened, from now on and in the past. Write down the license number. Write down a physical description of the driver. Don't threaten or retaliate against the driver in any way, even if they confront you about taping.

Since you are in a rural area, chances are good the attorney and sheriff's department already know the individual.\n\nIf the neighbor \"kid\" is a minor, talk to their parents about what is happening, and do the videotaping and documentation yourself.\n\nIf the district attorney doesn't want to do anything, talk to the [Oregon District Attorneys Association (ODAA)](http://odaa.oregon.gov/) about the situation and that you feel the attorney should be prosecuting the driver.

This approach is recommended in the answer for several reasons:\n\n1. It provides concrete evidence to support any future legal action or complaint.\n2. It helps avoid a \"he said, she said\" situation when reporting to authorities.\n3. It's a non-confrontational method that doesn't escalate the situation.\n4.

Many jurisdictions have thresholds (like the EU's \u20ac30,000 for VAT) before registration is required.

Excluding the question of geographic location, the hereditary nature of citizenship seems to be in glaring contrast to other U.S. founding ideals. In Ancient Rome, for instance, being a citizen was more akin to being a nobleman. Similar to our current system, Romans could earn citizenship through service \\- usually militarily. Given that citizenship carries so much weight and is clearly hereditary in the U.S., why is it not considered as a title of nobility? While it does not indicate a British rank, it certainly indicates social rank. If all men are created equal, then why should this distinction exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The granting of citizenship is expressly recognized in multiple places in the US Constitution. It would be incoherent if the prohibition on titles of nobility meant that the US could not confer citizenship on people. It would also be totally out of sync with any public understanding of \"titles of nobility\" at the time of the framing or today.\n\nThe US has conferred citizenship by parentage to children born abroad since 1790, which is further indication that the nobility clause was not understood to preclude citizenship by parentage.\n\nThe concern behind the nobility clauses was the creation of \"super\\-citizens.\" As [Joseph Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Story) wrote in his [*Commentaries on the Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States) at [Vol. 3, p. 215](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the/Am152G8mqiUC?hl=fr&gbpv=1&pg=PA215&printsec=frontcover):\n\n> \\[the nobility clause] seems scarcely to require even a passing notice. As a perfect equality is the basis of all our institutions, state and national, the prohibition against the creation of any titles of nobility seems proper, if not indespensible, to keep perpetually alive a just sense of this important truth. *Distinctions between citizens*, in regard to rank, would soon lay the foundation of odious claims and privileges, and silently subvert the spirit of independence and personal dignity, which are so often proclaimed to be the best security of a republican government.\n\nHe cited [Federalist No. 84](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493491), in which Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n> Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner\\-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.\n\nThe worry was that titles of nobility would undermine the republican system of government.\n\nI also question your premise that citizenship is \"clearly hereditary in the U.S.\" As you say, the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those merely born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction.

The key distinction between citizenship and titles of nobility lies in their effects on the republican system of government.

The sitter maintains position that the agreement was for $315\\.00 for 9 days of service and that it was not her fault she couldn't do her job for the remaining 7 days, so she kept the full payment.\n\nIs it legal for the pet sitter to keep the full payment, even though the contract was breached?\n\nWas the sitter right for keeping full payment with only providing a fraction of the services agreed upon?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is almost certainly legal for the sitter to keep the money. She was ready to provide the service, and it is not her fault she couldn't (and she may have turned down other opportunities because she had this one). I think your fiance's claim would be against the firm providing the security service (they are the ones that frustrated the contract). I foresee the following problems:\n\n* What are her losses? She was prepared to pay $315 (which she has paid), and the dog has been looked after. Where is the loss? (She may be able to argue that it was worth $315 to her, not to have to owe her mother a favour. I don't know if that will fly.)\n* The contract with the security firm almost certainly waives liability for this sort of thing. She would have to convince the court that the contract terms were unreasonable/unconscionable (or whatever the term is in the local jurisdiction).\n\nThere are two obvious options here: a) see if there is legal cover on her household insurance (or her pet insurance); b) forget it (it's only $175 all told).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of the pet sitter who was unable to complete the agreed-upon service due to being denied entry by security, which of the following statements is most accurate from a legal perspective?\n\nA) The pet sitter is legally obligated to refund the entire amount as the full service was not provided.\n\nB) The pet sitter should only keep payment for the days she actually provided service, as keeping the full amount would be considered theft.\n\nC) The pet sitter is likely legally entitled to keep the full payment, as she was ready to provide the service and the failure to complete it was not her fault.\n\nD) The pet owner has a strong legal case against the pet sitter for breach of contract and can easily recover the full amount in small claims court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the legal analysis provided, the pet sitter is likely legally entitled to keep the full payment. This is because she was ready and willing to provide the agreed-upon service, and the failure to complete it was due to circumstances beyond her control (being denied entry by security). In contract law, this situation could be seen as a \"frustrated contract\" where the sitter's performance was made impossible by external factors. Additionally, the sitter may have turned down other opportunities to take this job, further justifying retention of the full payment. The pet owner's recourse, if any, would more likely be against the security firm rather than the pet sitter. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't account for the legal principle that the sitter was prepared to fulfill her obligations and was prevented from doing so through no fault of her own. Option D is incorrect because the pet owner likely does not have a strong case against the sitter, given the circumstances of the situation."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15177/can-clinton-be-pardoned-without-being-charged-or-convicted", "docs_id": 15177, "title": "Can Clinton be pardoned without being charged or convicted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible for someone to be pardoned if they haven't been convicted or even charged with a crime?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The canonical example is Gerald Ford's [pardon of Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding presidential pardons in the United States?\n\nA) Presidential pardons can only be granted after a conviction has been secured in a court of law.\nB) A president can issue a pardon for potential federal crimes even before formal charges are filed.\nC) Pardons are limited to individuals who have already served part of their sentence.\nD) State-level crimes can be pardoned by the President of the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B.

At least not fully and not via a corporate structure.\n\nIt is fundamental that entities cannot change their liability to third parties without the consent of the third parties (subject to specific statutory exceptions like the priority afforded secured creditors vis\\-a\\-vis unsecured creditors, and the limited liability concept itself).\n\nSo, if a \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is negligent, nothing in your corporate structure can relieve that worker from liability. This is true without regard to whether the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is an employee or an independent contractor, although, in practice, it is less common to sue an employee than to sue an independent contractor. You can pay for construction defect liability insurance and comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance for them, but they can still be sued and will still have primarily liability.\n\nIn general, absent a direct contractual arrangement to the contrary, a \"mason\" will not have negligence liability for work done by a \"carpenter\" and vis\\-a\\-versa. \n\nOf course, it is often impossible to prevent both from being made parties to a lawsuit for defective work, because the question of whose work caused the problem is often a factual one that isn't clear until an exhaustive investigation by experts has been done. Often both will be sued at the outset and some who are determined to be not at fault or only minimally at fault will be dismissed voluntarily, or with token settlements, as investigations during the course of the litigation reveal who was really at fault.\n\nNow, if you have a contractual relationship with a third party, say the person who is hiring the general contractor, the contract between the person hiring the general contractor and the general contractor can contractually waive the liability of the general contractor and/or the liability of the subcontractor, for ordinary negligence (but not for intentional conduct of a subcontractor since such waivers are contrary to public policy), and can relieve the subcontractors of contractual liability to the person hiring the general contractor.\n\nThis is all a consequence of the contract between the general contractor and the person hiring the general contractor, however, and really has nothing to do with the corporate structure of the general contractor vis\\-a\\-vis the subcontractor.\n\nYou cannot limit the liability of the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" for harm to persons with whom there is no contractual relationship. For example, suppose that the mason negligently nicks a natural gas line causing an explosion that kills a dozen people who just work in the building and destroys the building. The individual mason and the individual mason's firm, will have liability to the people killed which could not have been limited contractually, although it could be insured against. This is true even if the mason's firm is incorporated, although, if the mason's firm is incorporated, only the person who actually did the work and the firm will have liability, not the co\\-workers of the person who did the work or passive investors in the firm.\n\nHowever, if the mason intentionally engaged in sabotage directed at the natural gas line, with an intent to harm the person who hired the general contractor or anyone else, any contractual waiver of liability in favor of the mason would be void and the mason's insurance policy would not cover the loss (and would not be allowed to cover the loss as a matter of public policy). On the other hand, if the victims of the sabotage had insurance to cover this kind of event, their insurance policies could cover their losses.\n\nIn the other direction, a pre\\-dispute waiver of a subcontractor's right to file a mechanic's lien against the person hiring the general contractor, is usually not permitted for any reason other than payments of the amounts owed to the subcontractor, as a matter of public policy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A general contractor wants to create a corporate structure that limits liability for their specialized trades (masonry, carpentry, etc.) while providing them with insurance and benefits.

The proposed corporate structure cannot fully protect workers from liability, especially to third parties not in a contractual relationship with the company. However, the general contractor can provide insurance coverage (such as construction defect and general liability insurance) for the workers. Additionally, the general contractor can negotiate contracts with clients that limit some liabilities for ordinary negligence, although this is based on the contract itself rather than the corporate structure. It's important to note that workers can still be sued for their own negligence, and certain liabilities (like intentional misconduct) cannot be waived or limited.

There is another jurisdictional statute [28 USC 131](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/131), the problematic one, which states:\n\n> Wyoming and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in\n>  Montana and Idaho constitute one judicial district.\n> \n> \n> Court shall be held at Casper, Cheyenne, Evanston, Lander, Jackson,\n>  and Sheridan.\n\nTherefore, the crime must be tried in Wyoming. Moreover, the judicial district of Wyoming also includes that unoccupied portion of the park in Idaho. This statute conflicts with Article III, Section 2, which requires court to be held in Idaho. Since The Constitution has precedence over federal statutes, the instruction to hold court in Wyoming is unconstitutional. \n\nThe 6th Amendment does not pose a particular problem, with its requirement that\n\n> the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an\n>  impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have\n>  been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained\n>  by law\n\nsince the jury could be of Idahoans, and transported to Wyoming \u2013 the 6th addresses the nature of the jury, not the location of the trial.\n\nIt is an open question what the 6th Amendment refers to in talking of \"state and district\", since district is not defined at a constitutional level. The only district with constitutional stature is the District of Columbia, which is not a state, and therefore there could be no \"state and district\" if we mean \"district, as specifically mentioned in The Constitution\". The [Judiciciary Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789) first created federal judiciary districts, signed by Washington on September 24, 1789, and the 6th Amendment was passed by Congress the next day. It is reasonable to assume that this is what they meant by \"district\".\n\n28 USC 131 does say that all of Wyoming plus a sliver of Idaho are a judicial district, so one could have a jury composed of citizens of Wyoming which satisfies the \"jury of the district\" requirement, but that would not satisfy the \"jury of the state\" requirement. If anyone lived in that area, those people could constitute a \"jury of the state and district\", but you would still have a clash between the statutory and constitutional requirements for venue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the hypothetical scenario of a crime committed in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal proceedings?\n\nA) The trial must be held in Wyoming, with a jury composed of Wyoming residents, as per 28 USC 131.\n\nB) The trial must be held in Idaho with an Idaho jury, as mandated by Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution.\n\nC) The crime cannot be prosecuted due to the conflicting requirements of federal statutes and the Constitution.\n\nD) The trial can be held in Wyoming with a jury of Idaho residents from the relevant district, satisfying both statutory and constitutional requirements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex interplay between federal statutes and constitutional requirements. Option A is incorrect because it contradicts the Constitution's requirement that the trial be held in the state where the crime was committed. Option C is overly pessimistic; while there are conflicts, they don't necessarily prevent prosecution. Option D attempts a compromise but still violates the Constitution's venue requirement.\n\nOption B is correct because Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which supersedes federal statutes, requires that the trial be held in the state where the crime was committed (Idaho in this case). Additionally, the 6th Amendment requires a jury from the state and district where the crime occurred.

Art. 1 Sect 7 says that Bills originate in the House or Senate (and revenue specifically in the House); and there is a procedure for presidential signing / veto / veto\\-override, in order to become law.

It could be for example a simple yes/no majority vote of those voters eligible to vote for president.

It outlines a specific process for creating federal laws involving both houses of Congress and the President, with no provision for direct popular votes on legislation. Implementing a system of national referendums for federal laws would likely require a significant constitutional amendment to grant such powers to the general public. While Congress could theoretically pass a law with a provision for a public vote, such a provision might be ruled unconstitutional if it were seen as conflicting with the Constitution's allocation of legislative power to Congress.

The cost of litigation and public relations risk associated with suing an ex\\-employee are major reasons not to sue for these losses.

While the contract includes a non-abandonment clause, it doesn't automatically mean the employee must pay $15,000. In general, contractual damages are calculated based on actual losses incurred. The company would need to prove that the sudden departure caused real damages, which could be less than or potentially more than the stated amount. The clause serves more as a deterrent and a basis for potential legal action rather than an automatic penalty.\n\nOption A is incorrect because job abandonment is not typically a criminal offense in civilian contexts.

The first question is what (or who) is actually being sanctioned, second who is impacted by the sanction, third what is the specific sanction?

I go into further discussion below, but for the **quicker answer to your specific question**, unless the person you are buying from is directly sanctioned or the subject of sanctions, or the entities specifically involved in the sale of goods (export company, vessel, etc) are directly sanctioned (or Russian companies operated in Crimea), yes it would be legal to purchase.

For example see below, many current sanctions are against government officials; Or in the case of EO 13685 from 2014 concerning the occupation of Crimea many of the sanctions imposed aren't strictly against *Russia*, but instead prohibits U.S. business, trade, or investment *in occupied Crimea*.\n\nEO 13685 excerpt:\n\n> Section 1\\.

Typically, a lease transitions to month\\-to\\-month and in your lease it probably already said that you needed to provide 30 days notice even if you were leaving at the end of the lease's original term.\n\nThird, yes, you are on the hook for rent until you give 30 days notice. Your \"verbal agreement\" is a contract and your landlord agreed to allow you to stay in the apartment as long as you gave him 30 days notice before moving out and paid your rent every month.\n\nMost of this is probably already spelled out in your current lease.

He verbally agreed with his landlord to transition to a month-to-month arrangement with 30 days' notice required before moving out. John then finds a new apartment and wants to move immediately. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal obligations?\n\nA) John can move out immediately without any further rent payment because he hasn't signed a new written agreement.\n\nB) John must pay for an additional full month of rent, regardless of when he gives notice.\n\nC) John is legally obligated to provide 30 days' notice and pay rent for those 30 days, even if he moves out earlier.\n\nD) John can move out immediately but must pay a penalty fee equal to half a month's rent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Even though John's agreement was verbal, it still constitutes a legally binding contract. By agreeing to the month-to-month arrangement with 30 days' notice required, John is obligated to provide that notice and pay rent for the notice period. This holds true even if he moves out earlier, as the landlord agreed to keep the property available for John during this time. Verbal agreements can be enforceable, especially when they pertain to extending or modifying existing written contracts like leases. Options A and D are incorrect because they assume no legal obligation from the verbal agreement. Option B is incorrect because it assumes a full month's rent is always due, which may not be the case if proper notice is given mid-month."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33901/youtube-copyright", "docs_id": 33901, "title": "YouTube Copyright", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What could happen if I copy some content from an article on a website and narrate it on my YouTube channel with some modifications?

Is Expedia required to at least honor the cancellation rules of the airline\n\n**Background:** \n\nWe booked Air France tickets on Expedia and Expedia cancelled since Air France cancelled the flights. Expedia offers airline credit but it's extremely restricted. Basically you can only use it for a single ticket on one booking for the same person on the same airline departing from the same country and costing the same price. Ideally we want cash back or at least Air France's conditions which offer a voucher that becomes refundable after one year. Expedia has removed the original fare rules from their website but they didn't include any specific verbiage about cancellation by the airline.We like to charge back through the credit card company but would like to understand the legal situation first. \n\n**Links to the regulations**\n\n[https://eur\\-lex.europa.eu/legal\\-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri\\=CELEX:32004R0261\\&from\\=en](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004R0261&from=en)\n[https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation\\-consumer\\-protection/refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds)\n\n**UPDATE ON EXPEDIA VS AIRLINE**\nIn this case I think we need to deal with Expedia since they took our money (not Air France). If we were to execute a charge back, we'd have to do it against Expedia.

They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.\n\nSo, no matter what, you can\u2019t get your money from them.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nWe have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and *why* Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... \n\nAs an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree\n\nThe first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund \\- that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, \u201cwe can fly you tomorrow\u201d \\- they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don\u2019t want to fly tomorrow.

That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?\n\nIf the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under?

EU regulations have an exemption for \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which may apply in this case.\n2. Expedia likely acted as an aggregation service, not an intermediary, so they're not directly responsible for refunds.\n3. The specific terms of the contract between the customer and Air France are crucial in determining obligations.\n4. The governing law of the contract (e.g., French civil law vs. Common law) impacts how force majeure is interpreted and applied.\n5.

Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_v._Garner), common law allowed police to use deadly force to effect the arrest of a person suspected of a felony. Even though SCOTUS there held that such a practice violates Fourth Amendment civil rights, I was surprised to find that [in some states it is *still* lawful for police to use deadly force to effect an arrest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190206192128/http://www.slu.edu/colleges/law/journal/police-use-of-deadly-force-state-statues-30-years-after-garner/)!\n\nLet us examine the most extreme case, which is that the police can legally shoot at you to effect your arrest. As explained [here, you are always allowed to resist \"excessive force.\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/2211/10) If you make it to court, these qualifications (e.g., \"necessary\" and \"excessive\") are ultimately decided based on what a \"reasonable person\" would have believed in the situation. So if a cop shoots at you, and you \"dodge\" the bullet, it is *possible* for you both to be found not guilty of any crime. I.e., the cop can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because he believed you were a violent felon and shooting you was the only way to stop you. And you can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because you believed you were being subject to excessive force.\n\nWhile this is an interesting hypothetical, in practice of course by the time a cop is shooting at you you are almost certainly going to be *charged* with resisting arrest.

According to the information provided, a suspect may legally resist what they perceive as excessive force, which could include dodging gunfire. However, this doesn't guarantee they won't face charges. The key points are:\n\n1. The use of deadly force by police to effect an arrest is still legal in some states, despite the Supreme Court ruling in Tennessee v. Garner.\n\n2.

Fair\\-use defenses look at four questions, and the answers to the questions can tip the scales in favor of or against a finding of fair use:\n\n1. **Does your kind of copying affect the market for the original?** To what extent can your copy fulfill the demand for the original? What if there were widespread copying of the kind you're considering? The more potential there is for the copies to replace the original, the less likely it is to be fair use. *(This is the most important factor in the analysis.)*\n2. **Why did you make the copy?** If you made the copy for purposes of news reporting, criticism, or commentary, it's more likely to be fair use. If you made a copy just so you could emjoy the work again whenever you felt like it, that may still be fair use, but it is somewhat less likely. If you made a copy just so you could sell it for profit, that's almost certainly not fair use.\n3. **How much did you copy?** Did you copy the whole thing, or did you copy only as much as you needed to achieve your purpose under Question 2? If you copy \"too much\" \u2013 either in the raw amount or as a fraction of the whole work \u2013 it's less likely to be fair use.\n4. **What did you copy?** Highly creative works, such as poems, music, and movies, are at the \"core\" of copyright principles. A fair use analysis will be more stringent in these cases than when dealing with a copy of a purely factual work, such as a phone book, biography, or list of statistics. Such works are still protected by copyright, but that protection is not as strong.\n\nSo take all of those and imagine the answer to each on a spectrum. If you see things generally tipping in the direction of fair use, that's a good indication that you're going to be safe. If you see things tipping in the other direction, you may want to reconsider.\n\nThese questions can be trickier than you might think. If you're dealing with a real situation, you should consult an attorney to get an answer specific to your situation.\n\nBut what if I don't make any money?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis fact tips the scales in your favor, but only on Question 2; you still need to consider the other factors. Whether you make money is less important than whether your copying deprives the copyright owner of the opportunity to make money, but then you have to balance that consideration against the First Amendment principles embedded in fair\\-use analysis.\n\nSo if you're ripping *Star Wars* DVDs to hand them out as Christmas presents, your lack of a profit motive will not save you.

This practice could be seen as a way to artificially lower the taxable amount of the sale, which is illegal and can have severe consequences. Sales tax evasion is a form of tax fraud that can result in criminal charges and significant penalties.\n\nOption A, while important, is typically a civil matter between the vendor and the platform.

The fact that the security guard was convicted of a misdemeanor does not necessarily indicate that the deputy was allowed to have the gun in the IRS office, only that the security guard's response to the situation was not acceptable.\n\nI am not able to locate any firearm policy for the Lucas County, Ohio' sheriff's office. Many US law enforcement agencies have a policy that their officers carry their firearms essentially at all times, so that they can respond to unexpected incidents even when they are off duty.\n\nAt the same time, owners of private property ordinarily can admit people, or not, for any reason at all. Unless the officer has an official reason for entering a property when the owner doesn't want the officer there, the officer isn't allowed to enter.

This means that even qualified officers cannot carry firearms into federal buildings or onto federal property when off-duty. The officer in this scenario is not permitted to bring their weapon into the IRS building.\n\nHowever, the case referenced in the passage suggests that forcibly stopping or disarming the officer (as in option B) could lead to legal consequences for security personnel. The security guard in that case was convicted of simple assault for their actions.\n\nThe correct approach would be to inform the officer of the policy and ask them to leave if they refuse to disarm. This aligns with option C, which respects both the federal building's regulations and the officer's right to leave the premises with their weapon rather than surrendering it.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because neither the officer's status nor their department policy overrides federal regulations for federal buildings."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79500/what-are-the-limits-of-website-scraping-under-the-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act", "docs_id": 79500, "title": "What are the limits of website scraping under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read several news in the EFF's website about court appeals and fights related to web scraping.\n\nI am a programmer and have always been worried about what are the limits of scraping.\n\nNormally, I think any public site can be scraped, as 'viewing' a website is not different from that.\n\nThat seems to be the [EFF interpretation too](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/scraping-public-websites-still-isnt-crime-court-appeals-declares).

The principle of \"quiet enjoyment\" generally allows tenants to use their rented property as they see fit, within the bounds of the lease and applicable laws. Since the lease doesn't mention animals, and there's no indication of relevant local laws prohibiting dogs, the tenant likely has the right to have friends with dogs visit. The manager's sudden prohibition, without basis in the lease or apparent legal grounds, appears to infringe on the tenant's rights. Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the manager's and landlord's authority in this situation.

The second cheapest alternative is filing a claim in small claims court (assuming your jurisdiction doesn't have a special landlord\\-tenant dispute adjudication board).

He will, of course, say why he thinks he is entitled to keep the deposit. This is where it could be useful for you to actually know the landlord\\-tenant law of your jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, it is pretty much guaranteed that deduction for \"furniture usage\" which you didn't agree to is illegal. It is reasonably likely that a stain on the carpet could be deductible. You are probably entitled to a written statement of alleged damages, and you would need to dispute his claims (in writing, delivered by certified mail). In that dispute letter you should provide all of the evidence you have to support your claim (for example, photos).

Are there changes to be made?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two relevant EU laws: GDPR and ePrivacy.\n\nUsing Google Analytics does not require consent as far as the GDPR is concerned. The processing can instead be based on legitimate interest, but you do have to offer opt\\-out and must use suitable security measures, for example by signing the data processing agreement with Google. Alternatively, an argument is possible that the collected data doesn't qualify as personal data \u2013 but I don't think that argument is correct.\n\nThe ePrivacy directive is more tricky. It is not directly enforceable law. Instead, directives are implemented through member state law. As a result, there can be subtle differences between member states. What one data protection authority allows is not necessarily relevant in another country.\n\nePrivacy requires you to collect consent when you access information on the user's device, for example when you read or write cookies or use similar technologies, regardless of whether the information is personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The only exception is when the access is strictly necessary for your application \u2013 but that doesn't cover analytics. This ePrivacy requirement is the source of all the cookie consent banners you see on the web.\n\nGoogle Analytics stores a Client ID on the user's device, which is used to combine separate events into a session or user profile. Optionally, this Client ID can be linked with a User ID, which lets you track a signed\\-in user across devices.\n\nBut storing/acessing this Client ID requires consent under ePrivacy.\n\nIf you want to avoid asking for consent, you must disable storage of the Client ID. On the web, this can be reached by setting `'storage': 'none'` for analytics.js or `'client_storage': 'none'` for gtag.js. I use this approach on my personal website, with the result that \u201cpageviews\u201d and \u201csessions\u201d are now synonymous. I am not sure what the equivalent would be on mobile, but the same concerns apply.\n\nI assume (but do not know for sure) that the consent requirement only applies to persistently stored data. Keeping a transient User ID in memory is likely fine. That would let you correlate events into a session while the app remains open, without having to ask for consent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer is considering implementing Google Analytics in their EU-based application.

Here's why:\n\nA) is incorrect because while GDPR might allow Google Analytics under legitimate interest, the ePrivacy directive requires consent for storing information (like Client ID) on the user's device.\n\nB) is correct because it avoids storing the Client ID, which would require consent under ePrivacy.

According to the information provided, it is not always necessary to obtain licenses for depicting real-world objects in video games.

The right of publicity is \"the property right in an individual's persona to use the individual's persona for a commercial purpose\", and you have that right. Per ORC 2741\\.02, \"except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not use any aspect of an individual's persona for a commercial purpose...\", as long as you are not dead and have not given written consent for the use, a question that you should research carefully), also it must not be \"in connection with any news, public affairs, sports broadcast, or account\", not political campaign, and also as long as you are \"an individual whose domicile or residence is in this state\" (with various exceptions to the exceptions).\n\nIf they have violate your right of publicity, you can sue them, but there is a requirement to notify the trespasser (your attorney will deal with this, I mention this just in case you decide to try a DIY lawsuit). If you win, you might get actual damages (i.e. how much did you actually lose), which includes \"any profits derived from and attributable to the unauthorized use of an individual's persona for a commercial purpose\", or at your discretion between $2,500 and $10,000\\. There is also the option of punitive damages which adds as much as twice the compensatory damages award, if their act was \"really bad\" (a very complex calculation, but basically \"not an innocent mistake\").\n\nThen there are [other exceptions](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2741.09v1) where the law does not apply, much of which doesn't have clear relevance but the provision \"The use of the persona of an individual solely in the individual's role as a member of the public if the individual is not named or otherwise singled out as an individual\" is likely to be a problem for a lawsuit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An amusement park employee, Sarah, discovers her image is being used without her explicit consent in the park's hiring advertisements.

Sarah's case might be weakened if she's not specifically named or singled out in the advertisements, as this falls under an exception in the Ohio statute.\n3.

An assault is a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on a person which puts the person in immediate danger of or in apprehension of such harm or contact. Groping is an example of offensive contact that does not involve bodily harm. Assault is against the law in two ways. First, it is a tort, meaning that the victim can sue the assailant for the damage that was caused. Second, it is generally a crime, meaning that the assailant might be punished, if convicted. The Canadian law regarding the crime of assault is [\u00a7265 of the Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-265.html). The law says plainly that\n\n> A person commits an assault when (a) without the consent of another\n>  person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly\n>  or indirectly\n\nWhether or not the government will pursue the matter is difficult to say. The standard procedure is that the victim reports the event to the police, who will decide whether to investigate, and it could end up in court being prosecuted by the Crown.\n\nThe other path is a lawsuit, where the person harmed files a lawsuit and has his day in court. The victim files a complaint alleging that certain events took place (it has to match toe legal definition of assault), and that you were harmed in a way that can be redressed with an award of money. You would, of course, hire a lawyer to pursue this, because you can't just say to the court \"Make him pay, he punched me\". You might be awarded something for emotional distress. You might want to talk to a lawyer about the prospects for getting an award large enough to cover your legal bill.\n\nNeedless to say, punching as payback is *also* assault, which as I mentioned is a crime. It's quite possible that the police will decide not to pursue the first assault but would take a dimmer view of revenge assault and prosecute you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a student repeatedly touches another student against their will during a school field trip, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications and appropriate actions?\n\nA) The touched student should immediately retaliate physically, as it's legal to punch someone who has assaulted you first.\n\nB) The incident doesn't qualify as assault because the touches were described as \"light punches\" and didn't cause visible harm.\n\nC) The touched student should report the incident to the police, who will definitely prosecute the case as criminal assault.\n\nD) The incident could potentially be considered assault under the law, and the appropriate action would be to report it to school authorities and possibly the police.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate response. The repeated unwanted touching, even if light, could potentially fall under the legal definition of assault, which includes applying force intentionally without consent. The appropriate action is to report the incident to school authorities, and if necessary, to the police. They will then decide whether to investigate or pursue the matter further.\n\nOption A is incorrect and illegal, as retaliating with violence is still considered assault and could lead to legal consequences for the victim.\n\nOption B is incorrect because assault doesn't require visible harm or severe force; unwanted intentional touching can qualify as assault.\n\nOption C is overly definitive. While reporting to the police is an option, there's no guarantee they will prosecute every reported case of assault, especially in a school setting where other disciplinary measures might be considered first."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42499/what-kind-of-trust-should-i-choose-when-applying-for-ein-roll-over-assets-fro", "docs_id": 42499, "title": "What kind of &quot;Trust&quot; should I choose when applying for EIN?

This is because a revocable trust becomes irrevocable by operation of law upon the death of the last grantor. The successor trustee can rename the trust to reflect its new irrevocable status (e.g., from \"MOM AND DAD REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST\" to \"MOM AND DAD IRREVOCABLE TRUST\") and apply for a new EIN using the online SS-4 form. This approach allows for continuity in managing the trust's assets while properly reflecting its changed legal status. It also addresses the requirements of financial institutions that may need updated information following the grantors' deaths.\n\nOption A is incorrect because creating an entirely new trust is unnecessary and could complicate asset transfers. Option C is incorrect because continuing to use the original EIN doesn't reflect the trust's change in status and may not meet legal requirements.

The Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG) requires deletion of data once it's no longer needed for its original purpose. However, it allows retention of contractually relevant information if there's a reasonable possibility of legal action. The platform should inform users about which data is retained after account deletion and why. This balance respects both privacy concerns and potential legal needs.\n\nOption A is too extreme, as it doesn't account for legitimate reasons to retain some data temporarily. \nOption B violates privacy laws by retaining all data indefinitely without justification. \nOption C, while closer to being correct, is too specific and doesn't fully capture the nuanced approach required by German law.\n\nThe correct approach involves careful consideration of what data is truly necessary to retain, informing users, and eventually deleting the retained data when it's no longer legally necessary."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11253/what-do-the-dissents-argue-in-whole-womans-health-v-hellerstedt", "docs_id": 11253, "title": "What do the dissents argue in Whole Woman&#39;s Health v.

Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 150\\. But \u201ca statute which, while furthering \\[a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\u2019s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 877 (plurality opinion), and \u201c\\[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right,\u201d id., at 878\\.\n\nJustice Ginsburg provided a separate concurring opinion in which she said:\n\n> ... Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory\\-surgical\\-center or hospital admitting\\-privileges requirements...\n> \n> \n> ...abortion \u201cis at least as safe as other medical procedures routinely performed in outpatient settings\u201d. Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law \u201cwould simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill was passed in Texas in 2013, I recall some Texas lawmakers in support of the bill claiming that the law would help prevent some abortions, [for example](https://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/13/texas-abortion-regulations-debate-nears-climax/):\n\n> The regulations in HB 2 will end up saving many babies, he said, \"so that families can adopt them and love them and be able to cherish them.\u201d\n\nIt seems like the bill was struck down by the Supreme Court because the bill did exactly what it was supposed to do. Perhaps if the decision was 8\\-0 one could argue that the Texas lawmakers should have known better and were just wasting taxpayers' time and money, but there were 3 dissenting justices, which to me, legitimizes the attempt to pass the law. Yet, I'm not fully understanding the dissenting opinions.\n\nMy question: are the dissenting opinions claiming that Texas HB2 does not present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or are they claiming that the premise is wrong and it should be OK for a law to present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or something else entirely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Justice Thomas's position is two\\-pronged. First, he argues that the court has taken the wrong approach to protecting abortion all along:\n\n> I remain fundamentally opposed to the Court\u2019s abortion\n>  jurisprudence.\n\nHe then argues that even taking *Casey* as precedent, the court has raised the standard that laws affecting access to abortions are judged by:\n\n> These precepts \\[...] transform the undue\\-burden test to\n>  something much more akin to strict scrutiny.\n\nMy takeaway is that he thinks jumping straight to a balancing test muddles the \"undue\\-burden\" and \"legitimate interest\" portions of the *Casey* test. He would have answered *first* whether these laws posed an undue burden upon women seeking abortions. If the answer there was \"no\", then the law only needs to pass a rational basis test. However, by immediately jumping to a test than balances the burden on women and legitimate interests of the state, he argues that a more heightened scrutiny is applied to these laws than *Casey* stands for.\n\nFurther, he argues that the clinics should not be able to sue to protect a right that they don't even claim belongs to them:\n\n> This suit is possible only because the Court has allowed\n>  abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative constitutional\n>  right that does not belong to them\u2014a woman\u2019s\n>  right to abortion.\n\nJustice Alito's position rests on *[res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata)*.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court decision on Texas HB2, what is the primary issue with the majority's application of the undue-burden test from Casey?\n\nA) The majority applied strict scrutiny instead of the undue-burden test.\nB) The majority failed to consider the state's legitimate interests.\nC) The majority allowed clinics to sue on behalf of women's rights.\nD) The majority combined the undue-burden and legitimate interest analyses, resulting in a higher level of scrutiny than intended by Casey.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Justice Thomas argued that the majority's approach \"transform[s] the undue-burden test to something much more akin to strict scrutiny.\" He believed that by immediately balancing the burden on women against the state's legitimate interests, rather than first determining if an undue burden exists, the Court applied a higher level of scrutiny than what Casey originally intended.

In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co, the court treated the advertisement as a unilateral contract.

Resol. 669 (2001\\)](http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=facpub) in \"Mandatory Binding Arbitration and the Demise of the Seventh Amendment Right to a Jury Trial\" partially addresses this (the focus though is on binding arbitration). One thing to note is that the Seventh Amendment does not appear to apply to issues in state court (it is a separate and fascinating question to wonder what parts of The Constitution are incorporated against states, and why). All is not lost for the constitutional question, we just need a different constitution.\n\nBy the agreement terms, \"This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York\". Therefore, New York's Constitution (Article 1 Sect 2\\) is also applicable:\n\n> Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed\n>  by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever; but *a jury\n>  trial may be waived by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to\n>  be prescribed by law*.\n\nThus, the right may be waived. Waiver of a right to jury trial is not the same as waiver of the right to trial: what the agreement says is that litigants would have a civil bench trial, where the judge determines whether there was a breach.\n\nIn New York, [NY CPLR \u00a7 4102](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2012/cvp/article-41/4102) allows parties to waive civil trial by jury (and unlike [California](https://casetext.com/case/grafton-partners-v-superior-court-2)), such waiver terms have been [upheld](http://www.chadbourne.com/sites/default/files/publications/hall%20judge%20smith%20nylj%20reprint%2012%2009.pdf), but the courts have recognized that there is a problem, so it's not always obvious whether such waivers in contracts are legal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the waiver of the right to a jury trial in civil cases under New York law?\n\nA) The right to a jury trial in civil cases can never be waived, as it is a fundamental constitutional right.\n\nB) A contractual waiver of the right to a jury trial is always enforceable in New York, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nC) The New York Constitution allows for the waiver of jury trials in civil cases, but the courts have recognized potential issues with contractual waivers.\n\nD) The Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution governs the right to a jury trial in New York state courts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/103/), 495 U.S. 103\\). Outside of the realm of child pornography laws, there don't appear to be any cases of tenable laws against \"obscenity\" from the past 25 years. The Miller test ([Miller v.

According to the information provided, child pornography is the primary and most consistently prosecuted category of obscene material in recent years. The passage mentions that outside of child pornography laws, there don't appear to be any cases of tenable laws against \"obscenity\" from the past 25 years. While the Miller test still exists, it's not clear that it's being actively applied to adult content. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest more active enforcement of obscenity laws for adult content, which isn't supported by the given information. Option C is incorrect because while bestiality images might be illegal, they're not specifically mentioned as a focus of current obscenity law, and would likely be prosecuted under animal abuse statutes rather than obscenity laws."}}
