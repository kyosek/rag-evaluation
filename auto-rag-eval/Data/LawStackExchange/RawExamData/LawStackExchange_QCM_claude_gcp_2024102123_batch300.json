            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On April 22nd 2022, the state\\-owned Rossiya 1 TV channel (which is widely seen as a Kremlin mouthpiece) reported that British prime minister Boris Johnson had \"threatened to carry out a nuclear strike against Russia, if needed, without consulting Nato\". The British prime minister's press office has denied he ever said such a thing. As far as I can find from press sources, this was not a (wilful) misinterpretation or mistranslation of anything he said, but simply a made\\-up quote.\n\nThis made me wonder, do the laws of war say anything about misinformation or psychological warfare? Is it e.g. a war crime to claim that the political or military leaders of the country you are at war with have ordered their troops to surrender, in order to mislead those troops? Is it a war crime to lie about the actions and declared intentions of your enemy to motivate your own troops? Is there in fact anything that binds a country at war to factual representation of their own and their enemy's actions, declarations, capabilities and intentions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have four questions.\n\n> This made me wonder, do the laws of war say anything about misinformation or psychological warfare?\n\nYes, a little. Mostly in the form of specific prohibitions.\n\n> Is it e.g. a war crime to claim that the political or military leaders of the country you are at war with have ordered their troops to surrender, in order to mislead those troops?\n\nNo, not as far as I could find.\n\n> Is it a war crime to lie about the actions and declared intentions of your enemy to motivate your own troops?\n\nNo, as far as I could find.\n\n> Is there in fact anything that binds a country at war to factual representation of their own and their enemy's actions, declarations, capabilities and intentions?\n\nYes, but only in a very limited context; indeed, misinformation is explicitly allowed, under the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, Article 37, Section 2, which states that \"ruses of war\" that do not rely upon the protections of the Convention to succeed, including \"he use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and **misinformation**\" are explicitly allowed.\n\nSome prohibited ruses include feigning protected status(non\\-combatant, surrendering, neutral party, United Nations, sick/wounded), feigning neutral status\\*, or feigning being part of the enemy\\*. (Source, ibid, Article 39\\).\n\n\\*Except when conducted as part of naval combat operations(which have their own traditions, and generally allow pretending to be the enemy for purposes of transit, escape, etc. but require to fly one's true colors before taking offensive actions, as well as honoring surrender), and espionage (which is generally treated as a \"crime\" rather than an \"act of war\" under international law, when one is not wearing the uniform of one's own forces).",

According to the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions, Article 37, Section 2, \"ruses of war\" including misinformation are explicitly allowed, as long as they do not rely on the protections granted by the Convention. Options A and C are incorrect because there is no general prohibition on misinformation or requirement for factual representation in wartime. Option B is also incorrect, as the source does not indicate that claiming enemy leaders have ordered surrender is specifically prohibited as a war crime. The key is that misinformation is allowed within certain bounds, particularly avoiding deception involving protected statuses or identities."

The front of the store around the cashier was dimmed.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer enters a liquor store at 8:50 PM. At 8:55 PM, the store staff turns off the main lights, leaving only dimmed lighting near the cashier area. The customer complains about the darkness but is ignored. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the store's legal obligations?\n\nA) The store is in clear violation of federal law, as OSHA regulations require full lighting at all times during business hours.\n\nB) The store may be compliant with federal regulations if the dimmed lighting near the cashier area provides adequate illumination for an exit route.\n\nC) The store is only required to maintain emergency lighting for employees, not customers, and therefore is not in violation of any regulations.\n\nD) State laws universally require liquor stores to maintain full lighting as long as any customers are present in the store.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.37(b)(1), each exit route must be adequately lighted so that an employee with normal vision can see along the exit route. The regulation does not specify full lighting throughout the entire store, only that exit routes are adequately lit. If the dimmed lighting near the cashier area provides sufficient illumination for an exit route, the store may be compliant with federal regulations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because OSHA does not require full lighting at all times, only adequate lighting for exit routes.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because OSHA regulations apply to both employees and \"frequenters\" (customers), not just employees.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while some states may have specific laws regarding lighting in liquor stores, it is not a universal requirement across all states. The given information only mentions a Wisconsin law about general safety for employees and frequenters, not a specific requirement for full lighting in liquor stores."

However:\n\n* I use what they call \"die Umweltskarte\" \\- a monthly ticket\n* I never been asked for any tickets by anyone. I never had an experience of showing my ticket to controllers.\n* There is a street name, the date and the time where the so\\-called \"violation\" happened. On that date, I never traveled anywhere using public transport and I am always at home during the time stated.\n\nSo I am pretty sure that I did not do anything remotely close to what the claim states.\n\nA brief search tells me \"just pay, you will have more trouble opposing them\". Especially since I live alone and nobody can prove that I was in fact at home, that I never travel to that street and that I never used public transport that day or never had issues with controllers.\n\nCan I at least require them to provide evidence I did it? If so, what can I request?\n\nThe message states that the collector agency, \"infoscore Forderungsmanagement GmbH\" was requested by \"S\\-Bahn Berlin GmbH\". They also \"warn\" that I will be fined more should I not pay the fine of around 150 euro.\n\nI have found an \"EBE Nr.\" in the form. BVG (Berlin public transport) has a portal dedicated to fines, including [an English version](https://www.bvg-ebe.de/en/service/). There it is possible to enter the \"EBE Number\" to object.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qX9Y.png)\n\nThe number in the form starts with **506230** \\- so I suspect it is not real. What can I do about checking whether it is a valid fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several plausible possibilities.\n\n1. This is a scam and isn't actually from the public transit authorities, in which case paying them hasn't helped you, and has contributed to this being a problem in the future for others. The payment information may have some subtle differences from the correct information and may actually go to the fraudster. The EBE number discrepancy makes this the most likely scenario in my opinion.\n2. There was a technical error. Maybe someone with a name similar to your was really cited, but due to a typo, your name was entered instead and the street address and corrected name were entered via some sort of autocorrect function. Somebody got lucky and avoided the ticket that should have gone to them. Maybe somebody went into the wrong field in the ticket entry system which could also explain the EBE number error.\n3. Someone has stolen your identity (perhaps a refugee) and is going around with a fake ID using your name and address. This doesn't explain the EBE number discrepancy, however.\n4. I've also heard of cases in some big cities where two people have the same name and birthdate and are constantly getting tickets meant for the other person but don't discover this fact for many years. Maybe someone like that recently moved into your town. This also doesn't explain the EBE number error.\n\nThe bottom line is that even though it would perhaps be cheaper and less time consuming in the short run to just pay the fine, I would not recommend doing that in this case.\n\nIn scenario 1, you really have a moral civic duty to take a little extra effort to identify a fraudster who is preying on lots of people in your community.\n\nIn scenario 2, you again, have something of a moral civic duty to help the transit system get this problem fixed, and who knows, it might be a technical problem that is prone to recur and if you don't address it the first time, people will assume that your \"confession\" of fault by paying the first ticket undermines your credibility if it happens again.\n\nIn scenarios 3 and 4, the problem is likely to recur and so you have an interest beyond this transaction in sorting out the situation.\n\nWhile your bare assertions that this didn't happen might fall on somewhat deaf ears as potentially self\\-serving, when corroborated by the fact that you have a monthly pass, I think that the likelihood that you would be found to be credible and beat the ticket is great in your case. Germany is less corrupt in bureaucratic matters like this than most countries on Earth. If this is a scenario 1 situation, the legitimate transit agency wouldn't even have a record of the existence of a ticket in the system, so you could be reassured that you would be at no risk if you didn't pay it.\n\nGiven the EBE number problem, it is quite possible that even if you did try to pay it and it was simply a human data entry problem or something (or maybe your ex or a high school bully you defied and forgot about is now a transit cop and trying to inflict revenge) that you might not get proper credit for it anyway, so talking to a person at the agency is probably necessary anyway.\n\nSo, my advice would be to talk to a human being in their office, ideally by telephone (without using the ticket to determine the proper telephone number as the number on the ticket would be a scam in scenario 1\\), but in person, if necessary, to get to the bottom of this. If this didn't work, I would write a letter or email with a copy of the ticket enclosed. If this falls on deaf ears, I would even consider making a police report of a suspected fraud, or even enlisting a local newspaper reporter or television news reporter in pursuing this situation because it is odd and would resonate with the general public.\n\nAll of this will be a pain and won't necessary make narrow economic sense, but we don't always have a choice about when duty calls to fix a problem or what problem that will end up being.",

However, given that everything was done within about two weeks, it comes down to whether the landlord's actions were \"reasonable\". He thinks they were, and so I'm afraid only a court could decide otherwise.\n\nIn the meantime, you must continue to pay your rent in full.\n\n**UPDATE:** In response to OP's comment below: according to this [parliamentary briefing paper](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7328):\n\n> Although there is no general obligation on landlords to ensure\n>  properties are \u2018fit for human habitation\u2019..., local\n>  authorities have powers to compel landlords to tackle serious health and\n>  safety hazards.\n\nAgain, since the repairs have been done, it seems unlikely that there is anything the local council could do.\n\nThe briefing paper also points out that:\n\n> The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 sets out implied terms in a tenancy\n>  agreement that require landlords to let properties which are \u2018fit for\n>  human habitation\u2019 at commencement of and throughout a tenancy.\n\n**However:**\n\n> these implied terms only apply to homes under a certain level\n>  of rent, the amount of which has not been uprated from the level set\n>  out in the Rent Act 1957\\.

Therefore, the government can levy the tax on income, but various forms and other revealing info should not be allowed.\n\nIs this true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since you asked, and it's a perfectly legitimate question, here's *why* it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment (from *Garner v. US*):\n\nThe Fifth Amendment doesn't say \"you can't be made to say anything that hurts you.\" It says \"no person...shall be compelled in any *criminal case* to be a witness against himself.\" The *only* time Fifth Amendment protection applies is if you are being forced by the government to make a statement that could open you up to an accusation or conviction of a criminal offense. It's fairly broad (if it would help prove any aspect of the charge, you can claim immunity), but it's also restricted (you can't claim it unless it really *would* tend to incriminate you).\n\nThat means that you could only argue the Fifth Amendment if your tax return might help prove a criminal case against you (the fact that disclosing income leads to you needing to pay tax does not qualify as \"self\\-incrimination\"). But the *amount* of income is not one of those things that might incriminate you \\-\\- you can get income through all sorts of ways. The thing that is incriminating is revealing the *source* of the income, and you can claim Fifth Amendment privilege for that.\n\nSo:\n\n* The only time you could possibly claim privilege is if you were being forced into a statement that might tend to incriminate you in a criminal proceeding. A statement that makes you liable for tax doesn't mean it might incriminate you.\n* Filing an income tax return isn't inherently incriminating. The fact that you have income not included in any other part of the return (illegal income goes under \"other income\") doesn't imply you've committed a crime \\-\\- lots of people have other income.\n* The *amount* of income can't be incriminating. The *source* can be, but you can claim Fifth Amendment privilege for that if it might incriminate you. And lawful income under \"other income\" still might give rise to a reasonable fear of prosecution, so the fact that you're justified in claiming Fifth Amendment privilege in source of income doesn't mean you're guilty of a crime.\n\nNote that there are cases where you *are* flat\\-out exempt from filing tax returns under the Fifth Amendment: *Marchetti v. US* and *Grosso v. US* found that registration and tax on gambling *could* be blocked by a Fifth Amendment claim, which didn't even have to be asserted at time of filing, because merely filing the special return would establish you as a gambler (heavily regulated/often criminalized at the state level). The difference with the normal income tax form is that *everyone* (just about) files one, and so filing it doesn't mean you're a criminal. If there was a separate line along the lines of \"Income from Illegal Drug Sales,\" that might be one thing (anything other than $0 is inherently incriminating). But all the questions are broad, and have many legal sources of income associated with them.",

It only applies to information that could lead to criminal charges, not civil liabilities like taxes owed.\n\nOption B is false. Claiming Fifth Amendment privilege does not imply guilt, as stated in the passage: \"the fact that you're justified in claiming Fifth Amendment privilege in source of income doesn't mean you're guilty of a crime.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect.

An SRO is to advance the program objective which include \"Education of children regarding the role of laws, courts, and Police in society\", which is the hook into \"legitimate educational interest\". This nothwitstanding the part that says that they \"are police officers and not school teachers, school administrators, nor school counselors. The officers will assist teachers with classroom presentations on relative topics when requested and able\" (there is no principle that only teachers, administrators, or counselors can have a legitimate educational interest). This model memo does not say anything that indicates that the conditions \"Is under the direct control\" and \"Is subject to the requirements of \u00a799\\.33(a)\" are true, but those conditions could be satisfied external to the MOU.\n\nThere are some additional exceptions of the \"if required by law\" type, such as a state law \"adopted before November 19, 1974, if the allowed reporting or disclosure concerns the juvenile justice system and the system's ability to effectively serve the student whose records are released\"; or, after that date, is \"subject to the requirements of \u00a799\\.38\" which refers you to \u00a799\\.31(a)(5\\)(i)(B). If that is confusing, here are the two self\\-referring sections:\n\n\u00a799\\.38(a) If reporting or disclosure allowed by State statute concerns the juvenile justice system and the system's ability to effectively serve, prior to adjudication, the student whose records are released, an educational agency or institution may disclose education records under \u00a799\\.31(a)(5\\)(i)(B). \n\n\u00a799\\.31(a)(5\\)(i)(B). The disclosure is to State and local officials or authorities to whom this information is specifically...Allowed to be reported or disclosed pursuant to State statute adopted after November 19, 1974, subject to the requirements of \u00a799\\.38\\.\n\nSo state law is one possibility; \"legitimate educational interest\" is a remote possiblity. [Massachussetts law](http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr23.html?section=all) does include governmental third party disclosures: 603 CMR 23\\.07(4\\)(c)\n\n> A school may release information regarding a student upon receipt of a\n>  request from the Department of Social Services, a probation officer, a\n>  justice of any court, or the Department of Youth Services under the\n>  provisions of M.G.L. c. 119, sections 51B, 57, 69 and 69A\n>  respectively.\n\nThat does not directly apply to local police, but it is possible that a police officer is operating as a probation officer or an agent of the Department of Youth Services. Under paragraph (e),\n\n> A school may disclose information regarding a student to appropriate\n>  parties in connection with a health or safety emergency if knowledge\n>  of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the\n>  student or other individuals. This includes, but is not limited to, disclosures to the local police department\n\nMass. law allows the possibility of treating a police officer as \"authorized school personnel\" if they are \"providing services to the student under an agreement between the school committee and a service provider, and who are working directly with the student in an administrative, teaching counseling, and/or diagnostic capacity\" \u2013 which is not completely out of the question but is a bit of a stretch (especially in the context of a blanket statement \"we share records\", not \"we may share yours, if you get special counseling\"). Tne law also says \"Any such personnel who are not employed directly by the school committee shall have access only to the student record information that is required for them to perform their duties\", so sharing of *all* records would not be allowed.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under FERPA regulations, a public high school wants to share student education records with a School Resource Officer (SRO) who works for the local police department. Which of the following conditions would most likely allow this disclosure without violating FERPA?\n\nA) The school has a general policy of sharing all student records with local law enforcement.\n\nB) The SRO has signed a memorandum of understanding with the school, agreeing to use the records only for educational purposes.\n\nC) The school has determined that the SRO has a legitimate educational interest, is under the direct control of the school regarding use of the records, and is subject to FERPA's redisclosure requirements.\n\nD) The SRO is considered a school official because they sometimes give presentations in classrooms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on FERPA regulations. It addresses the three key conditions for allowing disclosure to a third party like an SRO:\n1. The school has determined a legitimate educational interest\n2. The SRO is under the direct control of the school regarding use of the records\n3. The SRO is subject to FERPA's requirements on use and redisclosure of information\n\nOption A is too broad and would violate FERPA. Option B touches on educational purposes but doesn't fully address the necessary conditions. Option D suggests a legitimate educational interest but doesn't cover the other required conditions. Only option C addresses all the necessary requirements for FERPA compliance in this situation."

But since then, we haven\u2019t been able to do anything with it because it has 2 liens on it. So it sits there unoccupied after all these years. \n\nBack around 2007 during the housing bubble, my mom used her house as collateral and purchased 2 other houses. When she passed a way, the debt from those houses created 2 liens. Shortly after they foreclosed and sold, therefore (from what our lawyer tells us) the liens should\u2019ve been removed. So we tried to contact the two companies that held these liens to get everything smoothed out. To no avail, they both went bankrupt. We hired a lawyer to help us find the companies that took over the liens, but even our lawyer couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n\n$30,000 later, in debt from lawyer\u2019s \u201cresearch\u201d, no information on the liens, rejected by the judge, and no house, we decided to call it quits until we had the money to hire a lawyer again. I\u2019m worried that so much time and money has gone by that we need to figure this out before it gets auctioned off. So my question is, what can I do to find who the lien holders are, and remove them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Better than hiring an attorney who, as you now realize, will charge you by the hour and guarantee nothing. I recommend you approach a title and closing company with the same question. Even better, have a real estate agent do it. Or have a purchase and sale contract in hand signed by a buyer. The title company will do the research because they are on the hook for the title insurance against future claims and the closing company will be motivated to get a resolution because they will earn their closing fees when the transaction closes.\n\nEdit: I also like the \"sue for quiet title\" approach mentioned in one of the comments. I'm surprised your attorney didn't suggest that.",

These entities have a vested interest in resolving title issues to facilitate property transactions. They are motivated by potential fees and are experienced in navigating complex title situations. Additionally, title companies are responsible for providing title insurance, which gives them added incentive to thoroughly research and resolve any liens. This approach is likely to be more cost-effective than continuing to pay lawyers for open-ended research, and it has a higher probability of success due to the specialized expertise and motivation of these industry professionals."

Failing to comply could result in committing an offense. However, if you believe the stop and search was discriminatory or unlawful, the appropriate next step is to file a complaint.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How does the law reconcile the \"innocent until proven guilty\" principle with the treatment of those awaiting trial on criminal charges?\n\nAt least in the U.S., it seems like there is a meta\\-criminal\\-justice system in which merely being accused of a crime is enough to land a person in prison.\n\nAn illustration of this is the case of Michael Avenatti: While he was out on bail awaiting trial, prosecutors accused him of committing additional crimes (while on bail). [The judge agreed with the prosecutors and revoked his bail](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-15/michael-avenatti-arrested-new-fraud-allegations):\n\n> At the end of the court hearing, Judge Selna said he agreed with prosecutors that Avenatti\u2019s handling of the $1 million was probably illegal. He said he also agreed that Avenatti posed an economic danger to the public if he remained free on bail, because he was likely to keep committing crimes. \u201cI believe that the danger to the community is real and palpable,\u201d Selna said.\n\nI understand that the bail system is discretionary, but AFAIK the legitimate purpose of imprisonment awaiting trial is to ensure that the accused appears for trial. Here we have an example in which a person's freedom awaiting trial was curtailed based only on an accusation of illegal behavior, not based on a legal conviction for committing a crime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The concept of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is inherent in our constitutional protections for due process.\n\nAs far as I know, the Supreme Court first formally recognized it as a rule in [*Coffin v. United States*, 156 U.S. 432, 458\\-59 (1895\\)](https://casetext.com/case/coffin-v-united-states-2):\n\n> Now the presumption of innocence is a conclusion drawn by the law in favor of the citizen, by virtue whereof, when brought to trial upon a criminal charge, he must be acquitted, unless he is proven to be guilty. In other words, this presumption is an instrument of proof created by the law in favor of one accused, whereby his innocence is established until sufficient evidence is introduced to overcome the proof which the law has created.\n\nThe key phrase \\-\\- for purposes of your question \\-\\- is \"sufficient evidence.\" At a criminal trial, sufficient evidence consists of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on \u201call the essential elements of guilt\u201d [*In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358, 361 (1970\\)](https://casetext.com/case/in-the-matter-of-samuel-winship-appellant).\n\nBut if the government wants to lock up a defendant pending trial, the question is not whether the defendant is guilty of the charged crime, but rather whether he poses a danger to the community and can be trusted to appear for trial. [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3142(e)(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3142). And on those questions, he retains the presumption of innocence, but the government's burden of proof when arguing otherwise is substantially lower. The courts recognize both the potential of fleeing from the court and the prevention of additional crimes as legitimate bases for pretrial detention.\n\nIn cases like Avenatti's, where the government is seeking pretrial detention because the defendant is a danger to the community, it needs to prove by clear and convincing evidence \"that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community.\" [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3142(f)(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3142).\n\nHowever, if the government is seeking to hold the defendant because it does not believe he will appear for trial, it need only prove its case on that question by a preponderance of the evidence. [*United States v. Martir*, 782 F.2d 1141, 1146 (2d Cir. 1986\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-martir#p1146) (\u201cFor detention to be proper, the government had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no conditions of release would reasonably assure Martir's attendance at trial.\u201d).\n\nAs a side note, I'd agree with some of the answers that *in practice*, the bond system is regularly abused to the point that its underlying principles become unrecognizable. My answer is meant only to address the actual *legal* rules your question implicates.",

According to the provided information, when the government seeks pretrial detention because the defendant is considered a danger to the community, it must prove \"by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community.\" This standard is higher than preponderance of the evidence but lower than beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nA) Beyond a reasonable doubt is incorrect. This is the standard used in criminal trials to determine guilt, not for pretrial detention decisions.\n\nB) Preponderance of the evidence is incorrect. While this standard is used when the government argues that the defendant may not appear for trial, it is not the standard for danger to the community.\n\nD) Probable cause is incorrect.

Let's also say that later on the arrest makes major news, even beyond local news, like regional and national news, and the person's mugshot is a part of the news coverage. The person was later convicted of the crime they were arrested for and is now out of prison.\n\nCould they sell autographed copies of their mugshot? Or would this be in violation of Indiana's [\"Son of Sam\" laws](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/2012/03/23/son-of-sam-statutes-federal-and-state-summary/) ([Indiana Code \u00a7 5\\-2\\-6\\.3\\-3](https://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2022/ic/titles/005#5-2-6.3-3)) that prevent a person from profiting off their crimes?\n\nI have done a cursory google search and could not find anything explicitly forbidding this, but also nothing clearly stating that it was 100% legal either. Person in this hypothetical scenario is in Indiana, United States.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Indiana Code \u00a7 5\\-2\\-6\\.3\\-3 requires a person charged with a felony to remit 90 percent of any income derived \"directly or indirectly from a felony\" to the state's crime\\-victims fund.\n\nSo if the defendant's crime was not a felony, the law does not purport to have any effect on the mugshot transaction. But even if it was a felony, the law does not actually prohibit the mugshot sale, it merely imposes a tax on transactions related to that offense.\n\nBut the law is unconstitutional, as the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that these \"Son of Sam\" laws violate the First Amendment:\n\n> We conclude simply that, in the Son of Sam law, New York has singled out speech on a particular subject for a financial burden that it places on no other speech and no other income. The State's interest in compensating victims from the fruits of crime is a compelling one, but the Son of Sam law is not narrowly tailored to advance that objective. As a result, the statute is inconsistent with the First Amendment.\n\n[*Simon Schuster v.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) It is completely illegal under Indiana's \"Son of Sam\" law, as it constitutes profiting from a crime.\n\nB) It is legal only if the original crime was not a felony.\n\nC) It is legal regardless of the nature of the crime, as Indiana's \"Son of Sam\" law is likely unconstitutional based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent.\n\nD) It is legal, but 90% of the profits must be remitted to the state's crime-victims fund.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While Indiana does have a \"Son of Sam\" law (Indiana Code \u00a7 5-2-6.3-3) that requires individuals to remit 90% of income derived from felonies to the state's crime-victims fund, such laws have been ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. In Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Bd. (1991), the Court held that these laws violate the First Amendment by imposing a content-based financial burden on speech. Therefore, despite the existence of the law in Indiana, it is likely unenforceable due to being unconstitutional. This makes selling autographed mugshots legal regardless of the nature of the original crime.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't make the action illegal, it only attempts to tax it. Option B is incorrect because the constitutionality issue applies regardless of whether the crime was a felony or not. Option D, while reflecting the text of the Indiana law, is incorrect due to the law's likely unconstitutionality."

Are there grounds for such restriction? Would they consider restricting the scrap provider?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Via the [Insulin Amendment Act](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/77th-congress/session-1/c77s1ch613.pdf), later repealed, and the [Durham\\-Humphrey Amendment](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-65/pdf/STATUTE-65-Pg648.pdf), the federal government gained the power to regulate insulin, and the [Keefauver\\-Harris Amendment](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-76/pdf/STATUTE-76-Pg780.pdf) imposed regulatory requirements for proving safety and effectiveness. If you want to get in the business of manufacturing pork insulin (nobody in the US does: there are no approved US sources), you have to get FDA approval. [21 USC 331](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/331) prohibits introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved drugs.\n\nYou can argue that personal use does not constitute \"introduction into interstate commerce\". An analogous argument was tried in the case of [Wickard v. Filburn](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/317/111/), 317 U.S. 111, where appellee was penalized for growing and feeding wheat to his livestock, contrary to federal law. The court found that manufacturing for personal use potentially impacts interstate commerce, so the wheat regulations are not unconstitutional. Nevertheless, insulin\\-relevant law is framed in terms of *introduction* into interstate commerce, not just *affecting* interstate commerce. \n\nThe FDA's consumer guidance on importing beef and pork insulin is [here](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/questionsanswers/ucm173909.htm#Q-1). They state that you can apply for permission to import unapproved animal insulin, and they state that they will not generally allow unapproved importation, however\n\n> FDA staff may use enforcement discretion to allow the importation of\n>  unapproved drugs into the U.S. under certain conditions. One such\n>  condition is personal importation of unapproved drugs, like beef or\n>  pork insulin, that are medically necessary and not available in the\n>  U.S. If you are a person with diabetes who can\u2019t be treated with\n>  human insulin or its analogs, FDA may permit you to import beef or\n>  pork insulin into the U.S. for your personal use.\n\nAgain, this is for person use only. The bottom line is that there is a basis for thinking that the FDA could restrict you, but not necessarily a sufficient basis to say that the restriction would be legal. The underpinning of these restrictions is the Commerce Clause, and the language of the restrictions is more narrow than the frequent \"affecting interstate commerce\" connection to that clause. While the courts generally accept that \"keeping people safe\" is a legitimate government interest, a narrow reading of the language does not support the theory that making your own insulin is illegal.\n\nThere would be no legal basis for the FDA to penalize the scrap seller.",

The FDA has regulatory power over insulin through various amendments.\n2. Laws prohibit introduction of unapproved drugs into interstate commerce, but personal use may not clearly fall under this definition.\n3. The Wickard v. Filburn case established that personal use can affect interstate commerce, but insulin laws specifically mention \"introduction\" into commerce, not just \"affecting\" it.\n4. The FDA's consumer guidance suggests some flexibility for personal importation of unapproved insulin in certain medical situations.\n5. While there is a basis for the FDA to potentially restrict this practice, the legality of such a restriction is not definitively established due to the specific language used in relevant laws.\n\nA is incorrect because the FDA does have some legal grounds based on existing regulations. B is too definitive, as the Wickard v. Filburn case doesn't directly apply to this situation due to differences in legal language. D is incorrect because there's no legal basis mentioned for penalizing the slaughterhouse."

Can I still use my original name or will I have to change my business name entirely? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Business names are commonly regulated and you will need to check the regulations in your jurisdiction. For example, companies in Australia are registered nationally by ASIC, however, business names are registered state by state (however, ASIC maintains a consolidated database). In Australia it is illegal for a person (including a company) to conduct business under a name that is not their own. However, if your name is \"John Smith\" then you can conduct business under that name irrespective of how many other John Smith's are doing the same.\n\n[Here](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=pmxb8yv0k_4) is a business name search for \"ABC\" \\- as you can see, subtle differences (\"ABC\" vs \"A.B.C\") allow similar but distinct business (or company) names to be registered. \n\nNotwithstanding if your name is distinct enough to allow registration, using it may still infringe another person's [trade mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark). A trade mark is infringed when you use someone else's trade mark in a way that could cause confusion between your goods and services and theirs. You may have a perfectly legitimately registered business name but if you do not sufficiently distinguish your goods and services from theirs you cannot use it. In your case, you are talking about establishing a \"a design company/photography business\"; if the person you are concerned about sells fruit, you are probably not going to infringe their trade mark. Similarly, if your operations are sufficiently removed geographically that there is minimal chance of confusion you should be fine.\n\n[Copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) is a completely different concept and has to do with artistic or literary expression. They are asserting that they have copyright in the content (literary) and appearance (artistic) of their web site. Unless you copy that you have no issues with copyright. No one has copyright in a name because names lack the necessary threshold of literary creativity.",

Sarah may be able to use the name \"Capture Moments\", but she should take several factors into consideration:\n\n1. Business name regulations vary by jurisdiction. Sarah needs to check the regulations in her specific area to ensure she can register the name.\n2. Copyright doesn't apply to business names, so the \"Copyright 2020\" on the other business's website is irrelevant to the name itself.\n3.

If the name is distinct enough and allowed by local regulations, Sarah might be able to register it. However, she should consider whether using the same name as an established photography business could lead to confusion or legal challenges in the future.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright doesn't apply to business names. Option B is too absolute and ignores potential legal considerations. Option C is unnecessary, as permission from the existing business isn't required if local regulations allow the name and there are no trademark infringements."

Such employers insist that, by policy, they only pay through a company\\-issued debit card and will not pay using traditional methods such as a paycheck. Some also offer to arrange direct deposit with a bank, but will not offer any other form of pay.\n\nWord of mouth seems to be that these policies are illegal, but I have had difficulty finding information on this topic that is not from the card\\-issuing entities.\n\nCan a U.S.\\-based employer legally mandate their employees open a bank account upon hiring?\nIf employers can or cannot, what section of the law defines who can and cannot compel a citizen into banking against the citizen's will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under federal law, an employer may impose direct deposit as a condition of employment.\n\nThe Electronic Funds Transfer Act at [15 USC 1693k](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1693k) only says that employers may not require an employee to have a bank account *at a particular bank*:\n\n> No person may\u2014\n>  (1\\) condition the extension of credit to a consumer on such consumer\u2019s repayment by means of preauthorized electronic fund transfers; or\n>  (2\\) require a consumer to establish an account for receipt of electronic fund transfers **with a particular financial institution** as a condition of employment or receipt of a government benefit.\n\nIf the employee is allowed to choose their bank, then such a condition is legal under this law. The government's interpretation of this law is clarified in [12 CFR 1005 Supplement I](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/appendix-Supplement_I_to_part_1005) at 10(e)(2\\):\n\n> 1. Payroll. An employer (including a financial institution) may not require its employees to receive their salary by direct deposit to any particular institution. **An employer may require direct deposit of salary by electronic means if employees are allowed to choose the institution that will receive the direct deposit.** Alternatively, an employer may give employees the choice of having their salary deposited at a particular institution (designated by the employer) or receiving their salary by another means, such as by check or cash.\n\nThat said, individual states can create their own legislation, and many have made it illegal under state law for an employer to require direct deposit. You didn't name a particular state so I can't be more specific, but there is a chart [here](https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/can-employers-make-direct-deposit-mandatory) created by a payroll company showing the legality of such policies by state.\n\nNote that in some sense, the employee is not really being \"compelled\" or \"mandated\" to have a bank account \\- if the employer insists on using direct deposit, the employee is free to go look for a different job. US law does tend to recognize that there is a major power imbalance in employer\\-employee relationships, so there are many regulations; but at its root, it's treated as a contract between two independent parties who may each set whatever conditions they want, and enter into the contract only if they can agree. \n\nIn contexts other than employment, I would expect even fewer restrictions on how a bank account could be set as a condition for something. For instance, it could be a condition for using a particular product or service. Again, if you don't want to open a bank account, you are free to not use that product or service.",

If I log a line like the following:\n\n```\nTIMESTAMP | IP 123.123.123.123 | USER 42 | Serivice /country/list\n\n```\n\nIn this case, I would be able to relate the IP address to a single user by ID, so do I need to ask for an agreement before doing it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: IP addresses are personal data. That means you need a *legal basis* to process them, but not necessarily consent from the user.\n\nThat IP addresses should be treated as personal data in most contexts is clear, regardless of whether you can associate the IP address with a user ID. That you make such an association affirms that both the IP address and user ID are personal data in your context though.\n\nAs the answers in the questions you linked indicate, there are alternative legal bases to consent. The GDPR offers a choice of six legal bases (Art 6(1\\) lit a\u2013f). In most cases, you would instead rely on a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d for logging. But it's not enough to claim that you have a legitimate interest. You must have a clear purpose for which such logs would be necessary, and you would then have to weigh this legitimate interest against the interests, rights, and freedoms of the affected data subjects. If such logs are necessary for security and anti\\-abuse purposes, your legitimate interest test is likely to prevail.\n\nHowever, you must limit retention of the logged data and the included information to what is actually necessary. For example, keeping user IDs in there might not be necessary. If the association of IP addresses and user IDs is not necessary for a legitimate interest, then you would indeed need consent.\n\n---\n\nDiscussion on why IP addresses are personal data.\n\nYou see many answers and opinions that IP addresses might not be personal data. Some of these are *technically correct*, but most are misinformed or outdated. I know only a single well\\-informed person that still disagrees. For everyone else [such as the EU Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en), IP addresses are clearly personal data.\n\nUnder the GDPR, personal data is any information that relates to an (indirectly) identifiable natural person. In the context of log files we can assume that the entries usually \u201crelate\u201d to a person, namely the person making the request. The exception would be requests triggered by automated systems. The more interesting question is whether the person to which the log entry relates is identifiable.\n\nWhile the GDPR does provide further guidance on the concept of identification in Recital 26, it does not provide clear unambiguous criteria. Thus, there is lots of debate about what that precisely means.\n\nOne approach is to sidestep that debate and and notice that the GDPR's definition of personal data explicitly notes that a person might be identified \u201cin particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier\u201d (Art 4(1\\)). Another but otherwise unrelated part of the GDPR mentions \u201cinternet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags\u201d as examples of online identifiers (Recital 30\\).\n\nWe can also look more deeply into Recital 26 and see that \u201csingling out\u201d already counts as identification. We can use the IP address to single out one person's log entries from the set of log entries, so this could be interpreted as meaning that any stable user ID renders the data personal data \u2013 and an IP address is sufficiently stable in this context.\n\nAnother part of Recital 26 says that we must consider \u201call the means reasonably likely to be used\u201d for identification, even if this involves additional information from third parties. This phrasing is virtually identical to the GDPR's predecessor, the EU Data Protection Directive. On the basis of that DPD, the EU's top court (ECJ/CJEU) was asked to rule on the question whether dynamic IP addresses are personal data (the *Breyer* case, C\u2011582/14, judgement from 2016\\-10\\-19\\). It said yes.\n\n\u201cIt did not say yes\u201d, some people will object. And they are *technically correct*. When someone rents an internet connection from an ISP, the ISP will have logs that connect the user's real\\-world identity to the IP address they were assigned at a time. You don't have access to the ISP's logs. But, if that user violated your rights (e.g. a cyberattack or copyright infringement), then you could (depending on civil vs criminal matters) report this to the appropriate authorities or to petition the court and they would have the right to order the ISP to disclose this information. The CJEU said that *if* this chain (you \u2192 authorities \u2192 ISP \u2192 user identity) is grounded in law, then the IP address would be identifiable. But whether there are suitable laws to compel the ISP to disclose this data would be up to national laws, and the CJEU doesn't concern itself with that. Spoiler: such laws are pretty common.\n\nTo summarize typical objections:\n\n* The IP address doesn't *relate* to a person:\n\nCan be a valid objection, but is not typically the case for user\\-facing web services.\n* The Recital 30 argument is not valid because it's about profiling, not identification, and it only says that IP addresses *may* be used for profiling, not that they are always identifying:\n\nTechnically correct, but I think that Recital 30 merely expresses the implied understanding that of course an IP address is an online identifier and permits identification by itself.\n* \u201cSingling out\u201d does not apply because SOME\\_REASON:\n\nIndeed, this is an ill\\-defined term with no case law to guide us. However, regulators such as the EDPB and their predecessor WP29 routinely use \u201csingling out\u201d to mean being able to distinguish one person's data from other people's data. An IP address lets us do that.\n* The *Breyer* judgement is not applicable because the defendant in that case was the German state, and the state has other legal means than ordinary website operators:\n\nNothing in that case was specific to the website operator being a state or other authority. If the website operator can contact the appropriate authority and if they have the right to order the ISP to disclose the relevant data, then the IP address is identifiable.\n* The CJEU didn't say \u201cyes\u201d in *Breyer*, it said \u201cif\u201d. So I'll take that as a \u201cno\u201d:\n\nThe CJEU concerns itself with the interpretation of EU law, not with national laws. Specifically in the *Breyer* case, lower courts confirmed that German law has the necessary means. In other EU member states, further checks would be necessary but it would surprise me if there wouldn't be equivalent subpoena powers.\n* If the ISP doesn't have the data, then the IP addresses are anonymous:\n\nIndeed, the CJEU scenario collapses if there is no additional data to be linked with the IP address. However:\n\n\t+ The CJEU used this scenario as an example to show that IP addresses can be identifiable. If that particular scenario fails, there could be other scenarios that still allow identification.\n\t+ The question of whether IP addresses are identifiable had of course been the subject of wider debate at the time. That the GDPR explicitly mentions IP addresses can be seen as a reaction to this debate. Thus, in a sense, the *Breyer* case is moot. It is still useful as an explanation of how broad \u201creasonably likely means\u201d must be interpreted.",

Assuming their claim is true and that Trump and anyone who had legal representation rights for him did not authorize any release of the documents did the New York Times break any laws in either publishing or acquiring these documents? Or would it be safe to assume that whoever released these documents broke a law? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [Bartnicki v. Vopper 532 U.S. 514](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/532/514/case.html), SCOTUS ruled in a manner applicable to this case. In that case they assumed (did not decide, but operated from that initial position) that the information was illegally obtained, respondent knew that, but did not play any role in obtaining the information. They say that \n\n> In New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713, this Court\n>  upheld the press' right to publish information of great public concern\n>  obtained from documents stolen by a third party\n\nand held that \n\n> privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in\n>  publishing matters of public importance. One of the costs associated\n>  with participation in public affairs is an attendant loss of privacy.\n\n[Florida Star v. B.J.F. 491 U. S. 524](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/524/case.html) in a similar vein cites a principle (from [Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U. S. 97](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/443/97/case.html)) that\n\n> if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of\n>  public significance, then state officials may not constitutionally\n>  punish publication of the information, absent a need to further a\n>  state interest of the highest order.\n\nIn other words, this is a matter where any restriction would be subject to strict scrutiny. Similar results are found in [Boehner v. McDermott 332 F. Supp.2d 149](https://casetext.com/case/boehner-v-mcdermott-3). However, in [Peavy v. WFAA\\-TV Inc](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1297051.html), the TV station had a more active role in violating the law, so they were not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAs for the initial source, it is said to be unknown (to NYT) where the documents came from, though they were verified by Jack Mitnick. There are federal laws that would prohibit government agents from disclosing a person's tax return, but there is no general law against disclosing a tax return.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the Supreme Court rulings in Bartnicki v. Vopper and Florida Star v. B.J.F., which of the following scenarios would most likely be protected under the First Amendment?\n\nA) A newspaper publishes classified government documents that were stolen by a third party, knowing they were obtained illegally but not participating in the theft.\n\nB) A TV station actively participates in illegally recording a private conversation and then broadcasts portions of it.\n\nC) A magazine publishes private medical records of a celebrity, obtained through hacking the celebrity's doctor's computer system.\n\nD) A news website publishes a politician's tax returns that were anonymously mailed to them, without verifying their authenticity.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) This scenario most closely aligns with the principles established in Bartnicki v. Vopper and New York Times Co. v. United States. The Supreme Court has upheld the press's right to publish information of great public concern, even if obtained illegally by a third party, as long as the press itself did not participate in the illegal acquisition.\n\nB) This scenario is similar to the Peavy v. WFAA-TV Inc case, where the TV station had an active role in violating the law. Such actions are not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nC) While this involves publishing private information, it likely involves active participation in illegal activity (hacking), which would not be protected.\n\nD) While this seems similar to the correct answer, the lack of verification could potentially put it at risk. The New York Times case mentioned in the original post involved verification of the documents.\n\nThe key principle is that if the press lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance, even if the original source obtained it illegally, the publication is likely to be protected under the First Amendment, unless there is a need to further a state interest of the highest order."

The tags were not able to be seen due to mud covering the tag. \n\nThe gas station attendant did not see me operate the vehicle due to customer volume at the time. I returned to ask him. The people in the gas station were not familiar to me or the gas station attendant. There were several other vehicles and patrons in the gas station.\n\nAn officer pulls into a gas station parking lot and comes up to \"provide a courtesy by informing you your tag is too dirty to read\" and does not view the person being provided this courtesy actually operating the vehicle. No emergency lights were ever turned on and I was not in the vehicle. After I was informed my tag was dirty I thanked the officer and he left. I went inside and purchased a drink and used the restroom and came back outside to pop my hood and add power steering fluid to the vehicle. During that time, the same officer and another unit pulled back into the lot, again without emergency lights, to \"stop\" a vehicle that was not in operation to arrest me for \"driving\" with a suspended license. \n\n**Is this a \"traffic stop\"? And is it considered a driving offense to add power steering fluid to a vehicle on private property?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, the fact that they stopped you on private property is irrelevant. The traffic offense \\- you driving the vehicle with a suspended license \\- occurred on public property en route to the station. That offense does not simply disappear because you are *now* on private property, nor do the police need to wait for you to leave private property in order to stop or arrest you. So... forget the gas station even exists in this scenario.\n\nThe real issue at hand here is whether or not the officer needs to actually see you driving the vehicle in order to make an arrest. **The answer is no.** There isn't any other valid reason your car would be where it is now other than it was driven there. If you are the only person with the car, then it's reasonable to assume that you were the one that drove it there. Plenty of people get arrested for this \"connect the dots\" way of proving they drove, especially in DUI cases. But the officer doesn't even need to assume that second part either.\n\nIt all comes down to the actual definition of \"driving\" in the law books. Most citizens would interpret the word as meaning actually moving in a vehicle. That's wrong. Defining a driver and what constitutes driving is actually way, way broader in the eyes of the law. In Kansas, a [driver is defined](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2014/b2013_14/statute/008_000_0000_chapter/008_014_0000_article/008_014_0016_section/008_014_0016_k/) in such a way:\n\n> **8\\-1416\\.\u2003\"Driver\" defined.** \"Driver\" means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\n\nEssentially, having physical control over the vehicle is generally enough to label you as the driver or that you are driving the vehicle. In a lot of states, having possession of the keys to the vehicle is enough for a court to say you had physical control of the vehicle, because \"physical control\" is more broadly defined as \"capable of making it move and within close proximity\" to the vehicle. Thus, you can be arrested for traffic\\-related offenses. It does not matter if the car is parked, if you're filling it with fluids, or just taking a nap in the front seat.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the state of Kansas, under what circumstances can a person be considered to be \"driving\" a vehicle for legal purposes, even if the vehicle is not in motion?\n\nA) Only when the person is physically operating the vehicle and it is in motion\nB) When the person has the keys to the vehicle and is within close proximity to it\nC) When the person is performing maintenance on the vehicle, such as adding fluids\nD) Only when the person is seated in the driver's seat with the engine running\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Kansas law, the definition of a \"driver\" is broader than many people might assume. The legal definition states that a driver is \"every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\" This means that having physical control over the vehicle is generally enough to be considered \"driving\" in the eyes of the law. In many states, including Kansas, having possession of the keys to the vehicle and being in close proximity to it is sufficient for a court to determine that a person had physical control of the vehicle. This is why option B is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the vehicle does not need to be in motion for a person to be considered \"driving\" it legally. Option C is incorrect because while performing maintenance might suggest control of the vehicle, it's not the defining factor - possession of the keys and proximity are more relevant. Option D is too narrow, as the engine does not need to be running, nor does the person need to be seated in the driver's seat to be in control of the vehicle legally."

For example, using the same historical people is fine, but what about using said historical people in interactions that have no basis in historical documents?\n\nBasically, at what point does an artistic work infringe on previous artistic works? I recognize this is ambiguous but I assume that copyright law has several bases on which to make such a judgement call.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic principle is that copyright **never** protects an idea, it only protects the expression of an idea. In the US, that rule is embodied in [17 USC 102(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#103) which provides that:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nWhen significant, detailed, and specific plot elements are copied from a prior work, then that **may** make the new work a ***derivative work***. Creation or distribution of a derivative work requires permission from the owner of the copyright (if any) on the prior work (source work). But the elements used must be significant and must be detailed. If all that is taken could be expressed in a summery contained in a single sentence or paragraph, this will not make the new work derivative.\n\nFor example, such ideas as:\n\n> * Napoleon meets the Emperor of China and they form an alliance. \\[My idea]\n> * Sherlock Holmes helps to repel the Martian invasion described in *The War of the Worlds*. Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger is also involved. \\[Wellman's *Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds*]\n> * Aliens crash land on Earth in 1905, creating an alternate timeline. They seek to start WWI early, to stimulate technical development. \\[Benson's *...And Having Writ*]\n\nwould on their own not be enough to constitute a derivative work and thus infringement. But the more specific detail from the source work is used, the more likely it is that an infringement suit would win.\n\nBy the way, the rule is the same whether the source work is a book, or a TV show, or an opera, or any other work subject to copyright protection. If the work is old enough, any copyright will have expired, but the format of the original does not matter, as long as it is \"fixed in a tangible form\" which includes video tape, DVD, computer file, or a script written on paper. About the only things that do not count as fixed would be an impromptu dance, song, speech, or story whch the creator performed or spoke without its ever having been written down or recorded in any way.",

Copyright law does not protect ideas, only the specific expression of those ideas. The basic concept of Napoleon forming an alliance with the Emperor of China is an idea that cannot be copyrighted. The novel would only infringe on the TV show's copyright if it copied significant, detailed, and specific plot elements beyond this basic concept.

During a war can American soldiers commandeer my house?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Meaning of the Third Amendment\n------------------------------\n\nThe US Third amendment means that if the US ever wants to quarter soldiers in private houses (or other dwellings), without the consent of the owners, it can only do so in time of war, and only in accordance with some law that Congress passes, authorizing such action and providing procedures for it. To the best of my knowledge, Congress has never passed any such law, and so no such \"quartering\" would be permissible, even during wartime.\n\nNote that the text of the amendment says \"house\". This provision might be extended to other dwellings, such as apartment buildings, but probably not to any \"privately\\-owned building\" that is not a residence (that is, was not previously a dwelling). Such non\\-residences are not protected by the Third Amendment , although the takings clause of the Fifth might apply, as might the Due Process clause, depending on the circumstances. [*Youngstown Sheet \\& Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%26_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer) would be relevant in such a case.\n\n*Engblom v. Carey*\n------------------\n\nThe amendment was invoked and interpreted in [*Engblom v. Carey*, 677 F.2d 957 (2d Cir. 1982\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engblom_v._Carey). This is said by Wikipedia to be the first decision at the circuit court level interpreting the amendment or depending on its provisions. It has never been the basis for a US Supreme Court decision\n\nIn 1979 there was a state\\-wide strike of NY corrections officers (prison employees). NY National Guard troops were deployed by the state. Staff had been rented apartments as part of their employment agreement.\n\nGuard troops were first housed in administrative buildings and school buildings at or near the prison. But after five days striking officer were evicted by the state, and Guard troops were housed in dorms so vacated.\n\nTwo of the officers sued. The second circuit court held that:\n\n1. the National Guard troops are in fact soldiers under the Third Amendment;\n2. the Third Amendment applies to state as well as federal authorities, i.e., is incorporated against the states; and\n3. the protection of the Third Amendment extends beyond homeowners, but covers anyone who, within their residence, has a legal expectation of privacy and a legal right to exclude others from entering into the premises. That is, tenants and other lawful residents are protected.\n\nIssues Mentioned in the Question\n--------------------------------\n\n> What law is being referenced?\n\nNo such law currently exists. Congress could pass one in the future.\n\n> During a war can American soldiers commandeer my house?\n\nOnly if Congress passes such a law, and then only if whatever procedures that are \"prescribed\" by the law Congress passes are followed.\"",

Now Mike begins to drug deal and do drugs inside the house along with breaking a bunch of other laws. Steve sees this for a while and does nothing. Until one day Mike steals something from Steve. Now Steve would like to see Mike arrested and jailed for drug dealing, possession of drugs, and crimes he has confessed to Steve. Evidence would be in Mike's room and Text messages that Mike has on his phone would confirm the truth about the crimes he has confessed to.\n\nIf Steve were to call the police (and he is on the lease) could he have them walk in to the house and go into Mike's room to find the evidence of these crimes (without Mike's Permission) and arrest him on the spot? Also Mike would have no criminal record in this hypothetical scenario.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The police (and any other involved public agencies) do not work for Steve. They make their own decisions. You didn't specify a location, and requirements to consent to a search vary by location. It wouldn't be surprising, though, if Steve can't legally consent to a search of someone else's room (but possibly could consent to search of common areas).\n\nOne possibility you don't seem to have considered is that the police or prosecutor would, if Steve is willing to testify, use Steve's testimony as probable cause to get a warrant. Then they could obtain text messages from Mike's service provider (even if he's deleted them from his phone), search his room without his consent, etc. Details again vary by location.\n\nFinally, any jail/prison term is typically up to a judge or jury, not the police. Pre\\-trial detention is typically up to a judge or magistrate.\n\n(Also, outside the scope of your question, but if there is any chance Steve has allowed himself to become involved in the misdeeds, even slightly, Steve would be wise to talk to a lawyer. Or if he suspects the police could believe that.)",

Steve discovers that Mike has been dealing drugs from their shared apartment and wants to report him to the police. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Steve's ability to consent to a police search of Mike's room?\n\nA) Steve can give police permission to search Mike's room because he is on the lease.\nB) Steve can only give police permission to search common areas of the apartment, not Mike's private room.\nC) Steve cannot give police any permission to search the apartment without Mike's consent.\nD) Steve can give police permission to search the entire apartment, including Mike's room, but only if Mike has a prior criminal record.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, while Steve is on the lease, he likely cannot legally consent to a search of Mike's private room. The answer states that \"It wouldn't be surprising, though, if Steve can't legally consent to a search of someone else's room (but possibly could consent to search of common areas).\" This implies that Steve's authority to consent to a search is limited to common areas of the apartment, not Mike's private space. Option A is incorrect because being on the lease doesn't automatically grant the right to consent to a search of all areas. Option C is too restrictive, as Steve likely can consent to common area searches. Option D introduces a condition about criminal records that isn't mentioned in the documentation and is not relevant to consent for searches."

This usually takes the form of increasing share value or the payout of dividends (and implicit in this argument is that the best interest of shareholders is the improved return on their initial investment).\n\nHowever, what if it is the will of shareholders for the firm to engage in activity that apparently goes against their interests?

When we purchased our house recently it what not brought to our attention at the time but the neighboring property has a disused chimney stack which appears to have been cut by a previous owner of our house to make way for a single\\-storey extension. This does not appear to have been done correctly as my understanding is that a gallow bracket should have been fitted.\n\nTo make matters a little more interesting our extension was built without planning or building regs approval approximately 20 years ago, but we do have an indemnity policy which we believe covers us which was taken out two owners previous in 2006\\.\n\nMy question is in two parts:\n\n1. If a builder is brought in to rectify the issue we would no doubt need building reg approval but in doing so do we risk invalidating our indemnity policy and risk the local authority asking us to knock down the extension?\n2. Would we require a Party Wall Agreement with the neighbors which consists of two leaseholders and two free holders?\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1irGM.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1irGM.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Building regulations\n--------------------\n\nYou most likely do risk invalidating the insurance policy. Such indemnity policies typically have clauses to say that you mustn't carry out any action which alerts the local authority to the situation. The risk from the insurer's point of view is that if the local authority are alerted they may decide to take enforcement action against the earlier breach, and the insurer doesn't want to be liable in that scenario. You should check your policy wording to be certain.\n\nEnforcement limitation periods are as follows:\n\n* Criminal fine for breach, 2 years from date of offence ([Building Act 1984, s 35A(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/35A)).\n* Notice to carry out removal / alterations, 1 year from completion of works ([Building Act 1984, s 36(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/36)\n* Application to court to impose injunction for removal / alteration, no time limit ([Building Act 1984, s 36(6\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/36)\n\nIn *practice* local authorities rarely enforce breaches older than 1 year (presumably because of the increased risk/cost of going to court vs simply serving a notice), but of course you can't rely on this being the case.\n\nAs an alternative to applying to the council, you can use a private building control company (an \"approved inspector\") provided that you instruct them *before* you commence any works (they are not permitted to issue retrospective building control approvals). They are not going to care about the previous breach. The local authority will still be alerted to the fact of the *new* works but this is just a short notice sent by the approved inspector at the start and the end, and the local authority are far less likely to inspect (it has never happened in my experience). There are plenty of such companies; just google \"building control approved inspector\". But in any case you may still risk (a) invaliding the insurance and (b) triggering enforcement action, it's just that the risks are lower.\n\nParty wall\n----------\n\nYou probably will be required to submit a party wall notice. If you can gain the cooperation of your neighbour, it is not necessary to go through the formal process of reaching an agreement, and they can simply reply to your notice to say that they are happy for you to go ahead. If they are not willing to do so then it will become more complicated and you will probably need to appoint a party wall surveyor to reach an agreement. This will boil down to a bit of hassle and money, but isn't a big disaster otherwise. Be wary of party wall surveyors sending you marketing which makes it sound like you need to use them (quite common after you do something semi\\-public like apply for planning permission); *always* try to settle it with a written consent before you waste money. There are plenty of online resources and books which can guide you through the process.\n\nPlanning permission\n-------------------\n\nAlthough you didn't ask about planning, you should be aware that pursuant to the [Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section 171B(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/171B), you gain immunity from enforcement 4 years after completion of the works. You are also entitled to request a Lawful Development Certificate for Existing Use from the Local Authority to confirm the immunity, although it is not necessary to do so and it is perhaps not recommendable in this case as you might alert them to the building control issue and you would almost certainly invalidate your planning indemnity policy (albeit that would be less important than the building control policy).",

Which of the following actions is LEAST likely to risk invalidating their indemnity policy or triggering enforcement action?\n\nA) Apply for building regulations approval from the local council for the remedial work on the chimney\nB) Hire a private approved inspector to oversee the remedial work without informing the local council\nC) Obtain a Lawful Development Certificate for Existing Use from the local authority\nD) Proceed with the remedial work without any formal approvals or inspections\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is risky as directly applying to the local council for building regulations approval is likely to alert them to the previous breach and invalidate the indemnity policy. \n\nOption B is the least risky approach. Using a private approved inspector reduces the likelihood of the local authority closely examining the work or discovering the previous breach. While there's still some risk, it's lower than the other options.\n\nOption C, obtaining a Lawful Development Certificate, would directly involve the local authority and almost certainly invalidate the indemnity policy, especially for the building control issue.\n\nOption D, proceeding without any approvals, is illegal and could lead to serious consequences if discovered.\n\nOption B provides a balance between addressing the issue legally and minimizing the risk to the indemnity policy."

But are lawyers, who deal with some of the darkest parts of society, discouraged/dis\\-allowed from interacting with therapists?

The therapist is obliged to keep things confidential, and their therapy can be considered a medical necessity just like a neurosurgeon's (depending on whom you ask). So I suppose the crux of the problem is whether opening up to a therapist (which can be a medical need) constitutes a breach of secrecy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I would imagine that it is a profession that is extremely taxing on\n> ones mental health.\n\nTrue.\n\n> Lawyers defend many genuine criminals who, after being freed, would go\n> on to continue to commit terrible criminal acts.\n\nThis is not a significant reason that the profession is taxing on mental health. Indeed, the pretty much complete consensus of the criminal defense bar is that providing a defense to people who are factually innocent of any crime is much more taxing on mental health than providing a defense to people who are factually guilty of some crime.\n\nYou deeply misunderstand the nature of criminal defense work (which isn't uncommon), and in particular, the things about being a lawyer that make it stressful and that can cause mental distress.\n\nDay to day work as a criminal defense lawyer is psychologically, for the most part, more like being a car salesman who is constantly haggling over prices and making deals, day in and day out, than it is a major moral dilemma.\n\n> That being said, I assume that Larry the lawyer, after successfully\n> defending someone, can't just go to his therapist Theodore and blab \"I\n> feel like I just let a murderer go\", no matter how important it is for\n> Larry's mental health.\n\nWithout addressing the issue of whether privileges material can be revealed to someone who is subject to another privilege (which is a tricky legal issue to analyze),it is entirely possible to engage in fruitful psychotherapy without revealing attorney\\-client privileged material. In part, this is because the things that you think that lawyers find to be the source of their mental health worries aren't what actually is the source of those worries.\n\nOne thing that is desirable, however, about practicing in a law firm rather than as a sole practitioner without associate attorneys or staff, is that it does provide someone with whom you can readily and on a daily basis discuss attorney\\-client privileged matters related to your work. This isn't mostly a mental health thing *per se*. It isn't that you provide psychotherapy to your colleagues. But, some people process the details of their work life better when they can talk through it with a fellow professional and the process of reaffirming and challenging your own professional judgments. This can bring you a general mental clarity about your work that helps to overcome a \"lack of bandwidth\" feeling that can lead to mental stress.\n\nMore generally, practicing law outside of a law firm without professional colleagues is simply lonely, which is a mental health stressor in its own way.",

The text also mentions that defending factually innocent clients is generally considered more taxing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that defending factually guilty clients is not a significant reason for mental health stress.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the text suggests that lawyers can engage in fruitful psychotherapy without revealing privileged information.\n\nOption D is partially true but not the main point. While the passage mentions the benefits of discussing cases with colleagues, it doesn't identify this as the main cause of mental health issues."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The laws for a number of statutory boards in my state are very brief in their specifications of procedures. One basic thing most of them seem to be saying are that either a board leader may convene a meeting or a specified majority of board members may convene a meeting. I don't know that there is any case law on \"convening\" a meeting, but the quorum rule seems to be a completely separate topic. (The quorum rule (also specified in statute) says a majority of \"members serving\" is a quorum.)\n\nHere are two examples of what I am trying to interpret:\n\n> 1. The board shall meet at least once a year to conduct its business and to elect a chair. Additional meetings must be held as necessary to conduct the business of the board and may be convened at the call of the chair or a majority of the board members.\n> 2. The board shall meet at least once a year to transact its business, which includes the election of officers and the reorganization of the board. The board shall meet at additional times as it may determine. Additional meetings may be called by the president or by 2/3 of the members of the board.\n\n[http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/32/title32sec13718\\.html](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/32/title32sec13718.html)\n\nIn example two, the statute says specifically that the president's term lasts for exactly one year starting with the date of election.\n\nWhat I am seeing is, for example, with example two, they forgot to elect a president last year and yet the minutes all say that the \"president\" \"called\" the meetings last year. Does that make those meetings invalid? In one of those meetings, two thirds of the members were not even present. \n\nAnother question I have is, \"what about the meeting where officers are elected?\" The statute says \"additional meetings\" may be called by the president or 2/3, but is silent on the first meeting.\n\nHow do you interpret these \"convening\" clauses? I can't imagine they're meaningless. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Section 13716 is a textbook case of ambiguous drafting. Subsection 1\n\n> The board shall elect from its members a president and other officers\n>  as it considers appropriate and necessary to conduct its business.\n\ncan be read as *requiring* the board to elect a president, and *allowing* it to also elect other officers in case the board finds it appropriate and necessary. Or, it can be read as requiring them to elect both a president and other officers, at least as long as the board considers it necessary, though a board can certainly operate without a president. That is, \"as it considers appropriate...\" can have scope over everything that precedes i.e. (president and other officers) or just the immediately preceding conjunct (other officers). The ambiguity becomes relevant since one reading sanctions the possibility of a board without a president (when you make a mistake, like forgetting to overtly elect a president, then it's necessary to scramble for a legal foundation. I'm not approving, just pointing out that they are not technically required to elect a president).\n\nThe one required annual meeting need not be called at all. The additional meetings (which are \"called\") would need to be called by the president or 2/3 of the board. From what I can tell, there is no way to know who called (convened) the additional meetings. Reading some of the minutes, note that they start with a report of the \"call to order\". Calling a meeting to order is different from calling a meeting. The latter happens before the meeting and causes the meeting to come about; the former defines the start of the meeting. The minutes do not reflect who called the meeting (convened the meeting).\n\nThe website\\-available minutes do not indicate that a president was elected in the January 2015 meeting. Those minutes could be in error. Or, it could be that they failed to overtly do so (that is, it was understood that the president would keep his office for another term, though not formally voted on). That would be legally sketchy, but the actions of a regulatory body would not be cast aside because of a small procedural error. The empowering statute does not give any significant powers to the president (e.g. the president does not have veto power, unlike POTUS). The board has the power to elect a president and continued for a year to treat the person as \"the president\", apparently without protest. If the matter were taken to court, the issue would be whether the procedural error was so grave that all of the actions of the board for the year would have to be thrown out, and I just don't see what that grave injustice would be (then again, other details might come out in court).",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A state statutory board failed to formally elect a president at its annual meeting, but continued to operate for a year with the previous president acting in that role. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) All actions taken by the board during that year are automatically null and void due to the procedural error.\n\nB) The board's actions remain valid, as the continued treatment of the person as president implies tacit re-election.\n\nC) Only decisions made in meetings called by the \"president\" during that year could potentially be challenged in court.\n\nD) The board operated illegally, but a court would likely uphold its actions unless a grave injustice can be demonstrated.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option A is too extreme, as minor procedural errors don't typically invalidate all actions of a regulatory body. Option B overstates the legal weight of implied consent in this context. Option C is partially true but oversimplifies the issue by focusing only on meeting calls. Option D best captures the nuanced legal reality: while the board did err in not formally electing a president, courts are generally reluctant to overturn a regulatory body's actions for minor procedural mistakes unless there's evidence of significant harm or injustice resulting from the error. This answer acknowledges the illegality while also recognizing the practical approach courts often take in such situations."

For example, a bank will send letters and multiple emails. Most websites send a single email (which you cannot opt out of). Some will send an email which you can unsubscribe from.\n\nFor context, my University sent a \"Welcome back\" to the new term email, from a mailing address which you can unsubscribe from. About halfway down the email was the statement \"We've made some updates to our student Code of Discipline and have added a policy on sexual misconduct\".\n\nAside from the (questionable) contents of this new policy, has my University does everything required of it for me to be aware of this new policy?

This makes sense to me because usually someone going to court has tried (and failed) to resolve the dispute with the other party.\n\nFor example my ex\\-landlord owes me my damage deposit. He said he won't give it back because a hallway was left messy. I disagree with this because 1\\) the hall way was shared 2\\) the landlord never mentioned this during the inspection 3\\) cleaning the hallway can't possibly be worth the entire damage deposit.

He will surely do so if he reasons that that evidence favors his legal position.\n\nApropos of [your reply](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42143/when-going-to-court-should-a-plaintiff-preemptively-refute-the-other-sides-defen#comment78388_42143), the landlord will protest alleging that your evidence omits material facts, at which point the court will either (1\\) order you to submit the full string of emails, or (2\\) make you choose between producing the full string of emails or your entire waiver of that evidence.\n\n> should evidence be submitted if the claim is not yet being disputed?

If leaving your room clean is undisputed and plays no role in the landlord's failure to reimburse you, mentioning it is not going to earn you any points in court.

What legal remedies are there in such a situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The details depend on the state, of course. The common law thing you are looking for is a writ of mandamus \\-\\- a court order to a public official to do something (or not do something) that they are required to do under the law. Writs of mandamus were traditionally only applicable to *ministerial* tasks (i.e. things that are basically paper\\-shuffling where there is little to no discretion); marriage licenses are typically considered ministerial. With discretionary actions, things are much more complicated because the government official is *supposed* to have significant ability to decide what should and shouldn't be allowed; mandamus doesn't apply unless there's a *right* to the action requested. In some cases, mandamus has been replaced with other forms of judicial review, but in Alabama it is definitely still mandamus that's involved ([source](http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/civpro/2015/03/alabama-supreme-court-issues-writ-of-mandamus-enjoins-probate-judges-from-issuing-marriage-licenses-.html): mandamus is what's previously been used to *stop* issuance of licenses).\n\nFor *federal* review, which is more likely to get somewhere, the approach to use is the exact same thing that led to *DeBoer* (the case bundled into *Obergefell* that was about granting licenses), and *Perry*, and many of the other gay marriage cases: a lawsuit seeking an injunction or declaratory relief under 42 USC 1983, which allows actions in law and equity whenever anyone denies civil rights to a US citizen (or someone in the jurisdiction of the US) under color of law.\n\nThe ultimate result of this kind of suit is a federal court order to issue a marriage license, or a declaration that it's illegal to not issue the license (and so anyone who doesn't will be subject to a court order).

Instead, there is a multi\\-factor list of relevant considerations which a court weighs, with on one factor being necessarily decisive, in making that determination.\n\nBest practices, and the best evidence you could have at a trial, would be for the single\\-member company to use its own card (perhaps a debit card, which is easier to obtain) to make purchases.\n\nMaintaining a proper accounting while using a personal credit card, ideally with a written agreement between the LLC and its sole member, spelling out the arrangement, is not as good as the company having its own card, but is much, much better than using a personal credit card without making any formal pre\\-dispute accounting.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer, Jane, decides to form a single-member Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC) for her legal practice. To save time and effort, she continues using her personal credit card for all business expenses, including office supplies and client-related costs. Which of the following statements best describes the potential risks and best practices in this situation?\n\nA) As long as Jane maintains proper accounting records, using her personal credit card poses no risk to the liability protection offered by the PLLC.\n\nB) Jane should immediately cease using her personal credit card for business expenses, as this practice will automatically pierce the corporate veil.\n\nC) Jane's practice is not ideal, but she can mitigate risks by creating a written agreement between herself and the PLLC regarding the use of her personal credit card for business expenses, while maintaining strict accounting records.\n\nD) The use of a personal credit card for PLLC expenses is irrelevant to liability protection, as long as Jane files separate tax returns for the PLLC.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best answer because it acknowledges that using a personal credit card for business expenses is not ideal, but also provides a practical solution to mitigate risks. Creating a written agreement between Jane and her PLLC, coupled with maintaining strict accounting records, can help demonstrate a clear separation between personal and business finances. This practice, while not as strong as using a separate business card, can provide some protection against piercing the corporate veil.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply maintaining proper accounting, while important, may not be sufficient to fully protect against the risk of piercing the corporate veil when using a personal credit card for business expenses.\n\nOption B is too extreme. While using a personal credit card for business expenses is not best practice, it does not automatically pierce the corporate veil. Courts consider multiple factors when making such determinations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while separate tax filings are important, they are not the only consideration in maintaining liability protection. The use of personal financial instruments for business purposes can indeed be relevant in determining whether to pierce the corporate veil."

As far as I know many countries let you stay in their borders for 6 months if you arent a citizen. What can happen if a country decides not to allow return to a large amount of citizens like this, which measures can be taken against citizens in the foreign country with a decision like this? Would they acquire a status of refugee or something or would they be considered criminals?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A question like that is impossible to answer in general, but your question includes some incorrect assumptions.\n\n* Many countries try to prevent visitors to become *de\\-facto* residents through repeated visits. For instance, the Schengen area limits visitors on short\\-stay visa to 90 days out of every 180\\-day rolling window, and the UK seems to give their immigration officials more discretion on every re\\-entry.\n* Many countries give political asylum to people who are *persecuted* in their home country. A pandemic, or generally bad living conditions, do not count as *persecution*.\n* Many countries give refugee status to people who have to flee war or disaster in their home country. The default case for these rules is a person who is in danger and wants to travel to a safe country.\n* Then there are rules for *force majeure* when a person in the country is forced to overstay through no fault of their own. How that is handled usually depends on how cooperative the visitor was at securing a timely return or a visa extension.\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, there have been blanket extensions in some countries. As travel re\\-opened, these have run out.\n\nOne of the differences between the last three bullet points is how long the stay is permitted. Political asylum tends to be for the long term, refugee status lasts until the end of the disaster, and a *force majeure* exception might just last a few days.\n\nSo if this is not just a hypothetical question, contact a lawyer or the immigration authorities where you are now.

Which of the following most accurately describes their likely status in Country B?\n\nA) They would automatically be granted refugee status\nB) They would be considered a criminal for overstaying\nC) They would be eligible for political asylum\nD) They may be granted a temporary stay extension due to force majeure\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In situations where a person is forced to overstay in a foreign country due to circumstances beyond their control (such as pandemic-related travel restrictions), many countries have provisions for force majeure. This often results in temporary stay extensions or leniency in immigration enforcement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because refugee status is typically granted to those fleeing war or disaster in their home country, not to those unable to return due to travel restrictions.\n\nOption B is unlikely, as many countries recognized the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and were more lenient with overstays during this period.\n\nOption C is incorrect because political asylum is granted to those facing persecution in their home country, which doesn't apply in this scenario.\n\nOption D best fits the situation described, as it acknowledges the unexpected nature of the pandemic and the potential for countries to make allowances for overstays under these unusual circumstances."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's situation?\n\nA) The security firm must accommodate Bob's use of medical marijuana as it is prescribed for a recognized disability under the ADA.\n\nB) The security firm can legally discriminate against Bob based on his medical marijuana use, even though it's legal in his state.\n\nC) Bob can file a successful lawsuit against the firm if they reject his application based on his medical marijuana use.\n\nD) The security firm must ignore Bob's medical marijuana use as long as he only uses it outside of work hours.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, the correct answer is B. Even though medical marijuana may be legal in Bob's state, it remains illegal under federal law. Private employers, like the security firm, are allowed to treat federal law as enforceable and can legally discriminate based on medical marijuana use. This is supported by the example from Colorado, where employers have been allowed to discriminate based on medical marijuana use despite its legality under state law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while PTSD is a recognized disability under the ADA, the use of medical marijuana is not a protected accommodation due to its federal illegality.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as demonstrated by precedents in states like Colorado, Bob would likely not succeed in a lawsuit against the firm for discrimination based on medical marijuana use.\n\nOption D is incorrect because employers are not required to ignore medical marijuana use, even if it's only used outside of work hours, due to its federal illegality and potential impact on job performance and safety."

Can he forbid the entire movie to be played or can he just be financially compensated?\n\nLet's assume the original owner want's to take your movie down because he is just furious over what you've done.\n\nSo to make this example a more general question, copyrighted material used as an element in a huge project with many other elements. Does it make the entire project illegal then wherever and in which ever scene that object was visible?\n\nI am interested in the U.S. and E.U. laws concerning this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nThat the inclusion of this copyrighted content was accidental really has no bearing. What matters is that it was included. Ther are several possible outcomes.\n\nFirst of all neither you nor anyone else is under any obligation to notify the copyright owner on the character used. If the owner does not become aware of this, there are no consequences.\n\nTe movie maker could redo the scenes where the copyrighted character appears. How much time and expense this would require is highly variable. it is the movie maker's choice whether to do this or not.\n\nThe movie maker could contact the copyright owner and ask for permission to use the character. The owner can say yes on whatever terms s/he pleases, including a flat fee or a royalty agreement, or can say no. This involves the movie maker admitting tyhat the copyright owner's work was used.\n\nThe copyright owner could send a DMCA takedown notice. (see [DMCA counter notice and court action](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53689/dmca-counter-notice-and-court-action)) This is a procedure specific to US law, although some people in other countries use it anyway. Some other countries have a somewhat similar procedure. Thew owner sends a notice to the host. The host may, but need not, honor the notice, by taking down of disabling access to the allegedly infringing content. If the host does not, the host loses legal protection and could be liable for damages if the owner files a copyright suit and wins. The host must notify the user who posted the content. If the user sends a counter notice claiming that the content is not infringing, the host must notify the owner. The owner has 10 days to file suit. If the owner does not do so, the host may restore the content and will still be safe from liability. If the host does not restore the content, the host could be liable to the user if they have a contract requiring the host to post the content. This is normally only relevant if the user is paying the host for hosting services or has some other sort of publishing contract with the host.\n\nIf the content is taken down, a revised, non\\-infringing version could be put back up, or the same version could be put up with permission, if that is obtained.\n\nBoth DMCA notices and counter notices are made under penalty of perjury. But in practice, it is rare, almost unheard of, for anyone to be prosecuted for false statements in notices or counter notices, even in pretty blatant cases. a user or host cannot require law enforcement to prosecute such a case.\n\nThe copyright owner could file a copyright infringement suit. This costs significant time and money for court fees, legal preparation, and lawyers fees, so most owners will not do it unless they think there is a good chance of getting more money than the costs.\n\nIf the owner **wins** a US copyright suit, the owner could get either actual financial damages, or statutory damages, but not both. Statutory damages could be anywhere between $750 and $30,000 per work infringed, as the court thinks just. If the infringement is proved to be \"wilful\" the upper limit is $150,000\\. If the infringer is \"innocent\" (that is proves that s/he has no reason to believe that the act was one of infringement, and that there was no intention to infringe), the lower limit is $200\\. The court has wide discretion on what to award for statutory damages, the law only says that the award should be \"just\".\n\nIn addition to damages, the owner could get an injunction (court order) forbidding further distribution of the infringing work(s). In some cases the winner may get legal fees and expenses from the loser in addition.\n\nA major defense, under US law, is often that the use of the work constituted *fair use*. (see [this law.se answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/67034/17500).) Fair use is a specifically US concept in copyright law. It always depends heavily on the specific facts of the use, and there is not nearly enough information in the question here to even start a fair use analysis. Usually a fair use does not have significant economic impact on the copyright owner.\n\nSome EU and other countries have a somewhat similar, but generally narrower, legal concept known as \"fair dealing\". The Berne Copyright Convention provides for \"exceptions so copyright\". Both fair use and fair dealing are examples of such exceptions.",

If a site had few enough European visitors, the cost of having to filter out everything may far outweigh the drop in traffic. \n\nIt may be to early in the game to know yet, I'm unaware of the finer details of said article but have a generalized understanding of it.\n\nNote: I've tagged with both EU and US because I'm currently located and host my sites in the US.

Article 13 (now Article 17\\) is harmonization of copyright law, which is part of the civil law. (No EU will not go after you.) It is very difficult to go through a civil dispute even in a different member state of the EU. Only in very huge cases are considered international disputes effective. The content of Article 17 is very vague \"effective and proportionate measures\", \"best efforts\" etc. so there is a small chance to be successful. \nHarmonization of copyright laws has to be implemented in the member states of the EU. In other words, if you have no property in the EU, they can not enforce the law on you. I would not consider \" Blocking EU users\" as effective because copyright can be infringed even if a person outside of the EU has unauthorized access to the author's work. From my perspective there are two sides:\n\n1. You have to be in line objectively with Article 17 to not to be held responsible for violation of copyright otherwise it can be enforced in a civil proceeding, but\n2. even if the other party win the case, enforceability is very low if you are resident outside of the EU.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the EU's ability to enforce this law on the website?\n\nA) The EU has full legal authority to enforce Article 17 on any website, regardless of its location or attempts to block EU users.\n\nB) Blocking EU users from accessing the site completely exempts the website from Article 17 compliance.\n\nC) The EU cannot enforce Article 17 on the website if it has no physical presence in the EU, but copyright infringement can still occur even if EU users are blocked.\n\nD) Article 17 only applies to websites that actively market their services to EU users.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because while the EU may have difficulty enforcing Article 17 on a US-based website with no EU presence, copyright infringement can still occur even if EU users are blocked from accessing the site. The law is part of civil proceedings, making international enforcement challenging. However, simply blocking EU users does not guarantee compliance with copyright laws, as unauthorized access to copyrighted material by non-EU users could still constitute infringement."

(I guess the question here may also be on whether or not communication over email falls under \"verbal\" or \"written\" \"contract\" in this context?)\n\nThis condition sounds very fishy to me, as you're legally allowed to do most business transactions without a \"written contract\" otherwise.

The key points are:\n\n1. These instruments can come into force immediately or on a later specified date without requiring active approval from Parliament.\n2. Parliament has a 40-day period to potentially annul the instrument if it wishes.\n3. This process does not involve ratification, which typically implies an active, affirmative action.\n4.

Option C is wrong because the process is not considered a form of ratification at all, passive or otherwise. Option D is incorrect as it describes an active approval process, which is not part of the negative resolution procedure."

The criterion mostly is in terms of user's financial capability to make the payment.\n\nIf the copyright holder files suit and the defendant alleges he cannot afford the payment, the fact\\-finder would need to assess whether(when) the defendant's finances enabled him to pay the fee. In the affirmative, the defendant would be liable to the copyright holder.\n\n> one cannot \u201cafford the small fee\u201d (though it is only USD 5\\.00\\)\n\nThat allegation is most likely to be ruled as frivolous unless the defendant lives in a severely undeveloped economy where USD 5\\.00 entails significant purchase power.

The author is just friendly about \\[needlessly] justifying the fee he requires. But that friendliness ought not to be construed as a loophole, since the contractual intent is very explicit: A fee of 5 USD in exchange for continued use of the font.\n\nNor is the author's disappearance (?) a valid argument for eluding payment. The author provided a commonplace method (PayPal) for registering the usage of the font.\n\nEven if by *disappearance* you mean that the author is dead, the copyright holder (or beneficiary) would prevail.

The developer is likely infringing copyright and in breach of contract, despite their arguments. The documentation clearly states that users are required to register the font after a \"reasonable\" evaluation period if they continue to use it. The author's disappearance or difficulty in payment does not negate this requirement. The $5 fee is explicitly stated and considered small, making the argument of affordability weak in most circumstances. Additionally, copyright protection typically extends 70 years after the author's death, so the copyright is still in effect even if the author is unavailable. The developer's arguments about difficulty in payment or contacting the copyright holder are not sufficient grounds for continuous free usage without risk of legal consequences."

At present, all are owner\\-occupied and the Community of Apartment Owners (*Wohnungseigent\u00fcmergemeinschaft*) has three members Asani, Bahar, and Camille, with equal power. Units B and C are on the market and are bought by Diya, who decides to rent them out. Now Asani finds himself having a minority in the Community of Apartment Owners and, as an owner\\-occupier, having other needs and interests than Diya, but Diya can possibly push through or block any decisions taken by majority vote (depending on the specifics in the declaration of division (*Teilungserkl\u00e4rung*), a person owning two units may have either one or two votes). This situation is not desirable for Asani.\n\nIs it legally possible in Bavaria, Germany, to enact a rule that restricts the rights of owners to rent out their property long\\-term? For example, could it contain\n\n* a rule that every owner must live in their property, or\n* that the majority of homes must be owner\\-occupied, or\n* that new rentals are not allowed, or\n* that everyone who owns a property in the building must also live in the building, or\n* something similar?\n\nSuch a rule would need to be changeable only by unanimous consent, otherwise Diya owning two out of three properties could simply abolish the rule, so Asani, Bahar, and Camille would together agree on such a rule (perhaps Asani would pay Bahar and Camille in case they fear the rule might reduce the sale value, but that is separate from the legal question).\n\nI've searched the web about restrictions on renting out, but all I find is either about restrictions on *short\\-term* (holiday) rentals, or about owner\\-occupiers objecting to *specific* prospective tenants. I couldn't find anything about the possibility to restrict long\\-term rentals *in general*. Is there any law that would prevent the rules governing the property as a whole (such as the Declaration of Division (*Teilungserkl\u00e4rung*) or the Community Ordinance (*Gemeinschaftsordnung*)) from containing such a restriction?\n\nI am primarily interested in the situation in Bavaria, Germany, but for context it's also interesting to know the situation elsewhere.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, you can put *pretty much anything* you like into the co\\-op statutes.\nYou are actually interested in whether it *makes a difference*, though, whether the sheriff will come enforce a court order if it came to a trial.\n\n> * a rule that every owner must live in their property, or\n> * that everyone who owns a property in the building must also live in the building, or\n\nBy virtue of indirect effect of basic rights (*mittelbarer Wirkung von Grundrechten*) a court will never issue an order mandating Diya to live in her apartment, Art.\u00a011\u00a0GG.\nThe sheriff will not forcefully \u201cshove\u201d her into her apartment:\n\u201cYou *must* live here now!\u201d\n\n> * that the majority of homes must be owner\\-occupied, or\n\nSimilar, but Art. 2\u00a0I\u00a0GG.\nVacancy of apartments is legal in Germany.\n\n> * that new rentals are not allowed, or\n\nAs soon as Diya is recorded in the *Wohnungsgrundbuch* (apartment register) as the new owner of units B and C, she incontestably assumes the *role* of owner about said units.\nIf she rents them out despite the co\\-op statutes forbidding so, she does nothing illegal (that means breaking *state*/*federal* *law*).\nAfter all she *is* indeed the owner, so there is no fraud involved, \u00a7\u00a0263\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB.\n\nThe fact that she agreed to *not* rent out is a matter between Diya and the co\\-op.\n*No court* will evict the new tenants from units B and C, because Diya has breached *her* obligations.\n\nHowever, it *might* be a just cause to oust Diya from the co\\-op, \u00a7\u00a017\u00a0WEG.\nYet still it requires *severe* grounds as it *essentially* means exercising eminent domain, Art. 14\u00a0\u2162\u00a0GG.\nI tentatively claim it won\u2019t work out as long as Diya pays her share in maintenance and the tenants chosen by Diya are well\\-behaved.\n\n> * something similar?\n\nYou will need something that produces *evidence*.\n\u201cDiya does not live in unit B\u201d is a claim that needs corroboration in court.\n\n> \\[\u2026] restrict long\\-term rentals *in general*. \\[\u2026]\n\nTenancy agreements are by default unlimited in time.\nShort\\-term rents are sort of \u201cforbidden\u201d except if *justified* by one of the reasons named in \u00a7\u00a0575\u00a0\u2160\u00a0BGB.\nHence restricting long\\-term rentals borders on a blanket\\-ban on *all* rentals.",

He believes he is right, and so do we.\n\nThere wasn't anyone near by, so no witnesses.\n\nHow do I \"get justice\"?\nWhat are my options?\n\nEdit: The man was lying clearly... I went and saw him, I'm pretty sure the cops know as well... But, because there were no witnesses, little could be done. he was so bad at covering up his lies, if his son hadn't come, he might even had confessed.\nAlso the court costs more than fixing the car...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as the law is concerned, there are two kinds of \"justice\" at stake here. One would be legally punishing a wrong\\-doer, and the other would be compensating the victim for their losses. Regarding the former, if the act is sufficiently wrongful (in the judgment of the police / prosecutor) and the evidence of guilt is clear enough, the wrong\\-doer might be punished, either given a ticket, or prosecuted in the event of a serious enough wrong. That seems clearly impossible.\n\nCompensation for loss can come from two sources. One is the victim's own insurance. This assumes that the victim has comprehensive coverage on the vehicle (as opposed to just liability). If there is such coverage, the insurance company is obligated to pay for the lass (subject to whatever limits there are by law and under the policy).\n\nIf there is no comprehensive coverage, then the compensation has to come from the wrong\\-doer, who we assume has liability insurance but might not. The insurance company basically indemnifies the wrong\\-doer against his losses due to liability. They might have a lower bar for paying victims without hassle (avoiding the expense of a lawsuit). Let us assume that the wrong\\-doer has no insurance, which means that the matter has to go to court.\n\nWhat then has to be established is who is at fault. That will be decided by an objective third party, either a judge or a jury, who will evaluate the evidence. It then comes down to determining which story is more plausible, given the evidence. Non\\-party eye\\-witness is apparently not available, and it is unlikely that circumstantial evidence would show anything, assuming there is no intersection camera. So the fact\\-finder would have to judge the testimony of the two parties to decide who is more believable. If it is clear that the other person is lying, then you (your father) could present the evidence that makes it clear about the lie. There is some difference between jurisdictions regarding how convincing the evidence of wrong\\-doing has to be. In addition, states differ regarding comparative liability: the amount of any award might be related to the degree of fault of the two parties (e.g. under the circumstances, could your father have avoided the accident even if he had a green light). Being at all at fault is bad for the victim in a pure contributory negligence state (Alabama, DC, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia). At the other end is pure comparative fault, which says that even if a person is mostly at fault, they can recover a portion of their loss (the part that they are not responsible for). Most states are somewhere in the middle.\n\nSmall claims court is the cheapest way to sue a person for property damage, assuming no injury. There is no free way to sue a person.",

To clarify, I mean the cases in which there is strong, direct, irrefutable evidence forgery/coersion did occur.\n\nI'm interested in examples of different approaches, especially in common\\-law and vs civil\\-law legal systems.\n\nNotes: \n\n* The will being set aside is not really a sanction... like the failure to get the loot from a bank robbery is not a sanction. I'm talking about what happens to someone who's commited such acts and has been discovered/proven to have done so.\n* The UK, the US, France or Germany are particularly interesting.\n* A [related question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16013) is more general w.r.t. the legal ramifications of forgery; more specific w.r.t. the kind of forgery; and does not assume the forgery can be established in court.

The act treats all false documents equally, regardless of whether they are wills or other types of documents. The same penalty applies to using a false document, possessing a false document, or having materials designed for making false documents. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not reflect the actual maximum sentence specified in the legislation."

Doesn\u2019t this imply that the amendment only pertains to the military or collective militias?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. The intent of the draft was to protect those who objected to bearing arms for religious/moral reasons from being forced by the government to bear arms against their will (essentially making any draft that didn't have consciencious objector allowance from being Constitutional). The line was removed at drafting because it was redundant: The First Amendment protects the free exercise of religion and barrs the government from declaring religious tennents illegal without a very compelling government interest... the government making war was not compelling enough of an interest to force religious pacifists to take up arms for the government... better that the U.S. should suffer military defeat than violate the beliefs in individual liberty.\n\nIt does not imply that the 2nd amendment was intended for military purposes, but rather for self\\-defense purposes (at the time, militia meant the able bodied men of a community who could muster to defend from attackers. While we think of the \"Wild West\" in terms of the Modern West of the U.S., in 1789 when the Bill of Rights was being drafted, the \"Wild West\" were the western most parts of the states that we today think of as the \"East Coast\" the French and Spain/Mexico and the British controlled much of what is West of the Appalachian Mountains today. The \"wild west\" was closer to home than we tend to think of it and people did live far enough into the wilderness that the \"community\" that could form the militia might just be the patriarch of the homestead. It was so important that not only did the founders think to make sure that the right to weapons was essential, not only did they draft this having just exited a sucessful war where their troops were just that and an armed rebellion that was even fresher in their mind, the match that ignited the powder keg of the Revolutionary war was the British attempting to sieze weapons from Lexington and Concord that the people in those towns needed for survival. The \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" was shot over the right of the colonists to keep and bear arms and the founders were well aware of what they were fighting for.\n\nTo further validate the individual right to the people, President Thomas Jefferson, who had a hand in writing the Bill of Rights, when asked about if this allowed a merchant to place cannons on his ship, responded with essentially \"That's the reason I wrote the Amendment in the First Place.\"",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The Second Amendment's original draft included a clause about conscientious objectors. What does this reveal about the Founders' intentions regarding the right to bear arms?\n\nA) It proves that the Second Amendment was solely intended for military purposes and not individual rights.\n\nB) It demonstrates that the Founders prioritized religious freedom over the right to bear arms.\n\nC) It shows that the Second Amendment was primarily designed to protect state militias rather than individual gun ownership.\n\nD) It indicates that the Founders considered both collective and individual rights in drafting the Amendment, but ultimately prioritized individual rights to bear arms for self-defense.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex historical context and intentions behind the Second Amendment. Option A is incorrect because the conscientious objector clause doesn't negate individual rights; it actually reinforces them by protecting individual religious beliefs. Option B is partially true but oversimplifies the issue; religious freedom was important, but not necessarily prioritized over gun rights. Option C misinterprets the militia aspect; while militias were mentioned, they weren't the sole focus. \n\nOption D is correct because it acknowledges the multifaceted nature of the Founders' considerations. The conscientious objector clause shows they were thinking about both collective (military service) and individual (religious freedom) rights. However, its removal, coupled with other historical context (such as Jefferson's comments about merchant ships with cannons), indicates that individual rights to bear arms for self-defense was ultimately prioritized in the final version of the Amendment."

At least according to [this site](http://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2012/09/14/some_clauses_in_apartment_leases_arent_legal.html), in Toronto you can't disallow pets.\n\nI started thinking of it and its actually a little absurd. Trying to apply the same reasoning to other things. Like disallowing musicians, when really you just don't want noise to bother other tenants. Disallowing frat students because you think they ruin your apartment and bother neighbors. Disallowing X because you believe it will cause Y instead of just disallowing Y.\n\nThey are not perfect analogies, but I think the main reason people disallow pets is for damages, and maybe noise. Isn't this discrimination against pet owners?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not all discrimination is illegal. For instance, landlords discriminate against those who can't afford to pay the rent. They might discriminate against former tenants who destroyed several walls during their lease period. They discriminate against those with bad credit, and often might discriminate against the unemployed. Landlords often *do* discriminate against frat students/college students in general.\n\nIn fact, at least in the US, discrimination is generally *allowed* unless it's discrimination for one of a few specifically prohibited reasons (such as race). A lease is a negotiation on both sides; it requires *both* the landlord and the tenant to be satisfied with each other.\n\nAs for why different places have different laws: Toronto is not actually in the United States. That means it has different people, a different culture, different primary values, and a different legal tradition. It's not surprising that laws are different; if laws were the same everywhere, the world would be a boring place indeed.",

According to the documentation, discrimination in housing rentals is generally allowed in the United States unless it's based on specifically prohibited reasons (such as race).

I have worked very hard in school and have a strong research background with many published math papers, so it is looking like I will be able to get into a top 10/20 math Ph.D. program. On the other hand, I recently took a practice LSAT test \"for fun\" as I am also interested in law, and I got a 170, so if I studied I could probably do better.\n\nFrom what I have read, with an LSAT score in the 170s, a decent GPA, and a background in rigorous high\\-level research, I should have a decent shot at some of the top law schools. That said, I have heard in some circles that it is hard to get a job as a lawyer (I am most interested in corporate law), and if I decide to go to law school instead of a math Ph.D., I want to be sure that it is not a dead\\-end career choice where I would be relegated to doing horrible work with poor pay until my 50's when I get promoted to a more senior role.\n\nI am wondering if anyone here could say if it is worth going into law, particularly when coming from a good law school (and assuming I have a real interest in the subject and enjoy research, etc.). Is it true that the profession is contracting, and that it could be hard to find a decent job? Is there decent upward mobility in the profession, or should one expect a sub\\-60\\-70k salary for many many years after school? Is there anyone here that thinks not going into law (ie pursing a Ph.D. instead) is a better choice?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I am wondering if anyone here could say if it is worth going into law,\n> particularly when coming from a good law school (and assuming I have a\n> real interest in the subject and enjoy research, etc.).

Is there anyone here that thinks not going into law (ie\n> pursing a Ph.D. instead) is a better choice?\n\nI went into a top law school (the University of Michigan, ranked \\#8 when I matriculated, graduated in the top 25%, *cum laude*, with an editorship of a law journal under my belt) with almost the same academic background (undergraduate math major) and a similar LSAT score to you.\n\nIt was a somewhat easier choice for me. I was a solid A\\- math student, but didn't have the chops and talent to pursue a PhD in math and make an academic career out of it, even though I was something of a math prodigy. I also didn't have the passion for it. I saw that I was spending my free time focused on the humanities, social sciences and campus politics and journalism, rather than on math (although tutoring and grading paid my way for all of my personal and living expenses).\n\nA legal job definitely provides a secure lifetime of decent employment, can be intellectually challenging in some subfields (other kinds of practices not so much), and provides a certain amount of interpersonal interaction and immediate, easily understood relevance that you can't secure as an academic mathematician.\n\nIt isn't that hard to find a decent job for a graduate of a top law school, and the profession is not meaningfully contracting. Indeed, almost no occupation has been less impacted economically by the pandemic. Post\\-law school compensation is bimodal. A minority (maybe 30\\-40%) start at large law firms (sometimes after a judicial clerkship) and make very good money (low 100s) right off the bat. The rest get decent middle class jobs at first. Most, from both routes, end up eventually self\\-employed in small and medium sized law firms, although a lucky few (maybe 5%\\-10%) end up as partners in big law firms and a similar share end up as senior civil servants.\n\nThe problem is that the instincts you learn getting as far into math as you have are not very advantageous to a Big Law career, which places a huge premium on social skills, upper middle class to upper class social capital, and hard work as what amounts to being a super\\-bureaucrat at relatively menial details for long uncreative hours that are only dimly connected to results. A lawyer needs to be smart, but being a \"genius\" intellectually doesn't provide much marginal benefit. Most economically successful lawyers have quite narrow and specialized practices that present fewer intellectual challenges as you mass produce the same kind of work over and over, and lawyers derive a lot of their income from their capacity to market their services effectively to the affluent and the powerful. Also, a lot of your compensation in law is basically for your marketing, for taking on highly stressful responsibility, and for dealing with very unpleasant situations. It often isn't the most enjoyable life style unless you have a very particular type A, competitive, extraverted personality who understands people extremely well but isn't academically oriented.\n\nCorporate law, in particular, values your interpersonal skills very highly and doesn't place much of a premium on your intellectual legal knowledge and research ability. Those things are factors of production in corporate law but they aren't what leads to success there and are often pawned off on junior associates who never have a shot at making partner.\n\nI could have done better economically (I basically took what amounted to a mommy track for various reasons), but didn't understand the profession, or what the work involved, or what was critical to get ahead at the time and in my early career and had other priorities and a set of values and world views ill suited to the work.\n\nIf I was doing it all over again, I would have chosen a quantitative heavy but non\\-math PhD path (maybe Economics or physics or operations research or statistics) or would have become an actuary, rather than becoming a lawyer. I love knowing the things that I know because I went to law school (which I loved) and because I've have an incredibly diverse (although not terribly well paying) legal practice for 25 years. I was a professor (in a gradate estate planning program for financial planners) for a while, and it was the best job I've ever had and I still enjoy teaching a lot. I also spend lots of time in math related hobbies to exercise and enjoy math related talent that I have but can't use very often at work.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, with publications already and an acceptance in a top graduate math PhD program, I would definitely take that path. It is a field within academia with a healthy trend line of stability or growth within academia, and being a professor (which you have a viable shot at doing) is a wonderful way to live. There are fewer job seekers per open position for PhDs in math than in most academic disciplines. I've never met a math prof whose regretted his choice (and I know many, having grown up all my life as a child of a professor and a college administrator in a small college down and having been a math major).",
