Or is a certificate of citizenship sufficient?\n\nLegally, your right to work is not contingent on this and there is no Europe\\-wide rule that makes holding any document mandatory. Importantly, if you do start working anyway, you are not committing a crime and cannot possibly be banned or forced to leave the country. You do have the right to work from the day you became an EU citizen and if any doubt arises down the line, you should be able to clear it up later.\n\nIn practice, employers are sometimes supposed to check you are allowed to work (and for that would require some proof of your citizenship) but they don't necessarily need a passport or ID. What's typical on the other hand is that you have to provide an official proof of address (in the countries where you have to register your address with the authorities) and the local social security, insurance, or national tax number. Both of these will require dealing with the authorities and will be considerably more difficult, if not downright impossible, without a national ID card or passport (in fact it can even be difficult *with* a passport).\n\nI worked in multiple EU countries and I don't recall always having to present my ID to employers. I recall at least one instance (in Germany) where I could start working without one (it had just been stolen) and another one (in the Netherlands) where I started on the day after I arrived, without official address nor tax number (BSN). In both cases, I was expected to solve these issues within the first month and you risk a fine if you don't register within a week or two but it was neither illegal nor impossible to start working before all the formalities were completed.\n\nNone of this means I would be completely comfortable about being *months* without a passport. But the main issue for you will be entering the country and what your employer's HR department is prepared to tolerate, not any sort of legal obligation to hold a passport to work.\n\n*Note that in one of the cases I described above I went to the local consulate to get an emergency passport. It wouldn't have been possible back in my country of citizenship but there are some special procedures when you reside abroad. These rules change all the time and depend on your country of citizenship but that could be worth a try.*", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An EU citizen is planning to start work in another EU country in August, but does not yet have an EU passport or ID card.

The property manager at the time replied via email, saying she would get back to me shortly. (Note that I'm not sure of her official title, but all communications with the management company was through this employee.) \n\nAfter 2 weeks of no response, I emailed again. An unknown amount of time after that email, I called in and reached the property manager directly. She then said casually that yes, they already agreed to let me continue with the same rent.\n\n**Current situation**\n\nFast\\-forward to April 2018, where I receive notices at my apartment door that management has changed, and the employee mentioned above no longer works with the company. Another notice is later posted, saying I owe backdated rent from January. I reached out via phone and leaving voicemails, and I also send emails to ask for clarification. \n\nI also contacted the building manager who resides in the same building, and he had told me to not worry as other tenants were receiving the same notices.\n\nFast\\-forward again to May, when I finally receive a phone call from the new staff with the management company, saying I owe the backdated rent due. I forward my email correspondence with the previous employee, and today, I am told over phone that the lack of written documentation means I owe the backdated rent. She also indicates that other tenants have been getting the same notices and phone calls, so this situation is not unique to me.\n\nI then give my 30\\-day notice over email, as requested, and I receive a call back from the same employee, saying the owner will continue honor my rent discount promotion from June onwards, but only if I pay the backdated rent.\n\n**Question**\n\nDo I actually owe this backdated rent? \n\nIt's suspicious that there were no notices for late rent payments until after new staff was brought in. Aren't verbal agreements binding? \n\n(Jurisdiction is US, state of California.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your title doesn't quite match your question. \"Reneging\" would mean saying that a lease would be offered at the reduced rent, and then not offering the lease. Here, they offered the lease, and you accepted. So now the question is not whether they can refuse to offer you the reduced\\-fee lease, but whether they are owed the back rent. \n\nVerbal agreements are indeed binding, but they are rather sticky from an evidential point of view. Also, there are other possible complications. If your original lease stated that verbal agreements are not binding, or that only specific people are authorized to modify the terms and the person you talked to is not such a person, then this is not binding. If after they said you could keep the rent reduction, you signed a lease for the full amount or otherwise indicated acceptance of the full amount, then it may be considered not binding.\n\nEven if the agreement is not binding, you have further arguments. If you believed that it was binding, and did so out of good faith, then there was not a meeting of the minds, and they can't go after you for breach of contract. They may have other claims, such as damages if they can show that they could have gotten more money from another prospective client, but them accepting the rent makes that difficult to pursue.\n\nNow, again, verbal agreements do have evidentiary problems. If your case were nothing than your word claiming that they agreed, you would not have much of a case. But here, you have:\n\n\\-They were willing to take the lower rent for the initial period  \n\n\\-You stated that you would leave unless given a continued discount, and you stayed   \n\n\\-They didn't make any attempt to collect the full rent for three months  \n\n\\-They are willing to give you the discount if you pay the back rent\n\nAll of this points rather strongly towards your claim being true.

You would follow up on complaints to the extent that you have the time, budget and manpower to do so and you would prosecute cases where you believe that you have a reasonable prospect of getting a conviction and where prosecution is, in your opinion, in the public interest. In the real world, that means where the police hand you a brief of evidence that is a lay\\-down [misere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mis%C3%A8re) and (for statutory rape) where there is a real power imbalance between the perpetrator and the victim \\- giving 2 willing 15 year old kids the label of 'sex offender' for life is probably not in the public interest.\n\n> But suppose there were no complaints or smoking guns.

The initial public claim of being 12 years old constitutes such knowledge. Even though the user later claimed to be 18, this doesn't negate the original statement, and administrators are not required to investigate further. Discord's policy clearly states that users under 13 are not allowed, and they will take action against servers that knowingly allow underage users. Additionally, COPPA requires prompt deletion of information from users known to be under 13.

Now they want me to work on something similar to one of my projects.\n\nBefore I started working there, I planned to expand that particular project into a small side business. I might close the open source project as I turn it into a business. My employer does not know of my plans to start a small side business. My side project is not identical to what I would do at work, but it is similar.\n\nMy open source project has nothing to do with their products, so it would not compete against them.

If they see any code you wrote for them show up in your open source project.\n\nThey own the code you write on company time. Even if your code goes into an open source project owned by the company, you still don't own that code. The only way you can own it is if they directly tell you that you may put it into your open source project.\n\n2. If you make your open source project private so nobody else can see the source code, but they see your side business has the same features you wrote for them.\n\nYou can try to get around problem \\#1 by hiding your open source project. But if they see the same features in it that they told you to write for them, they can become suspicious. They might force you to reveal the source to them in court. If you don't want them to see it, they may force you to share it with a third party who is bound by an NDA. The third party can compare your code to theirs and report if you copied any code.\n\n3. Even if your work is not directly related to the company products, your work for them can be a company secret. You reveal that, and you are in trouble.\n\nYou say your work improves internal procedures, but is not directly related the company products. If a company can reduce its cost, it can lower its prices and still make more money than their competition. That gives them a competitive edge over other businesses. By revealing how your employer does its internal work, you give that competitive edge to their competition.\n\nAlthough you say your open source project does not violate rule \\#4 \\- \"does not reveal company secrets\" \\- all three explanations mentioned above say it does.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. Quit and start your own company based on your open source project.\n\nIf you quit, you should do it before you write any code related to your project for your employer.\n\n2. Ask your company to fund your project.\n\nTalk to your boss and anybody else there who might be a stakeholder. Tell them what you can do. Make a deal with them that you get to work on your project during work hours. Maybe they could turn it into an additional source of revenue for the company. That changes you from a potential loss into a valuable asset. Their competitors might end up buying products based on your code. Many companies would love for their competition to pay them.\n\n3. Ask your employer to allow you to turn your work into your open source project.\n\nSome companies require employees who work on open source projects to give their employers a royalty\\-free license to use and modify the work as they wish.\n\n4. Ask your employer if they would use a product based on your project.\n\nYou can start a side business (with your employer's blessing), and turn them into your first customer.

The regulations do not forbid such warnings, and it is considered legally prudent to provide a warning if there's a possibility that a regulated substance can be detected in the product. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the burden is on the business to establish whether a substance is contained in a product, not just for definite cases. \n\nOption B is false because the regulations do not contain provisions forbidding such warnings, and courts would not penalize a business for being overly-cautious. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the state does not inform businesses which of their products contain BPA; the burden is on the business to determine this.\n\nAdditionally, the information about BPA being found in all samples of recycled paper and paperboard suggests that even products seemingly unlikely to contain BPA (like M&M boxes) might actually contain traces of it, further supporting the practice of cautionary labeling."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2146/could-a-prosecutor-hint-the-jury-about-past-dismissed-cases", "docs_id": 2146, "title": "Could a prosecutor hint the jury about past dismissed cases?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In [Can you present a clear record if you do Driver Safety Course in Texas?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2075/can-you-present-a-clear-record-if-you-do-driver-safety-course-in-texas/2145#2145), it was determined that after taking a Driving Safety Course, a record of such action is placed upon one's driving record.\n\nTaking the course in Texas could be for either dismissing a ticket, or for obtaining an insurance discount.\n\nIf one has a jury trial for speeding, and claims to have a spotless driving record (which happens to show the course), would the prosecutor be allowed to contradict such statement, and, either directly or indirectly, inform the jury that the record may or may not be clean?\n\n(Additionally, would the driving record itself has to be shown to the jury?

The slightly harder way is to mail in a check and then try to wring a receipt from the office that took three months to issue a reference number.\n\nOur client tried to make the payment to the court months ago but the court wouldn't accept payment.

(IOLA accounts don't have credit cards associated with them.)\n\nWhat about writing a check on the IOLA account, to make a credit card payment?

In other words, they *are* trust funds subject to fiduciary duty and not ordinary operating accounts.\n\nThe Staff of the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission considered such a possibility in their opinion [TRUST ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: HANDLING CLIENT AND THIRD PARTY FUNDS](https://www.in.gov/courts/discipline/files/trust-account-materials-2012-03.pdf). While not stating outright that such commingling is unethical if there is neither intent to defraud nor recklessness, it gives two reasons why it could cause serious trouble:\n\n> 3. Risks of Lawyer Commingling Client Funds in Lawyer's Personal or Business Account\n\n> > (a) Client funds become available to the lawyer's personal creditors in the event of an attachment of those funds pursuant to proceedings supplementary to execution or otherwise under the Depository Financial Institutions Adverse Claims Act. IC 28\\-9\\-1\\-1, et seq. Even if the identity of the funds is later clarified, the client funds may be frozen for up to ninety (90\\) days by virtue of the automatic hold provision of IC 28\\-9\\-4\\-2\\.\n\n> > (b) Upon bankruptcy, dissolution of marriage or death of the lawyer, client funds may become a part of the lawyer's bankruptcy, marital or probate estate. Once again, there may eventually be a separation of interests in the funds, but in the meantime, client funds will be unavailable to their true owners.\n\n> > (c) ...\\[a scenario involving actual fraud and/or misappropriation]\n\nWhat they are saying is that even if you 100%, really and truly intend to just use your operating account as an \"in and out\" tool with full intention to devote your entire attention to promptly disburse the funds to their proper destination, that five minutes of commingling could coincide with some sort of legal event that would greatly complicate the payment.\n\nFor example, you transfer the client's funds from the escrow account into your firm's operating account at Time\\=0, morally confident that the transfer will be complete at Time\\=5\\. Unbeknownst to you, an earthquake occurs at Time\\=3 in which you are knocked offline and you and your entire firm are killed by falling debris. The contents of your operating account are frozen by your bank and sent to probate. Your client and Walmart hire another attorney to spend the next few months arguing over what your intentions were and why all of that \"operating\" money needs to be paid over to Walmart.\n\nSimilar to the above, you are in the middle of the transfer when a court order is served on your bank to freeze your operating account as part of some investigation into something entirely unrelated to your representation of your current client. Now, you are making your case to the court to unfreeze certain funds while Walmart is still waiting and your client is upset that you messed up something that should have been \"simple\".\n\n### A potential solution:\n\nThe same opinion, in Attachment G, provides:\n\n> Lawyers are permitted to advance filing fees for their clients out of operating funds, see, Ind. Prof. Cond. R. 1\\.8(e). In that event, no trust account questions arise from the use of a debit card that draws funds from an operating account.\n\nThe opinion then seems to indicate that debit cards should not be used, but in this case they are talking about linking cards directly to the escrow account:\n\n> May lawyers use debit cards to pay client funds for filing fees directly out of trust? The answer has two parts. First, current rules appear to prohibit it. Second, even if the rules were not an impediment, many banks refuse to issue debit cards on trust accounts.\n\nThe professional rule [cited above in the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct](https://casetext.com/rule/indiana-court-rules/indiana-rules-of-professional-conduct/client-lawyer-relationship/rule-18-conflict-of-interest-current-clients-specific-rules) provides that lawyers may \"advance court costs and expenses of litigation\". If the payment to Walmart can be considered a court cost or expense, it may be reasonable to pay the amount out of your operating fund and then immediately reimburse it with a client reimbursement from their escrow funds.\n\nThe pay\\-then\\-reimburse model also mitigates the issue mentioned above about intervening causes stopping the transfer. If you have a heart attack right after advancing the funds from your operating account but before filling out the paperwork to reimburse yourself, neither the client nor the other party (Walmart) has been adversely affected.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer is holding client funds in an IOLA (Interest on Lawyer Account) account to pay restitution to Walmart.

This method, known as the pay-then-reimburse model, aligns with professional conduct rules allowing lawyers to advance court costs and expenses of litigation. It avoids commingling client funds with the firm's operating funds, which could lead to complications if unforeseen events occur during the transfer process. This approach also ensures that the client's funds remain protected in the IOLA account until the payment is confirmed, reducing the risk of the funds being affected by potential freezes or legal actions against the firm's operating account.

A brand is an advertising construct which identifies certain goods or services. For example, Microsoft is both a company name and a trademark while Windows is only a trademark.\n\nCompany names are regulated by whomever it is in your jurisdiction who is responsible for this: in Australia this is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). In general, within the same jurisdiction, you cannot have two company names that are the same. So, if you are not registering your company in the UK you should be fine.\n\nTrademark is about protecting brands and ensuring that there is no scope for confusion by the consumer that your goods and services are theirs (and vice\\-versa). Generally, if there is no room for confusion there is no trademark infringement. E.g., if your brand is about software and theirs is about agriculture then this is probably OK.

The law simply requires written notice, and does not require any special form or signature. The misunderstanding by the agency about what 20 days is is common enough (after all, 30\\-20\\=10\\). One possible cause of confusion is over whether the law is stated in terms of tenants giving notice versus landlord receiving notice. The statute is not clear on this, but the above clause says \"given by either party to the other\", not \"received by either party from the other\".\n\nIf it is concluded, somehow (contrary to your attorney's argument) that your notice was not sufficiently timely, one option is to simply pay the next month's rent (at whatever the agreed rate is) and not leave until the end of the next month (giving timely notice early in the month). Under that option, landlord may not re\\-rent or otherwise illegally enter the premise, until the end of the subsequent month. A tenant may physically stay beyond the end of the lease, without paying \u2013 this is known as \"[unlawful detainer](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.12.030)\": under that circumstance, the landlord can take you to court to have you evicted and recover their damages (which would include attorney fees as well as lost rent), so that is not the best course of action). A third option is to abandon the unit. [The law](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.230) provides\n\n> If the tenant defaults in the payment of rent and reasonably indicates\n>  by words or actions the intention not to resume tenancy, the tenant\n>  shall be liable for the following for such abandonment: PROVIDED, That\n>  upon learning of such abandonment of the premises the landlord shall\n>  make a reasonable effort to mitigate the damages resulting from such\n>  abandonment\n\nThe liability clause says:\n\n> When the tenancy is month\\-to\\-month, the tenant shall be liable for the\n>  rent for the thirty days following either the date the landlord learns\n>  of the abandonment, or the date the next regular rental payment would\n>  have become due, whichever first occurs.\n\nThere is a problem with \"the date the landlord learns of the abandonment\": when (or what) exactly is \"the abandonment\", and does \"learning of the abandonment\" have to follow \"the abandonment\"? It may be tempting to think that signalling the intent to abandon starts the clock, but [Washington case law](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1215159/moore-v-northwest-fabricators-inc/) states that \"Abandonment, as applied to leases, involves an absolute relinquishment of premises by a tenant, consisting of act or omission and an intent to abandon\", citing NJ [precedent](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3577143/schnitzer-v-lanzara/). There does not appear to be any case law clarifying the meaning of \"learning of the abandonment\": it would probably require expensive litigation to establish that this means \"learning of the intent to abandon\", so you might as well assume that the abandonment clock starts from when you are really out of the unit. If you leave at the end of the month, indicate an intent to abandon the unit, and do not pay rent, then you will have abandoned the unit, and you will be liable for 1 month rent. However, they law also imposes an obligation to mitigate the damage, which basically means, no double\\-dipping.\n\nLeaving aside unlawful detainer, both the abandonment approach and the \"keep it another month\" approach entail paying another month's rent. In the former case, you have no claim on the unit but they can only ding you for rent for the number of unoccupied days. In the latter case, there is no option to pay less than a month's rent, but you retain full tenant rights (they cannot enter or re\\-rent). In neither case is there an avenue for both keeping the full month's rent from you, *and* re\\-renting the unit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Washington state gives written notice to vacate on April 11th, planning to move out on April 30th.

In this case, the notice given on April 11th may be considered insufficient for April 30th. However, the landlord cannot both charge for the entire month of May and re-rent the apartment immediately. The law requires landlords to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages in case of abandonment. Therefore, the landlord can charge the tenant for May, but must attempt to re-rent the apartment and can only charge the tenant for the days until it is re-rented. This balances the landlord's right to receive rent with the obligation to mitigate damages and prevents double-dipping."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59761/can-states-legally-leave-entire-areas-unrepresented-in-congress", "docs_id": 59761, "title": "Can states legally leave entire areas unrepresented in Congress?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose, for example, that the Utah state legislature decides Salt Lake City shouldn't get US House representation, so they draw the congressional districts such that no district's boundaries include any portion of Salt Lake City.\n\nWould this be legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 14th Amendment says\n\n> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to\n> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\n> State wherein they reside.

You can socialize just fine, to an extent, through applications like Slack, but there's also something to be said for having some in\\-person socialization throughout the day. Therefore shared workspaces and things like that have a solid purpose.\n\nHowever whereas shared workspaces can be expensive, public libraries are free. So assuming someone just needs their laptop to work, and not two huge monitors or anything else like that \\- assuming they can just throw everything in a normal\\-sized laptop bag \\- what's stopping them from using the public library 8 hours a day, 5 days a week indefinitely?\n\n(Just to be clear, I'm not talking about chatting with people throughout the day. It's just the idea of having other people in close proximity, as an ambient aspect, and that sort of thing in general. Occasionally having someone to nod to while walking by and that kind of thing. The thing that's being avoided is being completely alone inside one's apartment all day or something.)\n\nLibraries will often have free wi\\-fi, a free place to charge the laptop, free everything except coffee. And if it's just the occasional person doing this, they probably won't mind. However, especially considering the work\\-from\\-home situation with COVID\\-19, what's stopping these places from being swarmed and overcrowded indefinitely with people of this nature?\n\n***In particular, in a typical US municipality, what legal setup blocks public libraries from being swarmed by people using them indefinitely as free work offices? What are the normal legal limits that allow libraries to get used like this in moderation, while preventing them from getting overrun?***\n\nFWIW, the main reason this has come to my mind is that, for certain reasons, I've been spending a few weeks on the other side of the US from where I live. During this time, I've found working inside the local library to be usually fairly preferable to working inside the hotel/hostel. So much so, that it's tempting to keep doing this once I'm back home next week, and I'm wondering how much is too much, and how that's reflected in a typical legal setup.\n\n---\n\nThis question was suggested as a duplicate: [Legal Doubts Regarding Park Rules](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61107/legal-doubts-regarding-park-rules)\n\nThe important thing here is that I am ***not*** talking about breaking any rules. The second the library tells me to pack up the computer, I will. However no such limit has been imposed for several days, and they've actually acted fairly friendly and accommodating up to this point.\n\nTherefore, *is there anything in the **law** (in a typical setup) that places a major limit on this type of usage?* If it is nothing more than just simply waiting until the library staff say something, then that answers the question. I just want to make sure there's nothing in a typical *legal setup* that places a meaningful limit on this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First point: During the pandemic, most libraries have ceased in person services and only do downloads, pre\\-arranged loans, pick up and drop off.\n\nSecond point: In non\\-pandemic times, typical U.S. municipal library is a somewhat odd mix of young children with parents or nannies, homeless people, remote workers who don't need to talk on the phone much, retirees, and middle school and high school students studying and reading for pleasure (with the studying more common among students whose home situations aren't well suited to studying due to poverty, many siblings or housemates, or noisy family members or neighbors who play instruments). Libraries are usually incentivized to be well occupied as it helps when they seek municipal budget contributions or tax levies.\n\nFWIW, I've used municipal libraries for lengthy research projects as a lawyer now and then, both in times when I've been between offices (e.g. at one point tenant finish wasn't done at my new office but my old lease has expired and I was mostly working from home), and when I need to concentrate and the phone and colleagues interrupting me with innocent reasonable questions that aren't urgent keep interrupting me.\n\nThird point: It is rare in practice for libraries to be overwhelmed with remote workers, in part, because you can't really talk on the phone or attend Zoom meetings, or meet with people. It is also poor for spreading out with a lot of dead tree paper, especially if filing is necessary. Coffee shops which allow for talking and allow food and drink are more popular and commonly used by low volume realtors and lawyers without offices (I used them for meetings when I was a newly admitted solo practitioner), day traders, freelance and novel writers, graduate students, etc. The prohibition on talking and on consuming food and drinks in the library mostly solves the problem. Also, lots of remote workers don't want to work someplace that has little children squealing during story time and lots of homeless people. In my experience, the most common kind of remote workers in municipal libraries are day traders.\n\nIt is much more common for municipal libraries in the U.S. (which are one of the only places you can just be without spending money) to come up with ways to limit homeless people (or to better accommodate them) than to boot them out. Many municipal libraries in urban areas have hired social workers in lieu of security staff to regulate things, place limits on sleeping in the place, and sometimes place a maximum number of hours in place.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHT: Libraries are publicly owned property, and as such, library managers have not only the regulatory authority of a representative of the government, but also all of the rights of a property owner at their disposal legally.

IANAL.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem was that the arresting officer and the investigating officer were two different people. After American airlines misidentified Mr Lowe as the suspect a warrant was issued for an arrest, and it wasn't until about a year later when officers in New Mexico ran his name and found that he had a warrant that they detained him. So their actions were perfectly proper. The length of his detention was primarily because the USA functions as separate legal jurisdictions, so you can be held for some time on a warrant for another state.\n\nPossibly the investigating officer should not have relied on American Airlines identification of the suspect. However, Mr. Lowe would have to overcome the qualified immunity bar to sue the PD.\n\nThe case against the airline is that of negligence: they had no duty to single out Mr. Lowe; they could just have turned over all the data, as requested. Having chosen effectively to carry out their own investigation, the claim is that they owed a common law duty of care to Mr. Lowe to do it competently.

The primary legal basis for Lowe's lawsuit against American Airlines is negligence. The airline was served with a warrant requesting \"any and all recorded travel data for all individuals\" on the flight in question. Instead of providing this comprehensive data, the airline only produced identification for one passenger - Michael Lowe.

As a rule of thumb, your GDPR rights might not apply if their exercise would negatively impact other people.\n\nIn this scenario, you're seeking to delete images from other people's private chats. Requiring Facebook to search their chat messages according to your instructions would likely be a disproportionate invasion into those people's privacy, unless those images are inherently illegal. Even if you were the copyright holder for these images, it would likely be disproportionate to retroactively search the chats and potentially delete images. But you can't be the copyright holder since you didn't create those photos.\n\nAll of this means:\n\n* Facebook will likely refuse to act on your requests.\n* Those other people will likely refuse your requests.\n* A court is unlikely to order Facebook or those other people to perform a search and delete offending images.\n\nYou are claiming that since the images were shared with Facebook that there wouldn't be any expectation of privacy. This is a valid argument in the US (see the [third party doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine)). However, this argument doesn't fly in Europe in the context of the GDPR. Under the GDPR, any processing of personal data requires a legal basis, such as a specific law, the user's consent, or a legitimate interest. Facebook is bound by its privacy policy to keep private chats private. It has no legal basis to search those chats for the purpose of fulfilling your requests, unless you can get a valid court order that compels Facebook.\n\nMost likely, you won't be able to prevent private use of these images, for example your ex shares them in private messages. However, you may have personality rights that prevent wider circulation and publication of these images.

Therefore I'm sure any such research would be monitored one way or another\\-\\-\\- enough said on that.\n\nMy question here is, how is it possible to learn in this direction if my country and many others forbid even the possession of software for \"hacking\" despite intentions? This seems one of the main tools used to learn vulnerabilities and how to defend against them. For ones own security purposes as well as better security for others also and my own software development securities.\n\nWhile I understand the intentions behind such laws being directed at nefarious intentions, what about progress in this direction, what about people who want to enter the field or simply learn for ethical reasons? According to the criminal code of Canada there is no grey area, see first link below.\n\nAn FYI of how I intended to go about learning \"hacking\" ethically. By using my computer to break into my old brick laptop and learning from there. I wouldn't use such software to hack anyone else unethically, just not interested.\n\nReferences:\n\n[https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/understanding\\-canadian\\-cybersecurity\\-laws\\-interpersonal\\-privacy\\-and\\-cybercrime\\-criminal\\-code\\-of\\-canada\\-article\\-4/440337](https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/understanding-canadian-cybersecurity-laws-interpersonal-privacy-and-cybercrime-criminal-code-of-canada-article-4/440337)\n\n[https://devcount.com/is\\-ethical\\-hacking\\-legal/](https://devcount.com/is-ethical-hacking-legal/)\n\n[Criminal Code of Canada](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-1.html)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **...many \\[countries] forbid even the possession of software for \"hacking\" despite intentions**\n\nThat is not the case in the **[united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\")** where accessing a computer, and possessing the tools to do it, are only offences if the activity is **unauthorised**.

The father can not force the mother to abort the pregnancy.\n2. *Ex post facto* agreements of non\\-payment are, in all likelihood, unenforceable.\n3. The father will be obligated to pay child support under the laws of the state with jurisdiction over the paternity.\n\nThe abortion angle won\u2019t work.\n------------------------------\n\nSetting aside commentary regarding the politics or ethics of abortion. I think we can agree it is a highly charged and emotional topic for some people. I point to the fact it always seems to be an issue during Supreme Court nominations and presidential elections.\n\nGiven the explosive nature of the issue of whether abortions should be legal or not (in the case where the mother does *not* want to carry full term) could you imagine how much more dynamite it would add to the debate if the question were whether or not to allow the father to force the mother to terminate the pregnancy **against the mother's wishes**!\n\nOne can only imagine how much more bombastic the abortion debate might then become.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape child support (most likely).\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTo give you a sense of how difficult it is to escape the obligations of child support. Consider the following...\n\n[A Kansas man was ordered to pay child support when he thought he was being a sperm donor only](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/23/justice/kansas-sperm-donation/) and signed numerous agreements with the lesbian couple he thought he was *helping*. In that case, the court justified its ruling on the grounds that a doctor was not involved in the insemination process.\n\nBut nothing prevents future courts from making the same ruling in cases where a doctor *is* involved in the insemination process. Especially if that state either withdraws from the ***The Uniform Parentage Act***, amends it, repeals it, or never adopts it in the first place.\n\nSperm Donors and Child Support:\n\n> Even in cases in which the donor is known, but holds himself out as unknown, some courts have held the donor legally obligated to pay child support.\n\n[Read more here](http://family-law.freeadvice.com/family-law/child_support/artificial_insemination_donor_obligation.htm).\n\n*Ex post facto* agreements are problematic.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNow that you've edited the question, the above link is even more useful for providing a possible avenue to try (albeit unlikely to work): a ***non\\-payment agreement***. The discussion in that link describes that even if you could somehow convince the mother to go along with it, it is unlikely (though not impossible) to be enforced by the courts. It depends on the facts (e.g., intercourse vs. *in vitro*), circumstances (e.g., relationship vs. no relationship between the parties), timing (e.g., before vs. after the agreement), etc. of the impregnation itself.\n\nNotwithstanding all the above, if you still have questions, you might consider floating an idea of an approach you think you might try (in a separate question) and get reactions to that specific proposal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A unmarried couple conceives a child unintentionally.

I get annoyed when they have the anti racism campaigns in English football when they say that society has to eradicate all forms of discrimination. I think they may mean all forms of unfair discrimination but it still seems ignorant to what discrimination really means.\n\nThere was a landmark case in the Western Cape where a rich wine farm was left in a will to the land owner's nephews. The land owner's 5 daughters sought to have the will deemed invalid because the daughters believed it was discriminated based on gender, because right or wrongly the land owner believed farming was a man's job.\n\nAfter years of litigation the SA courts said that although the sister was indeed discriminated against that it does not invalidate a will. People are free to leave their possession in a will in accordance with any reason they may choose. In effect deeming it fair discrimination. Also noting an inheritance is a gift and nobody has a right to it.\n\nSo in closing, I would like to know if the US system has a similar concept of fair and unfair discrimination. If they even use those words. After all you discriminate against Pepsi everytime you buy Coke.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, what is \"fair\" and \"unfair\" is typically not a legal question, in large part because it is so subjective. There are some exceptions \\-\\- such as in copyright law or competition law \\-\\- but in the discrimination context, we use the lawful/unlawful distinction.\n\nBequeathing a house to your child solely because he is your child, for instance, is not fair but it is lawful. The same is true for giving more to your oldest child simply for being the oldest, or cutting a black relative out of your will: not fair, but lawful. Assuming there's a valid will, a court will rarely make a serious inquiry into the fairness of the decedent's discrimination among beneficiaries.\n\nThe same types of issues come up in contexts that are more routine subjects of discrimination law. In employment, for instance, you might have two employees: a lazy white salesman who's been around for 20 years and a new black woman who does an excellent job answering the phones.\n\nIf you only have enough money to give one raise, giving it to the black woman is both fair and lawful. Giving it to the white guy because he's been around longer is probably not fair but still lawful, while giving it to him strictly because he's white is probably neither fair nor lawful.\n\nThe inutility of the fair/unfair distinction can become especially clear in the affirmative\\-action context, where the question of fairness remains hotly debated.\n\nIf an employer has two equally qualified candidates, would it be fair to require him to choose a black applicant over a white applicant as a means of redressing centuries of discrimination against blacks? What if the black applicant is only marginally less qualified? What if the black applicant is far less qualified? There are many who think each of these would be fair, and there are many who think none of them would be.\n\nIn the end, then, the courts tend only to ask whether discrimination is lawful, which can usually be resolved by applying the facts to the law, leaving questions about what is fair to lawmakers and commentators.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, an employer is considering four equally qualified candidates for a single job opening.

John meets the eligibility criteria as he works for a covered employer (more than 50 employees) and has been employed for at least 12 months. A stroke and its aftermath would likely qualify as a serious health condition under FMLA. The leave is unpaid, but John's job is protected during this period. Option A is incorrect because FMLA does not mandate paid leave. Option B is incorrect because 26 weeks are only applicable for caring for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Option D is incorrect because caring for a parent with a serious health condition is explicitly covered under FMLA."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80642/do-i-need-permission-from-the-media-company-if-i-want-to-write-a-news-article-fr", "docs_id": 80642, "title": "Do I need permission from the media company if I want to write a news article from the same topic, using the original article as the only source?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I want to write an article from a topic and there is an article that I want to use as the only source (I know that's not ideal, but this is just a hypothetical situation).

However, a state can enact an exception, such as Washington's [RCW 4\\.24\\.220](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=4.24.220), which says\n\n> In any civil action brought by reason of any person having been\n> detained on or in the immediate vicinity of the premises of a\n> mercantile establishment for the purpose of investigation or\n> questioning as to the ownership of any merchandise, it shall be a\n> defense of such action that the person was detained in a reasonable\n> manner and for not more than a reasonable time to permit such\n> investigation or questioning by a peace officer or by the owner of the\n> mercantile establishment, his or her authorized employee or agent, and\n> that such peace officer, owner, employee, or agent had reasonable\n> grounds to believe that the person so detained was committing or\n> attempting to commit larceny or shoplifting on such premises of such\n> merchandise. As used in this section, \"reasonable grounds\" shall\n> include, but not be limited to, knowledge that a person has concealed\n> possession of unpurchased merchandise of a mercantile establishment,\n> and a \"reasonable time\" shall mean the time necessary to permit the\n> person detained to make a statement or to refuse to make a statement,\n> and the time necessary to examine employees and records of the\n> mercantile establishment relative to the ownership of the merchandise.\n\nSpeaking of Walmart, [here is a petition](https://www.courts.wa.gov/content/petitions/92468-6%20COA%20Respondents%20Brief.pdf) regarding a lawsuit against Walmart over such an event, where a shopper failed to stop to respond to exit security, resulting in her being physically stopped. A lawsuit (assault, unlawful imprisonment, outrage) ensued. The bottom line was that the shopkeeper's privilege is a valid defense against a lawsuit to the effect that a shopper does not want to comply with a request to prove that they are not stealing goods.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer at Walmart refuses to show their receipt to an employee checking receipts at the exit. The employee briefly detains the customer to verify their purchases. The customer later sues Walmart for unlawful detention. Which of the following is most likely to be true regarding this situation?\n\nA) The Fourth Amendment protects the customer from being searched by Walmart employees\nB) Walmart has no legal right to detain customers for receipt checks without explicit consent\nC) The \"shopkeeper's privilege\" may provide a valid defense for Walmart against the lawsuit\nD) The customer's lawsuit will automatically succeed because there was no membership agreement\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The \"shopkeeper's privilege\" is a legal doctrine that can protect retailers like Walmart when they briefly detain customers on reasonable suspicion of shoplifting. This privilege, codified in laws like Washington's RCW 4.24.220, allows stores to detain customers for a reasonable time to investigate potential theft. It provides a defense against lawsuits arising from such detentions, even without explicit customer consent or a membership agreement. The Fourth Amendment is not relevant here as it only applies to government actions, not private businesses. While the customer may sue, the existence of shopkeeper's privilege laws means their lawsuit won't automatically succeed.

Additionally, the expert suggests that the customer may be entitled to a reimbursement if they can prove they were up-to-date on their payments before the account was closed. The customer could approach the creditor/agency for a reimbursement, and if denied, they could pursue the matter in Small Claims court.

A warrant (I assume you mean arrest warrant) can be issued under court orders, if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed.

A warrant is never automatically issued when a check bounces. For a warrant to be issued, several steps must occur:\n\n1. B must sue A for the amount owed.\n2. B must win the case in court.\n3. A must fail to pay the court-ordered amount.\n4. The court must then order A's arrest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because warrants are not automatically issued for bounced checks. Option B is inaccurate because private citizens don't \"press charges\" - they can report to the police, but it's up to law enforcement to investigate and prosecutors to file charges. Option D is wrong because police don't immediately investigate or issue warrants for bounced checks without evidence of fraudulent intent.\n\nIt's important to note that while check bouncing can be a crime under certain circumstances (e.g., intent to defraud), not all instances of bounced checks lead to criminal charges or warrants.

Gambrinus Company/Spoetzel Brewery*, 116 F.3d 1052 (5th Cir. 1997\\), in which a brewery attempted to exclude a service dog for a tour open to the public, Citing FDA regulations in support of a \"no animals\" policy, and argued that to admit animals would constitute a \"fundamental change\". The Fifth Circuit ruled that the brewery must modify its policy, and awarded damages under a parallel state law.\n\nThis seems to confirm that the \"zoo exception\" is limited to a situation where the animals on display are a \"fundamental\" part of the operation of the facility, as is surely the case with a zoo, but would not be the case in a store as described in the question. \n\nI have not found any case law directly on point.

The owner has a sign stating \"No animals or service dogs permitted due to resident cats.\" A customer with a service dog attempts to enter the store. Under the ADA, what is the correct course of action for the business owner?\n\nA) The owner can legally refuse entry to the service dog due to the presence of the cats, citing the \"zoo exception\" in ADA regulations.\n\nB) The owner must allow the service dog, but can require the customer to keep the dog muzzled and on a short leash at all times.\n\nC) The owner must allow the service dog entry, as the presence of resident cats does not constitute a \"fundamental alteration\" of the business.\n\nD) The owner can refuse entry to the service dog only if they can prove in court that allowing the dog would cause significant financial hardship.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The ADA requires businesses to allow service animals in all areas open to the public, with very limited exceptions. The \"zoo exception\" mentioned in the ADA guidelines is specifically for situations where the animals on display are a fundamental part of the business, such as in a zoo. For a regular store, even with resident cats, the presence of those cats is not considered a \"fundamental alteration\" of the business's nature. Therefore, the business owner must modify their policy to allow service dogs, even if it means temporarily restricting the cats to another area of the store. Options A, B, and D are incorrect interpretations of ADA requirements for this situation."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29349/cyberstalking-and-ratemyprofessors-com", "docs_id": 29349, "title": "Cyberstalking and RateMyProfessors.com", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Imagine this hypothetical scenario:\n\n1.

There is virtually no chance a court will order them to take it down, because it would be almost impossible to do so without violating the First Amendment. \n\nYou would have to prove that forcing a publisher to stop saying that you teach at the university would advance some compelling governmental interest, and that there isn't a better way to advance that interest. \n\nIt's not clear what you mean by \"cyberstalking,\" but if you're talking about someone sending you harassing messages, then the court would probably conclude that the better option would be to punish the harasser, rather than limit the publisher's speech. \n\nYou could try paying them off or sending a threatening legal demand, but I doubt either would go far.

According to the documentation, forcing RMP to remove the professor's information would require a court order. However, it's extremely unlikely that a court would grant such an order because it would likely violate the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The court would need to be convinced that removing the information serves a compelling governmental interest and that there isn't a less restrictive way to achieve that interest. Even in cases of cyberstalking, courts are more likely to favor punishing the harasser rather than limiting the publisher's speech. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they overstate the ease of removing information or misrepresent the legal obligations and authority of the parties involved."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82205/is-the-district-of-columbia-a-state", "docs_id": 82205, "title": "Is the district of columbia a state?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is the District of Columbia a state? Does it operate like a state? Does the District of Columbia have a govenor? Is it special in the way it operates?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The District is not a state, and does not function as one.\n\nThe District does not elect any Senators, nor any Representatives. It does elect one \"Delegate\" who sits in the House, and may speak in debate, but does not have the right to vote.\n\nThe Constitution allows congress to exercise \"Exclusive legislation 8in all cases whatsoever\" over the District. However, since 1973 the Congress has allowed limited \"home rule\" in the district, although it could cancel this at any time by a new law.\n\nThe district has a local government, but it more closely resembles the government of a major city than that of a state. It is led by a Mayor and a city council.\n\nIt is specified in some Federal laws, and one Constutiuonal provision that for certain limited purposes the Districtm should be treated \"as if it were\", a state.\n\nThere have been a number of proposals to make the District into a state. The most recent ones have proposed to do this by redefining the \"Capital District\" into the White House, the Capital building, the Mall between them, buildings adjacent to the mall, and a small adjacent area. The rest of the district would, under such proposals, be admitted as a new state. Congress has the power to admit new states, so this would not require a Constitutional Amendment. But no such proposal has yet passed Congress.\n\nThere are some special provisions in the way the District is Governed. For one thing, to compensate for the many public building and facilities (which pay no taxes) and the special demands on the District of the Federal Government, Congress provides some of the funds needed to run the district, with the rest coming from local taxes. Congress must approve the District Budget, and can veto local laws.\n\nSee [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.#Government_and_politics) for more detail.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the governance of the District of Columbia is FALSE?\n\nA) The District of Columbia elects one non-voting Delegate to the House of Representatives.\nB) Congress has the constitutional authority to exercise exclusive legislation over the District of Columbia.\nC) The District of Columbia has a governor who leads its local government.\nD) Congress must approve the District's budget and can veto local laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is correct.
