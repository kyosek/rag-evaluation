Say country X considers the age of consent 16, recognizes dual citizenship, and has an extradition treaty with the US...\n\nHowever, Alice happened to have been born on a cruise while the cruise ship was sailing through US territorial waters, thus making her a US citizen. She has never done any of the things which can cause someone to officially lose their US citizenship.\n\nFederal law states [it is illegal for a US citizen to have sex with an individual under the age of 18 in a 'foreign place'](http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC02423.html)\n\nI'm wondering what, of any of these scenarios, would be illegal due to the above law and could theoretically lead to either extrication, or to arrest when/if they ever visited the US at some later date (and if one is possible but not the later).\n\n1. Alice never realizing she was born actually born in US waters and never thinking of herself as a US citizen, and she never visited the US or engaged in any of the activities that cause her to lose citizenship\n\nIf the above would not be sufficient would any of the below situations potentially lead to prosecution:\n\n\t* Knew she was also a US citizen and had once claimed some minor right or privileged due to being a US citizen.\n\t* Occasionally visits a friend or relative within the US for brief periods, using her US citizenship to allow easier entry to the US, without going through the steps of the VWP.\n\t* Once stayed in the US with said friend/relative for slightly more then 90 days (beyond the length a regular tourist can stay) many years ago\n\t* Had just spent spent 91 day summer vacation with her family relative before returning to her home country and having sexual relations with Bob.\n2. Alice and Bob both live in and were citizens of X but originally met when both were on a vacation to the US, ultimately having a sexual relationship in their home country.\n\nWould Alice potentially face prosecution, if not would this change if: \n\n\t* The couple had (legally) engaged in sexual activity in the US prior to traveling back home\n\t* The couple originally met in a state where sexual intercourse would have been illegal and so waited until returning home before having a sexual relationship?\n\t* Alice bought bob plan ticket home, so she is officially 'transporting' bob? (section a of the above law applies)\n\t* Alice and bob did have a relationship prior to their visit to the US which continued during their US visit.\n\nI realize that prosecutor discretion would usually result in no one choosing to prosecutor most if not all of the above cases, despite any legal right, but I'm asking rather they could face charges if a prosecutor did choose to move forward for some reason. I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung\\-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...\n\n\\*Edit:\nLooking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed. However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference. For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question? I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.\n\nps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right? That's something I really didn't need to know about. I knew I shouldn't have used that particular law as my example for this...\n\npps. Also the definition of \"any person can be charged with a\n criminal offense\" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Ignorantia juris non excusat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can say I didn't know: it won't keep you out of jail.\n\nRather than delving into the specifics of your question, I will keep my answer general. If you break the law, you break the law. It doesn't matter if:\n\n* you don't know what the law is,\n* you didn't think the law applied to you,\n* you thought what you were doing was in accordance with the law.\n\n**\"Break the law\"** is an objective fact \\- there is no subjectivity involved. The state of mind of the person is, in most jurisdictions, irrelevant; the common law doctrine of *mens rea* or \"the guilty mind\" has almost universally been done away with.\n\nNow specific offences have specific defences. Generally, in underage sex cases genuine ignorance of the age of the person is one such defence. A court may decide that ignorance that the person was underage *under US law* may qualify for this defence.",

        "answer": "Here is a potential exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A US citizen named Alice, who has lived her entire life in a foreign country, engages in a sexual relationship with Bob, who is 17 years old. The age of consent in their country is 16. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential US legal consequences for Alice?\n\nA) Alice cannot be prosecuted under US law because she was unaware of her US citizenship.\n\nB) Alice can only be prosecuted if she knew she was a US citizen and had previously claimed rights or privileges of citizenship.\n\nC) Alice could potentially be prosecuted under US law, regardless of her knowledge of her citizenship status.\n\nD) Alice is exempt from US law in this case because the act was legal in the country where it occurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The principle of \"ignorantia juris non excusat\" (ignorance of the law is no excuse) applies here. As a US citizen, Alice is subject to certain US laws even when outside the country, regardless of her knowledge of her citizenship status or the specific laws. While prosecutorial discretion may make charges unlikely in this scenario, Alice could potentially face legal consequences under US law prohibiting citizens from engaging in sexual acts with minors in foreign countries, even if the act was legal where it occurred. Her lack of awareness of her citizenship or the law does not provide immunity from prosecution."

In Section 1983 suits, many public employees have qualified immunity unless the legal point was already \"well established\" when the alleged violation occurred. Given that the sentencing took place in 1984 and the constitutional issues weren't widely recognized until much later, it would be challenging to overcome this immunity.\n\nOption A is relevant but not necessarily the most significant obstacle, as retroactivity is just one of several issues mentioned. Option B isn't mentioned in the given information and may not be the primary concern given the time that has passed. Option D, while a consideration in Section 1983 claims, isn't highlighted as a major issue in this specific scenario."

Is this legal? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not everything is capable of being copyrighted. According to [Circular 34](http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf) lists are generally not subject to copyright. In addition keep in mind that to be copyright the subject matter has to be one that is result of creative effort, ie [\"...original literary, musical, pictorial, or graphic expression.\"](http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf) I would think that a price list does not fall under that category because a listing of numbers and items is not such an expression.\n\nHowever, keep in mind how easy it is for anybody to file a DCMA take\\-down notice. It looks like Best Buy did so in 2006, to prevent their \"Black Friday\" sales prices from being publicly revealed, as per the Ars Technica article, [Best Buy tries to copyright sales prices](http://arstechnica.com/business/2006/11/8218/).\n\nIn short be prepared for a DCMA take down notice directed at your website.\nBe aware that although sales price lists may not be proper subject of copyright, this does not stop this author of the price list from bringing suit, and perhaps under other theories of recovery other than copyright infringement.

While price lists are generally not subject to copyright protection, as they typically don't meet the criteria for \"original literary, musical, pictorial, or graphic expression,\" the website owner should still be prepared for potential legal challenges. As the documentation mentions, companies have attempted to use DMCA takedown notices to protect their price information (e.g., Best Buy's attempt in 2006).

I spoke with multiple sources including lawyers and can't get a clear answer. The contractor claims they NEVER waive or modify the clause. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A contractor would agree because it basically it comes close to restating the state of the law in the absence of any agreement between the parties.\n\nSo contrary to the answer of ShazamoMorebucks it probably would be enforced. Sometimes contracts that waive liability that would otherwise exist in the absence of an agreement are viewed as objectionable. But, a requirement in a contract that simply places upon a party the liability that they would have in the absence of an agreement is usually enforced.\n\n> The Subcontractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless \\[the\n>  contractor] and the United States Government, and their respective\n>  officers, employees and agents (the \"Indemnities\"), from and against\n>  any and all liabilities, of whatsoever kind or nature, arising out of\n>  or in any way connected with the Subcontractor's performance under\n>  this Agreement, excepting only (i) liability arising from affirmative\n>  acts, done with intent to cause loss, damage or injury, by the\n>  Indemnities; (ii) liability arising from the sole negligence of the\n>  Indemnities; or (iii) any express liability as may be specified\n>  elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\nThe big limiting factor here is that the liability must arise out of or be connected with the Subcontractor's performance under the Agreement.\n\nUsually, if liability arises from the Subcontractor's performance, the Subcontractor would be, at least, jointly and severally liable for the liability in any case, where liability does not arise from the other party's intentional acts, or from the other party's sole negligence.\n\nLiability for defects in goods sold is generally a matter of strict liability. \n\nIf the Subcontractor did defective work, and the general contractor simply purchased that work and did nothing else to contribute to the liability, why should it be on the hook?\n\nThe only case where this may modify the default rule is when both the subcontractor and the general contractor are at fault. For example, maybe the subcontractor made a defective good but the defect was so obvious that the general contractor should have noticed a returned the goods before using them in a larger project. This puts full liability on the subcontractor, even when the general contractor is also negligent.\n\nBut, in practice, the general contractor will still be on the hook for most of the liability that the general contractor is forced to pay, because the subcontractor will generally be almost judgment proof and will go bankrupt before it pays a small portion of the amount that it owes to the general contractor in the event of the subcontractor's fault giving rise to a major liability (e.g. if goods it supplied caused a multi\\-million dollar project to have to be done over from scratch).\n\nAlso, subcontractors routinely can and do insure against this risk and figure the cost of the insurance into their prices. Working on a federal government subcontract can be a source of lots of business, and this is worth it if the primary risks can be insured against and the insurance cost can be recovered in the price charged for the work.",

The indemnity clause largely restates the default legal responsibilities that would apply to the subcontractor even without the clause. In most cases, if liability arises from the subcontractor's performance, they would already be at least jointly and severally liable, except in cases of the other party's intentional acts or sole negligence. The clause mainly formalizes this arrangement and potentially shifts some liability in cases where both parties are at fault. Additionally, subcontractors can typically insure against these risks and factor the cost into their pricing. While the clause may seem broad, it's generally in line with existing legal standards and common practice in government contracting."

Both the harmful and offensive contact varieties of battery require a bad intent: \u00a713 \"An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if (a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact...\", and per \u00a716, \"If an act is done with the intention of inflicting upon another an offensive but not a harmful bodily contact...the actor is liable to the other for a battery although the act was not done with the intention of bringing about the resulting bodily harm\". \u00a718 Battery: Offensive Contact says more or less the same thing with \"offensive\" inserted. Furthermore,\n\n> \u00a718(2\\) An act which is not done with the intention stated in Subsection\n>  (1,a) does not make the actor liable to the other for a mere offensive\n>  contact with the other's person although the act involves an\n>  unresonable risk of inflicting it and, therefore, would be negligent\n>  or reckless if the risk threatened bodily harm.\n\nSo, if A throws a dart at a dartboard while B is right next to it, and hits B in the eye, it would seem that this is not battery, and poor B might be out of luck.\n\nI *think* this would be generic negligence, where \u00a7281 \"The actor is liable for an invasion of an interest of another, if: (a) the interest invaded is protected against unintentional invasion...\". The problem is, the description of the interest in freedom from harmful bodily contact only protects against the interest w.r.t. intentional contact, so where does the protection of that interest come from in terms of *unintentional* contact. Specifically: is there a general rule that every protection against an intentional invasion of interest entails a protection against *unintentional* invasion of that interest? (I assume the \"duty\" is a generic and universal one).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generic negligence. In most United States jurisdictions, Negligence is a tort requiring (1\\) duty, (2\\) breach of that duty, (3\\) but\\-for and proximate causation, and (4\\) harm. In most human interaction, one person has a duty to act as a reasonable person to avoid harming another person. So if you do something a reasonable person would not do, and that causes harm, you can be liable for the resulting harm. The reason for this is that you have the ability to control your activity, and you should be willing to engage in reasonable activities without risking civil liability. Thus it discourages unreasonable behavior if you have to pay for the harm that results from your lack of reasonable care.\n\nBecause negligence requires breach of duty under a reasonable person standard rather than requiring intent, it necessarily creates a sphere of protection around the invasion of interests recognized by intentional torts that also have harm as an element. However, that sphere of protection does not protect against all unintentional invasions, just against those unintentional invasions which are sufficient to support a case for negligence in a given jurisdiction.",

However, there are various ambiguities, occurring most commonly in old code.\n\nI am now facing this particular issue:\nI have a dependency that I have seen to be indicated in the code to be licensed under `L-GPL`. With a fair amount of certainty this can be identified as the [GNU Lesser GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License). However, I cannot find information about the version this refers to.\n\nMy question is what version should I assume, and I can think of several options:\n\n1. The version of the time of creation of the software, namely [LGPL 2\\.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html), or\n2. The version of the time of our use of the software, which practically would allow me to choose today's most recent version, i.e. [LGPL 3\\.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).\n\nTo my understanding the difference between the two is negligible, but the combination of legal and technical context urges me to try to be specific as much as possible.\n\nPlease, excuse me if this question has already been asked in some other form and I haven't been able to identify it with my searches.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since version 3 didn't exist when the software was written, the original author presumably intended that 2\\.1 was used.\n\nHowever, point 13 of LGPL 2\\.1 states (emphasis mine):\n\n> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n>  of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.

What is the most appropriate approach to determining the applicable license version?\n\nA) Assume it's LGPL 2.1, as it was likely the version available when the legacy software was created\nB) Use LGPL 3.0, as it's the most recent version and provides the most up-to-date protections\nC) The developer can choose to use either LGPL 2.1 or LGPL 3.0, as both versions allow this flexibility when no specific version is indicated\nD) Contact the Free Software Foundation for a definitive ruling on which version to use\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When a library licensed under LGPL does not specify a particular version number, both LGPL 2.1 and LGPL 3.0 include provisions that allow the user to choose any version published by the Free Software Foundation. Specifically, LGPL 2.1 states in point 13 that if the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. LGPL 3.0 includes a similar statement. Therefore, the developer has the flexibility to choose either version 2.1 or 3.0 in this scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because although 2.1 might have been the version available when the software was created, the license terms allow for using later versions. Option B is incorrect because while 3.0 is the most recent, it's not mandatory to use it if no version is specified. Option D is unnecessary, as the license terms already provide clear guidance on this situation."

My friend's dad was there to buy the tickets. After that he went back to his car.\n\nWhen we went to go into the theater the guy who collects the tickets asked us our ages. We told him that we are 15, and he said that we needed a parent with us, so we ran back to the car and had my friend's dad come back with us and they said he needed to be in the theater with us. He bought a ticket and walked to the theater with us and then left.\n\nA few minutes later before the movie even started, the ticket collector came into the theater and asked where our parent was, we replied he left, and the guy escorted us out of the theater and said that we couldn't come back that day, when we asked for a refund he said we couldn't have one.\n\nSo I was just wondering if they broke any laws or if they were in the clear.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At a minimum, what the theater did was not a crime. When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a \"license\" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.\n\nAs a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.\n\nWhether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.\n\nIndeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.\n\nThere is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R\\-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.\n\nAnother fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non\\-discriminatory manner.\n\nI don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined. I would give you at least a 20% chance of prevailing if you took the issue to court although I would agree that it is more likely than not that you would not prevail if you took the issue to court.",

The teens are subsequently removed from the theater and denied a refund. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation?\n\nA) The theater unequivocally broke the law by removing the teens and denying a refund.\n\nB) The teens have a clear-cut case for breach of contract against the theater.\n\nC) The theater's actions were likely legal, but the contract terms are ambiguous due to lack of explicit written agreement.\n\nD) The teens definitively breached the contract by attending without an adult present.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that the legal situation is not clear-cut. While the theater's actions were likely not criminal, the contract between moviegoers and theaters is often implied and not explicitly defined. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine if there was a breach of contract on either side. The theater's actions were probably legal, as they have the right to revoke a \"license\" to be present, but the exact terms of the agreement are not well-defined. This lack of clarity is intentional on the part of theaters to discourage lawsuits over small amounts. While the teens might have a case, it's not clear-cut, and the small amount in question makes litigation impractical. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest a definitive legal violation or clear breach of contract, which the passage does not support. Option D is also incorrect because, while it's a possibility, the documentation doesn't present it as a definitive fact, but rather as one potential interpretation of the ambiguous agreement."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Rahul, an Indian citizen, has created a website containing original articles, photographs, and a software application. He wants to protect his work through copyright registration. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the copyright registration process for Rahul's website in India?\n\nA) Rahul needs to file a single application to copyright his entire website, including all content and software.\nB) Rahul must wait for a mandatory period of 60 days after filing his application before his copyright can be registered.\nC) Rahul needs to file separate applications for the literary works, artistic works, and software components of his website.\nD) Rahul is required to register his copyright with the Indian Patent Office to protect his website content.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a website contains several types of works, including literary works, artistic works, and computer software. Each of these requires a separate application for copyright registration. The FAQ specifically states, \"A web-site contains several works such as literary works, artistic works (photographs etc.), sound recordings, video clips, cinematograph films and broadcastings and computer software too. Therefore, a separate application has to be filed for registration of all these works.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because a single application is not sufficient for all components of a website. Option B is incorrect because the mandatory waiting period is 30 days, not 60 days. Option D is incorrect because copyright registration is handled by the Copyright Office, not the Patent Office."

Prosecutors have broad discretion in offering and rescinding plea agreements, as governed by Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 11. This discretion allows them to withdraw or modify plea offers at any time before a judge accepts the agreement, even if their motivation is annoyance at the defendant's actions. While it may seem unfair, it is within the prosecutor's legal rights to change the terms of a plea offer in response to the defendant's actions, including filing motions. Options A and D are incorrect because the prosecutor's action is not illegal and the judge does not have the authority to force a specific plea offer. Option B is incorrect because the defendant cannot compel the prosecutor to honor a withdrawn plea offer."

Sarah's subsequent demand for repayment doesn't change the nature of the original transaction.\n\nA is incorrect because John's vague statement about possibly repaying in the future doesn't constitute a legally binding promise.

The documentation specifically mentions that someone on a tourist visa is \"very greatly limited in what they could do with a company.\" This restriction exists regardless of the availability of single-owner business structures. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the visa limitations. Option B is false; a tourist visa does not allow for starting any type of business, and tax rates are not determined by citizenship.

Those JSON files contain instructions for the CompanyX software tool to perform certain tasks. The JSON files contain instruction and variable names that are abbreviations of the functions they represent. It is not a documented format, CompanyX does not disclose the schema of those JSON files. So we only would have samples provided by our clients.\n\n* Is it OK to extract those CompanyX ZIP configuration files and analyse the JSON files with a script to help our clients understand the scope of the migration project they are looking at?\n* Is it OK to create an automated migrator script that unzips those CompanyX ZIP files, inspects the JSON configuration files and translates them to a format that is readable by opensource tools and/or other commercial tools?\n* What are the risks we face when embarking on this journey?\n\nWe are a company based in the UK.

The consultancy can legally analyze CompanyX's configuration files and create migration tools, as reverse engineering is lawful and the clients own the copyright to their specific configuration files. However, the consultancy must be transparent about any uncertainties or limitations in the migration process to avoid potential claims from clients.\n\nOption A is incorrect because explicit permission from CompanyX is not required, and reverse engineering is legal as long as no improperly obtained information is used.\n\nOption C is incorrect because obtaining the schema directly from CompanyX is not necessary, and reverse engineering is indeed lawful in this context.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the consultancy faces minimal legal risks from CompanyX, they could face claims from clients if they oversell the capabilities of their migration tool or guarantee perfect accuracy, which is likely impossible given the complexity of the task."

However, the large, Native American owned casinos permitted by states through due to the 1987 ruling of [California v. the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indian/) draw in people from many different states at a time. I am wondering if this is permitted because these casinos are constructed within the sovereign territory of tribal nations within states, or, if it is because that ruling itself loosened regulations for all gaming institutions, Native or not. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two general federal restrictions on gambling are in [18 USC ch. 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-50), against off\\-shore gambling ships, and wire communication for transmitting information that assists interstate / international gambling on sporting events and competitions. Interstate lotteries are legal and internet sales of lottery tickets is legal (until Congress or SCOTUS says otherwise). These laws have the usual commerce clause justificational language.\n\nIn addition, the [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-120/pdf/STATUTE-120-Pg1884.pdf) says that you can't use the internet to engage in otherwise\\-illegal gambling, so if your state prohibits lotteries or bingo, you can't use the internet to gamble (in\\-state or across state/tribal lines). The definitions section ([31 USC 5362(10\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362)) narrows the term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" so that an online wager is legal if made exclusively within or between the land of one or more tribes, and follows applicable Indian gaming regulations, see below.\n\nGambling on tribal land is covered by [25 USC ch. 29](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-29) which was passed in response to California v. the Cabazon, and there are three classes of gambling. Traditional and social games with minimal reward are unrestricted; bingo, cards (not games where you play against \"the house\") and other stuff is class II which requires tribal approval etc. The broader 3rd class requires a compact to be negotiated between the state in which the venue is located and the tribe. Section [2710(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/2710) address the most stringent (and most generally\\-relevant) restrictions. The federal \"take\" on these matters is mediated via the Indian Gaming Commission under Interior (and not, for example, the DOJ), and 2 of the 3 commisioners must be registered tribe members. The law is framed in terms of location on tribal land which is \"within the reservation\" or \"on tribal trust land\", thus an operation owned by a tribe but located on other land is not covered by this act (and would be covered by the relevant state law).\n\nNo specific law is required to permit anything pertaining to gambling, instead a specific law would be necessary to prohibit it. The federal government prohibits very little, leaving that to the states. A state has authority to regulate gambling, but it has no authority to regulate gambling on tribal land, unless Congress gives it such authority (and Congress has not). The Indian Gaming Commission has (apparently) not issued any general regulations to the effect that a casino must disallow out\\-of\\-state gamblers or anything to that effect, although it might technically have the authority to do so. If home\\-to\\-casino internet gambling is legal in your state, then home\\-to\\-tribal\\-casino internet gambling is legal.",

The answer reflects the complexity of the system, which involves multiple layers of regulation and oversight:\n\n1. Federal law: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988 provides the overarching federal framework for tribal gaming.\n\n2. Tribal-state compacts: For Class III gaming (which includes most casino-style games), tribes must negotiate compacts with the state in which they are located.\n\n3. National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC): This federal agency provides oversight and regulation of tribal gaming.\n\n4. Different classes of gaming: The IGRA establishes three classes of gaming with varying levels of regulation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Native American casinos are not exempt from all regulations; they are subject to federal oversight and, in many cases, agreements with states.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation. While tribes have significant rights under the IGRA, they still need to negotiate compacts with states for Class III gaming.\n\nOption C is incorrect because states do not have full authority to regulate gambling on tribal lands. The federal government, through the IGRA and NIGC, plays a significant role in regulation, and states' involvement is primarily through negotiated compacts for Class III gaming."

If they are wrong, and I think they are, if I continue working there am I agreeing to the changes if they are not written out and signed by both. Do I give up my rights to the proper agreement we had?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### The Company is performing wage theft\n\nI have never heard of a wage method that pays a salary according to hours but doens't pay for hours over 40\\. Monthly **Salary**, by definition, is paid regardless of hours. Your contract doesn't give hours, it just gives a monthly total. That's a contract, and you should be paid according to the contract. In terms of fairness, it certainly isn't right to dock pay for weeks you worked less than 40 but not give you credit for weeks you wored more than 40\\.\n\nNow, it's not clear if you moved to direct employment for the second month. If you did, the first month would be a contract violation, and the second would be a violation of wage \\& labor law. A company can't pay you salary as an exempt (exempt from hourly wage laws, like management) employee and also dock you pay according to hours worked.\n\nSo what can you do? If you are still a contractor and actually want the job, not much more than arguing with payroll. Since you (why?) decided to be a contractor instead of a direct hire, you have exactly zero protections to getting let go. If you are a direct employee, you have protections from bringing action about being paid fairly, though your long\\-term prospects there would be problematic if you have to take the company to task using the government.\n\nAny HR rep should know all of the above. But never just go to HR without talking to your manager first. Remember that HR works for management, and working against your manager is generally a bad career move.",

The employer is likely committing wage theft by not paying the agreed-upon salary, regardless of hours worked. A monthly salary, by definition, is paid regardless of hours worked. The offer letter specifies an annual salary without mentioning hour requirements, which constitutes a contract. Docking pay for weeks under 40 hours while not compensating for weeks over 40 hours is unfair and likely illegal, especially if the employee has transitioned to direct employment. Options A and D are incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of salaried employment. Option B is incorrect because continuing to work does not necessarily imply agreement to unilaterally changed terms, especially when those changes violate labor laws."

What is it like in other countries?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> In European anti\\-monopoly law, does that not represent some kind of\n> abuse and monopoly of communications?\n\nAs a general rule, governments are allowed to award monopolies to individuals or private firms, or to governmental entities, and governmental entities are not, in general, subject to anti\\-trust liability.\n\nFor example, governments may nationalize a particular industry, government may authorize a firm that is regulated as a utility to have a monopoly in lieu of using private competition between firms to provide utilities, governments can award patents to inventors which are monopolies, governments can establish a national health service, and so on.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is a create of statute and only prohibits what national governments decide to prohibit by statute, which rarely includes their own activities.\n\nIn the E.U., this is somewhat complicated by the fact that the E.U., generally speaking, tries to put government contracts from within the E.U. but outside the country offer government contracts on an equal footing. But that does not, in general, prevent the government from nationalizing a good or service and making it an exclusively governmental function. The Postal Service is a governmental entity and/or regulated utility, so this would seem to be proper.\n\nIn the same vein, across Continental Europe, notaries public have transferrable, non\\-exclusive license to a particular territory in the country (that can be bought and sold between licensed notaries) and only a small number are allowed in any jurisdiction. Anyone who wants to do business transactions that require notaries must deal with one of them and in low population areas there may well be a monopoly.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is generally directed at preventing unregulated anti\\-competitive conduct by private firms.\n\nAlso, as noted in the original question, the use of means other than mail to cancel contracts isn't mandated, it is a choice of the parties in the context of laws that allow for alternatives. And, while the statutes disfavor electronic communications, the statutes do not, as a comment notes, state that contracts may not be terminated by a letter delivered by hand, signed in person and in presence, or delivered by another carrier providing traceability. The government post office means is presumably less expensive than a private courier providing hand delivery, but termination by hand delivery or courier of a signed dead tree paper letter appears to be allowed to cancel a contract without counter\\-party consent. So, it isn't a true monopoly.\n\nIn the same vein, the law does not mandate that apartment leases require payment of a security deposit, but the prevailing legal rules create an incentive that makes this practice very widespread.",

Government entities and regulated utilities, such as postal services, are typically not subject to anti-trust liability. Governments are allowed to award monopolies or nationalize certain industries without violating anti-monopoly laws.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the postal service is a governmental entity, not a private company. \n\nAnswer C is false because the EU does allow for government-sanctioned monopolies in certain cases, especially for governmental functions.\n\nAnswer D is technically true but doesn't address the legal aspect of the question.

According to the MUTCD, to which all states are required to adhere, [section 2B.47](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2b.htm#section2B46) paragraph 18, this sign would indicate that ***any*** parking is prohibited along a given highway:\n\n> In rural areas (see Figure 2B\\-25\\), the legends NO PARKING ON PAVEMENT (R8\\-1\\) or NO STOPPING ON PAVEMENT (R8\\-5\\) are generally suitable and may be used.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding parking restrictions in this scenario?\n\nA) Parking is prohibited only on the pavement directly adjacent to the sign\nB) Parking is allowed immediately before the sign, but prohibited after it\nC) The sign prohibits parking along the entire stretch of highway unless otherwise indicated\nD) Parking is allowed on the shoulder of the road, but not on the pavement\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The R8-3 symbol sign, as defined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) section 2B.47, is used to prohibit any parking along a given highway. It does not merely apply to the immediate vicinity of the sign or only to the pavement. The sign indicates a general prohibition on parking for the entire stretch of highway, unless there are additional signs or markings that specify otherwise. Options A and B are incorrect because they limit the scope of the parking prohibition, which is not consistent with the MUTCD guidelines. Option D is incorrect because the R8-3 sign prohibits all parking, including on shoulders, unless specifically allowed by supplemental signage."

And of an authority that recognizes and enforces such.\n\nHistorically, debtor\u2019s prisons with penal labor effectively enabled that in most countries, and which is still the practice in some.\n\nThe clearest rationale for the existence of such a right is in any country with a formal security classification system. A person holding a security clearance becomes subject to certain limits on their future actions, beyond that of that of the regular citizenry, which they cannot unilaterally remove even after leaving the position that required it. This appears to be quite close to contracting oneself into an indefinite, limited, servitude.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **NO** (mostly).\n\nServitude means that the employer, or owner of the indenture, or whatever, can use physical force to make the indentee carry out the work given. If the indentee runs away they can be arrested and forcibly returned.\n\nThis is distinct from the law of contracts. If Alice agrees to provide labour for Bob and subsequently fails to fulfil the contract then Alice may have to pay damages, but that is all. Even in cases of crminial fraud where Alice never meant to provide the labour in the first place, the penalty is defined by law, and would not be the provision of the contracted labour.\n\nAs the OP notes, military service is generally an indenture\\-style contract; desertion is a crime.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights prohibits all forms of servitude. However, the information notes that military service is an exception, where desertion is a crime and the government can enforce the contract. This aligns with option C, which states that indenture contracts are only enforceable when the government is one of the parties, such as in military service. \n\nOption A is incorrect because private indenture contracts are not generally legal or enforceable. Option B is wrong because while the UDHR does prohibit servitude, it doesn't make explicit exceptions for military service or security clearances. Option D is partially true regarding modern contract law, but it doesn't account for the military service exception mentioned in the passage."

The exemption is 100\\.10:\n\n> (c) Nothing in this part, other than the prohibitions against\n>  discriminatory advertising, applies to: \n> \n> \n> (1\\) The sale or rental of any single family house by an owner,\n>  provided the following conditions are met: \n> \n> \n> (i) The owner does not own or have any interest in more than three\n>  single family houses at any one time. \n> \n> \n> (ii) The house is sold or rented without the use of a real estate\n>  broker, agent or salesperson or the facilities of any person in the\n>  business of selling or renting dwellings.\n\nSo such a restriction could be allowed if e.g. you live in the house and rent only a few rooms, or a single family home marketed and managed in the right way. There is also an exemption for religious organizations and private clubs allowing rental to members only.\n\n100\\.500 lays the groundwork for disparate impact hot water. It says:\n\n> (a) A practice has a discriminatory effect where it actually or\n>  predictably results in a disparate impact on a group of persons or\n>  creates, increases, reinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing\n>  patterns because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial\n>  status, or national origin.\n\nSo only renting to students in a particular seminary would most likely have a disparate impact.\n\nThere is, however, the possibility of justifying the policy, following 100\\.500:\n\n> (b) (1\\) A legally sufficient justification exists where the challenged\n>  practice:\n> \n> \n> (i) Is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate,\n>  nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent, with respect to claims\n>  brought under 42 U.S.C. 3612, or defendant, with respect to claims\n>  brought under 42 U.S.C. 3613 or 3614; and\n> \n> \n> (ii) Those interests could not be served by another practice that has\n>  a less discriminatory effect.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) A legally sufficient justification must be supported by evidence\n>  and may not be hypothetical or speculative. The burdens of proof for\n>  establishing each of the two elements of a legally sufficient\n>  justification are set forth in paragraphs (c)(2\\) and (c)(3\\) of this\n>  section.\n\nSo let's say that the offended party has made the case that the practice will have a discriminatory effect, then the accused can set forth the aforementioned justification:\n\n> (c)(2\\) Once the charging party or plaintiff satisfies the burden of\n>  proof set forth in paragraph (c)(1\\) of this section, the respondent or\n>  defendant has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is\n>  necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate,\n>  nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent or defendant.\n> \n> \n> (c3\\)(3\\) If the respondent or defendant satisfies the burden of proof\n>  set forth in paragraph (c)(2\\) of this section, the charging party or\n>  plaintiff may still prevail upon proving that the substantial,\n>  legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged\n>  practice could be served by another practice that has a less\n>  discriminatory effect.\n\nThe crux of the matter is having a \"substantial, legitimate nondiscriminatory interest\", i.e. *why* would you want to rent to only seminary students.",

Which of the following scenarios would most likely be legally permissible under the Fair Housing Act and its exemptions?\n\nA) The landlord owns a 20-unit apartment complex and advertises \"Seminary Students Only\" on a public rental listing website.\n\nB) The landlord lives in one unit of a duplex and rents out the other unit, finding tenants through word-of-mouth at the seminary.\n\nC) The landlord owns three separate houses and uses a real estate agent to find seminary student tenants for all of them.\n\nD) The landlord owns a 5-unit building and justifies the \"seminary students only\" policy by claiming it creates a focused study environment.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most likely to be legally permissible due to the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in the Fair Housing Act. This exemption, as outlined in 24 CFR 100.10, allows owners who live in one unit of a building with four or fewer units to be exempt from certain anti-discrimination provisions. Additionally, renting without using a real estate agent or public advertising meets the conditions of the exemption.\n\nOption A is not permissible because it involves a large apartment complex and uses discriminatory advertising, which is explicitly prohibited even under exemptions.\n\nOption C doesn't qualify for the exemption because it involves using a real estate agent and exceeds the limit of renting out more than three single-family houses.\n\nOption D, while attempting to provide a justification, would likely still be considered discriminatory as it involves a multi-unit building and the justification may not be seen as a \"substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest\" that couldn't be achieved through less discriminatory means."

(attribution, non\\-commercial, same license for derivatives) I really like what it does, but I'll have to modify it a bit to fit my goals.\n\nNot sure how much of this paragraph is relevant, but it's an electronic circuit that uses the wrong shape board for what I'm doing, so I'll need to rearrange the same parts to make it fit around my other stuff while keeping the same connections between them. I'll also remove some auxiliary features that I don't need and add some that I do, but the core functionality is unchanged, including the software/firmware for one of the chips that does that core function.\n\nNone of that is a problem, as I understand, as a hobbyist and no more. And if I were to publish my version, I'd have to use the same license and refer back to the original. That's fine too...as a hobbyist and no more.\n\n---\n\nBut I also see the potential to produce and sell copies of my finished product that includes (among many other things) the core functionality of that CC\\-NC project. So how far does the \"non\\-commercial\" restriction reach? And what do I need to do now, before I start, to avoid violating it?\n\n* Does it make a difference whether I copy the original files and modify them, vs. re\\-creating my version from scratch having seen and understood the original?\n* What about permanently embedding it, vs. keeping it modular/removable?  \n\n(The original can't be made to fit if I wanted to. It must be my version or equivalent.)\n* This original does not offer a manufactured version. The expectation is that a user will take the design files and send them to their favorite manufacturer, which would be grossly unreasonable for my customers to do. So even if I were to release my derivative version per the original license, I would still have to include the manufacturing step on my side of the deal.  \n\nDoes ownership make it okay to sell my version as a manufactured product? I understand that my design files would have to be publicly available under CC BY\\-NC\\-SA per the original license that I received it under, but I own this derivative version and can therefore do what I want with it, including what would otherwise violate the license if I didn't own it. Is that true?  \n\n(I'd be okay with my design files being public like that; a few people might make their own instead of buying from me, but not many. And I'd be interested to see what derivatives *they* come up with too!)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> CC\u2019s NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are \u201cprimarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.\u201d\n\n(From the link in your link)\n\nIf you use the design (or derivatives thereof) to make money, you are violating the licence. Similarly, using them in such a way is highly unlikely to be fair\\-use. Therefore, everything you propose is copyright violation.\n\nYou can approach the author and negotiate a commercial licence.\n\nAs an aside, there is no copyright in manufactured objects built from copyright plans (except for buildings and sculptures) so selling a manufactured product is not copyright violation. However, in order to do so, you needed to make a copy (and a derivative work) and that is copyright violation.",

This aligns with the principle of state sovereignty in international law, where a recognized government can request assistance from other nations. The U.S. and its allies recognized the South Vietnamese government as legitimate, and this government had requested help in its counter-insurgency efforts against internal rebels. This justification allowed the U.S. to frame its involvement as legal under international law, despite controversies surrounding the conflict.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the main legal argument used by the U.S. There was no UN Security Council resolution authorizing intervention, no claim of collective self-defense was the primary justification, and the conflict did not start due to a direct attack on American soil."

By offering a similar arrangement, the owner is doing so voluntarily. As such, they have more flexibility in setting the terms of the agreement. This includes the ability to request direct payments, charge administrative fees, and require advance payments. Option C correctly reflects this flexibility. Options A and B are incorrect because they imply legal requirements that don't apply in this voluntary scenario. Option D is also incorrect because, without the legal COBRA framework, there's no specific requirement for official documentation, though it would be good practice to provide it."

If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third\\-party notices normally appear.\n\nSo if whoever is reusing your software is distributing the source code but without your name and copyright notice, it would seem that they are violating the license.\n\nYou mention a README file, but do not mention the NOTICE file which is listed in the Apache license. If you included a NOTICE file, and your software, or a modified version based on your software, is being distributed in object code form (only) without either a NOTICE file listing you, or a visible display by the program listing you, it would seem that they are violating the license.\n\nThe license specifically mentions a NOTICE file. It is not clear that attributions or restrictions in a README file will have the same effect. I would suggest that you add a NOTICE file to your distribution (if you did not already have one), and include one in any future distributions under this license.\n\nIf someone distributes a modified version of your software in object code format only, and you did not include a NOTICE file, it is not clear to me that the creator of the modified version must include **any** credit to you. However, the modified files must include a statement that they were modified from the original, and indicate who did so. Absence of that statement would also seem to be a violation of the license.\n\nIf it seems that the license has been violated, AND if you know or can find out who is distributing the modified version, you can send a letter (or email or other communication) indicating that the modified software is derived from your work, and should carry attribution to you. You could request or demand that they stop distributing copies that do not carry proper attribution. You may want to ask a lawyer to draft or review any such letter.\n\nIf the modified software is posted on a site subject to US law, you could send a DMCA takedown notice about the issue. This is fairly simple, and should not require a lawyer. However, if the other party files a counter\\-notice, the site could put the software back up if, after 10 days, you haven't filed a copyright infringement suit. Some sites restore challenged content quickly if a counter notice is filed, some just ignore counter\\-notices.\n\nUltimately, if the person does not restore proper credit voluntarily, and if a takedown is not available, or doesn't get the results you want, you would need to file a copyright infringement suit. To do this you would want to be sure that you have a good case. You would need to consider upfront costs and requirements, and possible damages should you win, to decide if it makes sense to file suit. Often it does **not** make economic sense. I would urge you to consult with a lawyer experienced in copyright issues before making a decision to file suit. Such a lawyer could help you estimate your chances of success, and the probable award if you win the suit. (Note that if all you are seeking is attribution, available damages may be limited, unless you can prove that lack of attribution harms you in a specific, economic way.) Such a lawyer could advise on needed pre\\-requisites (if you are in the US, you may need to register the work before filing suit). Such a lawyer could advise on what evidence would be needed to win, and how good or bad any evidence you have is. I cannot advise on **any** of that.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer releases a Discord bot with a dashboard under the Apache License 2.0 on GitHub. The README.md file includes additional conditions, including retaining copyright notices. Another developer modifies the bot, removing all references to the original developer except for one mention in the dashboard. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The modified version is in full compliance with the Apache License 2.0, as long as the NOTICE file (if present) is included.\n\nB) The README.md conditions supersede the Apache License 2.0, making the removal of attribution illegal regardless of other factors.\n\nC) The removal of attribution violates the Apache License 2.0, but only if the original developer included a NOTICE file with the distribution.\n\nD) The modified version likely violates the Apache License 2.0, regardless of the presence of a NOTICE file, as it fails to retain all copyright and attribution notices in the source form.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Apache License 2.0 requires that all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the original work be retained in the source form of any derivative works, as stated in section 4.c of the license. This requirement exists independently of whether a NOTICE file was included. While the README.md conditions may not have the same legal weight as the license itself, the core requirement to maintain attribution is part of the Apache License 2.0. Therefore, by removing all references to the original developer except one, the modified version likely violates the license terms, regardless of the presence or absence of a NOTICE file."

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. All written content is automatically copyrighted, including press releases.\n2. The term \"press release\" and labels like \"Newsroom: For Journalists\" imply an intent for the information to be distributed.\n3. However, this doesn't place the content in the public domain (ruling out A) or grant an unlimited license to anyone (ruling out B).\n4. While the label suggests it's intended for journalists, it doesn't legally restrict usage to only journalists (ruling out C).\n5. The most accurate interpretation is that by labeling content as a press release and placing it in a section for journalists, the company is granting a reasonable assumption of permission to copy and paraphrase the content for press purposes, which aligns with the typical use of press releases.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright principles, implied licenses, and the practical interpretation of common business practices in media relations."

The setting is the end of World War 2 with Soviet armies in Berlin engaging in mass rapes. The woman in question, after being raped several times, decides to seek protection from a Soviet officer. The officer protects her from being raped by common soldiers, and also provides \"bacon, butter, sugar, candles, canned meat\".\n\nDoes the officer engage in rape? The woman thinks no: she writes that \"By no means could it be said that the major is raping me\" and that she is \"placing \\[herself] at his service of \\[her] own accord\". However, can it be argued she is acting under duress?\n\nI am most interested in modern law, although if anyone knows about what the laws were like in 1945 Germany that would be interesting too.\n\nRelated: [Why must victims of 'sex\\-for\\-rent' arrangements be legally defined as prostitutes to seek justice?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59870/why-must-victims-of-sex-for-rent-arrangements-be-legally-defined-as-prostitute) which indicates that the woman becomes a prostitute in the eyes of the law (something considered by the author as well), but doesn't clarify if the officer engages in rape.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Socially the woman has become a \"kept woman\". It would not be rape, at least in most jurisdictions, because the officer is using neither force nor threats of force. The duress is from her economic and general circumstance, and most jurisdictions would not consider that to be rape. At least technically, this is a form of prostitution, but a form very rarely prosecuted.\n\nMaryland\n--------\n\n[maryland](/questions/tagged/maryland \"show questions tagged 'maryland'\") is a not untypical jurisdiction as US law goes in such matters. [\u00a7 3\\-303 of the Naryland Criminal Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2017/criminal-law/title-3/subtitle-3/section-3-303/) (Rape in the first degree) provides that:\n\n> (a) Prohibited. \\-\\- A person may not:\n> \n> \n> (a) (1\\)  \n> \n> (a) (1\\) (i) engage in vaginal intercourse with another by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other; or  \n> \n> (a) (1\\) (ii) engage in a sexual act with another by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other; and\n> \n> \n> (a) (2\\)\n> (a) (2\\) (i) employ or display a dangerous weapon, or a physical object that the victim reasonably believes is a dangerous weapon;  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) (ii) suffocate, strangle, disfigure, or inflict serious physical injury on the victim or another in the course of committing the crime;  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) (iii) threaten, or place the victim in fear, that the victim, or an individual known to the victim, imminently will be subject to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury, or kidnapping;  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) (iv) commit the crime while aided and abetted by another; or  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) (v) commit the crime in connection with a burglary in the first, second, or third degree.\n\n[Section 3\\-304](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2017/criminal-law/title-3/subtitle-3/section-3-304/) (Rape in the first degree) provides that:\n\n> (a) A person may not engage in vaginal intercourse with another:  \n> \n> (a) (1\\) by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other;  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) if the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual, and the person performing the act knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual; or  \n> \n> (a) (3\\) if the victim is under the age of 14 years, and the person performing the act is at least 4 years older than the victim.\n\nSections 3\\-306 thru 3\\-307 have similar provisions but they mention \"sexual act\" rather than \"intercourse\" and they do not define the crime as \"rape\" but as \"sexual offense\". But the emphasis on force or threat of force, and lack of consent is much the same.\n\nSo it seems that under Maryland law, at least, the situation described in the question would not be legally \"rape\" nor a \"sexual offense\".\n\nMaryland Criminal code [\u00a7 11\\-301](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2018/criminal-law/title-11/subtitle-3/section-11-301/) (2018\\) defines prostitution in subsection (c) which reads:\n\n> (c) Prostitution. \\-\\- \"Prostitution\" means the performance of a sexual act, sexual contact, or vaginal intercourse for hire.\n\nWhether the provision of food, shelter, and protection by one person to another in return for sex would be considered \"for hire\" is arguable.

Indeed, there is so much regurgitation and copy/pasting in the legal \"profession\" (judges included, as is notorious in judicial opinions they release and in the similarities \\-\\-verbatim\\-\\- among the procedure law of many, many U.S. jurisdictions). That regurgitation is not bad in and of itself, though, since what matters is the expeditious administration of justice and the protection of your rights, rather than obtaining creative expressions authored by some lawyer. \n\nYou might end up wasting valuable energy and money if you went after the competitor for something like this without first assessing the extent of originality in your contract.

Also, if I've made such an attempt and cannot find the rights\\-holder, can I reproduce them with a footnote stating such attempt?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Analogue) is well known and was published posthumously in France. Under French law, copyright exists for the life of the author \\+ 70 years; as Ren\u00e9 Daumal died in 1944, copyright ended in 2014\\.\n\nHowever, the English translation is its own derivative work and has a copyright duration under UK law of the life of the translator \\+ 70 years; you need to find out who this person was and when they died. Alternatively, if the translator cannot be identified then copyright lasts for 70 years from creation \\- at the latest this was the year of publication, 1959 meaning copyright lasts until 2029 in the translation.\n\nThe translator was *probably* an employee or agent of the publisher, Vincent Stuart Publishers Ltd (VSP) so they owned the copyright (a body corporate cannot be an author but it can own copyrights created by others due to contractural arrangements). You say VSP no longer exists, if that is so you need to find out who acquired the copyright when VSP was dissolved \\- were they taken over, merged, liquidated or something else? Whatever happened the copyright owner passed to someone else \\- that's who you need to find to ask permission.\n\nAlternatively, you could make your own translation of the original French text.\n\n**The UK has an [orphan copyright](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works) system**\n\nYou can apply to the UK government for permission to publish where the copyright owner cannot be found.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An artist wants to publish a book containing scanned pages from the English translation of \"Mount Analogue\" by Ren\u00e9 Daumal, originally published in 1959 by Vincent Stuart Publishers Limited (VSP). Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright status and the artist's options?\n\nA) The copyright has expired because the original author died in 1944, so the artist can freely use the scanned pages.\n\nB) The artist must locate the current copyright holder of the English translation, which may have transferred when VSP ceased to exist.\n\nC) The artist can immediately publish the book without permission because VSP no longer exists.\n\nD) The artist should create a new translation from the original French text to avoid copyright issues entirely.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While the copyright on the original French work has expired (70 years after the author's death in 1944), the English translation is a separate copyrighted work. Under UK law, the translation's copyright lasts for 70 years after the translator's death or, if the translator is unknown, 70 years from publication (until 2029 in this case). \n\nThe copyright was likely owned by VSP, but since the company no longer exists, the rights would have transferred to another entity when VSP was dissolved. The artist needs to trace the current copyright holder to obtain permission.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only considers the original work's copyright, not the translation's. Option C is wrong because a company's dissolution doesn't make its copyrights public domain. Option D, while a potential solution, is not the most accurate answer to the specific situation described.\n\nIf the copyright holder truly cannot be found after diligent searching, the UK's orphan copyright system could be an option, but this would come after attempting to locate the current rights holder."

The documentation suggests that the inability to withdraw a ticket once issued is likely a matter of policy rather than law. This policy serves as an anti-corruption measure, preventing situations where the issuer might be tempted to accept bribes to withdraw a ticket. While the security guard stated he couldn't withdraw the ticket once issued, this is probably due to his training and employer's policy, not necessarily a legal requirement. Option A is incorrect as it contradicts the guard's statement and the likely policy. Option B is incorrect because the inability to withdraw is not explicitly stated as a legal mandate. Option D is incorrect as the question doesn't provide information about who else might have the authority to withdraw tickets."

If there was authorization, there would be no need to resort to the defense of fair use.\n\nThe article discusses the commercial use of short sections of musical works used for commercial purposes. It points out that the idea that any use of an excerpt of less than 30 seconds is permitted is a myth. In this it is correct. While the amount of a copyrighted work used is one of the four factors to be considered in deciding wither a use is a fair use, it is not the only one, and no specific amount is always permitted. In [*Harper \\& Row v. Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) The US Supreme Court held that quotes amounting to about 3\\-400 words from a 500\\-page book were an infringement, and were not a fair use, because they were the \"heart of the book\".\n\nThe linked article says that one should ask \"Was the work obtained from a legal source, in a lawful manner?\" and asserts that \"taking a copy from an unapproved source invalidates fair use.\" Nothing in 17 USC 107 says this, and I don't know of any authoritative source for such a statement. The article also says that \"Commercial, for\\-profit use is not fair use, while commentary or criticism may be.\" This is simply incorrect. While a commercial purpose tends to weigh against fair use, it does not preclude it, and commercial use has been held to be fair use in some cases. Even in the case of *Harper \\& Row v. Nation Enterprises* linked above, fair use was seriously considered, and was not denied simply because the use was commercial. No one o0f the four fair use factors is final taken alone. I do not think the linked article is a reliable guide to US copyright law.\n\nIn the case described by the question, an unreleased game has been distributed without authorization over the internet, and reviews written based on that unauthorized copy. Whoever copied the game committed copyright infringement, but a suit might not provide substantial damages unless actual economic harm could be demonstrated. (And, of course, the identity of the infringer would need to be proved.) But a review based on such a leaked copy would not necessarily be an infringement. If the review described the game, but did not quote any of its dialog or other text, and did not reproduce any sounds or images from the game, there would be no infringement. If the review did quote from the unauthorized copy, the usual fair use analysis would apply. The fact that the copy had been unauthorized would not determine the outcome.\n\nFair use is defined by [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). This provides:\n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use\n> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or\n> phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for\n> purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching\n> (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or\n> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether\n> the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the\n> factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use\n> is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to\n> the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of\n> the copyrighted work.\n> \n> \n> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of\n> fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above\n> factors.\n\nNote that criticism is one of the specified purposes for which fair use is designed, and an unpublished work is still subject to fair use. If the review quoted so much of the game that the potential market for it was harmed, that would weigh against fair use, but it is hard for me to see how a mere review could do that to an interactive game.\n\n(17 USC 107(4\\)) is normally applied when an infringing copy serves as a replacement for the authorized version, and sales are lost as a result. I suppose it might be argued that a bad review that was a direct result of an infringement came under this provision, but it is a strech at best, and US First Amendment considerations would tend to prevent such a ruling.\n\nIn short, it seems unlikely that any normal review would be an infringement, and that the game was leaked would not make it one.",

The developer wants to have the review taken down, claiming copyright infringement. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The review is automatically considered copyright infringement because it's based on an unauthorized copy of the game.\n\nB) The review is protected by fair use as long as it doesn't quote more than 30 seconds of game dialogue.\n\nC) The review cannot be considered fair use because the game was unreleased and obtained illegally.\n\nD) The review may be protected by fair use, depending on a consideration of all four fair use factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Fair use is determined by considering four factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect on the potential market. The fact that the game was leaked or unreleased does not automatically disqualify fair use. Reviews and criticism are explicitly mentioned as potential fair use in copyright law. While using an unauthorized copy might be considered, it's not the sole determining factor. The review's impact on the game's market, the amount quoted, and the purpose of the review would all be weighed in a fair use analysis. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they oversimplify fair use or make incorrect absolute statements about what qualifies for fair use protection."

The [War Powers Resolution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33) limits his ability to engage unilaterally in military action, by requiring him to report to Congress within 48 hours, and if Congress disapproves, troops must be removed after 60 days. However, this law pertains to armed forces, and would not apply to remotely\\-launched missiles. Additionally, it is unknown if the resolution is unconstitutional (presidents say it is). No law at all requires POTUS to obtain permission from someone else, in order to engage in a military action.\n\n[Article 90 of the UCMJ](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/MCM-2012.pdf) states that it is a punishable offense to \"willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer\".

Those that may exist within the Home Office will in all likelihood follow the requirements and conditions stipulated in section 33D of the 2014 Act, [section 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/8?timeline=false) Housing Act 1988, and at the [Rules 83\\.9(5A) and 83\\.13(2\\) at Part 83](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-83-writs-and-warrants-general-provisions) Civil Procedure Rules and Practice Directions.\n\n* **What can trigger the Home Office's operational procedures to actually send such a notice?**\n\nWhen there is sufficient evidence, and it is proportionate and necessary to do so after taking in to account, for example, all the available information about the landlord, the occupiers' immigration status, and the public interest in terminating the agreement.\n\n* **Has the provision entirely fallen out of use?**\n\nI have not been able to find any publicly available data on this topic, so one option would be to submit a Freedom of Information request for an answer.\n\n**Also**, from a comment:\n\n* **It is almost surely specified/codified in some operational guidance document somewhere, and even if such is non statutory guidance, courts are still semi\\-bound to lend it some weight in legal contexts.**\n\nWhether or not to issue of a 33D notice is an operational case\\-by\\-case decision based on particular circumstances, so if a court (more likely an Immigration Tribunal) needs to consider the Home Office's internal mechanics, authorisation requirements, quality assurance and other such processes (which, hopefully, should be recorded in detail) then the normal production of evidence / disclosure / discovery rules would apply (with any non\\-relevant parts properly redacted to prevent unnecessary disclosure).",

According to the information provided, the Home Office issues a Section 33D(2) notice when there is sufficient evidence, and it is proportionate and necessary to do so. This decision takes into account all available information about the landlord, the occupiers' immigration status, and the public interest in terminating the agreement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because landlords do not typically initiate this process by requesting information.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the process is not automatic and requires consideration of multiple factors.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because a court order is not a prerequisite for issuing a Section 33D(2) notice. The notice is issued by the Home Office based on their assessment of the situation."

This would be on the record as part of the application, \\\\and would be evidence ofd prior use.\n\nIf the applicant knows of the similar mark but does not list it, the application is fraudulent and may be canceeld if this comes to light.\n\nIf the PTO finds that there is existing concurrent use of the mark or a confusingly similar mark, that is reason to refuse the application for registration\nunder [15 USC 1052](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052).\n\nThe user of a similar mark, or anyone who expects to be damaged by a registration my object under [15 USC 1063](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1063) within 30 days of registration, or may later file for cancellation of the registration under [15 USC 1064](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1064) within 5 years. After that a mark may become incontestable, but even then prior use can be a defense to an infringement action.\n\nIt is a defense under [15 USC 1115](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1115)(b)(5\\):\n\n> That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an infringement was adopted without knowledge of the registrant\u2019s prior use and has been continuously used by such party or those in privity with him from a date prior to (A) the date of constructive use of the mark established pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title, (B) the registration of the mark under this chapter if the application for registration is filed before the effective date of the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, or (C) publication of the registered mark under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title: Provided, however, That this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which such continuous prior use is proved;\n\nRegistration furnishes evidence presumed to be valid under 15 USC 1115(a) that the mark registered is valid and the rights to it are owned by the registrant, (subject to any limitations listed in the registration, such as known concurrent use). This evidence can be overcome by proof of prior use, but the burden of proof is on the person who challenges the registration.\n\nIn short a later registrant could bring and win a suit if the earlier user could not prove contentious use from before the registration, but not otherwise.\n\nPrevious Use or Registration by Another\n---------------------------------------\n\n> Or am I only at risk of accidentally infringing an already\\-existing trademark (such as if I didn't conduct my trademark search correctly).\n\nIn that case you may be at risk. Use of a mark that is identical or confusingly similar to an existing mark, for the same category of goods or services, in the same market area is infringement. This is true even if the infringer was unaware of the other mark, although that may reduce the damages.\n\nRegistration is evidence of the ownership of the mark, and may be conclusive. It also acts as evidence that the infringer should have known of the mark, and makes \"innocent infringement\" harder to establish.\n\nBenefits of Registration\n------------------------\n\nRegistration forces a through and professional search for possibly conflicting trademarks. It establishes that such a search was done. It establishes that the registrant had no knowledge of any prior use of the mark, nor, could the USPTO find any. It puts the evidentiary weight on the registrant's side under sec 1115\\.\n\nWhether that is worth the costs and effort is a business decision.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Tom can easily register Sarah's logo as his trademark and enforce it against her, since she didn't register it first.\n\nB) Tom cannot register Sarah's logo as his trademark because the USPTO will automatically know about Sarah's prior use.\n\nC) Tom can register Sarah's logo, but Sarah can defend her right to use it by proving her prior continuous use in her market area.\n\nD) Sarah is completely protected from Tom's actions due to common law trademark rights, regardless of registration.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the legal situation described in the documentation. While Tom could potentially register the logo if he doesn't disclose Sarah's prior use (which would be fraudulent), Sarah has a defense under 15 USC 1115(b)(5) if she can prove continuous prior use in her market area. The USPTO doesn't automatically know about unregistered uses (ruling out B), registration does provide significant benefits (ruling out D), and Tom cannot easily enforce a registration against a prior user (ruling out A)."

But it's about 4 months that I'm living out of US now to stay with my parents in a foreign country.\n\nHow long can I continuously stay outside the US to keep my green card valid? What are the rules for that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's no hard deadline for you to return to the US. There are some consequences, however, beginning at 180 days, at which point you are to be processed at the border as an \"applicant for admission,\" which will usually have little practical impact on the process.\n\nAfter a year, your green card is no longer valid for admission to the US. This doesn't mean that you lose your LPR status, and the green card remains valid for other purposes. It just means that you should get a returning resident visa (unless you have a re\\-entry permit, which you would have to have acquired before leaving the US, so I assume you don't have one).\n\nThere are ways to get into the US without a returning resident visa \\-\\- in particular, an airline isn't going to refuse to fly you to the US, because they won't know that you've been away for more than a year.\n\nYour LPR status remains until there is a formal finding that you have abandoned your residence in the US. This can be a result of your voluntarily relinquishing it or of an administrative or judicial action. In general, it's probably safe to say, the longer you're away, the more likely the immigration officer is to look into the possibility of abandonment.\n\nIf you are absent for more than six months, you may also delay your eligibility to naturalize because this absence would disrupt \"continuity of residence.\"\n\nA good starting point is the USCIS page [International Travel as a Permanent Resident](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-we-grant-your-green-card/international-travel-as-a-permanent-resident), which has more information about these matters as well as links to more detailed descriptions of some of them.\n\nSince this is <https://law.stackexchange.com/>, I suppose I should add some citations.\n\nThe 180\\-day threshold is found in [8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101#a_13_c).\n\nThe one\\-year threshold is at [8 CFR 211\\.1(a)(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/211.1#a_2).\n\nResidence requirements for naturalization are regulated at [8 CFR 316\\.5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/316.5). It should be stressed that failing to meet these requirements does not by itself put your LPR status at risk; it only affects your ability to qualify for naturalization.",

However, this doesn't mean John has lost his LPR status. His status remains until there's a formal finding of abandonment.\n\nA is incorrect because LPR status isn't automatically lost after a certain period; it requires a formal finding of abandonment.\n\nB is incorrect because after a year abroad, the green card is no longer valid for admission, and John may need additional documentation like a returning resident visa.\n\nD is incorrect because there's no strict deadline for return that would automatically trigger deportation proceedings. The consequences of prolonged absence are more nuanced and don't include immediate deportation at the 12-month mark."

The documentation emphasizes that you cannot change contracts or restrict other people's rights by your acts alone. The client's contract was with Sarah as an individual, not with her later-formed LLC. Creating an LLC after the fact does not transfer liability from the individual to the company for contracts entered into before the LLC's formation.

The idea is \"Making an app similar to X but with a better UX and simpler design\" without providing specific details on implementation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the protection of this idea under the NDA/NC?\n\nA) The idea is too general to be protected under the NDA/NC.\nB) The idea is protected, but Company B can freely discuss it with third parties as long as they don't mention Company A.\nC) The idea is protected, and even mentioning its existence to third parties could potentially breach the NDA/NC.\nD) The idea is only protected if Company A provides specific implementation details.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Even though the idea seems general, the NDA/NC typically covers all information shared between parties, including the existence of discussions. The documentation states that \"simply telling a third party that you are discussing the development of 'an app similar to x but with a better UX and simpler design', might already be considered as a breach of confidentiality.\" Furthermore, NDAs often include a clause stating that the agreement itself and its contents are confidential. Therefore, even mentioning the existence of this idea to third parties could potentially breach the NDA/NC, regardless of how general the idea may seem."
