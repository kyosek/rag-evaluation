Despite the provocative album title, stealing the physical CD from a retail store would still be considered shoplifting, a form of larceny. The album title does not provide any legal protection or justification for theft. The item belongs to the retailer, not the band or label, and normal criminal laws apply regardless of any perceived \"invitation\" in the promotional materials. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the album title cannot be used as a valid legal defense for theft. \nAnswer B is wrong because entrapment specifically involves law enforcement inducing a crime, which is not the case here. \nAnswer D is incorrect as the band or label would not be held liable for the actions of individuals who choose to interpret the title literally and commit theft."

That is why such tools exist; and by processing code client\\-side, the authors submit to that possibility. If there is something which a website wishes to make absolutely sure you won't mess with, they will process this information server\\-side, as per \u2013 B\u00e1lint's comment.\n\nNow as you pointed out, in the example you brought up, the code is compressed but not obfuscated to make it harder for a human to read. This is usually the norm. Because things that obfuscate the code, they make it take longer for a human to figure out how to manipulate it; however, they don't actually prevent a human from doing it; also, once a human has figured it out, he can explain it to others without legal repercussions \\-\\- whether it is to correct a bug, or to cheat. And any author who makes his code available as JavaScript, has to bear full acknowledgement of the fact that his code can be manipulated.\n\nNow, there is one exception. You say:\n\n> The authors of the website explicitely said that they does not want that other people read and modify 'on the fly' their code.\n\nIf this is something that you had to click \"I agree\" to, then it is legally binding. Therefore, if you must check to box agreeing not to modify the JavaScript code *before* you can download it, then it is protected by law. Otherwise, the author will have to prove that you were aware of his requirements, before he can legally prosecute you. (For example, if he can find a log that shows you read the ToS, and he can reasonably prove that it was you, e.g. by IP address, then he can prosecute you; however, in practice, such things are usually very hard to prove.)

The key exception is if users have explicitly agreed not to modify the code, typically through a \"clickwrap\" agreement where they must check a box or click \"I agree\" before accessing the site. In such cases, modifying the code could be legally binding. Without such explicit agreement, it's generally legal to modify client-side JavaScript, regardless of the purpose (bug fixing, cheating, etc.).

That would allow embedding Like buttons on any page at will and Facebook could only track the users that have already given consent for Facebook. Technically facebook would have been able to run their own JavaScript code on the host page so they could have implemented the consent query on any page if they really wanted to set cookies only after getting consent.\n\nThis would also immediately solve questions such as [Who's liable for GDPR compliance when embedding/hosting a self\\-contained 3rd\\-party website/service?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/50337/34270) and [Who needs to implement Cookie Consent for embedded content?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/55925/34270) because in both cases the host that wants to set non\\-necessary cookies would need to independantly verify they already have been given consent for those cookies. As GDPR doesn't define how such content must be acquired, there could be an UI on the host domain document and then the acquired consent must be explicitly transferred to 3rd party. In practice, the transfer cannot be just \"it's okay\" but \"user has given consent for trackingdomain.com via domain example.com at yyyy\\-mm\\-dd with log id abc123ef\" because GDPR requires that the user must be able to retract the consent later and entity doing the processing must be able to specify the origin for the consent.\n\nIs the current ruling just caused by the interpretation that embedding any content via URL is considered *implicit* consent for the whole domain?\n\nIn practice, this would practically prevent 3rd party cookies for any services the user hasn't expicitly visited previously.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The rulings you refer to are not primarily about cookies or consent. They are about pages who use Facebook services, and claim that Facebook would be the sole data controller. As the ECJ has ruled, this is not the case: causing or contributing to Facebook's processing of personal data can establish a joint controller role. Thus, the admin of a Facebook page ends up being co\\-responsible for the correct use of cookies on that page, and the embedder of a Facebook like button ends up being co\\-responsible for sending visitor data (such as IP addresses) to Facebook.\n\nYou are correct that joint controller situations are messy and potentially difficult to navigate. But the \u201cjoint controller\u201d concept reflects the reality of the legal situation that more than one person/entity can meet the definition of a \u201ccontroller\u201d for a particular processing activity.\n\nIt is possible to avoid joint controller situations, for example when processing activities are structured suitably, or when one party engages the others as data processors. Of course, it would be contrary to Facebook's interests to act as a data processor because FB wants to use the personal data for their own purposes, not solely for the other controller's purposes.\n\nSome detailed notes:\n\n* The Fashion ID case does not involve the *setting* of cookies, it applies more generally to any personal data a browser might send while making a request.\n* Both of these cases are not about Facebook's responsibilities, but about the responsibilities of data controllers that use Facebook's services. You can't just embed/use third party services and argue that you're not responsible for compliance.\n* GDPR does not require explicit records of consent to be stored. Doing so might even violate the data minimisation principle. The GDPR has the weaker requirement that \u201cthe controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data\u201d (Art 7(1\\)). This could perhaps be demonstrated indirectly, e.g. that it is not possible to trigger the processing activity without giving consent.\n* The controller of a page embedding content does not have influence over the use of cookies by that embedded content and would not typically collect consents for that content.\n* Instead, embedding pages typically collect consent for the *loading* of third party content, e.g. \u201cclick to show content from twitter.com\u201d or a greyed\\-out Facebook icon with a toggle next to it. This page (about the Fashion ID ruling) has a wonderful example with an embedded YouTube video:\n\n> [![a blurred-out placeholder for a YouTube video player embedding, with a consent dialogue up front](https://i.stack.imgur.com/POv4B.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/POv4B.png)\n> \n> \n> Source: [https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/digitale\\-welt/datenschutz/eughurteil\\-likebutton\\-von\\-facebook\\-nur\\-mit\\-info\\-an\\-nutzer\\-12029](https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/digitale-welt/datenschutz/eughurteil-likebutton-von-facebook-nur-mit-info-an-nutzer-12029)\n\nTranslation:\n\n> The video is currently deactivated to prevent unwanted data transfers to Youtube.\n> To activate, please click the link!\n> This will transmit data, but we can't provide information on their type, scope, and purpose.\n> \n> \n> Link: **show video**\n* There is no such thing as implicit consent under the GDPR. Consent must be indicated unambiguously. Art 4(11\\) defines consent as \u201cany freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data\u201d.\n* It is quite likely that, were Facebook to set cookies via embedded Like buttons or to use Like buttons to create profiles of users that are not Facebook members, that Facebook would be acting illegally. The lack of suitable consent would be a concern. But that matter was not being litigated in the cited cases.",

This means they share responsibility for ensuring GDPR compliance related to the personal data processing that occurs through the embedded content. The rulings reject the notion that only Facebook would be responsible (A) or that the website owner has no responsibilities (B). Option D is incorrect because the website owner does not become solely responsible for all processing, including actions taken by Facebook. The correct understanding is that both parties have responsibilities as joint controllers, reflecting the reality that multiple entities can meet the definition of a \"controller\" for a particular processing activity."

One notable case was [Blizzard's successful injunction against Peons4Hire](http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/01/blizzard-puts-peons4hire-out-of-work/), a World of Warcraft gold farming company.\n\nSetting aside terms\\-of\\-use considerations (which vary by game/platform), the sale of virtual goods for real money is broadly legal. Wikipedia has a [short list of jurisdictions with notable decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming#Law.2C_regulation_and_taxation) on virtual sales; see the page's references for the official news stories or government documents. Most of the rulings have been positive for virtual\\-goods vendors, though China has banned the sale of *real items* for *virtual currency* (the opposite of your proposed plan) and South Korea has banned the sale of virtual goods for real money outright.\n\nSuch sales incur normal tax responsibilities, just as any other income does. I don't know if any jurisdictions have imposed special legislation that place income limits or special tax rates for income from the sale of virtual goods.\n\n---\n\nIn the case of Steam specifically, the sale of virtual goods is broadly disallowed in Section 2\\.G of the [Steam Subscriber Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/), but narrowly allowed in Section 3\\.D. All virtual Steam goods remain the property of Steam, and you have a license to use them, which includes sale in limited circumstances.\n\nThe prohibition in Section 2\\.G reads:\n\n> G. Restrictions on Use of Content and Services\n> \n> \n> ...you are not entitled to: (i) sell, grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Content and Services to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease or license the Content and Services to others without the prior written consent of Valve, except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use); ...\n\nAnd the narrow permission to perform trades in the Community Marketplace in Section 3\\.D (per the above \"except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement\" exception of 2\\.G):\n\n> D. Trading and Sales of Subscriptions Between Subscribers\n> \n> \n> Steam may include one or more features or sites that allow Subscribers to trade, sell or purchase certain types of Subscriptions (for example, license rights to virtual items) with, to or from other Subscribers (\u201cSubscription Marketplaces\u201d). An example of a Subscription Marketplace is the Steam Community Market.\n\nYou can use the Steam Community Market to trade *items* for real money; this kind of real\\-money sale is explicitly allowed and facilitated by Steam. Separately, you can also trade *giftable games* (N.B.: game trading does *not* support real money) using Steam's trading system. Applying terms to a game\\-trade (like requiring payment external to Stream's trading system) appears to be disallowed by the broad prohibition in 2\\.G, but it's not very clear. The mechanical transfer of the game from one account to another is allowed, but the fact that it is actually a *sale* in a way that is not explicitly allowed seems to make it against the terms of service. I have no idea to what degree this is enforceable nor to what degree Steam polices against trades that involve Stream\\-external money transfers (though a cursory search of conversations in the Steam forums suggests they might not care very much).",

These are necessary conditions for criminal liability for which no corresponding mens rea is necessary. An example would be \u00a7 231 I StGB (\"participation in a brawl\"), which requires that the brawl resulted in grievous bodily harm or a death for it to be punishable. However, the participants need not have mens rea with regard to the grievous bodily harm/death.\n\nAre there crimes in US law (federal or any state) where the objective element contains conditions which don't have to be covered by mens rea?

Still, the knowledge you do have might trigger a duty to inquire if you want to escape civil forfeiture liability.\n\nUnder [the statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-13/article-2/16-13-49/), to defeat a civil forfeiture action (assuming it has been used for drug dealing), you must show:\n\n> (e)(1\\) A property interest shall not be subject to forfeiture under\n> this Code section if the owner of such interest or interest holder\n> establishes that the owner or interest holder:\n> \n> \n> (A) Is not legally accountable for the conduct giving rise to its\n> forfeiture, did not consent to it, and **did not know and could not**\n> **reasonably have known of the conduct or that it was likely to occur**;\n> \n> \n> (B) Had not acquired and did not stand to acquire substantial proceeds\n> from the conduct giving rise to its forfeiture other than as an\n> interest holder in an arm's length commercial transaction;\n> \n> \n> (C) With respect to conveyances for transportation only, did not hold\n> the property jointly, in common, or in community with a person whose\n> conduct gave rise to its forfeiture;\n> \n> \n> (D) Does not hold the property for the benefit of or as nominee for\n> any person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture, and, if the\n> owner or interest holder acquired the interest through any such\n> person, the owner or interest holder acquired it as a bona fide\n> purchaser for value without knowingly taking part in an illegal\n> transaction; and\n> \n> \n> (E) Acquired the interest:\n> \n> \n> (i) Before the completion of the conduct giving rise to its\n> forfeiture, and the person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture\n> did not have the authority to convey the interest to a bona fide\n> purchaser for value at the time of the conduct; or\n> \n> \n> (ii) After the completion of the conduct giving rise to its\n> forfeiture:\n> \n> \n> (I) As a bona fide purchaser for value without knowingly taking part\n> in an illegal transaction;\n> \n> \n> (II) Before the filing of a lien on it and before the effective date\n> of a notice of pending forfeiture relating to it and without notice of\n> its seizure for forfeiture under this article; and\n> \n> \n> (III) At the time the interest was acquired, was reasonably without\n> cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture or likely\n> to become subject to forfeiture under this article.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) A property interest shall not be subject to forfeiture under this\n> Code section for a violation involving only one gram or less of a\n> mixture containing cocaine or four ounces or less of marijuana unless\n> said property was used to facilitate a transaction in or a purchase of\n> or sale of a controlled substance or marijuana.\n\nThe language in bold is the most threatening part that effectively establishes a duty of inquiry and a duty to take action if your inquiry establishes that drug dealing is going on. If you can't establish that you were ignorant of wrongdoing, and reasonably so, under the circumstances of being told by one of your tenants that something is going on, you are at great risk of losing the duplex to civil forfeiture if the DA can prove that drug dealing is taking place by far less than a reasonable doubt standard.\n\nYou might want to hire a private investigator to look into the situation carefully, and to try to evict the allegedly drug dealing tenant if the private investigator corroborates the fellow tenant's claims.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Georgia owns a duplex and receives a complaint from one tenant that the other tenant may be dealing drugs. The landlord has been informed of suspicious activity but has not directly observed any drug deals. What is the landlord's best course of action to protect themselves from potential civil forfeiture of the property?\n\nA) Immediately evict the suspected tenant without further investigation\nB) Ignore the complaint as it's merely hearsay from another tenant\nC) Hire a private investigator to look into the situation and gather evidence\nD) Report the suspicion to the police without any further action\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because evicting a tenant without sufficient evidence could lead to legal issues and violate the tenant's rights under their lease.\n\nB) is incorrect because ignoring the complaint could put the landlord at risk of civil forfeiture if drug dealing is indeed occurring. The law requires that the landlord \"could not reasonably have known of the conduct or that it was likely to occur.\"\n\nC) is correct because hiring a private investigator allows the landlord to gather more information without directly accusing the tenant. This demonstrates due diligence in investigating the claim and helps protect the landlord from potential civil forfeiture by showing they took reasonable steps to uncover any illegal activity.\n\nD) is incorrect because reporting to the police without further investigation could unnecessarily escalate the situation if the suspicion is unfounded. It also doesn't demonstrate that the landlord took reasonable steps to verify the claim before taking action.\n\nThe correct approach balances the need to investigate potential illegal activity with protecting the landlord's property rights and the tenants' lease rights. Gathering more information through a private investigator is a prudent step before deciding on further action, such as eviction or involving law enforcement."

According to the information provided, for faxes and emails in common law, acceptance is considered to have occurred when actually communicated to the other party. This means that Alice's acceptance of the offer is not effective until Bob actually reads the email, which happened on Friday. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, unlike the postal acceptance rule, email acceptance is not effective upon sending but upon reading.\n\nOption C is incorrect because explicit response is not always necessary for a contract to be valid, especially if the terms were already agreed upon and one party has signed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Alice cannot unilaterally void the contract after Bob has read and accepted it, even if market conditions have changed. The contract becomes binding when Bob reads the email, assuming all other elements of a valid contract are present.\n\nThis question tests understanding of contract formation, the differences between postal and electronic communication in contract law, and the timing of offer and acceptance."

What judge enabled them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If an officer has a warrant to investigate is it possible for a\n> citizen to get details of that warrant including finding where those\n> officers are? What judge enabled them?\n\nThe name of the judge authorizing a search warrant or arrest warrant, and the court in which that judge serves, will always appears on the face of the warrant document.\n\nIt is possible to eventually get a copy of a search warrant or arrest warrant, once it has been served, but search warrants and arrest warrants are frequently issued \"under seal\" prior to the point in time at which they are served so that the law enforcement can have the element of surprise in executing those warrants.\n\nSearch warrants are usually served very shortly after they are issued, so there isn't much of a gap period for them to be under seal. Arrest warrants are frequently made public and widely publicized to law enforcement officers in cases that don't have an organized crime component or co\\-conspirators who have not yet been arrested, particularly if law enforcement doesn't know where to find the person named in the warrant.\n\nSearch warrants and arrest warrants which aren't under seal may be obtained by any member of the public from the clerk of the court that issued the warrant.\n\nOnce a search warrant or arrest warrant has been executed, the person searched or arrested and their lawyers are always entitled to a copy of it, and to a copy of the \"return\" of the warrant to the court, and to a copy of the police report, if any, prepared regarding the execution of the warrant. The \"return\" of the warrant to the court and the police report, if any, will generally disclose at least some of the officers who were involved in executing the warrant.\n\nSometimes a search warrant is handed to the person searched. Criminal case warrants and related documents are sometimes made available by law enforcement records departments, sometimes by the clerk of the relevant court, and sometimes by the prosecutor's office as part of \"discovery\" in a criminal case. Police reports are sometimes made available by the law enforcement records departments and sometimes by the prosecutor's office as part of \"discovery\" in a criminal case.\n\nBut, sometimes these documents remain sealed as to the general public if a criminal investigation is ongoing so that co\\-conspirators will not be tipped off and so that potential witnesses will not receive information not made available to the general public (allowing law enforcement to distinguish between reliable witnesses who know non\\-public factors and people just making things up based upon news reports) and so that juries will not be tainted by information which may not be admissible at trial.\n\nEventually, not later than after a jury has heard the case and all witnesses have testified at trial, the general public has a right to that information.\n\nOfficers Providing Probable Cause Affidavits\n============================================\n\nAnother kind of information that someone would often like to have regarding a search warrant is to know who supplied the probable cause statement for the warrant. Usually, there will be a named law enforcement officer's affidavit either attached to the warrant or including as part of that form, or filed under the same court case number even if it does not accompany the warrant itself.\n\nBut, while the law enforcement officer preparing the probable cause affidavit or declaration will be named, the law enforcement officer will not infrequently rely in part on unnamed anonymous informants who are described in more or less detail in the probable cause affidavit. The identity of the anonymous informant is not revealed unless the prosecution in the case chooses to do so. Instead, the practice of relying on anonymous informants is regulated with rules of law regarding when information from an anonymous informant can be sufficient, with or without other kinds of corroborating information, to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant or arrest warrant.\n\nIf after the search has been conducted, a court determines that the warrant was not supported by probable cause, this sometimes constitutes grounds to suppress the evidence obtained with the search warrant.\n\nIf a court later determines that an arrest warrant was not supported by probable cause, this could provide a basis for the suppression of evidence obtained incident to the arrest, for the release of the criminal defendant if no later evidence has established probable cause after the arrest from sources not tainted by the arrest without probable cause, or for a civil lawsuit for wrongful arrest brought by the person arrested.\n\nSo, failing to identify officers who are sources of information for an arrest warrant or search warrant is something only done if it serves some worthwhile purpose for law enforcement, because they don't want to have their evidence needlessly suppressed.\n\nAlso, while judges usually trust law enforcement officers and issue warrants rather freely based upon their statements, if a particular officer develops a pattern of seeking warrants based upon unreliable anonymous sources in cases that turn out to be baseless, eventually judges may start to view probable cause affidavits from the officers who do that with greater skepticism than probable cause affidavits from other law enforcement officers.",

According to the provided information, a citizen can eventually obtain a copy of a search warrant after it has been served. The warrant will always include the name of the judge who authorized it. However, information about the officers involved may be limited, especially if the criminal investigation is ongoing. The answer also correctly implies that this information may not be immediately available, as warrants can be issued \"under seal\" initially to maintain the element of surprise.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests immediate and unrestricted access to all information, which is not always the case, especially during ongoing investigations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it states that warrant details are always confidential, which contradicts the fact that the judge's name is always on the warrant and that warrant information generally becomes public eventually.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it completely denies the citizen's right to any information, which is false. Citizens do have rights to obtain warrant information, albeit with some potential limitations and delays."

For example:\n\n* Your name and your period of service may need to be kept indefinitely in case you need to claim compensation (e.g. for asbestos related diseases) many years later.\n* Your pay and tax records need to be kept as long as the relevant tax authority mandates \\- usually this is as far back as the tax office can audit.\n* Your bank and passport details are probably not required for long after your final payment was made.\n\nThe practical problem is that all of this information is likely scattered across paper files and several databases that were set up before GDPR was a \u201cthing\u201d and therefore don\u2019t make it easy to selectively delete such information.

According to the documentation, different types of personal data should be retained for different periods based on their specific purpose and legal requirements. For example, name and period of service may need to be kept indefinitely for potential future claims, while pay and tax records should be kept as long as mandated by tax authorities.

This approach aligns with data minimization principles and helps protect individuals' privacy while ensuring necessary information is retained for legitimate business and legal purposes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a blanket retention period for all data types, which is not appropriate. Option B is a misinterpretation of retention periods for different company types. Option D is incorrect as indefinite retention of all personal data violates data protection principles, and offering credit monitoring does not justify excessive data retention."

Since the clause is in terms of \"*assigns*\", it purportedly refers to recovering *from the adversary* those fees and costs. It does not preclude recovery *from you*, though. The term \"*costs*\" refers to money a litigant has to pay for actions such as filing a motion in court, mailing documents to the adversary, obtaining deposition \\& court hearing transcripts, and so forth.\n\nThis clause altogether is so redundant and so sloppy I would hesitate retaining a lawyer with that \"quality\". For instance, in general the default presumption is that nobody performs services for free. Absent any indication in your matter that contradicts or supersedes that default presumption, there was no need for this lawyer to include the statement you quote. The lawyer is getting paid either way.\n\nNote that the statement refers to the outcome of *lease termination* (i.e., contingent to you prevailing in the legal dispute). Except for very specific scenarios, no prevailing litigant would volunteer to cover fees which are legally recoverable from his adversary. If anything, it would be easier for a lawyer to bill his client than going to court again to litigate against the adversary the matter of attorney fees. Thus, the statement is tantamount to saying \"*you the client will allow me to take the longer path as to attorney fees if we win the underlying case*\".\n\nIt is also pointless for the clause to have the exact same statement at the beginning and at the end of that paragraph. It reflects that also this lawyer is in the business of doing copy/paste carelessly.",

This doesn't preclude the attorney from billing the client, but it gives the attorney the right to seek reimbursement from the opposing party for fees and costs associated with the case. Option A is incorrect because the clause doesn't guarantee payment regardless of outcome. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't waive the attorney's right to collect from the client. Option D is entirely unrelated to the meaning of the clause."

Alex's parents want to implement a system where Alex must pay a $20 fine for breaking house rules (e.g., missing curfew, not completing chores). Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) The parents can legally force Alex to pay fines from the gift money, as they have full control over a minor's finances.\n\nB) The parents cannot touch Alex's gift money under any circumstances, as it belongs solely to Alex.\n\nC) The parents can restrict Alex's privileges (e.g., phone use, going out) if fines aren't paid, but cannot directly take the money.\n\nD) Alex has full autonomy to spend the gift money as desired, regardless of parental rules or fines.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While parents generally have control over how minors spend their money, they cannot simply take it away. The correct answer is C because parents can use privilege restrictions as a means of enforcing rules, but they cannot directly take money from their child's personal gifts or earnings. Option A is incorrect because parents don't have full control over a minor's finances, especially gifts. Option B is too absolute, as parents can have some say in how money is spent. Option D is incorrect because minors don't have full autonomy over their finances - parents can still guide and restrict spending to some degree."

Comments and explanations in answers talked about what it means to have a \"legitimate educational interest\" in a student's grades. This question posed to law.StackExchange is about **what constitutes \"legitimate educational interest\"?**\n\n> Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.31\\):\n> \n> \n> * School officials with legitimate educational interest;\n\nThe majority opinion on Academia seems to be that a teacher wanting to know their student's pervious grades in a different class \\- a class which was a prerequisite for the current class \\- is a legitimate educational interest. The only reason provided as for why is that the teacher can use it to deny access to the class to some students or to adjust the class speed and/or content to better accommodate the students' level of understanding.\n\nI suggested that teachers can get this information in other, better ways, and have no true need or interest in previous grades. For example, when I want to get a feel for the level of the class up front, I have given an anonymous quiz on the first day of class. Since it's anonymous, it is obviously not graded. Others still insist that teachers in this situation have a legitimate educational interest in the student grades.\n\nOne person went so far as to suggest that FERPA only denies the teacher in cases of idle curiosity. That seems wholly ineffective to me at that point, as any teacher could always get out of a reprimand by claiming \"I heard this student was concerned about their standing and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help.\" You cannot easily prove that a teacher had only idle curiosity.\n\nSo the question is, in a nutshell: **Legally, what has FERPA's \"legitimate educational interest\" been interpreted as meaning, strictly?** If this has ever been tested in court for any grey areas like this (ie: not cases of negligence or idle curiosity), that would be great.\n\nMy personal interest in this is to get a better idea of when FERPA denies access to student records and when it does not. I am concerned, as the interpretation of some people of \"legitimate educational interest\" makes me wonder if FERPA does not really protect our privacy in practice, since negligence and idle curiosity should already have been grounds for workplace discipline for school officials in any competent school.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exact text of [34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.31](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.31) makes it clear that the determination of who has \"legitimate educational interest\" is left up to each educational institution to establish:\n\n> (a) An educational agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record of a student without the consent required by \u00a7 99\\.30 if the disclosure meets one or more of the following conditions:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\n> \n> \n> (i)\n> \n> \n> (A) The disclosure is to other school officials, including teachers, within the agency or institution **whom the agency or institution has determined to have legitimate educational interests.**\n\nMoreover, [34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.7) requires each institution to notify students of their particular definition of \"legitimate educational interest\":\n\n> (a)\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Each educational agency or institution shall annually notify parents of students currently in attendance, or eligible students currently in attendance, of their rights under the Act and this part.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **The notice must include all of the following:**\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (iii) If the educational agency or institution has a policy of disclosing education records under \u00a7 99\\.31(a)(1\\), **a specification of criteria for determining** who constitutes a school official and **what constitutes a legitimate educational interest.**\n\n(bolding mine)\n\nAs far as whether this has ever been tested at law, I'm not sure. There are a few cases mentioned in [this legal review article from 2003,](http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/nclr/vol81/iss3/12/) though the author calls the existing case law at the time \"meager\":\n\n> Not surprisingly, schools' interpretations of the legitimate educational interests exception have been at issue in some FERPA controversies. In *Krebs v. Rutgers*, for example, a university attempted to characterize its disclosure of students' Social Security numbers to campus post office personnel as a \"legitimate educational interest.\" The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey enjoined the practice, noting that \"the regulations do not suggest, and it is far from clear, that distribution of social security numbers ... serves a 'legitimate educational interest.' \" In contrast, in *Achman v. Chicago Lakes Independent School District No. 2144*, a Minnesota federal district court held that the supervisor of the school's detention room had a legitimate educational interest in accessing the disciplinary records of a student she monitored. In another FERPA case from 1987, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals found that a school official who requested students' education records to defend against her pending criminal charges did not have a legitimate educational interest in the records.\" Finally, in another instance that some commentators have deemed \"an egregious example of when disclosure serves no legitimate educational interest,\" a substitute teacher told her class that a student had HIV and classmates should not share lip balm with him.\n\nEarlier in the article, the author makes basically the same point you make in your question:\n\n> Thus, if a professor, campus employer, or other school official can contrive a colorable \"legitimate educational interest\" for accessing a student's education records, the official may obtain the data without the\n> student's knowledge or consent. ... Because policies are not uniform, systems administrators are largely untrained, and schools are not held accountable, school discretion in defining legitimate educational interests may undermine student privacy.",

Additionally, 34 CFR \u00a7 99.7 requires institutions to notify students annually of their specific definition of \"legitimate educational interest.\" This places the responsibility on individual schools to establish and communicate their own criteria, rather than having a universal definition set by federal agencies, state boards, or courts."

How does one release a work into the public domain?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The relevant concept is dedicating a work to the public domain, that is, saying in the work something like \"This work is dedicated to the public domain\". I understand that this isn't entirely reliable in European civil law. The preferred alternative is to license it to the public. However, you have to decide how \"free\" you want the work to be made. The normal state of affairs, where you do nothing and just rely on copyright law, is that you have the sole right to allow copies to be made and derivative works to be created. Thus if someone were to make a derivative work based on your composition, they would need your permission: but then they would have the right what they created (such as a translation). If you just abandon your property right to the work, you impose no obligation on others, and a person can freely create a translation (which is now *their* property). If you execute the right public license, you can allow people to use your work as long as they include that license in their versions.\n\nA fairly common public licensing scheme is the [Creative Commons licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license). That article gives a decent summary of relevant rights and how particular licenses correspond to configurations of permissions. I would say that the most difficult thing to do is to figure out what you *don't* want to happen, and pick a license that matches that interest.",

For those unaware, these were four individuals who played an active role during BLM protests, in pulling down and dumping in the water a prominent and contentious statue of someone who had profited from the slave trade on Bristol, UK. They were charged with criminal damage and acquitted.\n\nI'm not interested in the rights and wrongs of the case, and personally, it was a monstrous statue and unfit as a landmark. But in law, that's irrelevant.\n\nThe **legal** situation is that clearly, unauthorised damage to third party property occurred, clearly there was ample evidence these people either did it, or aided and abetted it, or knew or should have known it was likely if they roped the statue or brought rope and gave it to others, or were reckless to the fact.\n\nRight or wrongly, the CPS decided that prosecution was in the public interest and I don't recall that being specifically the angle it was defended upon.\n\nIn such a situation, I'm intrigued, short of jury nullification, how a trial could end in acquittal (however deservedly). What legal arguments were made, that mattered at all, and that a judge wouldn't rightly direct to be irrelevant and should be ignored?\n\nI've read the blow\\-by\\-blow account of trial proceedings, and I'm still at a loss to understand what happened.\n\nWe can never know what went on in a jury room, but perhaps someone can shed light on what legal premises and theories could even be relevant to acquittal (as opposed to mitigation), in this very specific controversial case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to prove [criminal damage](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/criminal-damage), the prosecutors had to show that the four individuals\n\n1. Destroyed or damaged property \\[\\= the statue]\n2. The property belonged to another \\[\\= Bristol City Council]\n3. They intended to do so, or were reckless as to whether that would happen\n4. They had no lawful excuse\n\nThey evidently failed to convince the jury of the combination of these facts. (Some members of the jury may have thought differently about different ones, or they may have applied their own idiosyncratic reasoning.) For their part, the defence contested (1\\) and (4\\) by specific arguments.\n\nAgainst damage to the statue, they argued that it had increased in value by virtue of its participation in a historic event. They also advanced some novel arguments that they were attempting to prevent a crime \\- either the [public display of indecent matter](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/42) or of a [visible representation which is threatening or abusive](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64). For this defence, it doesn't matter whether that was actually a crime, just whether the defendants honestly held the belief that it was, and that they were using what they believed to be reasonable force to prevent the crime. They also invoked a specific lawful excuse mentioned in [the relevant Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5), that each of them\n\n> believed that the person or persons whom he believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction of or damage to the property in question had so consented, or would have so consented to it if he or they had known of the destruction or damage and its circumstances.\n\nThe argument was that they honestly believed that the statue belonged to the people of Bristol as a collective, and that the people of Bristol would generally be in favour of their actions.\n\nFinally, the defence made a human rights claim on the basis of free expression, saying that their conviction would be a disproportionate interference with those rights. This is about weighing up the public interest in property rights and public safety on the one hand, and the defendants' right to act in accordance with their conscience on a matter important to them.\n\nThe judge allowed all these defences to be made, and it was the prosecution's job to make the jury sure that the elements of the offence were proved, despite whatever the defence made out. There was some specific guidance given to the jury to help them understand the nature of the arguments and what had to be proved, and ultimately it was up to them to consider everything privately and come up with their answer.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's this hypothetical scenario (sometimes referred to as the trolley problem) that people refer to as an ethical conundrum. It goes something like:\n\n> There's a train heading down the track where it will run over and kill five people. You are at the lever that diverts the train onto a different track where it will only kill one person. Do you pull the lever and kill the one person in order to save the five?\n\nRegardless of the ethics, what is the law? Could your actions in this scenario result in a man slaughter charge? Isn't trying to save someone essentially a 'motive' to take actions that would knowingly and unlawfully kill someone else? Suppose the scenario was in reverse and someone killed five people because they just wanted to save one person. Would there actually be a legal distinction between killing the one and killing the five? Does 'inaction' (not pulling the lever) automatically make you innocent and 'action' (pulling the lever) automatically make you guilty, regardless of how the bodies are weighted? Is knowing something about these people (like who deserves to live or die) essentially a motive for murder?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It\u2019s probably legal\n-------------------\n\n[new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\")\n\n[s18](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s18.html) of the Crimes Act says:\n\n> (1\\)\n> \n> \n> (a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.\n> \n> \n> (b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\n> \n> \n> (a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.\n> \n> \n> (b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only.\n\nSo, at worse, it\u2019s manslaughter because there wasn\u2019t \u201creckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm\u201d or in relation to another crime.\n\n[s24](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s24.html) deals with the punishment for manslaughter and says:\n\n> Provided that, in any case, if the Judge is of the opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, a nominal punishment would be sufficient, the Judge may discharge the jury from giving any verdict, and such discharge shall operate as an acquittal.\n\nWhich seems to be the most likely outcome.",

At worst, it could be considered manslaughter. However, Section 24 of the Act allows a judge, considering all circumstances, to discharge the jury from giving a verdict if they believe a nominal punishment would suffice. This discharge would operate as an acquittal. Therefore, while the person could potentially face a manslaughter charge, there's a strong possibility that a judge would recognize the ethical complexity of the situation and effectively acquit the individual."

How is it that the Japanese filmakers won the lawsuit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A story is usually both an idea and a form of expression. It is typically written in the form of a draft or a script or an outline, and those are all forms of expression. a movie is also a tangible form of expression and will be protected by copyright. If all that is copied is the general idea, such as \"a cute alien arrives and teams up with a young boy\" that will not violate the copyright on *ET*. But if detailed, scene\\-by\\-scene plot, let alone dialog, is copied, that might well be a copyright infringement. Since this particular case was settled, there is no way to know what the court would have ruled on whether protected elements were copied, but there have been cases where a movie was based on a book or another movie and held to infringe.\n\nI have read, but cannot confirm, that the settlement was for 15% of the receipts of *A Fistful of Dollars*. If this is true, then the defendants must have thought that the plaintiffs had a significant chance of winning a judgement. But that still does not say how a court would have ruled.",

While general concepts or basic plot elements are not copyrightable, the detailed execution of a story, including specific plot developments, character arcs, and scene sequences, can be protected by copyright. In the case of \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and \"Yojimbo,\" the lawsuit's settlement suggests that there were enough similarities in the detailed expression of the story to make a credible claim of copyright infringement, even though the settings and cultural contexts were different. This aligns with the explanation that if \"detailed, scene-by-scene plot, let alone dialog, is copied, that might well be a copyright infringement.\" The other options are incorrect because they either oversimplify copyright protection (A and B) or misunderstand the scope of what can be protected across different cultural contexts (D)."

After some research, it turns out that this type of warning sign is total legal ([the best answer I found on this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-legality-behind-the-Trespassers-Will-Be-Shot-sign). Also, [onsite answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13348/can-i-stick-a-dont-trespass-warning-on-my-house)).\n\n---\n\nThis got me thinking when does a *warning* become a *threat* and what consideration is used to determine one from the other?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A warning is arguably often a form of threat (and vice versa). The words are close synonyms. A threat, however, is usually used only in connection with an action that has some sort of human (or at least, AI) agency, while a warning often made to alert someone to a mere natural consequence of an action with no human agency (e.g. a warning that an object is hot and could burn you if you touch it).\n\nBut, the term \"warning\", when used in connection with an action that involves human agency, is usually used when the action threatened would be lawful when taken (and often refers to a threat from a third\\-party rather than the person giving the warning), while the term \"threat\" is usually used when the action threatened would be unlawful when taken, or if the action, while lawful, is threatened for an improper purposes that amounts to blackmail (e.g. a threat to release legally taken photos showing that someone is having an affair if money is not paid). Also, a threat is generally made by the person who would take the action (or their agent), rather than a disinterested third\\-party.\n\nIncidentally, a threat to bring a lawsuit, since a proper purposes of a lawsuit is to secure money from someone, is not improper to connect to a demand to pay money.",

While it may seem extreme, such signs are generally legal. The key considerations are:\n\n1. It's a warning about potential consequences of trespassing, which is an unlawful act.\n2. The sign doesn't necessarily indicate the property owner's intent to actually shoot trespassers, but rather serves to deter trespassing.\n3. Warnings often relate to actions that would be lawful when taken (in this case, defending one's property), even if the action seems severe.\n4. The sign informs potential trespassers of risks, similar to other property warnings like \"Beware of Dog.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sign is not considered an illegal threat. Option C is wrong because the sign does have legal significance as a warning. Option D is partially correct in recognizing the dual nature of warnings and threats, but it's incorrect in stating that the sign's legality depends on the owner's actual intent to shoot."

Some notable examples:\n\n* [Infinion acquires International Rectifier](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2015/INFXX201501-020.html). Both companies specialized in advanced MOSFET circuits with barely any other competitors existing in the whole world. They now have close to monopoly on these kind of circuits. You find these circuits in every modern car.\n* [Microchip acquires Atmel](http://www.microchip.com/announcements/microchip-technology-inc-acquires-atmel). Both companies were direct and fierce competitors in the market of cheap, small microcontrollers. They were the only two companies in the world that profiled themselves as having beginner\\-friendly, easy to use microcontrollers and so they have been competing over the very same kind of customers for the past 30 years or so. There is barely any competition left at all on that market now.\n* [NXP acquires Freescale](http://investors.nxp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=209114&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2120581). The companies had many overlaps and were competitors in many areas, particularly in microcontrollers and automotive electronics. These two companies branched out from Phillips and Motorola respectively, roughly at the same time, some 15 years ago. Since then they had the same owners. NXP now got a different owner Qualcomm, at the same time as the merger. Qualcomm being another of these huge companies, but with a focus on telecom electronics, where they in turn have close to monopoly. So essentially this is 3 companies merging into 1\\.\n\nThere are many more examples. ON Semi acquires Fairchild, Analog Devices acquires Linear Technology and so on. All in the past 1\\-2 years. It is the same story over and over, two huge multi\\-national companies that are direct competitors, with little or no other competition, merge into one. Imagine Microsoft and Google merging and you get the idea. \n\nThe nature of their products \\- advanced electronic components \\- is such that barely anyone can start up a competing company, as they would need to do massive investments in R\\&D, head\\-hunt all staff from the existing companies and possibly also make massive investments in production lines. Because of this steep threshold to enter the market, there has traditionally only been around 20 companies like this in the world, making 99% of the world's advanced electronic components. \n\nI take it that these mergers must have been approved by authorities in USA and Europe etc. Are there no laws regulating this? If there are, how do these companies manage to repeatedly dodge such laws world\\-wide? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no laws directly regulating merger of two companies. Instead, there are laws against \"monopolizing\" (and similar expressions). In the US, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act and the FTC Act providing the legal underpinning for the Department of Justice to prosecute a merger, or for a judge to prohibit a merger. The typical logical flow is that it is illegal to unfairly reduce competition, which might mean lowering prices when you have a substantial share of the market, privately agreeing on technical innovations with a competitor, or simply gaining a substantial share of the market via a merger.\n\n[Section 7](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/mergers) of the Clayton Act (also Sect 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, Sect. 5 of the FTC Act) forbid a merger or acquisition when the effect would be \"substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\". The US government has issued [guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/mergers/100819hmg.pdf) that gives ballpark suggestions about that they would be looking for in deciding is a merger is forbidden. The [Hart\u2013Scott\u2013Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act) provides the legal framework for federal review where the government approves vs. blocks an acquisition action (you have to file paperwork so they know that you intend a potential violation of anti\\-trust law). There are thresholds involving how big the cmopanies are and whethr4e they affect US commerce.

Assigning different weights to surnames is likely to be seen as a form of indirect discrimination, as surnames can be strongly correlated with ethnicity or national origin.\n\nC) Correct. A transparent mathematical model with a precise formula that can be explained in court and demonstrated to not consider any impermissible factors, directly or indirectly, is the most legally defensible approach. This allows the lender to prove that the decision-making process is fair and non-discriminatory.\n\nD) Incorrect. Using zip codes as a proxy for demographic information could be seen as an attempt to indirectly discriminate based on race or ethnicity, which is not legally permissible."

Whether one is the initial contractor or a subcontractor, there is no minimum threshold for filing a claim. 44A\\-8 says that\n\n> Any person who performs or furnishes labor or professional design or\n>  surveying services or furnishes materials or furnishes rental\n>  equipment *pursuant to a contract, either express or implied, with the\n>  owner of real property* for the making of an improvement thereon\n>  shall, upon complying with the provisions of this Article, have a\n>  right to file a claim of lien on real property on the real property to\n>  secure payment of all debts owing for labor done or professional\n>  design or surveying services or material furnished or equipment rented\n>  pursuant to the contract.\n\nA subcontractor has a contract with a contractor, not the property owner. 44A\\-18(a) says\n\n> A first tier subcontractor who furnished labor, materials, or rental\n>  equipment at the site of the improvement shall have a *lien upon funds*\n>  that are owed to the contractor with whom the first tier subcontractor\n>  dealt and that arise out of the improvement on which the first tier\n>  subcontractor worked or furnished materials.\n\nThat clause means that a subcontractor has a lien on the funds, not the property. 44A\\-20(d) is the special clause that opens the door wider, since\n\n> If the obligor is an owner of the property being improved, the lien\n>  claimant shall be entitled to a claim of lien upon real property upon\n>  the interest of the obligor in the real property to the extent of the\n>  owner's personal liability under subsection (b) of this\n>  section...which claim of lien on real property shall be entitled to\n>  the same priorities and subject to the same filing requirements and\n>  periods of limitation applicable to the contractor.\n\n(An obligor is defined as \"An owner, contractor, or subcontractor in any tier who owes money to another as a result of the other's partial or total performance of a contract to improve real property\").",

The general contractor has not paid the subcontractor. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the subcontractor's lien rights?\n\nA) The subcontractor cannot file any type of lien because the amount owed is less than $500.\nB) The subcontractor can only file a lien on funds owed to the general contractor by the property owner.\nC) The subcontractor can directly file a mechanic's lien on the property, regardless of the amount owed.\nD) The subcontractor can file a lien on funds and potentially a lien on the property itself, depending on specific circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to NC lien law, there is no minimum threshold for filing a claim. A subcontractor primarily has a right to file a lien upon funds owed to the contractor (44A-18(a)). However, under certain circumstances outlined in 44A-20(d), a subcontractor may also be entitled to file a claim of lien on the real property itself. This depends on factors such as the owner's personal liability and the relationship between the parties involved. The amount being less than $500 does not preclude the subcontractor from pursuing lien rights. Options A and C are incorrect because they misstate the subcontractor's rights. Option B is partially correct but incomplete, as it doesn't account for the potential to file a lien on the property under specific conditions."

However, the clearance rates for small\\-amount thefts and frauds are fairly low in Canada.\n\nIf it is purely an unintentional software error on the part of merchant, the police will not get involved. It is a civil case, not a matter of criminal law.\n\nYou can file a lawsuit against the merchant and your bank **but this is rarely necessary to resolve this type of issues.**\n\n---\n\nTo alleviate your fears and encourage use of credit cards, payment networks (Visa/Mastercard/Amex/etc.) usually require stronger consumer protection process as a condition for banks and merchants to participate in the network.\n\nYou are also [protected by law](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/resolving-unauthorized-transaction.html) against unauthorized credit card charges.\n\n> Unauthorized credit card transaction\n> \n> \n> When an unauthorized transaction is made with your credit card, your maximum liability, by law, can't be more than $50\\.00\\. Your credit card agreement must explain your maximum liability if your card is used without your permission.\n> \n> \n> Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Interac have committed to protect you against financial loss if your credit or debit card is used without your permission. According to this public commitment, you will not be held responsible for the unauthorized transactions and won't have to pay any fee.\n> \n> \n> [Learn more about these commitments and policies.](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/rights-responsibilities/protection-unauthorized-transactions.html) (*Link to policies of payment networks and your rights under law and relevant agreements*)\n\nIf you were charged fraudulently, the first thing and usually the only thing you need to try is the dispute process by your bank. The bank decides on the merits of your claim, and they usually favour the consumer. If the merchant disputes your dispute, a police report might be needed to convince the bank if there is an actual fraud involved.\n\nIf your dispute is successful, for credit cards, it is usually credited back to your account in a few days or within the next billing cycle.\n\n---\n\n> Will judge have enough time to hear my case?\n\nIf your bank and the merchant refuse to refund you, you may bring a claim before a competent court. Usually for 2000$, it would be in a small claims court with simplified procedures. Judges do hear these cases. In many if not most cases, a settlement is made before trial. In some jurisdictions (e.g. [Ontario](https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/What_is_Small_Claims_Court_EN.html)), a mediation\\-like settlement conference, led by a deputy judge, is mandatory before going to trial. The deputy judge usually makes some preliminary comments on the strengths and weaknesses on each party's claims/defences and many people choose to withdraw or settle at this stage.\n\nBefore COVID, this usually takes within a few months after a claim is served to the defendant and the defendant files a defence.\n\nIf the defendant ignores the claim, you usually get a default judgement in favour of you.\n\nIf you win in court, an order to pay is issued against the defendant and if it is not paid in time, you can apply to the court to enforce the order by e.g. garnishment or seizure.",

The documentation states that \"If you were charged fraudulently, the first thing and usually the only thing you need to try is the dispute process by your bank.\" Banks often favor the consumer in these disputes, and this process is generally faster and easier than other options.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while you can file a police report, it's not typically the first step, especially for unintentional errors.

As stated in the documentation, restraint of trade clauses are limited to what is reasonable to protect the employer's interests. This reasonableness applies to both job role and geographic location. For instance, a worldwide restriction might be reasonable for a high-level executive but not for a lower-level employee.

The employee was visibly white, and neither party disputes that black employees regularly use such language and face no disciplinary action as a result.\n\nFrom Bostock: \u201cAn employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cSex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\u201d\n\nIt is obvious that he was fired for actions it would not have questioned (and has not) in members of a different race. Is this not exactly what Title VII forbids?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Bostock is irrelevant. Your friend can sue under [*Burlington v. News Corp.*](https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/10D1325P.pdf)**\n\n*Burlington* answered this exact question **ten years ago,** using exactly the same, well\\-established logic used in *Bostock.*\n\n*Burlington* involved a news anchor (Burlington) who was fired after using the N\\-word descriptively in a staff meeting. He sued under [Title VII.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2) He argued he was being discriminated against on racial grounds, since several Black employees had used the word at work without consequence.\n\nThe case was tried before a jury in Federal district court. Burlington lost after the jury decided the facts did not support his claim. However, the judge made clear that the actions he alleged would violate Title VII:\n\n> Historically, African Americans' use of the word has been ironic, satirical, or even affectionate. Too often, however, the word has been used by whites as a tool to belittle, oppress, or dehumanize African Americans. When viewed in its historical context, one can see how people in general, and African Americans in particular, might react differently when a white person uses the word than if an African American uses it.\n\n> **Nevertheless, we are unable to conclude that this is a justifiable reason for permitting the Station to draw race\\-based distinctions between employees.** It is no answer to say that we are interpreting Title VII in accord with prevailing social norms. Title VII was enacted to counter social norms that supported widespread discrimination against African Americans. To conclude that the Station may act in accordance with the social norm that it is permissible for African Americans to use the word but not whites would require a determination that this is a \"good\" race\\-based social norm that justifies a departure from the text of Title VII. **Neither the text of Title VII, the legislative history, nor the caselaw permits such a departure from Title VII's command that employers refrain from \"discriminat\\[ing] against any individual...because of such individual's race.\"**\n\n**Added: Why *Bostock* is Irrelevant for Your Friend\u2019s Case:**\n\nAs you say, if we substitute the word \u201crace\u201d for \u201csex\u201d in those sentences from *Bostock,* it seems obvious your friend would have a case under Title VII. This is true, but not *because of* *Bostock.* *Bostock* changed who could claim sex discrimination under Title VII, but nothing else. In particular, it did not change the test used to prove discrimination under Title VII. The sentences you quoted, use the well\\-established *\u201dbut for\u201d* test.\n\nHere's Gorsuch\u2019s [explanation](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf#page=9) of how the *\"but for\"* test works:\n\n> In the language of law, Title VII\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u201d test incorporates the \u201csimple\u201d and *\u201ctraditional\u201d* standard of *but\\-for causation.* That form of causation is established whenever a particular outcome would not have happened *\u201cbut for\u201d* the purported cause. In other words, a *but\\-for test* directs us to change one thing at a time and see if the outcome changes. If it does, we have found a *but\\-for cause.*\n\n**The Bottom Line:** *Bostock* is illustrative, but not dispositive, of your friend's claim.",

The case of Burlington v. News Corp. directly addressed a similar situation where a white employee was fired for using the N-word, while Black employees were not disciplined for similar language use. The court in Burlington ruled that such differential treatment based on race could violate Title VII, even if it aligns with social norms. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while Bostock v. Clayton County uses similar reasoning about discrimination, it specifically deals with sex discrimination and is not directly applicable to this race-based scenario.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the Burlington case established that if the employer treats employees differently based on race for the same behavior, it could be considered discrimination under Title VII.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the presence or absence of a written policy is not the determining factor. The key issue is whether the employer applied different standards based on race, which could violate Title VII regardless of written policies."

The impact that the duration of these statements have on the customer is negligible at best, since omitting these statements does not improve the company's response time anyway.\n\nThe statement \"*your call is important to us*\" might not even be a lie. Many companies know that it is in their best interest to gather information from their customers on what to improve, lest customers switch to a competitor or file suit.\n\nThe lack of objective standards renders statements such as \"*best pizza in town*\" unascertainable. Accordingly, it would be unreasonable for a customer to rely on criteria that are subjective, undefined, unclear, and/or palpably fictitious.\n\nOnly statements like \"*scientifically proven*\" and \"*lose x pounds in y hours*\" might be within scope of consumer protection laws (see also *unfair and misleading practices*). The assessment of those scenarios requires more detail, including disclaimers and other \"small letters\" that are \\-\\-or ought to be\\-\\- disclosed no later than the formation of the contract.",

It's a common phrase used in customer service and doesn't make any claims that could lead to damages.\n\nB) This is another common phrase that, while potentially untrue, is unlikely to cause any material damage to a customer. It's generally seen as a way to manage customer expectations rather than a claim that could be actionable.\n\nC) This statement is the most likely to be considered actionable under consumer protection laws. It makes a specific, measurable claim (\"20 pounds in 2 days\") and asserts that it's \"scientifically proven.\" If this claim is false or misleading, it could lead customers to make purchasing decisions based on false information, potentially resulting in financial loss or other damages.\n\nD) While this statement is promotional, it's generally considered puffery - a subjective claim that can't be proven true or false. \"Best pizza\" is a matter of opinion, and \"in town\" is vague. Courts typically don't consider such subjective claims to be actionable.\n\nThe key difference is that option C makes a specific, measurable claim that is presented as factual and scientifically backed, whereas the other options are either inconsequential, common business phrases, or subjective promotional statements."

No time zone is explicitly stated in the contract. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the contract's effective time?\n\nA) The contract will come into effect simultaneously for all parties at 23:00 GMT, as Greenwich Mean Time is the default for international contracts.\n\nB) The contract will come into effect at different local times: 23:00 in London, 00:00 (Jan 2) in Paris, and 01:00 (Jan 2) in Athens.\n\nC) The contract is invalid due to the lack of a specified time zone, and must be renegotiated with a clear time zone stated.\n\nD) The contract will come into effect at 23:00 in each location's local time, meaning it will take effect at three different moments.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: When dealing with international contracts or agreements that span multiple time zones, it's crucial to specify the time zone if simultaneous action is required. In this case, since no time zone was specified, the most reasonable interpretation would be that the contract takes effect at the stated time in each location's local time zone. This means it would become effective at 23:00 in London (GMT/UTC), which would be 00:00 (midnight) on January 2 in Paris (CET, UTC+1), and 01:00 on January 2 in Athens (EET, UTC+2). Option A is incorrect because there isn't a universal default time zone for international contracts. Option C is too extreme; the contract isn't necessarily invalid, just potentially ambiguous. Option D is incorrect because it would result in the contract taking effect at three different moments, which is unlikely to be the intent."

What does it mean for an interested to be vested or unvested?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A vested interest is a type of property interest. Black's Law Dictionary provides this definition:\n\n> Accrued; fixed; settled; absolute ; having the character or giving the rights of absolute ownership; not contingent; not subject to be defeated by a condition precedent.\n\nIn other words, a holder's interest in property is vested when he does not need to satisfy any further conditions before claiming his property. This is in contrast to a *contingent* interest which does not become vested until some condition is satisfied.\n\nIn the United States, the most familiar example may be in the retirement context. An employer may offer to match your contributions to your 401(k) plan, with the match vesting after one year.\n\nIn that case, your employer should deposit matching funds into an account in your name as soon as you begin work, but for the first 12 months, you do not actually have the right to access or use those funds. Once a year has passed, though, you are not required to do anything else to take control of the matching funds, so you are said to have a vested interest in those funds \\-\\- you may withdraw them if you please, and the employer no longer has any claim to them.\n\nThe colloquial sense of vested interest is therefore inconsistent with the legal definition. For instance, in reporting on San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin's reelection campaign, Fox News described writer Shaun King as having  [\"a vested interest in the controversial DA,\"](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shaun-king-group-involved-save-san-francisco-da-boudin-recall-election) based on their mutual involvement in a nonprofit organization. But absent the repeal of the Thirteenth Amendment, it is not possible to have a vested interest in another person.\n\nLikewise, reports that [a politician has a vested interest in some policy](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/05/29/i-was-a-texas-gop-legislator-we-couldnt-stand-up-to-gun-violence/), that an [international organization has a vested interest in global economic development](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/russia-ukraine-war-naftogaz-says-opec-is-on-the-wrong-side-of-history.html) or that [a coach has a vested interest in his players' health](https://www.si.com/nba/2022/05/10/monty-williams-safety-suggestion-incident-involving-chris-paul-family) make no sense when applying the legal definition. None of these things are property to begin with, let alone property that these people could actually be said to hold an interest in with no preconditions.\n\nIt is likely that in the vast majority of cases, references to a \"vested interest\" should simply say \"interest.\"",

Sarah's interest in the vested portion is not contingent; it's fully vested.\nB) Incorrect. This understates Sarah's vested interest. After 2.5 years, more than 37.5% would be vested.\nC) Correct. With a 1-year cliff, Sarah became 25% vested after her first year. Then, she continued to vest at a rate of 25% per year. After 2.5 years, she has vested 25% (1st year) + 25% (2nd year) + 12.5% (half of 3rd year) = 62.5%.\nD) Incorrect.

My quandary is as follows:\n\nGenerally a business is under no obligation to accept pennies as a form of payment.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury states that:\n\n> no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an\n> organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods\n> and/or services.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how this concept applies to a situation where a tenant is using pennies to pay for his rent and the landlord is refusing to accept pennies as a form of payment.\n\nThe lease between the landlord and tenant does not stipulate that the tenant must pay using a specific form of money. However, it does allow the landlord to evict if the tenant does not pay the rent within 60 days after it is due.\n\nIf the tenant offers to pay rent in pennies \\& the landlord refuses to accept payment, does that mean that the tenant is in violation of the lease agreement which states that the tenant can be evicted if \"he does not pay rent within 60 days after it is due\"? In other words, while I understand the landlord has a right to reject the rent, the tenant may have fulfilled his obligation as it relates to the terms of the lease as soon as he offered to pay rent?\n\nAdditionally, the tenant could argue that if he pays after the due date it is like a debt which can be paid off in any form. Since rent is due at the beginning of each month, if the tenant pays his rent several days after the rent is due, the payment is now considered payment for a debt which would require the landlord to accept it in any form?\n\nSection 31 U.S.C. 5103, states:\n\n> United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and\n> circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are\n> legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign\n> gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\n\nWho has the upper hand in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nI write that so often I should get a stamp made.\n\nIf the contract is silent, then it is implied that payment in US currency is acceptable, as is any other method of payment the parties agree to. As you have correctly quoted, there is no limit to the number of US coins that are valid for payments, unlike in many other jurisdictions where there is such a limit.\n\nAccept the coins, make the tenant wait while you count them one by one and then give them a receipt. Oh, and change your lease when you can to nominate sensible forms of payment like electronic transfer.",

The lease agreement does not specify acceptable forms of payment. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can refuse the pennies and immediately evict the tenant for non-payment of rent.\nB) The landlord must accept the pennies as they are legal tender for all debts.\nC) The landlord can refuse the pennies, but cannot evict the tenant if they offered payment within the specified timeframe.\nD) The landlord can only refuse the pennies if they modify the lease agreement first.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The landlord can refuse to accept the pennies as payment, as there is no federal law requiring private businesses to accept specific forms of currency. However, if the tenant offered to pay the rent within the timeframe specified in the lease (60 days after it is due), they may have fulfilled their obligation under the terms of the lease. The landlord's refusal to accept the offered payment doesn't automatically put the tenant in violation of the lease agreement. Therefore, while the landlord can refuse the pennies, they likely cannot evict the tenant solely on these grounds if the tenant attempted to pay within the specified timeframe. The most prudent course of action would be for the landlord to accept the coins, count them carefully, provide a receipt, and then modify the lease agreement to specify acceptable forms of payment for future transactions."

Or a gift from my family?\n\nAnother way to ask this is:\nDoes inheritance always happen posthumously?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\n**Inheritance** usually refers only to a post\\-humous transfer, but that usage isn't absolute. There are circumstances when people will use the word in an extremely broad sense that also includes large transfers received during the donor's life in lieu of a true **inheritance** received at death, and it isn't completely incorrect to do so.\n\nFor example, if the stock made up 90% or 100% ownership in a family business, often this might be called an **inheritance** even if it was received while the donors were alive.\n\nStill, if you received the stock while the donors were alive, the preferred term would be to call it a **gift** (even though a **gift** can include gifts made during life and gifts made upon death).\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nIf you receive something because someone died and their will says that you should receive it, the proper legal term for this is a **devise**. You are a **devisee**. A **devise** and **bequest** and **legacy** are close synonyms. Historically, a gift by will of personal property at death was called a **bequest** or a **legacy**, and a gift by will of real property at death was called a **devise**, but the terms are now often used more or less interchangably.\n\nThe original primary meaning of the word **legacy** has become a secondary and technical one in contemporary usage. Now, the term **legacy** is primarily used to refer to the reputation that someone (usually, but not always, someone who has died or at least ceased to participate in a particular field in which they are distinguished) has left behind and is associate with.\n\nIf you receive something because someone died and they didn't have a will, the proper legal term for this is an **inheritance** and you are an **heir.** (In civil law jurisdictions not derived from the laws of England where English is spoken, such as Louisiana, there is also the term a **testamentary inheritance** which means a **devise** or **bequest** in the narrow technical senses of those words.)\n\nHowever, many people (even in legal circumstances) use the term **inheritance** to refer to anything received as a consequence of someone's death even if it was pursuant to something other than **intestate succession** (which is the passing of property at death other than pursuant to a will or a beneficiary designation or joint ownership). And, the term **heir** is likewise sometimes used more generally to refer to anyone receiving an **inheritance** in the broader sense of the word.\n\nThe term **heir** also refers to someone who would be entitled to receive an **intestate succession** at the time if someone died, even in the absence of any actual inheritance or death. This narrow sense of the word is also called an **heir at law**. And the term **heir** is also used in a slightly different sense to refer to someone who would receive the property or feudal title of someone if they died, even if this is not pursuant to **intestate succession**. If one wants to distinguish this sense of this paragraph from other senses of the word **heir**, one can say **heir apparent**.\n\n(There are also non\\-literal senses of the words **inheritance** and **heir** that refer to people who are recipients of intellectual contributions made by someone or some movement. Similarly, there is a technical sense of the word in genetics which means to receive a trait genetically from a parent. More generally, sometimes the semantic focus when one uses the word **inheritance** is on the fact that something is received by someone in a younger generation from an older generation, rather than on the timing of the transfer.)\n\nIf you receive property from a trust or a beneficiary designation you are a **transferee** also called a **beneficiary** and the technical terms for this are **non\\-probate transfer** or **distribution**.\n\nThe term **gift** usually refers to a transfer of property during life, but the strict technical meaning of the word **gift** includes both gifts made during life and gifts given as a consequence of a death. The strict technical term for a gift given during life when the context doesn't make the fact that the donor is alive at the time of the gift is a **lifetime gift** or an **inter vivos gift**.\n\nWhile it is contrary to the technical meaning of the term **inheritance** and also to the broader literal meaning of the term **inheritance**, people sometimes the term **inheritance** very loosely to refer to a large **lifetime gift** made in lieu of an **inheritance** or **devise** or **bequest** at death. But, this usage is not appropriate in technical discussions.\n\nIf you received the stock during the life of the donor, it would be more clear and a better usage to say that it was a **gift**, rather than an **inheritance**, even though it would not be unheard of (and not absolutely incorrect) to call a large gift made during life in lieu of a transfer at death an **inheritance** and even though a **gift**, in theory, could be made after death. In this extremely broad, but literal, sense, **inheritance** refers to a substantial, usually one time, intergenerational transfer of wealth.\n\nAlso, when one talks about **inherited wealth** one is usually talking about all wealth received from lifetime gifts and gifts made upon death by any means, combined, rather than in the narrow sense of wealth received upon someone's death. Similarly, the word **inheritance** can be used in the sense of all of a person's **inherited wealth** rather than with respect to a particular transfer of property, and in this sense **inheritance** refers to all wealth received from lifetime gifts and gifts made upon death by any means, combined, rather than in the narrow sense of wealth received upon someone's death. Indeed, sometimes **inheritance** is used even more broadly still to refer to everything a person owns (i.e. all of their wealth) without regard to its source, although this usage is usually limited to poetic or religious uses of the word.\n\n(While I don't cite to sources here, I have been an estate planning attorney for twenty years and just yesterday taught a course to attorneys and accountants that spent the first 40 minutes or so defining these terms.)\n\nThe [origin of the word inherit](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/inherit) is as follows:\n\n> Middle English enherite \u2018receive as a right\u2019, from Old French\n> enheriter, from late Latin inhereditare \u2018appoint as heir\u2019, from Latin\n> in\\- \u2018in\u2019 \\+ heres, hered\\- \u2018heir\u2019.",

While the term is often used more broadly in common language, the technical legal definition is narrower. Option A is too broad, including lifetime gifts. Option B is close but includes property received through a will, which is technically called a \"devise\". Option D combines both devise and intestate succession, which is a broader use of the term than its strictest legal definition. Option C correctly identifies that inheritance, in its most precise legal sense, refers to property received through intestate succession when there is no will."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In California small claims court, an \"Assignee of Record\" refers to:\n\nA) A court-appointed representative who manages the case on behalf of the plaintiff\nB) An individual or entity that has legally acquired the right to pursue a claim from the original creditor\nC) A neutral third party who acts as a mediator between the plaintiff and defendant\nD) The original plaintiff who initiated the small claims case\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: An \"Assignee of Record\" in California small claims court typically refers to an individual or entity that has legally acquired the right to pursue a claim from the original creditor. This often occurs when debts are sold or transferred to collection agencies or other parties. The assignee then has the legal right to file a claim and pursue the debt in small claims court, stepping into the shoes of the original creditor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because court-appointed representatives are not typically used in small claims cases. Option C is wrong because mediators are separate from the parties involved in the case. Option D is incorrect because the assignee is different from the original creditor or plaintiff.\n\nThis question tests understanding of legal terminology specific to California small claims procedures and the concept of debt assignment, making it challenging for those without specific knowledge of these topics."

There is also the option of paying \\~\u20ac6000 and just doing your military service for 3weeks, but I don't want to do it either; I don't have that much money for that kind of thing.\n\nNow, I want to become a German citizen by naturalisation, but Germany doesn't allow me to have dual citizenship *unless I have no other options*.\n\nTo do that, I want to renounce my Turkish citizenship but the government will be asking me to do my military service in a couple of months and I have no other excuse to give them, so I'll be a deserter, and the Turkish government doesn't allow anyone to renounce their citizenship if they deserted from their military service.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have recently take a lunch in a pub (in France) and when i have buy a sandwich there was a 15% tax because i choose the \"on the spot\" formula. This tax wasn't indicated anywhere in the pub. Is this legal or not ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a consumer protection point of view, it is not legal:\n\nMy first thought was that there is a similar issue under French tax law as under German tax law when distinguishing the taxation of food sold, and the taxation of food provided under a contract that has elements of a sales contract as well as a service contract (i.e. eating in a restaurant). Where food is sold to take away, it is taxed at 7% value added tax (VAT), while food served in a restaurant is taxed at 19% VAT.\n\nHowever, the additional 15% are not a tax, especially not a higher rate of VAT. As pointed out VAT often has different tax rates for specific goods and services to meet certain policy goals. Some or all food often attracts a lower tax rate to decrease the economic burden on the poorer demographic. \n\nFrance has four VAT tax [rates](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf): \n\n1. super\\-reduced rate: 2,2%\n2. reduced rate: 5,5% or 10%\n3. standard rate: 20%\n\nWhile **foodstuffs** can attract all tax rates, **restaurant and catering services** only attract the **reduced rate** at either 5,5% or 10%. But the 5,5% rate only applies to school cantines. All other restaurant services attract the 10% rate, with the exception of alcoholic beverages, which are liable to 20%.\n\nConsequently, the additional 15% are not a tax, but a 'service fee' for additional services rendered, such as plates, tables, glasses etc.\n\nIf it is true that there was no display in the pub that mentioned this service fee, this might have violated provision **L113\\-3** of French Consumer Code (**Code de consommation**), which states:\n\n> Article L113\\-3\n>  Tout vendeur de produit ou tout prestataire de services doit, par voie de marquage, d'\u00e9tiquetage, d'affichage ou par tout autre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 appropri\u00e9, informer le consommateur sur les prix et les conditions particuli\u00e8res de la vente et de l'ex\u00e9cution des services, selon des modalit\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par arr\u00eat\u00e9s du ministre charg\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie, apr\u00e8s consultation du Conseil national de la consommation.\n\nFrom this follows that the restaurant as service provider must inform the consumer about the price.\n\nA violation in contravention of said law allows for the imposition of an **administrative fine** of up to **15000,\\- \u20ac**:\n\n> Tout manquement \u00e0 l'article L. 113\\-3 et aux arr\u00eat\u00e9s pris pour son application et \u00e0 l'article L. 113\\-3\\-1 est passible d'une amende administrative dont le montant ne peut exc\u00e9der 3 000 \u20ac pour une personne physique et 15 000 \u20ac pour une personne morale. L'amende est prononc\u00e9e dans les conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article L. 141\\-1\\-2\\.\n\nHowever, this does not answer whether a customer might be able to reclaim the money where the display of the price was not made in accordance of said law.\n\nFurthermore, the question remains whether the service fee was incorporated into the service contract as a standard term. Unfortunately, I cannot answer that question. Another issue could be that the fee was nonetheless paid and this could be construed as a waiver.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) The 15% charge is a legal VAT increase for on-premises consumption and does not need to be displayed.\n\nB) The charge is illegal because all fees must be clearly displayed according to French consumer protection laws, and the pub could face a fine of up to 15,000 euros.\n\nC) The charge is legal as long as it's listed on the final bill, even if not displayed in advance.\n\nD) The customer has no recourse because paying the bill constitutes a waiver of any right to dispute hidden charges.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to French Consumer Code (Code de consommation) Article L113-3, all service providers must inform consumers about prices and particular conditions of sale. Failure to display this information violates consumer protection laws. The pub could face an administrative fine of up to 15,000 euros for a legal entity (business) for this violation. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the 15% is not a VAT increase but a service fee, and it still needs to be displayed. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the law requires prices to be displayed in advance, not just on the final bill. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while payment might complicate the issue, it doesn't automatically waive the customer's rights under consumer protection laws."

However, the charges only seem to apply if Congress can quickly dig up proof of a lie. Otherwise, if the perjurer makes it five years without his lie being discovered, it's like the crime was never committed. \n\nThe 'Committee Classified' documents that the Democrats released a day or two ago seem to contain evidence of Kavanaugh perjuring himself before Congress at least five times, all more than five years ago. \n\nWhat is the justification for the statute of limitations being set at five years from commission, and are crimes beyond the statute of limitations able to be presented as background in cases of future wrongdoing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, the Speedy Trial Clause and the Due Process Clauses require some limit on the time the accused has to wait for trial. A statute of limitations statutorily encodes what is a reasonable delay (if SCOTUS thinks that 5 years is too long a time, they can so rule and Congress will have to change the law). The practical rationale for limiting the delay on trying a person is that after 30 years, memory of the details surrounding an event are likely to be very unreliable, so that witnesses on both sides are of limited value. In addition, the limit motivates law enforcement to investigate the problem in a timely manner.\n\nThe federal law, [in the general (noncapital) case](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3282), is that the limit for all crimes is 5 years, There are various longer limitations, including none for capital offenses. [Criminal contempt](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3285) has a shorter limit of one year, and otherwise 5 years is the shortest period for criminal prosecution at the federal level. The reason why perjury has a 5 year limit is that it is not one of the specific more serious offenses and it is not criminal contempt. [The limit in 1948](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/80th-congress/session-2/c80s2ch645.pdf) was 3 years, and was [increased to 5 years](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-68/pdf/STATUTE-68-Pg1142.pdf) in 1954\\. You could look for records of congressional debate to see why they increased that from the original limit ([1 Stat 119](http://loc.gov/law//help/statutes-at-large/1st-congress/c1.pdf)) of 2 years for non\\-capital offenses.\n\nYou could make a political argument for a longer or shorter limit, on Politics SE: the point is that no limit could cause constitutional problems, and nitpicking over 2 vs. 5 is strictly political.",

This was, of course a request for an injunction, not a criminal proceeding, but it is hard rto imagine that a criminal proceeding could have succeeded after the decision, and in fact no prosecution was attempted.\n\nAt the start of [the unsigned opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/713/), the court wrote:\n\n> We granted certiorari in these cases in which the United States seeks to enjoin the New York Times and the Washington Post from publishing the contents of a **classified** study entitled \"History of U.S. Decision\\-Making Process on Viet Nam Policy.\" (*emphasis added*)\n\nThis makes it clear that the content of the \"papers\" wa officially classified.\n\nIn concurrence, Justice Black (joined by Douglas) wrote:\n\n> I adhere to the view that the Government's case against the Washington Post should have been dismissed, and that the injunction against the New York Times should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases were first presented to this Court. I believe that every moment's continuance of the injunctions against these newspapers amounts to a flagrant, indefensible, and continuing violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThe question asks:\n\n> I am wondering if everyone who leaks classified military documents are going to be charged criminally by the U.S. government\n\nEven when such charges are constitutionally permitted, the government has the authority not to proceed with them, if it so chooses, for whatever reason it sees fit.\n\n### Specific laws\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 793**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793) prohibits conveying various information about the national defense, military equipment, or preparations for war:\n\n> with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\n\n\u00a7 793 does not refer to classification status at all, and it has no explicit excptions, but it would not apply where ther is no \"intent or reason to believe\" the information will harm the US or help another country.\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 794**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/794) has an intent requirement simialr to that of 793, but covers different kinds of information. Some of its provisions apply only in wartime, and then the required intent is that the information \"will be communicated to the enemy\". Again classification is not mentioned.\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 795**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/795) Covers making images of \"vital military and naval installations or equipment\" protected by order of the President. Permission of the relevant military commander is required. No exceptions are listed.\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 796**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/796) is similar to \u00a7 795 but limited to images obtained by use of aircraft. No exceptions are listed.\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 797**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/797) prohibits publication of images taken in violation of \u00a7 795, unless approved by a censor. It is in form a prior restraint. No exceptions are listed.\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 798**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798) Prohibits disclosure of information about cryptographic systems. No exceptions are listed, but I think there is caselaw limiting the coverage of this section.\n\n[**18 USC \u00a7 799**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/799) prohibits violation of NASA security regulations.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case involving the leak of classified military documents, which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to result in criminal prosecution under U.S. law?\n\nA) A journalist publishes classified information about U.S. cryptographic systems without authorization.\n\nB) An activist leaks classified documents about Vietnam War decision-making to major newspapers, with the intent of informing the public about government actions.\n\nC) A military officer shares classified information about vital naval installations with a foreign government, believing it will give that nation a strategic advantage.\n\nD) A civilian employee takes unauthorized photos of classified military equipment and posts them on social media.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the least likely to result in criminal prosecution based on the information provided. This scenario closely resembles the Pentagon Papers case (New York Times Co. v. United States), where the Supreme Court allowed the publication of classified information about Vietnam War decision-making. The Court emphasized First Amendment protections in this case, making it difficult to prosecute such disclosures, especially when the intent is to inform the public rather than harm the U.S. or aid foreign nations.\n\nOption A would likely be prosecuted under 18 USC \u00a7 798, which specifically prohibits disclosure of cryptographic information. \n\nOption C clearly violates 18 USC \u00a7 793, as it involves intent to advantage a foreign nation. \n\nOption D would likely violate 18 USC \u00a7 795, which prohibits unauthorized imaging of vital military installations or equipment.\n\nWhile all options involve classified information, option B has the strongest legal precedent for protection under the First Amendment, making it the least likely to face successful criminal prosecution."

In order to win in such a lawsuit, you would have to prove that the damage resulted from the contractor's negligent actions or inactions. To show this, you have have to establish exactly what was done (or not done) by the contractor that resulted in damage, and you must show that this was not a decision that would be made by a professional exhibiting ordinary caution. That means then that you would need an expert who would testify as to the requirements of core, professional standards, and what (forensically) was actually done. The contractor will of course have his own expert to testify on these matters (who may testify \"schedule 40 pipe is standardly used in such jobs\", disagreeing with testimony from your expert who might say \"I would have used schedule 60 pipe\"). The point is that proving that a job was not done correctly is not trivial.",

Two weeks later, a leak occurs, causing extensive water damage to the floors and walls. The homeowner wants to sue the plumber for negligence. Which of the following is NOT a requirement for the homeowner to successfully prove their case?\n\nA) Establish exactly what actions or inactions by the plumber resulted in the damage\nB) Provide expert testimony on professional plumbing standards and practices\nC) Demonstrate that the plumber's decisions deviated from those of a professional exhibiting ordinary caution\nD) Show that the plumber used lower quality materials than what was agreed upon in the contract\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Options A, B, and C are all necessary components for proving negligence in a case against a service provider, as outlined in the given information. The homeowner must establish what the plumber did or didn't do that caused the damage, provide expert testimony on professional standards, and show that the plumber's actions deviated from ordinary professional caution.\n\nOption D, however, is not mentioned as a requirement in the given information. While using lower quality materials than agreed upon could potentially be part of a breach of contract claim, it's not a necessary element for proving negligence in this context. The focus is on whether the plumber's work met professional standards, not necessarily on the specific materials used (unless those materials were below professional standards, which would be covered by the other requirements).\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant factors in a legal negligence case against a service provider, based on the information provided."

The flight attendant hands over immigration/customs cards. Alice digs out her pen and fills in her form. Bob carries on with his meal in not so tidy way: his hands clearly become fat smeared.\n\nAlice finishes with her form, and Bob finishes with his meal. Now Bob wants to fill in his form but he hasn't got a pen. He asks Alice to borrow hers.\n\nAlice doesn't want her pen to be held by Bob's fatty hands but she doesn't want to appear rude either. She says that she will let him use her pen provided that he first goes to the lavatory and washes his hands with soap.\n\nSetting aside the apparent absence of intention to create legal relations, and the obvious [de minimis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis), does this situation otherwise satisfy the legal requirements for a contract? Is the act that Bob washes his hands valid consideration on his side?\n\nIf the answer to the above is *Yes*, is there any line dividing *contract* and mere *permission* to use things subject to certain conditions?\n\nAnswers for any jurisdictions are welcome, though mostly interested in [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) ones.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consideration\n-------------\n\nConsideration is essential on both sides of every simple common law contract (civil law is different). It is the *quid pro quo* or \"something for something\" that is the essence of a contract \\- it's what turns an unenforcable agreement into a contract.\n\nA formal contract supported by a deed does not need consideration.\n\nThe rules of consideration are that it:\n\n1. must move from the promisee, but need not move to the promissor. For example, you promising me to wash someone else's car is good consideration.\n2. may be 'executed' (something for something now) or 'executory' (something for something in the future) but it cannot be 'past' (something that has already occurred before the contract came into existence \\- noting that that exact moment might be somewhat nebulous).\n3. need not be adequate. If I agree to sell you my home for $1 this is clearly not adequate (in most circumstances) but the $1 is good consideration.\n4. must be sufficient. This is not the same as adequate. Insufficient consideration falls under the following headings \n\n\t* performance of a duty imposed by law\n\t* performance of a duty already imposed by another contract\n\t* moral obligations\n\t* uncertain or indefinite promises.\n5. Possible to perform \\- both legally and practically.\n\nWhat is promised does not need to have intrinsic value and can be a promise to do something or to refrain from doing something.\n\nCondition\n---------\n\n\"Condition\" has several meanings in contract law.\n\n**Condition of a Contract**\n\nA condition in a contract is an essential term the breach of which entitles the innocent party to either:\n\n1. affirm the contract and sue for damages, or\n2. treat itself as no longer under an obligation to perform the contract \\- but rights which had accrued up until that time continue.\n\nA term that is not a condition is a warranty. Breach of a warranty allows suing for damages but does not allow the innocent party to escape their obligations.\n\nWhether a term is a condition or a warranty depends on how essential it is \\- if it was so essential that the innocent party would not have entered the contract without it, it's a condition. The egregiousness of the breach can affect this as well \\- a term requiring payment on the 1st of each month is likely to be a warranty if payments are consistently made on the 3rd but a condition if they are constantly 2 months late.\n\n**Condition Precedent**\n\nA condition precedent is one which must be satisfied before a contract becomes binding.\n\n1. A condition precedent to the formation or existence of a contract. There are no enforcable rights on either party until the condition is fulfilled. Usually, this condition depends on a third\\-party. For example, an offer to buy real estate \"subject to finance\" is not a contract if the finance is not forthcoming.\n2. A condition which is precedent (a pre\\-requisite) to the obligation of a party to perform its part of the contract. For example, a requirement that delivery must be before 9\\.00 am on Wednesday or there is no binding contract. This can alternatively be thought of as the parties providing within the contract a mechanism for its discharge.\n\n**Condition Subsequent**\n\nIs a condition terminating the contract (either automatically or on the election of one of the parties) when it occurs. For example, a contract for the supply of iron ore while the price is above $X/ton \\- if the price drops lower the contract ends.\n\n**Other uses**\n\nOutside of contract law, the word \"condition\" is used a lot; most usually in its common English construction of \"If \\[condition] then \\[consequence]\". For example, \"if I put the basketball through the hoop, my team gets 2 (or 3 or 1\\) points\" \\- that's a condition of getting the points but it's not a contractual obligation.\n\nBob and Alice\n-------------\n\n**Bob washing his hands**\n\n1. It moves from Bob \\- that is, Bob has to do something. It doesn't move to Alice (apart from her not having to sensorily experience Bob's greasy fat\\-smeared hands anymore).\n2. It is executory \\- Bob may have washed his hands in the past (we can hope) but this particular contract requires him to wash them in the future.\n3. It doesn't have to be adequate although in the context of this contract it probably is anyway.\n4. It is sufficient \\- Bob is under no legal or moral obligation to wash his hands.\n5. It's possible to perform \\- it is neither illegal nor physically impossible for Bob to wash his hands.\n\n**Alice lending the pen**\n\n1. It moves from Alice and it this case, to Bob.\n2. It is executory \\- Alice will lend the pen in the future.\n3. It doesn't have to be adequate although in the context of this contract it probably is anyway.\n4. It is sufficient \\- Alice is under no legal or moral obligation to lend Bob her pen.\n5. It's possible to perform \\- it is neither illegal nor physically impossible for Alice to lend the pen.\n\nBob washing his hands is *also* a condition of the contract \\- if Bob does not wash his hands, Alice can either affirm the contract and sue for (admittedly small) damages or terminate the contract and keep whatever benefits she has accrued (none).\n\nAnd, it's a condition subsequent, until Bob washes his hands, Alice has no obligations under the contract.",

The Act's definition of license plates includes those issued in other jurisdictions (Section 1(9)).

Falwell*, 485 U.S. 46 (1988\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/46). At the time, Campari Liqueur was running an ad campaign in which people talked about their first time drinking Campari, but in a context setting up extended double\\-entendres about losing their virginity. Playing off that format, Hustler ran a [fake interview with Jerry Falwell](https://frontpageconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Falwell-Ad-e1511466570818.jpg) about his \"first time,\" which can really only be understood if reprinted in full:\n\n> **Falwell:** My first time was in an outhouse outside Lynchburg, Virginia.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Wasn\u2019t it a little cramped?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Not after I kicked the goat out.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** I see. You must tell me all about it.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** I never really expected to make it with Mom, but then after she showed all the other guys in town such a good time, I figured, \"What the hell!\"\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** But your Mom? Isn\u2019t that a little odd?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** I don\u2019t think so. Looks don\u2019t mean that much to me in a woman.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Go on.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Well, we were drunk off our God\\-fearing asses on Campari, ginger ale and soda\u2014that\u2019s called a Fire and Brimstone\u2014at the time. And Mom looked better than a Baptist whore with a $100 donation.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Campari in the crapper with Mom. How interesting. Well, how was it?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** The Campari was great but Mom passed out before I could come.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Did you ever try it again?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Sure. Lots of times. But not in the outhouse. Between Mom and the shit, the flies were too much to bear.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** We meant the Campari.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Oh, yeah, I always get sloshed before I go to the pulpit. You don\u2019t think I could lay down all that bullshit sober do you?\n> \n> \n> **Campari, like all liquor, was made to mix you up. It's a light, 48\\-proof, refreshing spirit, just mild enough to make you drink too much before you know you're schnockered. For your first time, mix it with orange juice. Or maybe some white wine. Then you won't remember anything the next morning. Campari. The mixable that smarts.**\n\nPredictably, Falwell sued, claiming defamation and extreme emotional distress. A jury awarded Falwell $150,000, and Hustler appealed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Falwell could not recover for defamation because the ad \"was not reasonably believable,\" and that he could not recover for emotional distress because the First Amendment does permit such claims when \"the conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad parody involved here\":\n\n> Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate. ... From the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without them. ... There is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite sure that the pejorative description \"outrageous\" does not supply one.\n\nSince then, the principles from *Hustler* have evolved and distilled into a test that generally requires the plaintiff to prove that reasoanble readers would view the material in question as actually telling the truth about the defendant. For your hypothetical, then, the question would become whether people reading the website believed that about it.\n\nThis is a trickier question than it might sound like.

City of Parma*, 932 F.3d 421, 427\u201328 (6th Cir. 2019\\)](https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/19a0170p-06.pdf).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website creator makes a parody site about four lawyers and two law firms, using elements from popular TV shows like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. The site is clearly labeled as parody and contains humorous content that a reasonable person would not believe to be true. One of the lawyers featured decides to sue the website creator for defamation. Based on legal precedent, what is the most likely outcome of this case?\n\nA) The lawyer will win the defamation suit because the website uses the lawyer's name without permission.\n\nB) The website creator will be found liable for emotional distress, but not for defamation.\n\nC) The case will be dismissed because the website is protected as parody under the First Amendment.\n\nD) The lawyer will win the case if they can prove any financial damages resulting from the website.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the legal precedent set by Hustler Magazine v. Falwell and subsequent cases, parody is protected under the First Amendment. The key factors here are that the website is clearly labeled as parody and contains content that a reasonable person would not believe to be true. This aligns with the principle established in Hustler v. Falwell that material which is \"not reasonably believable\" cannot be grounds for defamation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because using someone's name in parody is not automatically grounds for a successful defamation suit. \n\nOption B is wrong because, as established in Hustler v. Falwell, claims for emotional distress cannot succeed when the conduct in question is protected parody. \n\nOption D is incorrect because even if financial damages occurred, they would not override First Amendment protections for parody that is not reasonably believable as fact."

In Flemming v. Nestor (1960), the Supreme Court ruled that Social Security benefits are not contractual rights or property rights. Instead, they are benefits that Congress can modify or terminate at any time, subject only to the Due Process Clause. This means that while beneficiaries have some procedural protections, they do not have a guaranteed right to receive benefits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court explicitly stated that Social Security benefits are not constitutionally protected property rights.\n\nOption B is wrong because the Court ruled that these benefits are not contractual obligations and are not protected by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Social Security benefits are not considered part of the \"public debt\" referenced in the 14th Amendment. The Court's ruling clarifies that these benefits are separate from constitutional debt obligations.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the legal status of Social Security benefits as defined by a key Supreme Court decision, challenging students to differentiate between various legal concepts such as property rights, contractual obligations, and congressional authority over social programs."

Alice and Bob would file for divorce in California and the matter would be adjudicated under a Californian court and under Californian law. After these proceedings, Alice and Bob would still be married in Afghanistan (and *maybe* other foreign countries? That\u2019s a tricky question, so if someone else can figure it out please leave a comment!) but the US would cease to recognize the marriage. In no case would either a Californian or Afghan court make a ruling under the other\u2019s laws.\n\nAs far as child custody, property, etc. the divorce would essentially proceed as a normal divorce case, although things could become complicated if Alice and Bob own property in Afghanistan, which would usually still be able to be appropriated by a Californian court but, once again, the matter is complex since Afghanistan still recognizes the marriage.\n\nAs you can tell, a divorce of this nature is not as complicated as one might think, but nevertheless could create some complicated legal situations. Also, marriage is regulated state\\-by\\-state, so other states may have different rules regarding foreign marriages. As always, the best path of action is to consult an attorney who specializes in divorce.\n\nEdit: A commenter brought up the issue of whether California would recognize a marriage where both parties weren\u2019t present.

According to the information provided, if both Alice and Bob are legal permanent residents of California, a California court would have jurisdiction to dissolve their marriage under California law, regardless of where or how the marriage was originally conducted. However, this dissolution would only be recognized within the United States.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company wants to adopt a \"pay-what-you-want\" model for their product, allowing users to download it for free or pay any amount they choose. The company is considering describing themselves as a non-profit to encourage donations. Which of the following statements is most accurate and advisable regarding this situation?\n\nA) The company can call itself a non-profit as long as it allows free downloads, even without official registration.\n\nB) The company should register as a non-profit with the IRS to legally use the term and benefit from tax exemptions.\n\nC) The company should avoid using the term \"non-profit\" and instead describe their model as \"shareware\" or \"pay-what-you-want\".\n\nD) The company can freely use the term \"non-profit\" as long as they don't make a profit from the downloads.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The company should avoid using the term \"non-profit\" unless they have officially registered as such with the IRS and meet specific criteria. Using the term without proper registration could lead to legal issues. Instead, they should describe their model accurately as \"shareware\" or \"pay-what-you-want\", which better reflects their business model without misrepresenting their status. Option A is incorrect because simply allowing free downloads doesn't qualify a company as a non-profit. Option B, while emphasizing the importance of registration, is not the best course of action if the company's primary purpose is selling software rather than a charitable cause. Option D is incorrect because non-profit status is not determined by whether a profit is made, but by official registration and adherence to specific rules about how funds are used."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A number of news reports have indicated that merchants who collect state sales taxes delay paying them for an indefinite amount of time and often pay them out of the following months' revenues. This in itself seems shady. They collect these taxes on behalf of the state.\n\nAnd while I do understand that they act as *reluctant* agents of the state when they do that, they don't seem to act as *good\\-faith* agents when they delay paying those taxes.\n\nIs there a process *in practice*, rather than in theory, to (1\\) record each transaction formally and formally inform each merchant that I will be paying those taxes to the state directly and (2\\) formally make a payment for each such transaction directly?\n\nAre there forms one has to fill out for each such occurrence? Or this process unorthodox enough that it would require a lawyer\\-drafted template both for recording and for making such payments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [wisconsin](/questions/tagged/wisconsin \"show questions tagged 'wisconsin'\")\n\nI think you may be misinformed on how businesses report/pay sales taxes. For sales tax, depending on the type of business you are and your expected taxable sales, you may be required to report your taxable sales quarterly, biannually, or annually. **Tax is due when the report is due** much like income tax, but these cannot be delayed like income tax filings.\n\nIf you fail to make a report, the State will estimate your taxes and send you a bill. This bill will include late fees and charges. There is no incentive for business owners to delay these filings and payments. In fact, not filing and not paying **may result in your sales and use tax certificate being revoked**, effectively putting you out of business.\n\nA business is also not required to set aside any certain amount from a single transaction and pay that to the State. They don't have to take $5 of your $100 transaction and put it in a \"sales tax\" envelope to send to the State. At the end of the period they have to calculate, $X in taxable sales \\* Y% tax rate \\= Total Tax bill, and pay that amount. They could pay it all from the last sale, or set aside a separate account, or a sub\\-account, etc.\n\nSo businesses don't have to pay immediately, they pay on a set schedule. The funds that they collect will most likely be deposited into a general account and the taxes paid out of that account at a later date. Yes, this may include revenue from the following month, *but who cares*? The point is that the tax is paid on time and in the amount required.\n\nBut to the question at hand... No, you cannot file a form or inform the business that you will pay tax directly. The business **is required by law** to collect those taxes at the time of the sale (unless you have a reseller certificate and they make those kinds of sales). They are not allowed to say \"sure, take the X% off the price and pay the state, we trust you\". They have to report taxable sales and pay the tax on those sales. Since your sale is \"taxable\", they are required to pay the tax on that, regardless of them collecting it from you or not.",

Making the functionality of the Program or modified version available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.\n> \n> \n> \u201cService Source Code\u201d means the Corresponding Source for the Program or the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service, including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available.\n\nIt seems to me that the hypothetical business plan violates section 13 of the license if the \"Service Source Code\" is not made available to each and every user. Whether D and D's associates plan to make, or in fact do make, a profit is irrelevant. The license requires releasing such source code even if the service is made available for free. If D is not willing to make such source code available, then D would be wise to use a database program available on different terms.\n\nNote that if D merely intends to run the DB program on D's own servers, but not provide access to the functionality of the DB to users, then there would be no requirement to provide any source code to anyone under the linked license. Whether the app in fact \"provides access to the functionality of the DB\" will depend on the exact function of the app, and may be a question of interpretation of the license. From the very brief description of the app in the question, it seems to me that it would. Before undertaking any such plan, D or anyone in D's position would be wise to consult a lawyer knowledgeable in open\\-source license law as it is applied in D's jurisdiction (which is not stated in the question at this time).",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding Dana's use of MongoDB Community Edition under its current license?\n\nA) Dana can use MongoDB Community Edition without any restrictions as long as the app is not open-source.\n\nB) Dana must make the entire mobile app's source code available to all users to comply with MongoDB's license.\n\nC) Dana can use MongoDB Community Edition freely as long as the app doesn't directly expose MongoDB's functionality to users.\n\nD) Dana likely needs to make the \"Service Source Code\" available to all users at no charge, or choose a different database solution.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to MongoDB's Community Server Side Public License (SSPL), if the functionality of MongoDB is made available to third parties as a service, the \"Service Source Code\" must be made available to everyone at no charge. This includes not just MongoDB's code, but also all programs used to make MongoDB available as a service, such as management software, user interfaces, and hosting software. \n\nSince Dana's app would likely be considered as offering MongoDB's functionality as a service to users (even indirectly), Dana would probably need to comply with this requirement. If Dana is unwilling to release the required source code, choosing a different database with more favorable licensing terms would be advisable. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there are indeed restrictions even for closed-source apps. Option B is too broad, as only the \"Service Source Code\" is required, not the entire mobile app code. Option C misunderstands the license terms, which apply even if MongoDB's functionality is indirectly exposed through the app's features."

But they are far easier to pass and alter.\n\nAre there any standards on what can only be prohibited (or mandated) by a change in the Constitution vs. a lesser law?\n\nFor example, the ban on alcohol (known as \"Prohibition\") was a Constitutional Amendment ([the 18th](https://jackmillercenter.org/eighteenth-twenty-first-amendments/)), whereas the very similar (if not identical) in nature bans on narcotics were simply Federal (and State) laws.\n\nMy own \"gut feeling\" \\-\\- without any formal legal education \\-\\- is that the Constitution *proclaims* something in general terms, and the laws then *implement* the details: banning actual particular activities, assigning punishments for different related violations, etc\u00e6tera.\n\nThis explanation would make sense, but it does not work for many cases, such as, for example, the ban on narcotics...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your gut feeling is reasonably close, but not precisely correct.\n\nThe Constitution sets the baseline rules for the powers of and interactions among the branches of the federal government, as well as the powers of and interactions between the state and federal governments.\n\nWith only one exception (the dilution of a state's representation in the Senate), the Constitution can be amended to basically anything. It can make anything legal and it can make anything illegal. It generally addresses fairly high\\-leval legal principles, but there's no reason that it couldn't be amended to include a 9,000\\-page law specifically addressing every conceivable aspect of the regulation of nuclear energy.\n\nAs it stands now and as it always has, the Constitution permits the federal government to write laws only with respect to [certain topics](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8). The states, meanwhile, retain authority to write laws on virtually any other topic.\n\nThere are a variety of legal and historical reasons why prohibition took the form of a constitutional amendment while drug laws are handled legislatively, but one important consideration is the scope of Congress's power to regulate \"interstate commerce.\"\n\nAt the time of prohibition, it was not clear that Congress could regulate commercial activity that took place entirely within a single state. So if you grew all the ingredients for your whiskey in Kentucky, and you distilled those ingredients in Kentucky, and then you sold your whiskey in Kentucky exclusively to residents of Kentucky, it seemed that your conduct was outside the reach of Congress, and that any attempt to regulate it would be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge. The solution, therefore, was to amend the constitution and give that authority to Congress.\n\nAbout a decade after prohibition ended, though, the Supreme Court decided that the power to regulate interstate commerce includes not just transactions that cross state lines, but also any conduct that \u201cexerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce\u201d [*Wickard v. Filburn*, 317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942\\)](https://casetext.com/case/wickard-v-filburn). This broadens the Commerce Clause authority to cover virtually any economic activity. So even if you buy marijuana seeds from your next door neighbor, plant them in your own back yard, grow them for strictly personal use in your own home, and never sell anything to anyone, the courts will hold that your conduct affects the interstate market for marijuana, and is therefore subject to federal regulation.\n\nThis standard substantially lowers the bar for Congress to act without a constitutional amendment, which is a big part of the reason there hasn't been an amendment to address narcotic use.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why Prohibition required a Constitutional Amendment, while federal drug laws did not?\n\nA) The Constitution only allows for broad proclamations, while specific bans must be implemented through federal laws.\n\nB) The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause was significantly broader when drug laws were enacted compared to the Prohibition era.\n\nC) Constitutional Amendments are easier to pass than federal laws, so Prohibition took that route for expediency.\n\nD) Drug use was considered a lesser evil than alcohol consumption, so it didn't warrant a Constitutional Amendment.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The key difference lies in the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause. During the Prohibition era, it was unclear whether Congress had the authority to regulate commercial activity occurring entirely within a single state. This uncertainty led to the use of a Constitutional Amendment to implement Prohibition. However, in the 1942 case Wickard v. Filburn, the Supreme Court significantly broadened its interpretation of the Commerce Clause. This decision allowed Congress to regulate activities that have a \"substantial economic effect on interstate commerce,\" even if those activities occur within a single state. This broader interpretation gave Congress the authority to enact federal drug laws without needing a Constitutional Amendment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Constitution can actually be very specific if amended to be so. Option C is false because Constitutional Amendments are generally more difficult to pass than federal laws. Option D is not supported by the given information and doesn't address the legal reasoning behind the different approaches."
