Original jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court cannot be limited (nor expanded) by the US Congress, but the appellate jurisdiction can.\n\nMy understanding is as follows: the US Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is not necessarily exclusive, and thus other courts can also have original jurisdiction over these cases, which is known as concurrent jurisdiction. The plaintiff can thus choose the court in which he files the lawsuit. If the plaintiff chose to start the case not in the US Supreme Court, but rather in another court having original jurisdiction, then the US Supreme Court could have only appellate jurisdiction over such case.\n\nIs it correct?\n\nIf so, could the US Congress strip the US Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases over which the US Supreme Court has original jurisdiction?\n\n*Edit: In an already deleted answer, It was argued that SCOTUS' original and appellate jurisdiction is mutually\\-exclusive, according to [Marbury v. Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison). However, it seems that SCOTUS has rejected this argument in [Cohens v. Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohens_v._Virginia) in which SCOTUS held that \"where the words admit of appellate jurisdiction, the power to take cognizance of the suit originally does not necessarily negative the power to decide upon it on an appeal, if it may originate in a different Court\" and \"The general expressions in the case of Marbury v. Madison must be understood with the limitations which are given to them in this opinion\".*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an interesting question that, to the best of my knowledge, has never presented itself.\n\nThe statutory limitations on the appellate jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court are very narrow and to my knowledge, there has never been an attempt to limit it with respect to matters of which it has original jurisdiction as well.\n\nTo make it a bit more concrete, one class of orders which is not appealable in federal court jurisprudence is an order remanding a case that is removed to a federal court back to its state court of origin. The reasoning behind this rule is that if there is concurrent jurisdiction, there is no legally cognizable harm in doing so in the judgment of Congress, and if the state court lacks jurisdiction, then the lack of jurisdiction can be appealed in the state court action and a new federal case can be commenced in a court with jurisdiction over the case.\n\nIf SCOTUS decided that a limitation on its appellate jurisdiction in this case was unconstitutional, as a practical matter, no one else could overrule its decision, so, effectively, it would have to consent to the limitation.\n\nA closely related unresolved question of constitutional law is whether Congress has the power to deprive all courts of jurisdiction over some particular otherwise justiciable legal right necessarily established by the U.S. Constitution as an end run around amending the U.S. Constitution.

For example, if you sell an asset in consideration for 10% of the revenues from the asset,to be paid to you until the time when the S\\&P 500 index reaches 28,000 \\- you may get an open transaction since neither the time nor the amount of consideration may be determined at the time of sale.\n\nAs I said, it rarely happens.

The documentation emphasizes that courts and tribunals have an overriding duty to serve the interests of justice. This includes ensuring that each party has a reasonable opportunity to present their case, as stated in the Commercial Arbitration Act. While missing a deadline may be frustrating, it does not necessarily cause injustice. Preventing a party from fully presenting their case due to a missed deadline, however, could lead to injustice. The judge's order to allow the defendant to file a reply within 10 days aligns with these principles by giving the defendant an opportunity to present their case despite the missed deadline.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the judge's order is not inherently prejudicial; it aims to serve justice by allowing full presentation of the case.

Under [8 USC \u00a71409(a)(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409#a_3), one of the requirements is that the father must agree in writing to provide financial support for the child until they reach the age of 18\\. If all the conditions of [8 USC \u00a71409(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409#a) are met, then [8 USC \u00a71401(g)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401#g) applies \"as of the date of birth\" of the person, i.e., they are considered a US citizen from birth.\n\nThus, the person's citizenship is conditional upon a particular act that must be performed before they reach the age of 18\\. As long as the father has written down somewhere, prior to the child's 18th birthday, that they agree to support the child financially until the age of 18 (or even just signed such an agreement written by someone else), this condition is fulfilled and the child is a citizen if all other conditions are met. If the child is over the age of 18 but has such a document in their possession that is dated before their 18th birthday, they can use it to prove that the condition was met and that they are a US citizen. However, if by the time the child turns 18 the father is still alive but has never made such a written agreement, then the child is not a US citizen.\n\nThere are two ways to interpret the law:\n\n1. It grants citizenship. If, at some point between the child's birth and the child's 18th birthday, all the conditions of 8 USC \u00a71409(a) are fulfilled, then the law grants citizenship to such child, and this grant is retroactive to their birth. (This interpretation raises the constitutional question of whether such a citizen would be eligible for the presidency.)\n2. It takes away citizenship. The child is born a citizen, but if the child reaches the age of 18 and the conditions have not been met, their citizenship is taken away by operation of law. It is constitutional for Congress to provide for the loss of citizenship of individuals who were born outside the US and not naturalized in the US. See [*Rogers v. Bellei*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_v._Bellei). However, this interpretation seems less likely to me. I would normally think that if Congress had intended to write a law that takes away citizenship, they would be a bit more explicit about it. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that a person who is still under the age of 18 and for whom the condition still *could* be met in the future could claim current US citizenship in e.g. removal proceedings.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Constitutionally, a person is only required to be granted U.S. citizenship if they are born in the United States. Any other form of citizenship is as provided by statute. So, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409 makes some people citizens who would not otherwise be citizens in its absence. In that sense, it grants citizenship.\n\nMeanwhile, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(g) supports the proposition, which is a legal fiction in some cases, that someone is a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States, and hence eligible to run for President someday, and is retroactively considered to have been a citizen in the meantime for myriad other purposes, despite the fact that in the case of an unmarried non\\-citizen mother and a citizen father, this right is not vested and could never come into being if the required actions aren't taken after the fact.\n\nIncidentally, this statute has been upheld against constitutional challenges. *[Miller v. Albright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/420/case.pdf)*, 520 U.S. 420 (1997\\).\n\nSo, while you would like to clearly distinguish between someone having citizenship granted and having citizenship revoked, Congress, in its wisdom, has not been so accommodating and has declined to clearly distinguish between the two interpretations.\n\nThis statute is a bit like the question of [Schr\u00f6dinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat), who is indeterminately alive and dead at the same time until there is a measurement of its state, in quantum physics.\n\nA person with an unmarried non\\-citizen mother and a citizen father is both a U.S. citizen from birth and always has been, and has never been a citizen of the U.S., until the situation is resolved with an actual determination of the question in accordance with the requirements of the statute.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John was born in France to an unmarried American father and a French mother.

In John's case, his father only made a verbal promise, not a written agreement. Since John is now 19 and this condition was not met before he turned 18, he does not qualify for U.S. citizenship under this statute. \n\nOption A is incorrect because automatic citizenship is not granted in this situation without meeting all conditions. Option C is incorrect because the law is clear on the requirements, and there's no need for a court ruling in this straightforward case. Option D is incorrect because the statute doesn't support the interpretation of citizenship being revoked at 18; rather, it suggests that if the conditions aren't met by age 18, citizenship was never acquired in the first place."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64059/why-does-the-first-amendment-apply-to-states", "docs_id": 64059, "title": "Why does the First Amendment apply to states?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The First Amendment doesn't say \"No one can restrict free speech\" \\- it says \"**Congress** shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\"\n\nYou could interpret it as saying, \"Congress cannot restrict free speech, but a private company like StackExchange can make any restrictions it wants on speech, as long as they are not discriminatory,\" which I believe is a correct interpretation.\n\nBut by the same token, couldn't you also read it to say, \"Congress cannot restrict free speech, but the states (and maybe executive orders) can impose any restrictions they want on speech.\" I'm reasonably certain this is NOT a correct interpretation.\n\nIs there some understanding that \"Congress\" here means \"any government entity\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) generally requires the states to recognize the same individual rights that the Bill of Rights requires Congress to recognize.\n\nIn [*Gitlow v.

The following is from a US perspective.\n\nIn short, you can't say \" a developer is bad\" (which a reasonable person would interpret as referring to the developer's skills, professionalism or character), and not risk a lawsuit.\n\nMerely labeling something as your opinion, does not make it statement of opinion. The difference between fact and opinion is that a statement of fact is falsifiable according, while an statement of opinion is not. This is especially relevant because under US law, proving falseness of the offending statement is a required portion of the plaintiff's case.\n\nNote that the above statement is not only potentially defamatory, but (in my non\\-lawyer opinion) seems likely defamation *per se* (which means that the plaintiff does not need to prove actual damage from the statement).\n\nFor example, in TRONFELD v. NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY ([https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va\\-supreme\\-court/1194415\\.html](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-supreme-court/1194415.html)), the statement that a lawyer \"just takes peoples' money\" was found to be inherently defamatory *per se*.\n\nThat's not necessarily to say that a lawsuit would necessarily prevail (the developer would have to prove the statement, that they (and/or presumably their work and/or skills) are not \"bad\", on the balance of probabilities), but it would clear the bar that the statement was not an opinion, and so could not be dismissed on those grounds.\n\nOne might be legally safer, if one very much wants to complain about a developer, to mention easier to verify **true** statements (e.g. if work was not completed to specification, or to contracted schedule), or genuine unverifiable opinions (e.g. \"I was not satisfied with the work; I thought the graphic was ugly\", because ugly is subjective).\n\nNote that there are not \"magic words\"; context matters.

The documentation emphasizes that merely labeling something as an opinion does not protect it from defamation claims if it can be interpreted as a statement of fact. Saying a developer is \"bad\" could be seen as a statement about their skills or professionalism, which could be considered defamatory per se. The safest approach is to stick to verifiable facts (e.g., missed deadlines, failure to meet specifications) or genuinely subjective opinions (e.g., \"I didn't like the design\"). \n\nOption A is incorrect because prefacing a statement with \"In my opinion\" does not automatically protect it from being considered defamatory. \nOption B is incorrect because calling a developer \"bad\" can be interpreted as a statement of fact about their skills or professionalism, not just an opinion. \nOption D is incorrect because while Anti-SLAPP laws may offer some protection, they don't guarantee protection in all cases and their application varies by state."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31696/how-does-one-evict-a-tenant-in-arizona-if-they-have-a-lease-purchase-instead-of", "docs_id": 31696, "title": "How does one evict a tenant in Arizona if they have a lease/purchase instead of a straight lease?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've read there are differences to eviction based on the type of lease/purchase, so if more information is needed please comment.\n\n* Tenant pays a lease payment each month that includes a monthly rent amount, an amount that is 1/12 the yearly taxes, and an amount that goes toward the eventual down payment\n* Tenant is responsible for all repairs and maintenance to the home during their tenancy.\n* While it is phrased as an \"option\" to purchase in a lease attachment, the purchase is required (they cannot choose not to purchase at any point or it will breach\\* the contract)\n* The tenant is required to improve their credit within 2 years in order to be able to qualify for a mortgage to purchase the home.

The term \"expandable\" doesn't guarantee compatibility with all future technologies. Computer obsolescence is a well-known fact in the industry, and no manufacturer promises an infinite upgrade path.

Here, you have no right: the fruit's owner has every right to the fruit he owns. You have no right just to come along and take it. A right to deprive the other of something would be relevant where he had misappropriated it from you.\n\n*Appropriation* is any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner. Here, you are assuming the rights of the owner by taking the fruit.\n\n*Property* is fairly self\\-explanatory. Everything except land is property.\n\n*Belonging to another:* \"Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest.\" Here, the owner of the tree has possession and control and a proprietary right and interest.\n\n*Permanently depriving* means that you treat the thing \\[fruit in this case] as your own to dispose of regardless of the other\u2019s rights.\n\nAll of these apply in your case of taking fruit from a tree owned and grown by someone else.\n\nThere is an exception, which may be relevant to the \"by hook or by crook\" quote:\n\n> A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.\n\nBut this doesn't apply where the tree is not growing wild.\n\nIt is generally held that you can cut off foliage or whatever which is overhanging your land \u2014 I can't find a reference specifically, but I expect it's to do with nuisance and free enjoyment of your own land \u2014 but the severed parts and any fruit on them are **still the property of their owner,** and you can't deprive him of them permanently. Public land isn't **yours,** so **you** can't cut off branches overhanging it: the public authority can. Even there, they must give them back to the owner.\n\nThe 1968 Act repeals a number of prior Acts (all the way back to the First Statute of Westminster in 1265\\), but I can't see anything relevant to the restriction of common law.

Hobbs and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, courts focus on whether a religious belief is sincerely held by the individual, rather than whether it aligns with mainstream interpretations of a religion. The key factor is the sincerity of the belief, not its conformity to recognized religious practices. As long as John can demonstrate that his belief in wearing the crystal pendant is genuinely part of his religious practice, the court would likely consider it valid for religious freedom protections, even if it's not a common Christian practice.

Given that, if someone confessed a crime (major or minor) the priest could not report that individual to the police (i.e. act on his own will). \n\nI understand that a defendant's attorney could not be forced by a judge to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was exchanged between the defendant and even if the attorney accidentally revealed that the defendant did commit the crime, it would have to be removed from record because that is privileged information. \n\nMy question is: Are priests held to the same standard? Can a judge (federal, state, etc.) order a priest to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was said in confession? And if the judge did and the priest refused, would the priest be held in contempt? Does this apply to all states in the US? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Confidential statements made in confession to a religious advisor are privileged in every U.S. state and in federal court. \n\nThere is a body of law that surrounds each kind of privilege (attorney\\-client, psychotherapist\\-patient, doctor\\-patient, priest\\-parishioner, accountant\\-client, husband\\-wife) that covers exceptions to the general rule. At least a couple of privileges (attorney\\-client and husband\\-wife) actually involve more than one distinct privilege: attorney\\-client privilege has a confidential communications component and a work product component that have different rules; a husband\\-wife privilege has a confidential communications component and a 5th Amendment like component that allows one spouse to refuse to permit the other current spouse to testify against him or her.\n\nThe privilege for confessions made to priests is generally speaking, broader than the attorney\\-client privilege. Both attorney\\-client privileges have crime\\-fraud and prevention of imminent harm exceptions that do not apply to priests. The work product component of the attorney\\-client privilege also has an exception when work product is the sole available source of critical information available by no other means (e.g. due to the fact that destructive testing was conducted on evidence).\n\nA judge cannot order a priest to disclose to a grand jury or any other tribunal or official, what was said in confession, and the priest could not be held in contempt for not testifying in this manner. Indeed, even if, for example, a secret microphone had been placed on a suspect and captured his confession to a priest, the recording of that conversation would not be admissible as evidence in any legal forum due to the privilege.\n\nOften, as in the case of a seal of confessional for a Roman Catholic priest, a privilege is also accompanied by a duty on the part of the person receiving the confidential information to keep the information disclosed confidential. But, the duty to keep privileged communications confidential does not always exactly match the scope of the privilege. \n\nFor example, a Mormon minister's religious obligation to keep confessions confidential might not be precisely the same as those of a Roman Catholic priest, even though confessions to either one would be privileged from compulsory disclosure in a court or other tribunal. Similarly, confidential communications to an attorney can be disclosed by an attorney in furtherance of the representation in a way that a confidential communication to a priest usually could not be disclosed.\n\nIn at least some jurisdictions, the priest could probably be compelled to testify regarding whether an individual came to a place at a given time to confess (which would establish alibi or lack thereof, and proximity to the time scene at a particular time) since that itself wouldn't be a confidential matter shared with the priest and could have been witnesses by anyone else in the church building who was not a part of the confession whether it not it actually was witnessed by anyone else. In such a jurisdiction, if the priest refused to testify regarding that matter, the priest could be held in contempt of court just like any other witness under a subpoena who refused to testify.\n\nThe law is not entirely clear over the extent that the priest\\-parishioner privilege is mandated solely by a statute, common law rule, or court rule (as the case may be from state to state, this varies considerably), and to which extent the statute, common law rule, or court rule providing for the privilege is constitutionally mandated by the free exercise clause of the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution (incorporated to apply to the states through the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution), and by parallel state constitutional provisions.\n\nThe question of whether the priest\\-parishioner privilege is constitutionally mandated matters because some states, in the wake of scandals involving sexual abuse of children by clergy, have sought to extend the requirement that a designated person knowing of instances of child abuse must report their suspicions to authorities, that applies to many kinds of licensed professionals who deal with children in most states, to religious officials who deal with children and their supervisors and colleagues in their churches or denominations.\n\nIf the question is constitutional, it might be the case that these laws would be unconstitutional. Middle ground might find that there might be a duty of someone taking a confession from a priest to report child abuse (because this is an abuse by the priest of the privilege of receiving privileged confessions), but not a duty to report child abuse disclosed in confession by anyone else. Of course, if there is no constitutional dimension to the privilege, the legislature is free to modify it with legislation as they see fit.\n\nThere is also an issue in every particular privilege regarding whom the privilege belongs to, and hence, who has a right to legally waive a privilege and allow testimony concerning the confidential communications to be provided. It might belong to the person making the confession, it might belong to the priest, or it might belong to both (hence requiring mutual consent for a waiver of privilege and not just consent by one individual who holds the privilege).

It is not really a textbook, however, so much as a resource used by both law students and practicing lawyers and judges.\n\nThe editor of all editions of it since 1996 is Bryan A. Garner, who is also the leading authority on what constitutes good modern legal writing (which in some cases violate outdated elementary school usage rules like never starting a sentence with a conjunction).\n\nLaw textbooks are subject\\-matter specific, and there is no one class in which legal terms are taught. In contacts class, law students learn contracts related terms. In property class, law students learn property related terms. In torts class, law students learn torts related terms.\n\n> I am sure in law classes, legal terms are defined.\n\nNot really. Your assumption is more false than true.\n\nU.S. legal instruction is typically conducted using the Socratic method and with a review of the leading appellate court cases and the key statutory language in each subject.\n\nRather than having the textbook define a term, it is far more common for students in a class to read four appellate court cases addressing a subject, none of which define a term, and for the professor to ask a student chosen at random what that term means, often probing the student with follow up questions for fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\nUsually, the final conclusion is not stated outright either by the professor or the textbook in textbook author provided text, although the cases referenced and statutes referenced will often provide one or more than one definition for a term, not necessarily consistent ones.\n\nLaw professors in the U.S., collectively, take the attitude that there is no absolute meaning for anything and that it is a waste of time to teach specific legal rules or doctrines which may change over the course of a student's career. Instead, they focus on teaching how to argue over close call gray areas in the law and how to identify legal issues, with the idea that the clear black and white rules of law are easy to learn after you graduate from law school when and if you need to do so.\n\nThere are books called \"legal outlines\" and \"treatises\" which are more direct than law professors and textbooks in providing answers in a particular subject, as are bar exam review materials. But, again, it is important to understand the nature of the beast before you use them.\n\n> I am a mathematician who likes terms to be defined precisely. I am\n> sure in law classes, legal terms are defined. If it turns out that\n> pretty much every law textbook defines terms precisely, then I will\n> simply check Google.\n\nThis is a fool's errand (I was an undergraduate math major myself before becoming a lawyer).\n\nThis is because legal terms don't have a single consistent meaning. The same word or phrase can and often does mean different things in different contexts.\n\nMany legal terms defined in Black's Law dictionary have multiple meanings stated and it is not at all uncommon for a statute or contract to define a word in a new and unconventional way.\n\nI probably draft contacts with novel definitions for words at least a few times every year. There are a million or so U.S. lawyers, and tens of thousands of federal, state and local legislators out there further complicating affairs each year, in addition to thousands of judges whose decisions may coin new legal terms or new meanings for existing legal terms. This is why these resources need to be updated regularly.\n\nFor example, there is no one consistent definition of the word \"person\" which is widely used in a variety of statutes and regulations and contracts.\n\nAs another example, the term \"security\" means something very different in the law of securities regulation, where it refers to investments made by passive investors and traded in secondary markets, than it does in the law of secured transactions, where it means collateral for an obligation. Likewise, in bankruptcy law, national defense law, criminal law or tort law, the term security means something entirely different in each separate context.\n\nAs a third example, the term \"equity\" can have very different meanings depending upon context. It can mean the value of something net of debt to which it is subject. It can refer the the jurisprudence of courts of chancery before equity jurisprudence and law jurisprudence were merged in the 19th century which is relevant to the constitutional right to a jury trial in federal court and to the kinds of defenses that can be asserted in response to a claim. Or, it can refer to ownership interests in entities as distinct from debt interests in entities, as a third and not comprehensive list of meanings.\n\nCommon law countries, in particular (i.e. those countries with legal systems derived from those of England) are notorious for their inconsistent use of terminology, which is rather more consistent in civil law countries due to the way that civil codes are drafted.\n\nAlso keep in mind the famous quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.:\n\n> The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\n\nIn law, the fact that A implies B and that B implies C does not necessarily mean that A implies C. The law simply isn't that consistent and logical. You can't follow long chains of logical reasoning in the law with any confidence.

It specifically states that U.S. legal instruction typically uses the Socratic method, where students are asked to derive meanings from cases rather than being given direct definitions. The passage also notes that law professors generally avoid teaching specific rules or doctrines, focusing instead on how to argue and identify legal issues. This approach aligns most closely with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that legal terms do not have consistent meanings across different areas of law. Option B is wrong because the passage indicates that law textbooks do not typically provide precise definitions for legal terms.

It will be fact\\-specific; in some cases far easier to prove than in others. The criminal justice system is overburdened and underfunded so it is no surprise that these trolling videos are given no priority whatsoever.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the need to correctly identify the individual to prosecute. Doing so would require a fair amount of police time, time that could perhaps be spent on more urgent priorities given the relative lack of harm these videos are doing compared to more serious crimes.\n\nHowever, in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-OA9sXzLQ) (Would You Help a Police Officer Having An Asthma Attack?) an S50(2\\) offence would seem to have been committed by the actor wearing the police clothing:\n\n> Any person who, not being a constable, wears any article of police uniform in circumstances where it gives him an appearance so nearly resembling that of a member of a police force as to be calculated to deceive shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.\n\nIt does appear that both offences are being committed in these various videos, and the only reason people aren't being prosecuted is practical: there are more serious crimes to focus on, and the police would need to identify who exactly committed this crime\\-\\-given these all happened at least two years ago, it would be challenging to say the least.\n\n> They also seem to commit the separate crime of wasting police time, for example by approaching cops in the street and falsely confessing to crimes.\n\nUnder [S5(2\\) of the Criminal Law Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/5), wasting police time is a criminal offence.

For instance, in Article 7 (2\\) is says:\n\n> Any part of such a declaration \\[of consent] which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.\n\nSo if the consent obtained is *not* explicit, specific, freely given, and informed, and the company relies on *consent* to ensure lawfulness of processing, it is breaking the law (and may be fined under the GDPR).\n\nThe big problem with this privacy policy is this sentence:\n\n> Your continued access to or use of any of the Services shall be deemed your acceptance of the Privacy Policy.\n\nAs you've noted, the GDPR requires consent to be *explicit*. What \"explicit\" means is spelled out in Recital 32, which (among other things) says:\n\n> Silence, pre\\-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.\n\nAnd Recital 32 goes on state that consent must be *specific*:\n\n> When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.\n\nThe full privacy policy lists 16 different purposes for which personal data is collected, but do not seek specific consent for *any* of them.\n\nConsent under GDPR must also be *freely given*. Recital 42 says (among other things):\n\n> Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n\nHere the company states that continued use of the service \"shall be deemed your acceptance\". The only way the data subject can refuse consent is to *not* use the service, which is to the detriment of the data subject. This also makes the consent invalid.\n\nFinally, the GDPR also requires consent to be *informed*. What this means is spelled out in Recital 42, which (among other things say):\n\n> For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least \\[...] the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.\n\nHere the data subject is supposed to consent to some unknown, future change which may be to allow different purposes of the processing.

All one has to say is they maintained some portion of land for 10 years undisputed and now they can claim they \"own\" the property.\n\nMy mother owns a vacant land and I notice someone is mowing the lawn. One of the claims of adverse possession is that they make the land theirs undisputed (\"Planting your flag\" so to speak) and they make it known to the supposed owner that they maintain and control the land. However, whoever is mowing the vacant land is doing so in secret and without letting us know it.\n\nFrom what I understand in most adverse possession case, someone builds a structure or improve a portion of a property as theirs. For example, a farmer might plant crops in a land which is basically something you can't keep hidden and the owner would have more than enough time to dispute it with survey or otherwise. Then there are cases of building a shed or structure or fence over/just before someone's property line and one can make a claim that a part of a property is theirs.

Can anyone explain what sort of ways someone could make an adverse possession claim and just how successful they can be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **It's not THAT easy, and it's fifteen years, not ten.**\n\nAs you say, Virginia requires your neighbors to do more than mow your lawn to get title to your land. In Virginia, most of these requirements are laid out in judicial decisions, not statutes. However, the one requirement [set by statute](https://vacode.org/8.01-236/) is that the possessor has to have \"possessed\" the land **for 15 years.**\n\nAs for the rest of the requirements, they are the usual ones. Ten years ago, the [Supreme Court of Virginia](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1058407/helms-v-manspile/) gave a nice, concise summary. It said that to \"establish title...by adverse possession,\" your neighbor would have to prove that their possession was:\n\n1. actual,\n2. hostile,\n3. exclusive,\n4. visible, and\n5. continuous...\n\nHere is what the Court said each element requires:\n\n> Use and occupation of property...constitutes proof of actual possession. One is in hostile possession if his possession is under a claim of right and adverse to the right of the true owner. One's possession is exclusive when it is not in common with others. Possession is visible when it is *so obvious that the true owner **may be presumed** to know about it.* Possession is continuous only if it exists without interruption for the statutory period.\n\n**Two things to notice:**\n\n1. Because your neighbor's possession must be *adverse,* you can stop the 15 year possession \"*clock*\" by simply *giving them your permission* to mow the lawn.\n2. It does not matter that your neighbors are mowing \"in secret and without letting us know it.\" That you are here asking about it shows the mowing so \"visible\" that you know what is going on.\n\n**For more information**\n\nWhether your neighbors can claim your land depends on how Virginia courts have interpreted the law. Luckily for you, several Virginia lawyers have gone online to explain those details. These two, (one in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/realestate/2003/03/22/the-rules-of-adverse-possession-determine-who-is-entitled-to-occupy-land/a6b88fc8-352f-445d-9336-a26a66f53c82/)), give nice [overviews](http://richfishlegalblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/supreme-court-of-virginia-affirms-law.html), while [this guy,](https://www.hovplc.com/blog/2016/october/squatters-rights-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not/) says mowing alone probably won't do it.

I am renting this property and do not own it.\n\nLong story short I had a NEMA 14\\-50 EV charger installed in my rental house in Seattle, with the permission of the owner. This was roughly a year ago. The electrician lied to me and told me I did not need an inspection. His company then called me saying that I did, and they went ahead and had charged me for it. It then failed inspection because he hadn't installed a GFI. On an exterior circuit... So they came back and fixed it (for free) but completely botched my panel and disconnected my water heater. I then didn't have hot water for 3 days. I tried to let them fix it (again) and they promised to send out an emergency dispatch that day. I called 4 times and was told they were coming, and sat around all day waiting; they never showed up. The next day I called a different company who came out on an emergency call and fixed it. The new electrician made many comments about things they'd done incorrectly and fixed some of their minor mistakes for me, free of charge. Since this was an emergency call on Labor day they charged me their holiday \\+ emergency rate of $500\\. No cheap, but I wanted to take warm showers again and the other company did not seem inclined to fix their mistakes.\n\nI was understandably angry and called them, demanding them to reimburse me for the emergency service after I tried repeatedly to allow them to fix the mistake and they failed to. I received a verbal agreement from the site manager that he would. Nothing happened, of course, and then they started ignoring or not returning my calls. Eventually I gave up as the frustration was not worth it.\n\nNow I actually do not recall if an inspector came by a second time to approve the fix. Over the past week they have been calling and emailing me saying that they failed to document that the GFI was installed and that another inspection is required, or I could photograph the panel for them. I am inclined to tell them to go pound sand and to stop contacting me. I may also tell them I will send a picture of the updated panel, if they reimburse me the $500 as agreed upon last year.\n\nShould they be unwilling and I just continue to ignore them, is there anything negative that can happen to me?

The owner was consulted before the work was done. They \"fixed\" it and in the process disconnected my water heater. I attempted to allow them to correct this but they no\\-showed, so I had a 3rd party fix the panel. Now they are asking me for a picture of the panel to confirm they did install the GFI but after so much consternation and money spent fixing the issue, I am disinclined to work with them unless failing to do so can cause me issues.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some consequences for you, under the [Seattle Residential Code](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/SeattleResidentialCode/2015SRCChapter1.pdf).

The legal burden of assuring that the work was done correctly and paperwork is in order ultimately falls on the owner, though the city at least initially talks to the contractor.\n\nInsofar as a customer taking a picture doesn't count as an actual final inspection, I suspect that some cost\\- and time\\-saving short\\-cuts were taken.\n\nFollowing up on the new information about being a tenant, the primary legal question is whether you have a duty of care towards the landlord, since in engaging this company, the landlord's interest may be put at risk. The landlord may have protected his interest via a clause in the lease saying \"you must get written permission to modify the property, and you assume full liability for resulting damages\", so first thing to check is what the lease says (perhaps look for a \"Tenant's duty of care\" clause). In lieu of clear evidence that you caused damage to the owner (economic damage, by negligence w.r.t. his need to have proper permits and the whopping fines that follow), I don't see what the risk to you would be in just washing your hands of the problem.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant installs an EV charger in their rental property with the landlord's permission, but the electrician performs faulty work and fails to properly complete the inspection process.

The tenant should first review their lease agreement for any clauses that might make them liable for modifications to the property or resulting damages. Without such clauses, the tenant generally isn't responsible for the electrician's failure to complete proper inspections or paperwork. The landlord typically bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring work on their property meets code requirements. However, the tenant isn't entirely free from potential consequences, which is why ignoring the situation (option A) isn't the best course of action.

According to the documentation, lawyers generally enjoy litigation privilege, which protects them from tort claims arising from their conduct during legal proceedings.

It seems like this is just so the cops can bully the suspect and be able to dominate them, and so is there a legal basis allowing them to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the police order you to sit in an interrogation room and you are not permitted to leave, *by definition*, you have been arrested. Detaining someone against their will for longer than necessary to answer a few questions on the spot (which is a lesser imposition on your freedom called a \"Terry stop\") is what it means to be arrested. Legally, the police are only allowed to arrest you if they have probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime.\n\nI believe that you are confusing arrested (being detained by law enforcement against your will for more than a Terry stop), with being booked, or being charged with a crime. Generally speaking people are arrested first, and then booked next, and then charged with a crime after that, although this isn't always the order in which this happens.\n\nIn much the same way, if the police observe someone committing a crime, they will first handcuff them which places them under arrest, and then book them sometime not too long later when they arrive at the police station, and then formally charge them sometime after that after a conversation with the prosecuting attorney to see if the prosecuting attorney is willing to pursue the case. Booking generally involves bringing someone to a police station, getting identifying information, taking a mug shot, taking finger prints, and depending upon what the police want to do, searching your person and inventorying your possessions prior to putting you in a jail cell in jail garb.\n\nUsually, however, the grand jury or the prosecuting attorney (it varies by jurisdiction) does have subpoena power to compel you to provide information under oath prior to trial as a witness, following the service of a subpoena upon you a reasonable time in advance as set forth in the relevant court rules, unless you invoke your 5th Amendment right against self\\-incrimination and are not granted immunity from prosecution based upon your testimony in exchange, or you invoke some other legal privilege against having to testify.\n\nThey can, of course, simply ask you to come to an interrogation room and answer questions, and merely imply that it is mandatory without actually saying that you must and without clarifying the situation. **In that case, which is extremely common, their legal right to interrogate you flows from your own consent.** If you answer their questions, your answers could provide the police with probable cause to arrest you that they didn't have when they started asking questions.\n\nIndeed, often, when police interrogate you before booking you, they are doing so because they need your statements to establish the probable cause needed to legally arrest you. This is why criminal defense attorneys counsel people to immediate ask for a lawyer and refuse to answer any questions other than those needed to establish your identity.\n\nYou can also ask if you are under arrest and if you are free to leave (which are mutually exclusive).\n\n**If they say you are not under arrest, you are free to leave,** unless you are appearing pursuant to a subpoena.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer asks John to come to the station for questioning about a recent crime.

The law generally requires a clear aggressor or a party taking advantage of another's incapacitation. When both individuals are similarly impaired, it becomes nearly impossible to determine that one party had the specific intent to commit assault or was more capable of consenting than the other. This situation highlights the complexity of consent and intoxication in sexual assault cases, and why such cases are often difficult to prosecute when both parties are impaired.

So, if you think that the defendant might not answer and the original complaint was wrong, you need to not seek a default on the original complaint, amend the complaint and reserve the amended complaint.\n\nThe idea behind this rule is that the defendant should be able to make a rational decision about whether or not to fight a lawsuit based upon what is at stake in the lawsuit and not be surprised if the defendant decides to default to avoid litigation costs.\n\nBut, if a party answers the Complaint, then damages are determined based upon the evidence provided at trial and may ultimately be determined at trial to be either higher or lower than the amount claimed in the Complaint.\n\nThe idea behind this rule is that if the defendant had decided to litigate that the ultimate outcome should prefer reality to procedure since each party has input into how the decision is made by the court.\n\nIt also isn't uncommon for events that take place after the filing of the Complaint to change the amount of damages that are owed. Sometimes the damages go down, for example, if it is possible to mitigate damages in some way such as by selling defective goods that were delivered at a discount.

There are two key rules at play here:\n\n1. If a default judgment is entered (i.e., the defendant doesn't respond), the plaintiff generally cannot secure a judgment for more than what was requested in the original served complaint.\n\n2. However, if the defendant answers the complaint, damages are determined based on evidence provided at trial and may be higher or lower than the amount claimed in the complaint.\n\nIn this scenario, if Mary has filed an answer to the complaint, John can increase the amount sought. However, to do so properly, he should amend the complaint and re-serve Mary with the updated information.

Do any UK consumer or product liability laws apply?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Note** \\- I'm not asking legal advice. I already have a basis of claim in my actual case. But the case prompted a question mark over an apparent loophole in UK consumer protection/product liability law, and I'm wondering if it's covered in some consumer law I don't know about.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nI bought an expensive computer networking product, some years ago. The firmware hadn't been updated since, so I decided to do so. The manufacturer puts new firmware on their website, together with \"release notes\" (guidance and instructions concerning the update, and procedures to follow in updating). The instructions state simply, to upload the firmware to the device, and restart the device. No warnings or caveats are stated.\n\nOn following these instructions, the product was rendered inoperable \\- \"bricked\". I found numerous threads on the manufacturers support website where many people had exoerienced this exact same issue, often with this exact same model, over a period of months or years. The manufacturers staff members' response was invariably that this update, applied as in the release notes, can irreparably break the product in some circumstances. Specifically, if the product still had old/original firmware, then the procedure in the release notes would render the product irreparable. A completely different procedure, not in the notes or mentioned by them, should be followed instead. If the broken product was in warranty, it would be replaced, but otherwise nothing could be done except pay the very high price for out\\-of\\-warranty replacement/repair.\n\nI'm happy to rely on tort in my own actual claim (see below), but it never hurts to know your law fully. I am trying to understand whether any specific product safety laws apply as well, since the Consumer Rights Act 2015 seems to exclude this (it falls in various loopholes?):\n\n* CRA2015 for the update and release notes as \"digital content\". But s.33 says it is only covered if a price was paid (1\\), it was supplied free \"with\" other paid items (2\\), or it is not generally available unless some paid item was purchased (2\\). The update was free, it was supplied separately and independently from any paid product, and it is available freely to all, so this doesn't seem applicable.\n* CRA 2015 for the update and release notes as a \"service\". But s.48 seems to require a contract, and no explicit contract was required to be clicked for download or installation. Would a court impute a contract, sufficient to meet this requirement, regardless? If not, this doesn't seem applicable either.\n\nNegligence seems clear (duty of care, reliance, defective software usage instructions known for years to cause serious damage, defective instructions continue to be provided with no warning, predictable damage resulted), so I'm happy about my own actual case, but I'm really surprised not to find any UK consumer protection for harm\\-causing product updates if they are made freely available after and separate from purchase, by a manufacturer, as this is such a common situation.\n\nAre there any UK consumer laws or product safety/quality laws that might be applicable to free but defective software update?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It might be a lot late now yet I suggest that relying solely on your interpretation, the manufacturer appears to have negligently offered goods or services without warning you of known potential consequences.\n\nThat you had no contract with the manufacturer should not matter any more than if I rocked up on your doorstep and offered to clean your car, with or without mentioning that I proposed to use Agent Yellow, which then wrecked your paintwork.\n\nIf you really had no contract then how could the manufacturer make any conditions about what you did with the update you downloaded, including any conditions restricting liability?\n\nBeyond that I cannot go and you should consult a lawyer.\n\nIt seems fairly clear what happened in your case should be actionable but let's remember, whether it's *worth* taking action over is a very different Question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a consumer who downloads a free firmware update for a previously purchased product, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal recourse in the UK if the update causes damage to the product?\n\nA) The consumer has no legal recourse as the Consumer Rights Act 2015 does not apply to free digital content.\n\nB) The consumer can only pursue a claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 if they can prove an explicit contract was formed when downloading the update.\n\nC) The consumer may have a valid claim under negligence law, even without a specific contract for the update.\n\nD) The consumer is fully protected under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 as the update is considered part of the original product purchase.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the Consumer Rights Act 2015 may not directly apply due to the update being free and not clearly tied to a contract, the consumer likely has a valid claim under negligence law. The manufacturer has a duty of care to provide safe and accurate instructions for product updates. If they were aware of potential issues and failed to warn users, this could be considered negligent behavior. The lack of a specific contract for the update does not negate the manufacturer's responsibility to prevent foreseeable harm to their customers.

I rent an apartment with far too few spots for the amount of people in my building. This is remedied by there being excess spots in front of other apartment buildings within the same property (same company, same apartments, different buildings). However, people are just too lazy to walk the extra 100 feet so rather than parking in one of the open spots elsewhere, they park in the fire lane in front of the building. The lanes are very narrow to drive in as it is so I\u2019ve been trapped and unable to leave for work some days because those cars block me off. I call the management office, they don\u2019t open until 8 but I have to leave for work at 6 to get there. So nothing gets done in time. By the time management returns my call at 9, the vehicles are gone. I take pictures and send emails. By the time management sees the email, the cars gone and they say they\u2019ll \u201cgive them a warning\u201d but nothing changes.\n\nCan I have cars towed that are illegally parked in the fire lane overnight in front of my apartment? I\u2019m tired of relying on management who does nothing and having to miss or be incredibly late to work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Had a similar situation in a home I lived in. We lived on the street closest to a High School's footbal stadium and the inadequate parking would cause fans to park in a manner that took a street that could handle bi\\-direction traffic to an unsigned one\\-way road. The school did make frequent announcements that fans parked there could be towed (it helped that I was one of many alums that lived there). The police informed me that unless there was some signage, they actually couldn't do anything. So you have the benefit of signage that says people cannot park there.\n\nI would recommend calling the fire marshal. In Washington State (I assume your not in DC) the Fire Marshal is a division of the Washington State Patrol, the state police organization. Giving them a call in the evening when the parking is observably bad, will likely get the ball rolling. I would not expect towing, but I would expect to see tickets under offending vehicles if they come out.\n\nIf they fail too, I would start taking pictures of offending vehicles and present it to the local branch of WSP. I would minimize the inconvenience to your commute and the safety hazard of blocking space allocated for use by Emergency Service Vehicles. Try to get a name of someone who you can personally work with to assist you in the manner and who you can contact to report further issues. If they won't provide, ask if there is a way you can submit complaints to them.\n\nI would, after contacting the WSP, notify your building's staff in person and through e\\-mail, that you have made them aware of the situation and that they have taken no action on previous attempts and that you have gone to the WSP over this matter. This serves two purposes, first you are notifying the building managment of a potential violation of law (the fire code is a law and is there because it's easier to fight deadly fires by removing hazards that make fires deadly in the first place. If a fire truck is blocked from the fire lanes, the fire fighters are going to have to deal with that before they can get to doing their real job.). The other benefit is to create a paper trail, which you can present to the WSP to show the building is compliant in fire code violations despite being made aware of the problem. Your building is likely not doing anything because there's no documentation that they are aware of the problem, so they can claim they didn't know anything about this if it goes to court.\n\nFinally, I would recommend you seek an attorney that specializes in teneat or real estate matters and ask for a consultation. You do not have to employ their services, but most law offices will have a \"client intake\" process where you can explain your case and they can offer you some advice or other avenues. Even if you don't intend to sue your landlord(s), and even if you are reporting a crime to police, having a lawyer when dealing with the police and landlords can only help as they will be able to better advise you so you can do this safely without exposing yourself to civil or criminal liability. You can bet they have lawyers that will be more than willing to screw you for their clients.

[This 2020 ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/a-tennessee-law-requires-doctors-to-lie-to-their-patients-were-suing) summarizes several examples.\n\n> In four states, doctors have to tell their patients that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer, even though that is factually wrong. Eight states insist that physicians include \u201cnegative emotional response\u201d among the lists of risks associated with the procedure, even though mainstream medical associations have uniformly determined that this is false. Four states require doctors to lie to their patients about the risk having an abortion could have on their future fertility.\n\nThese are clearly established as lies by actual medical research, e.g. obtaining an abortion objectively does not increase one's risk of breast cancer.\n\nAs Martin points out in the comments, if doctors are permitted to explain that the information is false they can avoid actually lying. \"I am required by law to tell you that if you get an abortion you are more likely to die by suicide or breast cancer, but that is not actually true.\"\n\nI am unfortunately unfamiliar with the best way to find the actual text of each state's laws, so I am unable to determine if any of the abortion laws in question forbid doctors from revealing that false information is false. Consequently, I will broaden the scope to either being required to lie or being required to provide false information with the option of revealing it as such.\n\nAre there other examples of laws in US states that require one person to lie to or mislead another? If some narrowing of scope is needed, I am mostly wondering about examples which are similar in the sense of a professional being required to lie to someone obtaining some service or good from them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A law requiring you to explicitly lie to someone would be a form of compelled speech, which is a violation of the 1st Amendment's free speech clause. However, a \"lie\" in the legal sense would be a statement of fact that is objectively and demonstrably false. There are lots of disclosure laws that require lots of people in different professions to do and say all kinds of things to and for their clients that might even be widely regarded as stupid, but that does not make them lies.\n\nTaking the ACLU's claims at face value (I'm sure these laws exist but I'm not going to take the time to look them up), requiring doctors to disclose potential negative side effects of a drug or surgical procedure to a patient is clearly within the legislature's authority to do if they've determined that there is sufficient evidence to warrant it. It's ultimately up to the courts to decide, but courts generally give wide latitude to legislatures and administrative agencies in this regard unless the statute is egregiously unreasonable.\n\nEither way, the doctor does not have to assert the disclosures as statements of fact, and they are free to tell their patients that they do not believe them to be true, so there is no compelled speech involved.\n\n---\n\nI'm not trying to express support or opposition to abortion here, so please don't start a dumpster fire in the comments. But the ACLU article you linked is a straight\\-up opinion piece. The ACLU believes that the statements are lies. There are a lot of weasel words just in the paragraph you quoted. Out of curiosity, I did a search on their claims.\n\nThe top search result for \"abortion and breast cancer\" is [this article from the American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), which contains this statement:\n\n> The results of studies looking at the possible link between breast cancer and induced abortion often differ depending on how the study was done. Cohort studies and studies that used records to determine the history of abortions have not found an increased risk. Some case\\-control studies, however, have found an increase in risk.\n\nIn other words, we don't really know for sure. So it's not as \"factually wrong\" as the ACLU says.\n\nA search for \"abortion effects on future fertility\" yields [this study from the U.S. National Institute of Health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2225607/)\n\n> ... Women whose pregnancy is terminated by dilatation and evacuation may have an increased risk of subsequent premature delivery and a low birthweight baby. Very little has been published and no conclusions can be made regarding the effects of instillation procedures and repeat abortions on future reproduction.\n\nSo there's definitely a risk from a *particular kind* of abortion (a D\\&E, which are performed usually for mid\\-late term pregnancies), but no significant risk from an instillation abortion (a vacuum catheter in early pregancy). This study is from 1990, so medication\\-induced abortions were not available then. It was just the first search result that wasn't a news article.\n\nAnd then there's the \"negative emotional response\" risk. I'm not even going to tackle that one it's so weaselly. What does that even mean exactly? \"...Mainstream medical associations have uniformly determined that this is false.\" Which medical associations? And what constitutes \"mainstream?\" I highly doubt there is uniformity of opinion.\n\n---\n\nBottom line is, no, a law cannot require you to lie.

However, while the employee cannot be forced to continue working, they may still be liable for monetary damages if their departure causes provable harm to the company.\n\nOption A is incorrect because such a contract clause is not legally binding due to constitutional protections against involuntary servitude.\n\nOption B is incorrect because US courts cannot order specific performance for personal services contracts, as this would violate the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the employee can leave, they may still face potential financial liability, depending on the circumstances and any provable damages to the company."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55671/dont-police-actually-have-an-obligation-to-arrest-in-some-domestic-cases-ala-nr", "docs_id": 55671, "title": "Don&#39;t police actually have an obligation to arrest in some domestic cases ala NRS 171.137?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The previous answers say police have no duty to arrest. Yet it seems statutes in many states require arrests in some domestic violence cases. For example, in Nevada, [NRS 171\\.137](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-171.HTML#NRS171Sec137) is entitled,\n\n> \"Arrest *required* for suspected battery constituting domestic violence.\"\n\nPlease clarify.\n\nAlthough this is a Nevada law it's a very common law in many states. Many domestic violence cases occur so this would give police obligations in a wide range of cases.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **You are asking a different question**\n\nThe title to the [earlier question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53515/do-police-have-a-civil-duty-to-do-their-job) \\-\\- \"Do the police have a civil duty to do their job\" \\-\\- is slightly misleading. The question is not whether the policy have an *abstract* \"civil\" duty to enforce the law, but whether they have a *specific* \"constitutional\" duty to do so. If they do have such a specific duty, then, as they OP says, they could \"be sued for not doing their job.\"\n\nAs ohwilleke explains thoroughly, the answer to this question is \"no.\" The Supreme Court has consistently held there is no constitutional right to police enforcement of the law. In particular, the SCt has held that police aren't violating the 14th Amendment when they don't \"do their job.\" According to the Court, someone who is hurt when the police don't enforce the law, is *not* deprived of \"life, liberty or property *without due process of law.*\" This in turn means that the people who are hurt can't sue the police under [\u00a71983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983), which allows people to sue state or local officials who violate their constitutional rights.\n\nAs you point out, the [Nevada statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) clearly requires officers to make an arrest in some cases. However, this requirement is *not absolute;* the statute also creates an exception to the requirement:\n\n> a peace officer *shall,* **unless mitigating circumstances exist,** arrest a person when the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has...committed a battery upon his or her spouse..\n\nThe statute goes on to explicitly exempt the officer and her department from liability if she decides not to make an arrest:\n\n> *Nothing in this section* shall be construed to *impose liability* upon a peace officer or his or her employer for a determination made in good faith by the peace officer *not to arrest a person* pursuant to this section.\n\nThus, the statute sends mixed signals to police officers. On the one hand, it requires them to make arrests in some domestic violence cases; on the other hand, it says they are not liable if they ignore this requirement.\n\nTaken together, the Nevada statute and the SCt's decisions mean people who are hurt if police don't make an arrest under 171\\.137 cannot sue the police under either state or federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Nevada, a police officer responds to a domestic violence call but decides not to make an arrest, despite having probable cause to believe a battery occurred between spouses.

The Act ([section 29\\.22](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-6.html#h-103309)) explicitly allows reproduction of works for private non\\-commercial purposes as long as the reproduction is based on an legal copy, the reproduction is not given away to others and no DRM measures were circumvented.\n\nIf a new work of creative nature is created by your photograph (i.e. the photo is not simply a substantial copy of the painting), another non\\-commercial exception may be applicable.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) It is always legal to share photos of artwork displayed in public spaces on social media.\nB) It is legal to share the photo on social media only if the painting is not the main subject of the image.\nC) It is legal to share the photo on social media for non-commercial purposes if certain conditions are met, such as acknowledging the source.\nD) It is never legal to share photos of paintings on social media without explicit permission from the copyright holder.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Canadian Copyright Act, while there is no general freedom of panorama for two-dimensional works like paintings, sharing such a photo on social media may be legal under certain conditions. Section 29.21 of the Act allows individuals to use existing works in creating new works (like photographs) and share them through intermediaries (like social media platforms) for non-commercial purposes. This is permissible if conditions are met, including using a legal copy, acknowledging the source, and ensuring no substantial adverse impact on the artist's ability to benefit from their work. Therefore, option C is the most accurate, as it reflects the nuanced approach of Canadian copyright law in this scenario."}}
