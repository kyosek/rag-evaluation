Instead of being killed, the character is taken in by the terrorists and forced to work for them as a sort of civilian operative, who could collect and feed them information or assist in other operations.\nThe character isn't doing this willingly, but he is 'convinced' when the terrorists take his son hostage. Throughout the next eight years, the character *(not by his own will)* commits several crimes, not violent or murderous but many treasonous. He is soon caught by authorities in Houston, Texas. However, the terrorists in question *are* a lot more evil and malicious, and it's possible that during those 8 years, the character had commit a crime that assisted the terrorists in, say, a murder or robbery of protected information.\n\n**Question:**\nEven though he was being forced to do so by terrorists, *would the character be punished like any normal criminal committing these crimes?* I need to know, because he agrees to help authorities put an end to the terrorist group.

The precise scope of what actions are sufficient to establish that duress is present vary. A credible threat that someone will kill you or your child is generally sufficient in every state that recognizes the defense. There is also a closely related defense known as \"choice of evils.\"\n\nThis said, eight years is a very long time and usually the defense of duress is available only if the threat was imminent or immediate. So, it is probably less likely than not that a finder of fact would conclude that it was impossible to seek to involve authorities in the situation, for all of the time in that eight year time period, without reasonably risking the threatened harm.\n\nAlso, while you call his acts \"treasonous\", in reality the crime of treason is defined very narrowly in the U.S. Constitution to taking up arms against your country and providing aid and comfort to people who are doing so, and the fact pattern suggested probably does not constitute treason under U.S. law.\n\nFinally, while his circumstances only dubiously are sufficient to assert a defense of duress over the sustained eight year time period, this doesn't mean that authorities couldn't choose to refrain from prosecuting him, or that the couldn't seek only lesser charges with mitigating circumstances conceded in sentencing, in an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Often this exercise of prosecutorial discretion would be conditioned upon cooperation in the case brought against other defendants in related cases.\n\nIn an exceptional case, the pardon power could be invoked for relieve him from criminal liability as has been done in some past insurrections in U.S. history like the Whiskey Rebellion and the U.S. Civil War. Even treason is a pardonable offense at the federal level. At the federal level in the United States, the President can issue a pardon even if someone has not yet been convicted of the crime in question.\n\n[england](/questions/tagged/england \"show questions tagged 'england'\")\n\nWhile I am not an expert on the exact details of English law, in general, it is harder to claim the defenses of \"duress\" and \"choice of evils\" under English criminal law than it is under the criminal laws of most U.S. jurisdictions. *See* [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70975/can-you-establish-a-guilty-mind-if-the-defendant-is-a-victim-of-blackmail/70979#70979).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a futuristic United States (2191), a civilian is forced by terrorists to commit various crimes over an 8-year period under threat to his son's life. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding his legal situation?\n\nA) The civilian would automatically be exempt from all criminal charges due to the duress he was under for the entire 8-year period.\n\nB) The civilian would likely be convicted of treason, as his actions directly aided a terrorist organization against the United States.\n\nC) The civilian might have a partial defense of duress, but it's unlikely to cover the entire 8-year period, and he could still face some criminal charges.\n\nD) The civilian would have no legal recourse and would be treated exactly the same as any willing participant in the terrorist activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate. While the defense of duress exists in U.S. law for situations where a person commits crimes under credible threats, it typically applies to immediate or imminent threats. An 8-year period is very long, and it's unlikely that a court would accept that the civilian had no opportunity to seek help from authorities during this time. However, the circumstances could be considered mitigating factors, potentially resulting in reduced charges or sentences, especially if the civilian cooperates with authorities. The other options are incorrect because: A) overestimates the scope of the duress defense, B) misuses the term \"treason\" which has a very specific legal definition not necessarily applicable here, and D) ignores the possibility of mitigating circumstances and prosecutorial discretion."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5280/if-one-has-committed-illegal-act-a-or-b-but-we-cannot-prove-that-a-was-committe", "docs_id": 5280, "title": "If one has committed illegal act A or B, but we cannot prove that A was committed or B was committed, is one generally proven guilty of a crime?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Imagine a scenario where you know beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody did something wrong, but you couldn't prove exactly what it was.

This conduct happens not infrequently, and is almost never criminally prosecuted. Police and the NYPD generally treat it is a \"civil matter\" except in the most rare cases, despite the fact that the conduct may violate criminal law. Usually, there are only prosecutions if there is a pattern of conduct by a repeat litigant that exploits someone who does not have access to counsel to represent them (e.g. widows, orphans, and undocumented immigrants). The number of cases brought criminally in this fact pattern in the entire State of New York is unlikely to be more than half a dozen a year in the entire state out of many thousands of instances of this happening every year, and quite possibly only one or two a year.\n\nIt would be unwise to pursue this course of action and would pose a greater risk that your own attorneys would be sanctioned (for violating the ethical rule against using criminal proceedings to gain advantage in a civil matter) than it would of providing a positive benefit to the victim of this conduct.\n\nThe most effective means of obtaining relief would be to file a motion with the judge in the underlying case seeking sanctions against the offending party (or parties), or seeking to hold the offending party (or parties) in contempt of court in the underlying action.\n\nIf an attorney was involved in the misconduct, a complaint to the attorney discipline officials in the State of New York could result in sanctions against the attorney, although this would not result in benefit to the aggrieved party (nor would criminal charges).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil court case in New York City, one party allegedly bribed witnesses and falsified evidence during the proceedings.

Does this vary much by jurisdiction of place?\n\nI'm not opening a debate on reform, just trying to see if I misunderstand the general law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your main misunderstanding is that opposing counsel cannot testify. He can ask a question, such as \"Did you say ...?\", which provides Einstein an opportunity to answer in a way that maintains the credibility of his testimony, but consel cannot just enter his own testimony into the record. In addition, counsel on \"his side\" has the opportunity to pose appropriate clarifying questions, e.g. could ask \"Did you repudiate that idea 88 years ago?\", though there is a problem that the attorney may not have the technical expertise to recognize the subject\\-matter question that they should ask. \n\nExpert testimony does not attempt to determine the state of scholarship in an area, it attempts to resolve a specific factual matter. The two are not the same thing. Einstein would not testify as to what his general and special theories of relativity say, except in a bizarre universe where some person is accused of the crime of denying the theory of relativity. Instead, he might be testifying for the defense, where the defendant is accused of an act that (it turns out) is physically impossible in light of the theory of relativity. If Einstein had been in the habit of posing random mutually\\-contradictory conjectures on a weekly basis, opposing counsel's question could be relevant to establishing that the witness's testimony is not reliable. Theoretically, counsel could \"hint\" that the witness is scientifically flighty, so Einstein would have to have a credible explanation for changing his position. It is easy to demonstrate that scientists in general do change their positions as knowledge expands, so Einstein's burden would not be very substantial.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a court case where Einstein is testifying as an expert witness on relativity, opposing counsel attempts to impeach his testimony by referencing a previous publication mentioning a cosmological constant.

While opposing counsel can attempt to impeach Einstein's testimony by referencing his previous publication, they cannot simply read it into the record as evidence without giving Einstein a chance to respond. The correct procedure would be to ask Einstein about the apparent contradiction.\n\nMoreover, Einstein's own counsel would have the opportunity for redirect examination after cross-examination. During this time, they could ask clarifying questions that would allow Einstein to explain the evolution of his theories, including why he may have changed his stance on the cosmological constant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because opposing counsel cannot simply testify or enter evidence without proper procedure. Option B is incorrect because the jury wouldn't automatically disregard testimony due to an apparent contradiction; they would consider all evidence and explanations.

It is my understanding that under Jewish law, Jews can't attend classes during Passover or certain other holidays. However, there seems to be a trend towards eliminating spring recess from school schedules, and I can't shake the feeling that this is discriminatory and illegal as it would put Jewish students at a disadvantage.\n\nUnder United States federal law, would requiring students to attend classes during religious holidays constitute discrimination, exposing the school to liability under civil rights laws? What if the school provided make\\-up work for students who cannot attend classes but otherwise held classes during such holidays? (Answers that cover this from a federal standpoint are preferred, but if a state is required for an answer, assume New York.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A school district *has* been sued for something like that. In [Church of God, Etc. v. Amarillo Indep. Sch](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/511/613/1429691/)., 511 F. Supp. 613, plaintiffs successfully sued the school district \"to enjoin the enforcement of the Amarillo School District's absence policy which limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays to two days each school year\", where \"A fundamental tenet of the Church of God is that members must abstain from secular activity on seven annual holy days\". The school district imposed an absence polity where \"School work missed may be made up whether an absence is excused or unexcused\", and \"Excused absences shall be granted to students for a maximum of 2 days for religious holidays in each school year\". The court concluded that \"This policy poses an unquestionable burden on the Plaintiffs' religious belief\", and \"This burden is not ameliorated by the make\\-up work provision. The provision does not require a teacher to evaluate the work made up. It in fact directs the teacher to enter a zero for that work\". In this case \"Summary judgment is granted and judgment rendered enjoining the enforcement of the Amarillo Independent School District's excused absence policy insofar as it limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays\". This is not a matter of religious discrimination, this is a First Amendment issue. The policy is in violation of the Free Exercise clause.\n\nEliminating spring break per se is not a problem: doing so and providing no excused absences is the problem. In the above case, there was clear a religious principle of the church to the effect that one must be off the clock on the holiday. As far as I know, there is no requirement to abstain from work or school on Shrove Tuesday, Ash Wednesday or Good Friday. Nevertheless, in recognition of New Jersey state law which allows any student to take off a religious holiday \u2013 including Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday, and dozens more \u2013 the Board of Education has [prepared a list](http://www.state.nj.us/education/genfo/holidays1718.pdf) of such holidays, which includes Wiccan, Hindu, Baha'i, Jewish, Zoroastrian, Church of Scientology (and so on) religious holidays.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A public school district decides to eliminate spring break and requires students to attend classes during religious holidays, including Passover.

This conclusion is supported by the case Church of God, Etc. v. Amarillo Indep. Sch., where a similar policy limiting religious absences was found unconstitutional. The court ruled that such policies place an undue burden on religious beliefs, even when make-up work is allowed. The provision of make-up work does not fully address the issue, as it still requires students to choose between their religious observances and their education. The policy's legality doesn't depend on discrimination against a specific religion (ruling out option B), and the two-day limit mentioned in option D was specifically found inadequate in the cited case.

It does not cover pre-existing IP or projects created outside of work hours that are unrelated to the job. The analysis also notes that attempting to claim unrelated IP might be considered void as against public policy. While option B is close, it's too restrictive by limiting it to only employment hours. Option D more accurately reflects the broader interpretation of work created as part of job duties, which could potentially include work done outside standard hours if it's still part of the job responsibilities."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81660/does-the-eprivacy-directive-apply-to-general-javascript-code", "docs_id": 81660, "title": "Does the ePrivacy directive apply to general JavaScript code?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sweden have a \"cookie law\" that requires constent for non\\-necessary cookies.

For example, given this code:\n\n```\nvar advertising = getAdvertising();\nshowAd(advertising);\n\n```\n\nDo I require consent before serving that code? Why or why not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, the ePrivacy Directive is way more general than cookies. The translated Swedish law seems close to the original in the ePrivacy Directive:\n\n> Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent \\[\u2026]. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service.\n\n(from Art 5(3\\) [ePrivacy Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02002L0058-20091219))\n\nSo, the general question when you access some JavaScript API is: what is the **purpose** of this access?\n\n* Is the access necessary for performing a service that the user explicitly requested? Then fine. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of providing an appropriate layout is fine, because the user explicitly requested you to show them the website. Using LocalStorage to store user data for an offline\\-capable webapp is perfectly fine.\n* Otherwise, you will need consent. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of better ad targeting would require consent, because the user did not explicitly request that you show them targeted ads. The user requested to see a website, and showing ads is not strictly necessary for that. Similarly, using any technologies that access or storage on the user's device to access, store, infer, or construct an advertising ID would require consent.\n\nThe WP29 has discussed this aspect of the ePrivacy Directive in their [Opinion 9/2014 on device fingerprinting (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp224_en.pdf). They explicitly note that \u201cJavaScript objects (e.g., document, window, screen, navigator, date and language)\u201d can be used to form a fingerprint, for example by accessing \u201cinformation relating to the screen size, colour depth and available system fonts. Other APIs may request access to information elements stored in the firmware (e.g. the CPU type), operating system (e.g. the OS type) or graphics card model. API calls may also reveal the presence of installed software (e.g. browser plug\\-ins) or even the precise version number\u201d.\n\nThe document defines criterion A and B to refer to the \u201ccarrying out the transmission\u201d and \u201cstrictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user\u201d exceptions, respectively.\n\n* For the specific case of first\\-party analytics purposes, WP29 notes:\n\n> However, the Opinion also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first\\-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption defined in\n> CRITERION A or B and consent of the user is required.\n* Similarly, for a user tracking for online behavioural advertising use case, WP29 states:\n\n> Opinion 04/2012 emphasised that third\\-party advertising does not fall under the exemption defined in CRITERION A or B. Therefore, device fingerprinting for the purpose of targeted advertising requires the consent of the user.\n\nThe [Opinion 04/2012 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp194_en.pdf) discusses these \u201ccookie consent exceptions\u201d in more detail, but of course this is more general than cookies and applies equivalently to any JavaScript API. In the summary, they caution that the \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d criterion must be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> When applying CRITERION B, it is important to examine what is strictly necessary from the point of view of **the user**, not the service provider.\n\nThese guidelines are rather dated, but since ePrivacy has remained essentially unchanged since then the WP29 guidelines and opinions are still the most authoritative discussion of these matters. The only relevant change is that the GDPR changed the definition of consent. The ePrivacy directive leaves no room for national derogations from the consent exception, though some countries like the Netherlands and (until 2021\\) Germany do provide exceptions. However, it is expected that the ePrivacy Directive will eventually be replaced by an ePrivacy Regulation that allows for access in case of a legitimate interest, similar to the more flexible approach chosen by the GDPR.

The general rule is that whoever creates the thing (book, song, software) has the exclusive right to the thing. If an employee of Company 1 writes software for Company 2, that employee might (rarely) hold the copyright, but typically that scenario would involve a \"work for hire\", where the employee is hired by Company 1 to do such tasks as part of his duties with Company 1 (which might then be given to Company 2\\). This would then be a [work for hire](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf), and the copyright is held by Company 1\\.

Since C1 holds copyright, they must grant a license to C2 so that C2 can legally use it; or, C1 must transfer copyright to C2\\. This does not happen automatically, and (if C1 does not want to remedy the situation after the fact) C2 would need to take C1 to court to force a resolution to the situation. At that point, the issue would be what C1 *implicitly* promised, even though they didn't put it in writing. It is likely that the initial exchange was along the lines \"Can you make us a program that will do X?\", and the answer was \"Sure, that will cost Y\", and then \"Okay, go ahead, looking forward to the product\". The courts would not simply say \"Well, you didn't explicitly require a license, so you don't get to actually use the software that you paid for\". However, it's a somewhat open question whether the court would order a license (of what nature?) or a transfer of copyright.

The Art 2(2\\)(c) exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household activity\u201d does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.\n\nYou must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the *public*. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.\n\nOn a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:\n\n* For what *purpose* are you processing personal data?\n\nContext: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1\\)(b)\n* What is the *legal basis* for processing?\n\nGDPR Art 6(1\\) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.\n* What is the *minimal data necessary* to achieve the purpose?\n\nPer the Art 5(1\\)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide *data protection by design and by default* per Art 25\\. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.\n* What *appropriate safeguards* and security measures should you apply?\n\nPer Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1\\) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.\n* What *further compliance measures* do you have to consider?\n\nThere are additional GDPR and non\\-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:\n\n\t+ Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13\\.\n\t+ Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35\\.\n\t+ If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a *joint controller* or *data processor* and apply appropriate safeguards.\n\t+ If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3\\).\n\t+ If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.\n\t+ If you transfer data into a non\\-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non\\-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45\\. For US\\-based companies, this is the case only when they have self\\-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.Non\\-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.\n* How can you prepare for *data subject requests*?\n\nData subjects have various rights per Arts 15\u201323, subject to the modalities in Art 12\\.

As it explains:\n\n> Congress could also enact new legislation to enforce Section 3 in the\n> aftermath of January 6, much like it did in response to the Civil War.\n> Congress initially provided enforcement of Section 3 of the Fourteenth\n> Amendment through enactment of the First Ku Klux Clan Act in 1870\\.\n> Section 14 of that Act directed the district attorney in each district\n> in which a potentially disqualified person held office to file a writ\n> of quo warranto against the office\\-holder before a judge.

But, that isn't the only conceivable procedural approach.\n\nBut, it isn't obvious that you couldn't have a process in which the determination were made first, administratively, and could be contested within a reasonable time after the person affected has notice of it by having the affected person bring a lawsuit challenging the determination.\n\nThe process would have to have a timeline that would not prevent a person who successfully challenged the classification from running for and winning public office. So, for example, it couldn't be done shortly before an election is held.\n\nThe CRS Report continues by examining some of the other current legislative options:\n\n> In contrast to general procedural legislation akin to the Ku Klux Klan\n> Act, there is some debate as to whether Congress can enact a law\n> naming specific individuals subject to disqualification.

If this is truly the case, then there is no sexual assault.\n\nBut I don't think you meant to say this. As I explain below, in order to consent, A must not have been mistaken about the identity of B: A could not have thought that B was C. If she was mistaken, as you assert in the title and in the second paragraph, then she was not consenting at law in Canada.\n\nThus, I will assume you have used \"consent\" more colloquially, and move on to assess the scenario in which A merely \"consented\" in the sense that she was not physically or otherwise coerced into the physical acts.\n\n### Can mistaken identity result in sexual assault? Yes\n\nIn your scenario, where A thought B was C, the *actus reus* of sexual assault has occured: sexual touching without A's subjective consent. This is because consent is linked to the identity of the partner (see *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17800/index.do) at para. 88\\).\n\nSee also *R. v.

(See also *R. v. O.A.*, [2013 ONCA 581](https://canlii.ca/t/g0qcv), 310 O.A.C. 305\\.)\n\nSince A was mistaken about the identity of the partner, there was no consent.\n\nB may very well have a defence available: mistaken belief in communicated consent (*R. v. Barton*). This defence asserts that the accused did not possess the *mens rea* of sexual assault (which is knowing of the lack of consent, or being reckless as to the lack of consent). This defence asserts that, despite A not consenting, B believed that A did consent. This was the attempted defence in *G.C.* and *O.A.*, cited above.\n\nFor this defence to be successful, B's belief in A's communicated consent must be based on reasonable steps taken by B to ascertain consent. Whether the steps taken by B were reasonable depends on what was known to B at the time.\n\n> the accused must take steps that are objectively reasonable, and the reasonableness of those steps must be assessed in light of the circumstances known to the accused at the time\n\nIn your scenario, you have not asserted that there is anything *known to B* about \"similar facial characteristics \\[he shares] with A's boyfriend.\" However\n\n* if it is well\\-known to B that he looks like C, and\n* depending on how similar the features are, and\n* depending on what B knew about A's ability to discern the difference between B and C\n\nthis might put an obligation on B to affirmatively confirm with crystal clear language that A knows that B is not C, failing which, he would not have the defence of mistaken belief in communicated consent. For example, in *G.C.* (the identical\\-twin case), \"\\[t]he trial judge recited the relevant facts of that night known to the appellant and concluded that without doing more than he did to make his identity perfectly clear to the complainant, the appellant could not be said to have taken reasonable steps necessary to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.\"\n\n---\n\nAnticipating comments that will always come up about evidence: this answer intentionally skips over questions like \"how would you prove X in court.\" This answer only says what the law is and what would have to be proven.

According to Canadian law, the actus reus (physical element) of sexual assault has occurred because A's consent was based on a mistaken belief about B's identity. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that consent is linked to the identity of the partner, and a mistaken belief about identity results in no consent under the Criminal Code.\n\nHowever, B may have a defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent. This defense asserts that B did not possess the mens rea (mental element) of sexual assault if he genuinely believed A had consented. For this defense to be successful, B must have taken reasonable steps to ascertain consent based on the circumstances known to him at the time.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because consent in law requires the complainant to not be mistaken about the identity of their sexual partner.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the actus reus is present, B's guilt would depend on whether he had the required mens rea and whether he can successfully argue the defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because A's mistaken belief about B's identity is highly relevant under Canadian law, even if B did not intentionally deceive A."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70320/is-it-legal-for-some-employees-to-have-to-clock-in-and-out-and-others-not-if-the", "docs_id": 70320, "title": "Is it legal for some employees to have to clock in and out and others not if they are in the same role?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work in the same position and with same job description as other employees.

The change being discussed is actually a change in how economists and corporate law theorists think about corporations. \n\nThe basics of corporate law did not change significantly in the 1970s. There were some minor changes starting to take place then in law and practice, however. \n\nThe most notable of these were the rise of insider trading laws with real bite, the innovation in financial practice of the leveraged buy\\-out which precipitated \"poison pill\" defense from board of directors, and the surge in CEO pay often in the form of stock options. \n\nThere has been a shift in perspective and framing of the issues, but these changes are not huge changes in corporate law *per se*. Legal decisions allowing \"poison pills\" were minor anti\\-shareholder rights innovations. Tax laws encouraging stock option compensation were minor shareholder value oriented innovations. The theoretical basis of insider trading laws is a doctrinal muddle. No one conception of the corporation is completely dominant today and drives all legal theory and policy decisions.\n\nSecondly, Lynn Stout is engaged in a misleading bit of ret\\-con in her article and is presenting a misleading history of the evolution of corporate law scholarship. \n\nThis history, by the way, isn't terribly old. The right to form a corporation without a specific piece of authorizing legislation of the kind that creates a government agency, for example, is only about 150 years old or so, and both internationally and until quite recently, was much harder to form (e.g. many countries, such as South Korea, require proof that a corporation has insurance in place and sufficient capital to pay its debts before it is allowed to incorporate \\- corporate law firms still face some of these restrictions in the U.S.) Before then, each corporation was an individual legislative concept to some extent.\n\nThe notion that corporations should maximize shareholder well being, because they own the corporation, is the older and traditional view. Milton Friedman and the authors of \"The Theory of The Firm\" were simply restating the consensus view in a more focused and economically defined manner, not innovating. These pieces were published as apologies for that traditional view once it started to be challenged.\n\nThe view of a corporation as a web of contractual relationship with bondholders, suppliers, employees, customers and shareholders is the more modern view that started to gain currency sometime around the 1960s and 1970s, which is why people like Milton Friedman felt the need to articulate a defense of the traditional view that had previously merely been assumed and gone unchallenged. \n\nThe web of contracts theory was articulated initially to a great extent by corporate law theorists seeking to provide a theoretical justification for corporations to act in a responsible manner that treats its employees well, behaves honestly, goes above and beyond its legal obligations to honor the spirit as well as the letter of the law, etc.\n\nSome of the most notable corporate law responses to that theory are the law of publicly held companies in Germany, which requires that employees have a minority number of seats on the board of directors of a company, and the laws in some Scandinavian countries that call for rough gender parity on corporate boards of directors. There have also been a smattering of laws passed at least authorizing corporations to consider factors other than profit maximization.\n\nAnother related version of corporate theory to the web of contract theory is the \"director primacy\" conception of the corporation that sees a corporate board of directors as the hub of that web of contracts and the body which corporate law should protect the power of. [Professor Stephen Bainbridge](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/about.html) at UCLA Law is one of the leading proponents of this minority view of corporate law which was starting to emerge in the 1980s to justify efforts by corporate boards to defend themselves from the emerging threats of leveraged buyouts and proxy fights.\n\nBainbridge's view is nonetheless significant because it is an overarching theory that explains a variety of major corporate law doctrines, particularly in Delaware, whose law is dominant in the governance of publicly held corporations, that seem to be at odds with a shareholder primacy view of corporate law. It can explain the legitimacy of both \"poison pills\" and large CEO pay packages, the Delaware court's hostility to derivative suits, and its hostility to shareholder activism. To some extent, the \"director primacy\" view of corporate law is the web of contracts theory twisted and seen through a conservative lens that uses the theory to urge the law to crush the kind of shareholder activism for social good and employee rights that the original web of contracts sought to advance.\n\nThe rights of everyone other than a shareholder in a corporation are simply contract law rights \\- bond contracts, purchase and sale contracts, employment contracts, etc. \n\nThe web of contracts theory argues that the legal rights of shareholders vis\\-a\\-vis a corporation really aren't that different and that this relationship is really more like any other contract right rather than really being a genuine ownership relationship like the kind of ownership someone has over their other property that should be entitled to special consideration. \n\nThis view has a lot to do with the fact that in publicly held companies, in reality, shareholders have no meaningful role in the governance of the corporation or selection of members of the board of directors via the occasional Soviet style ballots for directors that they complete. Instead, in this context, shareholders apply the \"Wall Street Rule\" and sell stocks of companies that they feel are ill governed and don't worry too much about their practical inability to compel dividend distributions since they can take profits from retained earns by selling their stocks. This makes them look more like people with any other commodity to trade with purely contract and not political/ownership rights. This view doesn't translate well to closely held corporations where shareholder governance rights, in practice, are much more meaningful.\n\nAlso, for completeness, it is worth noting yet another emerging view of corporate law theory, developed mostly by liberals who favor campaign finance restrictions for corporations and want to restrain what they see as abuses of power by big business. This is the anti\\-corporate personhood movement that questions the assumption of all previous theorists that corporations should be treated in most respects as a \"person\" under the law. \n\nFor what it is worth, in my opinion, this movement improperly conflates abuses and power divisions that arise from businesses being very large and those attributable to the corporate form of business organization itself which actually can be very helpful in regulating businesses and redressing the harms that individuals suffer from corporate activities, by making it unnecessary to identify who within the corporation in particular causes a harm attributable to the corporation in litigation and regulatory contexts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the evolution of corporate law theory from the 1970s onward?\n\nA) Milton Friedman introduced the revolutionary concept of maximizing shareholder value, which fundamentally changed corporate law and practice.\n\nB) The web of contracts theory emerged as a challenge to the traditional shareholder primacy view, promoting consideration of multiple stakeholders.\n\nC) Director primacy theory, developed by Stephen Bainbridge, became the dominant view in corporate law, replacing shareholder primacy.\n\nD) Anti-corporate personhood movement became the prevailing corporate law theory, reshaping how corporations are treated under the law.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

To the best of my understanding (unlike Whatsapp which is built upon the TCP/IP stack) SMS is not a connection\\-oriented protocol i.e. Message Sent does not equate to Message Received. Although TSP do endeavour to provide a receipt, delivery of an SMS may fail silently. It may even transpire that an SMS is delivered only partially. Ergo, whilst the lessor may have sent the message (and have proof of dispatch) it does not follow that the message was received and received in the form intended.\n\nIs there a precedent elsewhere (outside India) for an intimation sent by SMS to be deemed a legal summons?

Indeed I suspect that SMS is rather more reliable, although I have no statistics at hand.\n\nNote that in this case the language specifies that notice is to be sent by registered post **and also by** email, SMS, or Whatsapp. Thus there should always be proof via the registered letter, and normally quick delivery by electronic means.\n\nIn any case the parties to the contract may specify whatever methods of delivery they choose.

However, it's often up to lay citizens to notice these discrepancies and take them to court for appeal. Even when the cases are very clear\\-cut, it can take months or years, and by the time it's done, a whole new set of quick\\-and\\-dirty executive regulations may have come out.\n\nI'd like to know if, given the at least attempted \"formal algorithm\" method of the law, there wouldn't be an automated method of parsing the laws for contradictions, formal inconsistencies, endless loops, or undesirable end\\-states. I'd likewise appreciate an automated system for parsing out the control flows in the laws and turning them into easily\\-readable, standardized diagrams and charts.\n\nNow, However, I don't know enough about programming, particularly as applied to linguistics, to figure out what the best approach would be. If y'all got any insights, I'd strongly appreciate them.\n\nThe DEFINITIONS part is particularly tricky for me, as we've got, off the top of my head:\n\n1. Agents\n\t* Public ones: Courts, Legislative Assemblies, Administrations, Department, Position (distinct to the person of the civil servant in it), \"Organ\", etc. (it's quite a tangled web of affiliations and dependencies, and liable to change quickly, too).\n\t* Private citizens, with the attributes thereof that are deemed relevant (nationals/EU citizens/foreign, major/minor, etc.)\n\t* Private associations: Privately or Publicly owned, For Profit or Non Profit, different types of corporation...\n2. Actions: For example, for a person to be \\[appointed to an Positon],\n\\-Organ A \\[nominates],\n\\-Organ B \\[introduces in the agenda],\n\\-Organ C \\[votes],\n\\-Organ D \\[vetoes or not],\n\\-Organ E \\[signs the appointment],\n\\-Organ F \\[publishes] in the official bulletin, etc.\n3. Documents: just in the example above, each action or lack thereof is recorded (actively or by default) in a document (Nomination, Minutes, Appointment, the Bulletin, etc.). Then you have stuff like Registries and Records, which are compilations of documents, and need to be distinguished from the Organs named after them that are in charge of running them. You have Contracts, which are a whole Thing themselves. You have your specific Administrative Acts and your General Decrees. And, well, I can't help but think of the myriad types of documents, both formal and not, that are introduced in \\- discovery, was it? \\- as Evidence.\n4. Dates and timestamps are very important, as are the specific windows and deadlines to perform this or that action.\n5. Principles: they're very annoying because they're unevenly applied and usually not self explanatory, but they're supposed to inform all legislation and, when they're in the Consitution, they're meant to be very binding indeed. Legality, Rule of Law, State of Law, Non\\-Arbitrariness, Objectivity, Impartiality, Transparency, Non\\-Retroactiveness, General Interest, Cooperation, Coordination...\n\t* It's possible to go to the Doctrine (i.e., the opinions of Respected Legal Scholars) or to Case Law (which tend to rule on ambiguities of this type) to construct something resembling a useful formal definition, but it's usually very difficult to avoid a degree of \"fuzziness\" and \"gradient\" in the concept.\n\t* As such, my impression is that any formal tests that one could devise to make sure the laws apply those principles would fall under the header of operationalization, i.e. answering a difficult question with a similar, much simpler one.\n\t\t+ The example I was given in Philosophy of Science class at Uni was: \"How much do you love your wife?\" vs. \"How high a voltage are you willing to be shocked with in order to guarantee that she herself does not get shocked?\"\n\t\t+ Likewise, \"is this law impartial\" could be turned into \"in practice, what demographics are disproportionately favored by it and what aren't\", although that requires going outside of the formal confines of the law. There's likely a way to formally test if, in theory, the law is impartial, but I can't think of one right now.\n\t\t+ Similarly, the concept of \"General Interest\" is quite problematic\n\t\t\\- a huge collection of subjective interests that seems incredibly hard to even *know* objectively, let alone turn into a set of quantitative criteria, or legislate for without biases or hidden assumptions,\n\t\t\\- and yet \"the Administration serves the General Interest Objectively and Impartially\" is an actual article of Law that is in effect and which you could refer to in court when appealing an administrative regulation or act that you have evidence serves Special Interests, is Subjective, or favors certain parties over others.\n\nI've been circling the problem, reading some law, attempting a chart and a pseudo\\-code, going to practical cases, reading some theory on the background thereof, learning about different coding languages and practicing simple exercises just to get the hang of them, etc. I'm slowly growing familiar with declarative, imperative, object\\-oriented, etc languages, as well as Controlled Natural Languages and attempts to make programming easy to parse for people and human language easy to parse for machine. I'm finding out about programs and AIs that are designed to parse language, and about statistical methods to hermeneutics and data analysis.\n\nIt's been quite haphazard and unstructured, and I feel like I may be wasting my time blindly touching an elephant's trunk and trying to figure out what sort of snake it is. But I'm afraid to raise my voice, explaining what I'm doing and ask, \"am I doing this right\" and of either being ignored or being told to ask a more specific and well\\-researched question. I'd really appreciate some guidance, though.\n\nI guess, for now, I'd be content with tips on how to approach the following problems, in order of priority:\n\n* automating the representation of laws as control flow charts\n* automating the discovery of\n\t+ undesirable loops and end\\-states in said flow charts\n\t+ fringe cases that are pedagogically optimal for explaining the nuts and bolts of the law to people learning it\n\t+ ambiguous language: when a word means different things depending on which \"semantic field\" of law we're in \\- for example, \"convention\" can mean very different kinds of agreements in Civil Law, Administrative Law dealing with private entities, Administrative law dealing with different tiers of the Administration, and International Law, just to name a few.\n\t+ formal contradictions between laws of equal and different tiers\n\nThat would be a good start \\- just a formal comprehension and testing of the law.\n\nOther than that, I'm aware that LawTech firms [are developing some truly interesting applications](https://www.legalgeek.co/startup-map/) on a number of subjects, with particular attention paid to contract drafting and enforcement, and the automation thereof, as well as to the prediction of outcomes in lawsuits based on case analytics. I'm not, however, aware of the theoretical and skillset edifice upon which this kind of work is build \\- but it interests me a great deal. In fact, I'm finding Law so fascinating and vitally important that I'm actually considering getting a Law degree myself \\- I understand that STEM\\-trained folks are actually rather welcome in Law Schools?

While a game developer cannot copyright the concept of a damaging scream or invisibility power, they may have some protection for the specific way they implement and express that ability in their game (e.g., unique visual effects, specific gameplay mechanics).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because ability names alone, especially if based on common concepts, are generally not copyrightable.\n\nAnswer B is false because concepts and ideas cannot be copyrighted, regardless of who implements them first.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as there is no automatic copyright protection for game abilities based on popularity, and court cases have generally upheld that ideas and concepts are not copyrightable."}}
