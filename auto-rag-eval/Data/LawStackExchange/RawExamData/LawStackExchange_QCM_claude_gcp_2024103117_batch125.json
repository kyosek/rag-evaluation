If someone knowingly and intentionally destroyed an embryo conceived via IVF but not implanted yet what kind of consequences do they face?

Those laws are currently unconstitutional. A state could certainly prescribe some criminal punishment in a case like this one, but punishing under existing manslaughter or murder laws would almost surely not be upheld under existing law (subject to change without advanced notice by the U.S. Supreme Court).\n\n> If someone knowingly and intentionally destroyed an embryo conceived\n> via IVF but not implanted yet what kind of consequences do they face?\n> Is the potential life treated differently or is this just destruction\n> of property?\n\nThis is a tough question that probably doesn't have a uniform answer under the law of all U.S. states.\n\nFor one thing, it isn't clear who, if anyone, has property rights in the embryo. It is certainly conceivable that a state might instead conclude that the donor receiving the IVF treatment has only contract rights in it (and breach of a contract is not a crime).\n\nIt might be viewed as a property destruction case. There might be a specific statute on point. There might be a civil lawsuit remedy. In most states, this would be an issue of first impression and a court would look a competing ways that cases had been handled in other jurisdictions to decide what to do in its case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a state with a \"life begins at conception\" law, if someone intentionally destroys an embryo created through IVF but not yet implanted, which of the following is most likely to be true regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The person would definitely face murder charges due to the \"life begins at conception\" law.\n\nB) The person could face criminal charges, but likely not murder or manslaughter under current constitutional interpretations.\n\nC) The person would face no legal consequences as embryos are considered personal property.\n\nD) The person would only face civil lawsuits for breach of contract with no possibility of criminal charges.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While states with \"life begins at conception\" laws may attempt to criminalize the destruction of embryos, current constitutional interpretations make it unlikely that murder or manslaughter charges would be upheld. The documentation suggests that states could prescribe some criminal punishment, but applying existing murder laws would likely not be constitutionally valid. The legal status of embryos is complex and varies by state, potentially involving property rights, contract rights, or specific statutes. While civil lawsuits are possible, criminal charges other than murder or manslaughter are not ruled out.

We are starting to get to the contract talks and I wanted to make sure if anything goes horrible wrong in the event of hacking or loss of money from their store being down. I am not open to be sued personal and have my personal assets at risk. If I created an LLC for my freelance work would this protect me from losing an personal assets in the case of a lawsuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An LLC (subject to exceptions that authorize piercing the corporate veil, the most common of which are co\\-mingling personal and LLC funds without proper documentation and fraudulent transfers such as distributions of profits from the LLC to the owner while the LLC is insolvent or facing litigation) protects its owners from personal liability for obligations of the LLC in tort or in contract, *in their capacity as owners of the LLC*.\n\nIf the LLC is a party to a contract which the owner does not guarantee, the LLC is very good protection against personal liability for the contractual debts of the LLC (of course, the property of the LLC itself, including its intellectual property, is subject to the LLC's creditors claims).\n\nIf the LLC is sued for a tort, the protection is less perfect because in addition to suing an LLC for a tort (since the LLC is vicariously liable for anything done by its employees or agents under the doctrine of respondiat superior) anyone who personally participated in tortious activity may be sued personally, rather than as an agent of the LLC, for their own personal tortious actions.\n\nFor example, suppose that the LLC sold software that contained code that embezzled funds from the customer's bank accounts and gave the money to the Salvation Army which had no involvement whatsoever in creating the software (a Robin Hood virus). This would be tortious (probably conversion or civil theft, at a minimum), and the LLC would be liable in tort for this tortious act because it was committed by someone acting on its behalf. But, the human being who actually wrote that code while working for the LLC would also be personally liable in tort for the harm caused because they personally participated in that tort. But, if that person's manager at the LLC never knew that this was done by the employee, the manager would not have personal liability.\n\nOf course, nothing under the sun can prevent you from being sued. Anyone with a word processor, the filing fee and a process server can sue you for anything. The substantive law can make it more or less likely that you will be found by the court to have legal liability in the end. Also, some suits can be dismissed early in the process, while in the case of other suits, even if you are in the right, it can take a long court process to prove that fact.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A freelance developer creates an LLC for their work and enters into a contract with a client to develop an e-commerce platform.

However, the Statute provides that the signature may be made by a person authorised by you.\n* In Australia, a Commonwealth income tax return must be signed by the taxpayer. The taxpayer must sign it personally. If you get your assistant to sign it then you haven't filled it in properly and you are liable to be fined for failure to lodge a valid tax return. There are rules in the legislation for corporations, e.g. the public officer signs it. Sometimes the law allows a tax agent/accountant to sign a form. The theme is that the law provides specific rules.\n* In Australia, banknotes must bear the signatures of two senior officials such as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. However, the law imposing this requirement allows a great deal of flexibility about how these signatures are applied, freeing these officials from the tedium of signing millions of banknotes: Reserve Bank Act 1959, s 37\\.\n\nIn the case of a letter, there are no specific laws about who can sign it and how. You could very well get an employee to sign it for you.\n\nThe other issue to be aware of is deception. If I write you a letter signed \"Kim Kardashian\", but she has no idea I've done this and has not given me permission, but I lead you to believe that Kim Kardashian just wrote you a letter saying you're great, and then you go and embarrass yourself posting that letter on Facebook, then potentially I am in a bit of trouble. (A more serious example would be where I impersonate your bank and purport to waive the repayments on your mortgage, resulting in you defaulting.) In such a case, the relevant laws are the various laws to do with deception, not laws specifically about who can sign a document.\n\n**Is it legal for a single individual to use multiple signatures when signing legal documents (ie, is there a requirement your signature be identifiable or consistent)?**\n\nThis is fine. A real signature is not like a cryptographic signature. Its function is not to, by itself, prove the authenticity of a document. The act of signing something is significant because it shows commitment, etc, and for very important documents (e.g. deeds) people (or the law) will ask for the signature to be witnessed. The verification in that case comes from the witness being able to testify as to who they saw sign the document, not the appearance of the signature itself. \n\nKeep in mind that the law related to signatures evolved at a time when not everybody could write their name and continues to accomodate people who cannot today. \n\nThere is no reason or principle requiring an individual to use a consistent signature.\n\nThere is a practical exception in relation to banks. Banks keep a specimen signature on file for each customer and use this to decide whether to accept withdrawal slips, cheques etc. It is not an ideal system (it is not hard to forge a signature well enough to get past a teller) but in conjunction with the banks' other fraud prevention methods it is the best they can do. However, this is a matter of their own risk management not a legal requirement. If you were transacting in person at the branch and the teller knew you and the bank manager was happy, legally you could sign withdrawal slips with an \"X\" or a different signature every time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company sends out multiple documents demanding payment, all bearing the name of the same individual on the signature line.

According to the documentation, there is no legal requirement for an individual to use a consistent signature across documents. The law allows for flexibility in signatures, and variation in a person's signature does not inherently make a document illegal or invalid. However, significant variations might raise questions about the authenticity of the documents or the authorization of the signatories.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because consistency in signatures is not a legal requirement. Answer B is partially true but too restrictive; while authorization can be a factor in some contexts, it's not always necessary for signature variation to be legal.

As stated in the documentation, \"Usually, an order would specify what happens.

One between the freelancer and the client (the F\\-C contract).\n\nUnder the F\\-C contract, the client owes the freelancer money. Under the C\\-P contract the platform agrees to collect the money from the client. Under the F\\-P contract the platform agrees to remit the funds to the freelancer (less the fee, I assume).\n\nUnder the F\\-P contract, the freelancer assumes the risk of fraud on behalf of the client. This is a perfectly sensible thing for a contract to address; contracts are fundamentally about risk allocation after all. So, if there is fraud or suspected fraud, the freelancer cops the loss. They have no cause of action against the platform because the platform is only doing what the F\\-P contract requires \\- that is, there is no breach of contract.\n\nThe freelancer does have a cause of action against the client under the F\\-C contract, so they can sue the client for the money.

This is because:\n\n1. The platform's Terms of Service likely allow them to withhold funds during a fraud investigation, which is not necessarily an unfair contract term under Australian Consumer Law.\n\n2.

The lack of a clear, authoritative reference to government laws or official clauses makes it difficult to determine the exact legal status.

The boundaries of it are well known as I did a redefinition survey to find them out. Let's call this land ***A***.\n\nHistorically, land A has had a piece of local authority land attached to it as the fence was erected far too over the legal property boundary of A. Let's call this adjoining local authority land ***B***.\n\nPrevious owners used to graze sheep on the whole fenced area (A\\+B) and both the local community and authorities were fine with it.

I have been approached by the authorities with basically two options:\n\n1. To continue to be regarded as \"occupier\" of B and therefore take responsibility for issues occurring on it e.g. controlling/removing gorse;\n2. To say that I have no use of B so that they care of the gorse the way they want. Specifically, they would spray it.\n\nThe main concern with the 2nd option is that the chemicals used for spraying would be washed out on A because B is higher up the hill. I am therefore keen to keep occupying B and control it the way I want e.g. mow it or plant a food forest. And here comes the question:\n\n*Is there any way I could legally fix my free occupation of B so that I could protect it from trespassing?* Say if I were to grow fruits on it, I would need to be entitled to say \"no\" to any people who would want to go there and pick/\"steal\" fruits.

You don't have any ability to claim it your own by adverse possession or by any means except for outright purchase.

See [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02\\.html\\#en\\_US\\_2016\\_publink1000229343](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000229343).\n\nSo the employees would be required to report the dollar value of their scrip as income.

The IRS requires taxpayers to report the fair market value (in US dollars) of any income received, regardless of the form in which it was paid. This is considered \"barter income\" and is treated the same as cash income for tax purposes. Failing to report such income or intentionally misrepresenting its value could be considered tax evasion.

Each cover needs to be researched individually to determine its copyright status and owner. The age of the book (1950s) doesn't automatically place it in the public domain. The designer would need to check the copyright information in the book, contact the listed rightsholder or licensee, and possibly conduct further research to determine if and how they can use the image legally. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they oversimplify the copyright process or make false assumptions about copyright duration and fair use."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1763/is-an-implied-physical-threat-via-looming-over-someone-legal", "docs_id": 1763, "title": "Is an implied physical threat via looming over someone legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Lets say that two individuals approach another person and start asking him questions or ask him to do something (for instance leave an area).

(This is a one time incident, and not recurring harassment.)\n\nIs the use of such implied physical intimidation to compel someone legal? If it isn't are there rules in place to decide what qualifies as implied intimidation? There must be some yardstick, otherwise anyone could claim they felt intimidated regardless of the intent of the person they were speaking to.\n\nThis is a question mainly asked out of curiosity, derived from my thinking of a situation over a year ago where three people decided that just because the child I was with was a different race then myself I must therefore be plotting to drag him away to a windowless van with the words \"Free candy\" written on its side. In that case the child's mother (my close friend) came over and sent them away, but it bothered me that they left muttering that I was\"'lucky\" as if my horrible crime of being a mentor for a child was something that clearly should have resulted in a worse fate then just being harassed by three men and accused of something that is obviously quite morally repugnant.)\n\nI find myself curious what the laws would be about their trying to harass me into answering their questions. In this case they outnumbered me 3 to 1\\. Looking back I realize one man actually left to get the other two to back him before returning to harass me, and I feel there was a clear intent to physically intimidate me into answering their questions. The child confirmed he knew me and I was a family friend. At that point they continued to harass me both to explain my exact relationship to the child's mother (which I refused to, due to the personal nature of the relationship), give them my full name, and to take them to his mother. \n\nI cooperated with them because I'm not one to cause trouble, and in particular did not wish to concern the child, but if I had chosen to be obstinate, or the mother wasn't available to appease them, what would the legal rules have been?

A tort of assault does not require actual contact, whereas some jurisdictions define criminal assault elements as those of battery; in others, it is an intended battery without the contact. \n\nThe elements of common law assault are:\n\n1. *A positive, voluntary act*  \n\nYou can't do this accidentally or negligently\n2. *That intentionally causes reasonable apprehension in the plaintiff*  \n\nThe person must reasonably apprehend contact. However, this is a subjective standard. If the plaintiff does not apprehend contact, then this element is not satisfied.  \n\nAdditionally, while words alone are rarely enough to satisfy this element, words in a certain tone, or with certain actions, may be. Also, verbal threats are not required for this element.\n3. *Of immediate*  \n\nYou can't assault someone by threatening them with something that'll happen in the future, if it's distant enough. Whether this is distant enough is decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis.\n4. *Unlawful contact*  \n\nThe contact needs to be unlawful and harmful.\n\nIn the situation you describe, a civil action in assault would have all requirements fulfilled. You might also succeed in pressing criminal charges, depending on the jurisdiction concerned.\n\nPolice officers generally have the power to maintain the peace, and an assault is most definitely a breach of the peace.

The scenario described meets all the elements of the tort of assault: it's a positive, voluntary act that intentionally causes reasonable apprehension of immediate unlawful contact in the plaintiff.

For example, if I play a movie from a streaming service and screen\\-share on Zoom, I would be committing civil copyright infringement (if it is not fair use), but if I give other people my login credentials for the streaming service, it would be theft of service, I think, depending on the jurisdiction ([http://nashvilleattorneynow.com/criminal\\-defense/nashville\\-criminal\\-attorney\\-explains\\-theft\\-tennessee\\-netflix\\-password\\-sharing/](http://nashvilleattorneynow.com/criminal-defense/nashville-criminal-attorney-explains-theft-tennessee-netflix-password-sharing/)). Is there a clear distinction between the civil and criminal offenses in cases like this, what is that distinction, and why is that?\n\nAlso, how does this distinction affect the outcome for a person liable/guilty of either?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> if a friend hires someone to fix something in their house, but after\n> the repairs are done, the friend refuses to pay, this would likely\n> fall under theft of service.\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\nThe most common distinction is intent. (The [federal Canadian criminal code provision](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-322.html) for theft (Section 332\\) requires intent to commit the crime, although \"[false pretenses](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-81.html#h-122229)\" (Section 362\\) is probably a better match within the Canadian criminal code to theft of services and also requires a showing of intent).\n\nIf breaching a promise to pay that the person making the promise to pay intended to be honor when the promise was made fails to pay (e.g. due to poor budgeting or losing a job) this is a breach of contract.\n\nSimilarly, if someone accidentally attaches the wrong cable line to their TV and gets the premium package rather than the regular one, but didn't realize that fact, the cable company might have a claim for negligence or for unjust enrichment, but this would not constitute theft.\n\nIn contrast, obtaining services knowing at the outset that you do not intend to honor your promise yet deceiving the service provider with your promise is theft. Theft (in the context of a theft of services) is intentionally obtaining services by deceit with an intent not to pay for them at the time that they are obtained.\n\nProving this intent is usually prohibitively difficult and no something that law enforcement will choose to press charges regarding, but with very clear evidence (e.g. an audiotape of the person making a promise to pay bragging immediately before or after making the promise to pay about how he never intends to pay in the first place, or in a case with a pattern of conduct involving many service providers on multiple occasions), charges can be pressed and a conviction can be won.\n\nAlso, to be clear, it has nothing to do, *per se*, with the power relationships of the parties. If an employer picks up a bunch of day laborers telling them that they will be paid an agreed rate at the end of the day for the work they are made to do, and the employer not only doesn't pay them at the end of the day but didn't intend to do so in the first place and perhaps has a practice of picking up day laborers and then refusing to pay them without good cause, that is theft of services a.k.a. wage theft.\n\n> if I play a movie from a streaming service and screen\\-share on Zoom, I\n> would be committing civil copyright infringement (if it is not fair\n> use), but if I give other people my login credentials for the\n> streaming service, it would be theft of service, I think, depending on\n> the jurisdiction\n\nThis isn't a good analogy as it implicates copyright law which is quite different from other bodies of law.\n\nSome acts are both civil and criminal copyright violations. But criminal copyright violations are generally not a theft of services.\n\n[In Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_(Canada)), the typical criminal copyright violation involves the sale or rental of the copyright protected material to third parties for money.\n\n> how does this distinction affect the outcome for a person\n> liable/guilty of either?\n\nCivil law violations are a basis to bring a lawsuit against someone who breaches the law in a civil manner for money damages sufficient to compensate the person bringing the lawsuit for the damages that they have suffered.\n\nTheft is a criminal offense. The prosecutor's office decides whether or not to bring charges and if it does bring charges does so (in Canada) in the name of the Crown, at the government's expense under criminal procedure rather than the civil procedure applicable to lawsuits. The victim is usually a witness and is usually consulted, but is not a party to a criminal case. If a conviction is obtained for a criminal offense, the penalty is usually some combination of incarceration, a fine, probation and community service, as authorized by statute, with court costs and restitution to the victim tacked on as an afterthought. The measure of what is owed as restitution is typically more grudging than the measure of the damages that can be awarded in a civil lawsuit.\n\nThe two remedies are not mutually exclusive.

The key distinction between a civil and criminal offense in this scenario is intent. If the homeowner truly never intended to pay from the outset and deceived the plumber, this could be considered theft of services, which is a criminal offense. However, proving this intent is usually very difficult without clear evidence (such as an admission or a pattern of similar behavior). As a result, such cases are often treated as civil matters of breach of contract.

I know that police officers in the United States are allowed to lie. Is this an example of the officer lying to the suspect to get him to admit to a smaller amount of cocaine, or is it true that for some reason the weight of the container is included when charging people for possession?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a slim chance that it is truish, depending on whose law you are asking about, and also depending on the facts (if the drug was in a baggie, it's unclear; it is was mixed with the soda, it's clear and it's true). As far as I know, the \"baggie in can\" theory has not been put to the appellate test (perhaps that is evidence that the can does not count). However, in the case [Chapman v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/500/453/), 500 U.S. 453, defendant was convicted of the sale of LSD\\-laced blotter paper, and was sentenced accosting to the 5\\.7 gram weight of the blotter paper, not the 50 milligram weight of the LSD that it contained. SCOTUS upheld the sentencing based on the higher weight, holding that \"The statute requires the weight of the carrier medium to be included when determining the appropriate sentencing for trafficking in LSD\", because the statute is stated in terms of a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" ([here, 21 USC 841](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/841), are some of the current laws, which repeated use the formula \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\").\n\nThe question that would arise is whether a can containing a bag of something is a \"substance\" or \"mixture\". The ordinary meaning of \"mixture\" precludes that interpretation, but of course you also have to look at the legislative history to determine what Congress's intent was in writing these laws. Saying that a can with a bag is a \"substance\" is also counter\\-intuitive, but not as plainly unreasonable as calling a can and a bag a \"mixture\". In *Chapman*, the court observed that \"Congress clearly intended the dilutant, cutting agent, *or carrier medium* to be included in the weight of those drugs for sentencing purposes\", but again you might interpret \"carrier medium\" as referring to something other than \"the means of carrying the drug\" \u2013 \"carrier medium\" is not statutorily defined, and its \"plain meaning\" is broad (but also note that the statute doesn't mention \"carrier medium\"). In its ruling, the court appeals to \"the history of Congress's attempts to control illegal drug distribution\", and a careful study of all of the pertinent documents for this case might definitively rule in vs. out an interpretation that the weight of the container is to be included.\n\nAn obvious ludicrous consequence of including container weight is that if you are arrested for possession of a trace amount of a drug, found in your car, the weight of the car is to be considered and you get life in prison. It is plausible that the officer has a vague acquaintance with the Chapman\\-type ruling, and has misapplied the law, thus he has a good\\-faith belief that his claim is legally correct (thus he did not lie, he was simply wrong).

US case established that the weight of carrier mediums or substances mixed with drugs (such as LSD-laced blotter paper) is included in the total weight for sentencing purposes. This is based on the statutory language referring to a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of the drug. However, the case does not definitively state that external containers like soda cans would be included. The inclusion of carrier mediums is based on the idea that they are integral to the drug's distribution or consumption, which may not apply to external packaging.

And is a PA divorce usually that much better for a man than a NJ divorce?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: New Jersey has jurisdiction under [N.J.S.A. 2A:34\\-10](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2017/title-2a/section-2a-34-10/) provided that \n\n> at the time the cause of action arose, either party was a bona fide\n>  resident of this State, and has continued so to be down to the time of\n>  the commencement of the action; except that no action for absolute\n>  divorce or dissolution of a civil union shall be commenced for any\n>  cause other than adultery, unless one of the parties has been for the\n>  1 year next preceding the commencement of the action a bona fide\n>  resident of this State;\n\n(which if you undo the contorted writing, mean one of you must be a resident for a year, except if the cause is adultery). Under this scenario, the wife did not continue to be a resident of NJ, so it is crucial that the husband be a bona fide resident. The problem is that there is no general law defining residency for all legal purposes, instead, residency is defined on a law\\-by\\-law basis (or, not defined). [52:14\\-7](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2017/title-52/section-52-14-7/) which imposes a residency requirement on state employees says that\n\n> a person may have at most one principal residence, and the state of a\n>  person's principal residence means the state (1\\) where the person\n>  spends the majority of the person's nonworking time, and (2\\) which is\n>  most clearly the center of the person's domestic life, and (3\\) which\n>  is designated as the person's legal address and legal residence for\n>  voting.\n\nThe husband is apparently an NJ resident under (1\\) and probably (2\\), and possibly (3\\). It would not matter whether he was living in that particular house, the question was whether he was living in the state (presumably yes since otherwise you would have said \"he moved out of the state\"). \nVoter registration, another measure of residency, requires [30 days living in NJ](https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/voting-information.html) (and is itself proof of residency). Another way of determining residency is via [state income tax](https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tgi-ee/git6.pdf). You are a full time resident if\n\n> New Jersey was not your domicile, but you maintained a permanent home\n>  in New Jersey for the entire year and you spent more than 183 days in\n>  New Jersey\n\nor\n\n> New Jersey was your domicile for the entire year,\n\nas long as it's not the case that\n\n> You did not spend more than 30 days in New Jersey\n> \n> \n> You did maintain a permanent home outside New Jersey\n> \n> \n> You did not maintain a permanent home in New Jersey\n\nUnder tax law, the husband is a resident.\n\n[Failure to get an NJ license](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2017/title-39/section-39-3-17.1/) is itself against the law, so that would not be a valid argument that the husband is not a resident.

New Jersey law considers several factors in determining residency for divorce jurisdiction, including where a person spends the majority of their non-working time and what is clearly the center of their domestic life. The husband's continued use of the New Jersey house, even if not constant, along with evidence that he spent significant time there, strongly supports his New Jersey residency. This aligns with the state's residency requirements for divorce jurisdiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because maintaining a business in another state and not changing a driver's license do not negate residency if other factors (like time spent in the state) support it. Option B is incorrect because the wife's move doesn't necessarily disqualify her if the husband maintained residency. Option D is incorrect because failing to contest jurisdiction initially can be significant, and challenging it later may be less likely to succeed, especially if evidence supports residency."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55317/minors-legal-right-to-his-personal-property", "docs_id": 55317, "title": "Minor&#39;s legal right to his personal property", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am the legal guardian of my 14\\-year\\-old grandson and have been since he was 2 years old.

The act of copying without permission is what makes the act illegal. Profit might maybe enter into the matter if you are talking about the \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\" defense, since certain kinds of works can be partially copied for certain purposes. You could quote a few lines from a novel in a review, for instance. The judgment of whether a given act of copying without permission is allowed under fair use is complex and involves a balancing act. Profit becomes relevant in that a non\\-profit use favors fair use and a for\\-profit use disfavors it. Wholesale copying of works of art as you describe is illegal (is infringement).\n\nHowever... \"illegal\" is a pretty broad concept. If you infringe on my intellectual property, you almost certainly will not suffer any consequences unless I sue you. Taking \"illegal\" to mean \"in violation of the law\", infringing copyright *is* illegal because it violates the law, but I have to make a federal case out of your infringement \u2013 I have to sue you. As it happens, it can also be a crime to infringe copyright, and in that case, the government and not the copyright holder pursues the matter. If a person *knowingly* infringes copyright, he might be prosecuted, thus the [Megaupload case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload_legal_case) which in the US is realized in the indictment [US v. Dotcom](https://www.scribd.com/document/78786408/Mega-Indictment). Moreover, [profit motive is a required element](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1851-copyright-infringement-fourth-element-commercial-advantage-or) for criminal infringement. (Also note that you don't have to actually make a profit for the profit element to be present).\n\nYou cannot sue a person unless they have harmed you, so if you know that Smith copied Jones' work you can't sue Smith for harming Jones. (This is what they call \"standing\"). You might sue Smith, but not for infringement itself. If they sold you an illegal infringing copy, then you could sue. Or, their infringement could diminish the value of your legal copy. \n\n[This website](http://www.inhouselawyer.co.uk/wgd_question/are-there-criminal-sanctions-for-infringement-of-any-intellectual-property-rights-and-if-so-what-are-they-and-how-are-they-invoked/) gives a multi\\-nation overview of criminal copyright infringement laws.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of copyright infringement, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and potential consequences of unauthorized copying and selling of artistic works?\n\nA) Copying and selling artwork without permission only becomes illegal when the copyright owner files a lawsuit against the infringer.\n\nB) The act of copying artwork without permission is inherently illegal, regardless of whether profit is made, but criminal charges require proof of a profit motive.\n\nC) Anyone who is aware of copyright infringement can sue the infringer, even if they are not the copyright owner or directly affected by the infringement.\n\nD) Copyright infringement is only considered a civil matter and can never result in criminal charges or arrest.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The act of copying artwork without permission is inherently illegal, regardless of whether profit is made. This is because copyright infringement occurs at the moment of unauthorized copying, not when profit is generated or when a lawsuit is filed. However, for criminal charges to be brought against an infringer, there typically needs to be evidence of a profit motive, even if actual profit wasn't realized.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the act is illegal from the moment of infringement, not just when a lawsuit is filed. Option C is incorrect because only the copyright owner or someone directly harmed by the infringement has legal standing to sue.
