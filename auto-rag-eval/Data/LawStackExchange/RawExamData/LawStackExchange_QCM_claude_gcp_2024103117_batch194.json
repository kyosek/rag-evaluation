It is not sufficient for it to be somehow possible to see the terms. In [Specht v. Netscape, 306 F.3d 17](https://www.law.unlv.edu/faculty/rowley/Specht.pdf), the company put a link to license terms \"on the next scrollable screen\". The court was \"not persuaded that a reasonably prudent offeree in these circumstances would have known of the existence of license terms\". The salient characteristic of that agreement is that customers were \"responding to an offer that did not carry an immediately visible notice of the existence of license terms or require unambiguous manifestation of assent to those terms.\" It might have been possible for a customer to guess that there was a license agreement because the download link did not position the scroll bar at the very bottom of the page, but really, who pays attention to the scroll bar especially when there is usually a lot of junk at the bottom. Coupled with the overall presentation of the product as \"download free software now one click !!!\", nothing notified customers that there was an EULA.\n\nAnother relevant case is [Kwan v. Clearwater](http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020120104780/KWAN%20v.%20CLEARWIRE%20CORPORATION). In this case, the legal issue is whether there would be a trial at all, and the court determined that there would be since there were matters of fact to resolve, prominently whether plaintiffs had agreed to forgo litigation in favor of arbitration. Again, the court found that there was inadequate notice of the TOS: defendant provided information that could lead to seeing the TOS, but simple possibility of finding is not enough. There was no persuasive evidence that plaintiff had actually assented to the terms. In this case, plaintiff was presented with an opportunity to press \"I accept terms\" but did not do so (plaintiff testified that she declined to do so). \n\nSo the main concern would be whether the customer has legally\\-easy notice, and a bullet\\-proof means of agreeing (i.e. actually requiring an \"I agree\" button\").

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 established Parliamentary Supremacy in the United Kingdom. This principle means that ultimate authority lies with Parliament, not the monarch. Parliament has the power to depose a monarch who fails to act properly and can alter the line of succession to the crown. Key laws passed after the Revolution, such as the Declaration of Right and the Coronation Oath Act 1688, further reinforced Parliament's authority and placed limitations on the monarch's power.

According to the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act), circumventing technological measures designed to control access to copyrighted works is generally illegal, even if those measures are outdated or relatively weak. The fact that someone has \"cracked\" the Windows XP activation algorithm doesn't make it legal to use that method to bypass Microsoft's intended activation process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the unavailability of original activation servers doesn't automatically make alternative methods legal. Option B is too absolute, as there might be some exceptions or defenses in certain circumstances. Option C is incorrect because having a permissive license for reinstallation doesn't necessarily grant permission to circumvent activation measures.

You sue for the damage you suffered.\n\nYou can name her as a defendant alongside her son on the theory that she contributed to the accident by letting her son use the car, and then let the judge sort out who gets landed with the liability. Depending on the rules in your jurisdiction you might have to pay her travel expenses and/or lost wages if the judge decides she wasn't to blame (and the same for her son, but that sounds like a slam\\-dunk).\n\nHowever you might be better off going for [victim restitution](https://www.cdaid.org/1271/departments/legal/prosecuting-attorneys-office/restitutioncrime-victim-compensation).

Idaho follows the Family Car Doctrine, which makes the owner of a vehicle (in this case, the mother) legally liable for accidents caused by family members who drive the car. This means the victim can sue both the son (as the driver) and the mother (as the owner) for damages resulting from the hit-and-run accident. The doctrine allows the victim to potentially recover damages from either or both parties, increasing the chances of full compensation.

[See list of other statutes.](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors163.html)\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\n> Where online can one find a database of convictions that allows one to\n> search convictions by statute section?\n\nThis doesn't exist.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nTypically, the way the records a kept by the courts in the ordinary course will involve statistical categories that assign one category expressed in words to a case, that may encompass multiple statutory sections or subsections, and that don't capture secondary charges in a case.\n\nFor example, suppose that someone is charged with robbery, trespassing, burglary, theft, theft by use of a stolen credit card, and tax fraud. In all likelihood, in both most state court systems, and in the federal courts, this would be coded as a robbery cases for statistical purposes, regardless of the actual offenses of conviction. Similarly, the statistical record keeping process might not distinguish between half a dozen different fraud offenses on the books and simply categorize all such offenses as \"fraud\".\n\nWorse yet, it would be common place for the statistical categories used by the judicial branch to be different from the statistical categories used by the department of corrections. In addition, each local jail would typically have its own separate statistical database for people held in its facility which would not have consistent categories with other databases in the state. At the federal level, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, has yet a third (and most detailed) approach to maintaining these records statistically for federal offenses. Also, it isn't uncommon for there to be more than one set of records maintained independently in a single state. This statistical information is typically reported in an agency annual report and sometimes in additional special reports or responses to legislative inquires (usually for budgeting purposes).\n\nFor example, in Colorado, criminal cases in state courts are maintained i a common database, but most municipal court ordinance violation cases are maintained in separate municipal court databases for each separate municipal court, with the exception of additional state databases for traffic offenses that count as \"points\" against your license handled by the DMV, and a separate state database where domestic violence offenses that disqualify someone from gun ownership are registered. In rural lower courts, the record keeping is often solely on paper or is in a computerized database that isn't even connected to the Internet. In urban areas and in federal courts, the records are kept electronically, but still aren't indexed or searchable in the manner you would like.\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, only commonly charged crimes have statistical categories to assign them to at all, with most crimes on the books which are only rarely prosecuted simply lumped into \"not elsewhere classified\" or \"miscellaneous\".\n\nIn addition to those records, the U.S. Justice Department does two kinds of surveys each year which use different categories still. One it does directly in a random statistical survey with a large sample size of crime victims. The other is done through an annual survey of most (but not all) law enforcement agencies in the U.S. on a standard justice department form that gets filled out by some police department middle manager or administrator in each responding agency.\n\nMurders are also kept track of in an independent vital statistics records maintained by coroner and forensic examiner's offices. U.S. immigration officials also keep a tally of deportable offenses reported to them and actions taken on those offenses.\n\nThe contents of the mittimus in a criminal case, which is the final summary statement of the precise offenses for which a criminal defendant was convicted, the sentence imposed for each offense of conviction, and the total sentence in light of which sentences are to be served consecutively and concurrently with each other, would generally not be included in a searchable database. There would be a databased from which you could pull the mittimus in a particular case for a particular offender, but the contents of the mittimus usually wouldn't be searchable. Maybe Oregon has better information systems than most, but I doubt it.\n\nTo get that kind of information, you'd need to do a freedom of information act request or the equivalent (and pay a state employee hefty hourly research fees), or have a legislative committee or administrative officer within the judicial branch or department of corrections authorize the search.\n\nAll of this information is a matter of public record (except in \"sealed\" cases). But gathering the information is very cumbersome.\n\nThere are a couple of social science databases maintained by particular academics, news organizations, or non\\-profit organizations, for particular purposes on a sporadic and incomplete basis that have some of this information, but the extent to which the manager of those databases will allow you to access that data varies wildly, and often that is also not complete.\n\nFor example, my small town hometown newspaper growing up, which published weekly, reported the offense of conviction (by name, not statute number) and the sentence imposed, for every conviction in the city's municipal court in the past week, with the name, age, and address of every convicted offender.\n\nOften the prosecutor's office, the public defender's office, and the leading criminal defense lawyers in a particular county maintain private databases of this information that is more specific, and is almost never shared.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the availability and searchability of conviction records by statute section in the United States?\n\nA) Most state and federal court systems maintain easily accessible online databases that allow searching convictions by specific statute sections.\n\nB) While conviction records are public, they are typically not organized or searchable by statute section due to inconsistent categorization and database systems across different agencies and jurisdictions.\n\nC) The U.S. Sentencing Commission maintains a comprehensive, publicly accessible database of all convictions searchable by statute section for both federal and state offenses.\n\nD) Each state has a unified database that allows searching of all criminal convictions by statute section, but access is restricted to law enforcement and legal professionals.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The information provided indicates that while conviction records are generally public, they are not typically organized or searchable by statute section. This is due to several factors:\n\n1. Inconsistent categorization: Different agencies (courts, corrections departments, law enforcement) often use different statistical categories for offenses.\n\n2.

The FCRA's Section 1681h(e) limits liability for defamation claims, stating that \"no consumer may bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation... except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.\" This limitation applies to both court proceedings and arbitration. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the FCRA's limitations are not restricted to court proceedings only. \n\nAnswer B is overly broad; the FCRA does allow defamation claims in limited circumstances (with proof of malice or willful intent).\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Sarah can potentially bring claims under Sections 616 or 617 of the FCRA, the question specifically asks about a defamation claim, which is governed by Section 1681h(e).\n\nThe correct answer reflects that Sarah can pursue a defamation claim in arbitration, but only if she meets the high standard of proving malice or willful intent, as specified in the FCRA."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60871/accident-at-ace-chemical-processing-new-jersey", "docs_id": 60871, "title": "Accident at Ace Chemical Processing - New Jersey", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is 1988, New Jersey.\n\nIn the area commonly known as Gotham, a poor engineer, let's name him John Doe, is forced \\- under the threat of death and bodily harm on denial \\- to take part in a small crime of breaking and entering the Ace Chemical Processing Plant.

There are a lot of things happening, of course, but there were two incidents that raised some \"legal\" questions in me.\n\nSorry, there may be spoilers.\nAlso, I am not a law person so my wording might not be correct.\n\nIncident one:\n\n> Hostage A is trying to secretly steal a weapon from the heist men,\n>  hostage B (which happens to be an employee of A) sees him \n>  and then A is threatening him that if he says\n>  anything he will fire him after the heist.\n\nIncident two:\n\n> Hostage A and three of the heist men (after a failed escape attempt) are pointing guns at each other, Hostage A threatens them to open the door, the Heist men try to convince him to put the gun down, then,\n>  Hostage C disables Hostage A.\n\nSince the heist is under police handling, could anything you do inside the heist considered as interference with the police work?\ne.g. if the behavior of Hostage A causes a shooting that results in people getting killed \\- but not by Hostage A. Will Hostage A then be responsible for those deaths since he interfered with police work?\n\nIf yes, are the Hostages B and C justified for their behavior for trying to stop Hostage A?\n\nSince the country may matter, just for the sake of it, let's assume that the events take place in Spain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since there hostage scenario has fire arms involved, this should be treated as an Active Shooter Event. In this situation, the common emergency response by the hostages would be first to flee (can't do that, they got trapped inside), the next is to hide/shelter in place and remain there until the police arrive. If a confrontation with a gunman or gunmen is unavoidable the official response is to take whatever measures you believe will get you out of that situation safely. If you have to fight back, fight back. If you feel it is better to talk it out with the gunman, do that. If you feel the need to stay where you are, do that. Each move is equally dangerous at this point and your priority should be saving yourself.\n\nWith that out of the way, Hostage A shouldn't play Bruce Willis, but if he is comfortable with using a weapon to affect his own freedom from the situation, that is his preoperative. The \"threat\" of firing from a job if Hostage B blabs is probably intended as dark humor. If Hostage B were to blab, Hostage A will likely be killed by the heist men, so Hostage B wouldn't get fired by Hostage A and Hostage A knows this... basically, he's admitting the plan is so suicidal that being killed is likely to happen regardless of the situation.\n\nIn situation 2, I don't see any legal repercussions for either Hostages. Hostage A is acting in self\\-defense and thus fighting back against legitment threats to person or persons and hostage C is thinking of their safety if he loses. I'm not sure if it would be the same in Spain, but in the U.S. from the first commission of a crime by the Heist men (taking a hostage), the lives and safety of the hostages are in the hands of the Heist men. Even if Hostage A gets someone killed in his attempt to get everyone free, he is not criminally liable for that death, even though it was his bullet from his gun. Rather, the heist men would be charged with the murder of anyone who died for any reason within the building while they were committing the crime (and some time afterwards). The stray bullet from Hostage A's gun and the life ending heart attack from Little Old Lady Hostage D are both on the heads of the hostage takers.\n\nEither way, unless some plot device accounts for the cops outside not hearing the gun fire, Hostage A will summon the Calvary (cops will hold out peaceful surrender of the heist men and the safe release of the hostages so long as they have assurances that the latter are safe. Gun fire will shatter that assurances and send SWAT in to take out the heist men), so the the 3 to 1 odds are not going to hold for long.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of a hostage situation involving armed criminals, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of a hostage's actions?\n\nA) If a hostage's actions lead to casualties, they would be held criminally liable for those deaths.\n\nB) Hostages are legally obligated to remain passive and wait for law enforcement to resolve the situation.\n\nC) Hostages have no legal right to attempt to free themselves or others, as this could be considered interference with police work.\n\nD) Hostages are generally not held criminally liable for deaths that occur as a result of their attempts to free themselves, even if their actions indirectly lead to casualties.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, in a hostage situation involving armed criminals, hostages are generally not held criminally liable for deaths that occur as a result of their attempts to free themselves. This is because from the moment the crime of taking hostages is committed, the lives and safety of the hostages are considered to be in the hands of the criminals.

Or does Terry's initial taunting disqualify self\\-defense as an excuse?\n\nEdit: Editted to focus only on the self\\-defense question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That depends on whether the legislature has made this a disqualifier. In North Carolina, [G.S. 14\\-51](https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-51.4.pdf) disqualifies a person from using the self\\-defense defense when the person \"Initially provokes the use of force against himself or herself\", with an exception to the disqualification if the attack puts him in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and he cannot withdraw, or if the person has \"retreated\". The initial aggressor doctrine is also part of [Louisiana law](https://lawofselfdefense.com/jury-instruction/la-%C2%A7-623-aggressor-doctrine/). There is a [jury instruction](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Ief9fc262e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29) on this matter in Washington state which further clarifies that\n\n> No person may, by any intentional act reasonably likely to provoke a\n> belligerent response, create a necessity for acting in self\\-defense\n> \\[or] \\[defense of another] and thereupon \\[kill] \\[use, offer, or attempt\n> to use force upon or toward] another person.

On the one hand, in Washington there is no \"duty to retreat\". But force is legal only when necessary. That term is defined in [RCW 9A.16\\.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.010)\n\n> \"Necessary\" means that no reasonably effective alternative to the use\n> of force appeared to exist and that the amount of force used was\n> reasonable to effect the lawful purpose intended.\n\nThe solution, stated in the comments but not the instruction, is that \"the court may need to make clearer to the jury that the defendant was not obliged to retreat rather than defend\". But also, \"At the same time, the prosecutor should not be deprived of the argument that other alternatives to the use of force may have existed\".

Nothing in the news piece you link to support that supposition, the general idea is a missile that was launched towards the Atlantic Ocean that steered off route.\n\n1. From your link:\n\n> The treaty recognizes five states as nuclear\\-weapon states.\n\nThe NPT limits **other states** from researching (including testing) nuclear weapons and/or delivery vehicles. In exchange, they get access to nuclear technology for civilian purposes.\n\nTreaty preambles are general, introductory texts that explain the intent of the treaty. They are not binding, and the language clearly shows it (Hint: It states \"Desiring to\", \"Recalling to\". Binding agreements use \"Shall\", \"Shall not\", \"May\" or \"May not\", and are more specific about what are the restrictions).\n2. As stated above, the test was not \"in North\\-America\". It was from international waters \"towards Africa\", probably to be sunk before it reached land1. There is no notion anywhere that there was an intention of violating the airspace of any country.\n\nCertainly, the UK would be responsable if one of their missiles test fails and the missile ends causing damages, and the USA can protest any violation of its airspace, even if unintentional. But it is not \"a test of ballistic missiles in North America\", and certainly the USA has no more rights outside its territorial waters than, say, Gambia does.\n\nThe only restriction would be the internationally stablished procedures for testing missiles, which are setup to avoid any kind of issues (the test scheduled date and path is published2 with time enough for third parties to take notice).\n\nSo yes, it is [business as usual](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38716446).\n\n---", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and international law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the UK's test launch of a Trident missile?\n\nA) The test launch violates the NPT because it goes against the treaty's preamble, which calls for the elimination of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems.\n\nB) The test launch is illegal under international law because it occurred in North American waters without US permission.\n\nC) The test launch is permitted under international law as long as the UK followed established procedures for notifying other countries of the scheduled test.\n\nD) The test launch violates international law because non-nuclear states are prohibited from testing ballistic missiles in international waters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The UK, as a recognized nuclear weapons state under the NPT, is permitted to test its nuclear delivery systems. The preamble of the NPT, while expressing desires for disarmament, is not legally binding. The test did not occur in North American waters, but in international waters. There are no specific prohibitions on nuclear states testing ballistic missiles in international waters, as long as they follow established notification procedures.

A small child rushes under the car, s/he can't swerve, and kills the child. \n\nExample 2: Someone is driving in the same neighborhood at 30 mph, as recorded by a policeman who arrested him after he hit a child.

Is it true that Cases 2 and 3 would be easy to prove in a tort action, and case 1 would be very difficult? Why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All torts have to be proved.\n----------------------------\n\n**In 99\\.99% of cases the proof is by admission of the tortfeaser.**\n\nThat is, they agree to pay damages with or without admission of liability.\n\nWhere liability is contested, there are never any \u201cslam dunks\u201d. There are strong cases, even very strong cases, but when someone else is deciding the case, there are no certainties. Remember, if your opponent thought they were going to lose, they\u2019d settle.\n\nLooking at your examples, it seems that the tort you are thinking of is negligence. In order to establish negligence as a Cause of Action under the law of torts, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant:\n\n1. had a duty to the plaintiff,\n2. breached that duty by failing to conform to the required standard of conduct (generally the standard of a reasonable person),\n3. the negligent conduct was, in law, the cause of the harm to the plaintiff, and\n4. the plaintiff was, in fact, harmed or damaged.\n\nWhere the issue is not one of evidence, that is, the facts are as you say and are not in dispute, the question is not \u201cwhat happened\u201d, but \u201cis what happened negligence\u201d.\n\nFor all the examples, 1, 3, and 4 are probably not in dispute: there was a duty, the conduct caused damage at law and the plaintiff actually suffered harm. The question to be decided is whether the driver failed to conform to the required standard of care.\n\nFor examples 2 and 3, most courts would conclude they didn\u2019t. For example 1, some courts might decide that the way the driver drove did conform to the required standard and others that they didn\u2019t.

All elements of negligence must be established, including that the driver breached their duty by failing to conform to the required standard of conduct.

Same as 2?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: National territory\n------------------\n\nIt depends on the nation. Some countries or jurisdictions have specific laws about meteorites, like the [Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia) [Museum Act 1969, ss. 43\\-45](https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/prod/filestore.nsf/FileURL/mrdoc_1471.pdf/$FILE/Museum%20Act%201969%20-%20%5B02-a0-11%5D.pdf?OpenElement), which provides that meteorites are Crown property (there are many meteorites in the Nullarbor Plain). Absent any specific rule like this, meteorites are likely to be treated in any of the following ways \\-\n\n1. **It's a rock.** Mineral rights (which often go along with ownership of the land in general, but can be separately assigned) may apply to meteorites on the grounds (haha) that they are rocks which can be treated as part of the land on which they fell. There may be special law vesting certain kinds of mineral finds in the State, should you be dealing with a meteorite made of gold, for example. Mineral law is a specialist topic even within national law, so the exact answer here may depend on a lot of factors \\- what the thing is made of, whether it's above ground or not, etc. \\- but the probable starting point is that rocks from space are no different in law from the rocks that were already there.\n2. **It's an object that has no clear owner.** There are longstanding principles for \"unowned things\" in civil and common law systems, typically applying to wild animals or other things that are naturally occurring and not part of the *land* as such. If a meteorite is \"res nullius\" in this sense, then it might belong to the finder or to the landowner, depending on exactly which flavor of legal tradition is followed.\n3. **It's a valuable find.** There are similar rules about \"treasure trove\", for example in the United Kingdom which gives rights to the Crown. But a meteorite would not be classed as treasure in the UK, because it is an \"[unworked natural object](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/24/section/1)\". Other jurisdictions might draw these boundaries differently.\n4. **It's an object of scientific importance.** A meteorite might be classed as \"cultural property\" within the meaning of the [U.N. Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 1970](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html), as transposed into local law. The Convention covers \"rare collections and specimens of \\[...] minerals\", and objects of paleontological or archaeological interest. This could affect somebody's ability to export or destroy the object (for the latter, see also the [2003 UNESCO Declaration](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17718&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html) which includes \"cultural heritage linked to a natural site\"). National law might contain its own similar provisions.\n\nInternational waters and the poles\n----------------------------------\n\nThe [U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, Part XI](https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf) governs mineral exploitation in \"the Area\", meaning the part of the seabed that does not belong to any nation. Activities of this kind are meant to be under the auspices of the [International Seabed Authority](https://www.isa.org.jm/), which has copious rules about application and approval, navigation, environmental controls, and so on \\- subject to the Convention principle of treating the seabed as \"the common heritage of mankind\". This Area includes the North Pole.\n\nThe South Pole is part of the area covered by the [Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, 1991](https://documents.ats.aq/recatt/Att006_e.pdf), which provides in its Article 7 that\n\n> Any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited.\n\nIn practice, as in international law generally, States might do all sorts of other things. But this is the broad legal position. It might be that States would agree a special regime applicable to the totally unprecedented circumstances, or that it would be a free\\-for\\-all.\n\nAgain, I'm assuming that the applicable principles for digging up a space rock for commercial purposes are the same as for other kinds of rock.

Even though the meteorite landed in the ocean, its proximity to the Western Australian coast would likely lead to the state government claiming ownership under this law. While international waters are generally governed by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, the specific local legislation regarding meteorites would take precedence in this case. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't account for specific laws governing meteorites in the region.

The key difference lies in how the two countries treat international treaties in relation to domestic law.

This means the US could potentially pass legislation that allows for autonomous vehicles without human drivers, even if it conflicts with the 1949 Geneva Convention. \n\nIn contrast, Japan, like most other countries, considers international treaties to take precedence over domestic law.

I don't see a declaration of \"I\n> live here\" which is required by law in certain circumstances equates\n> to \"sending letters here will reach me\" ... and it is an assumption\n> made incorrectly and encoded in our current legal system\n\nI think that you've figured out the problem. This is encoded in our current legal system. There are all sorts of laws, case law precedents and contract terms that hold as a matter of law that a letter sent through the postal system addressed to your physical residential address is a reasonable way to give notice to you.\n\nProblems With Designating A Non\\-Residential Address As Your Residence\n======================================================================\n\nThis puts you in a bit of a bind.\n\nOn one hand, if you use the address where you usually do receive packages as your residential address, but you don't really reside there, you are being untruthful which could be a problem in and of itself, and it could have all sorts of unintended consequences (e.g. it could cause you office to be charged with violating land use laws that don't allow that building to be used as a residence, and it might cause you to pay commercial rather than residential rates for utility services at home).\n\nYou could also be accused of evading service of process via a process server if a process server shows up at your purported residential address and finds that it is not, in fact, a residence, which could cause you problems. Indeed, as a lawyer, I've encountered several cases where defendants who are con\\-men or otherwise engaged in fraudulent activities declare a residential address that is really a private mail drop even though the actually live in a house rather far from that location for the express purpose of making them harder to find or to serve with legal process, and have had to seek extraordinary relief from the courts to obtain substituted service of process on these defendants as a result.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think that there is a way to opt out of receiving physical post as an individual.\n\nCollective Abandonment Of Physical Addresses\n============================================\n\nI am familiar with some entire communities that manage that, however.\n\nFor example, at many colleges and universities, students can take mail exclusively at a post office box in a college mail room for the duration of their stay at college that is not attached to the physical address of their residence, without being viewed as deceptive or improper in any way.\n\nSimilarly, in a number of seasonal resort communities, mail is delivered only to a central mailroom and there is no mail delivery to physical addresses in the community, saving the postal service effort and providing greater convenience for seasonal residents.\n\nGeneral Delivery Addresses\n==========================\n\nIn the United States we also have a somewhat outdated concept called general delivery mail service, although I don't know if it exists in the U.K. This is useful mostly for mail intended for homeless people or urban nomads who have no fixed physical address. Instead, mail for these people is sent to the general delivery bin at a post office that is convenient to them and they can walk into the post office to ask if there is any mail for them in the general delivery bin from time to time without having to pay for a post office box of their own.\n\nGeneral delivery mail can sometimes be used in a manner similar to that of sending mail to the physical address of someone who usually doesn't take mail at a physical address to give them notice, which is a bad thing because most general delivery mail is never picked up.\n\nPractical Solutions\n===================\n\nFrom a practical perspective, probably the most viable option is to claim as your legal residence the physical home of a family member or close friend where you now and then stay overnight, and with whom you are in touch by phone, etc., and then to not inform the world or bureaucratic paperwork about where you actually rest your head most nights.\n\nThis is an approach that is often used by people with careers or the equivalent that leave them on the road most of the time (e.g. explorers, archaeologists, traveling salespeople, people in maritime occupations, circus people, retirees who travel often, people who actually spend most nights with a significant other but aren't married, etc.).\n\nAs long as you have some physical address that you can call home with a straight face even if you don't spend much time there, that meets the needs of having a postal address at which you can be reached, the bureaucracies of the world will generally tolerate you, even if you don't spend much time there.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a digital nomad, wants to legally declare that he doesn't want to receive physical mail at any address.

(p400\\).\n\n**Generally, slave owners could not patent inventions of their slaves.** There were some exceptions made in the Confederacy's patent laws.\n\nBelow is a copy/paste of selections from \"[Invention of a Slave](https://lawreview.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Q-Frye-w-change.pdf)\" by Frye:\n\n> The antebellum Patent Act was amended and rewritten several times. After 1793, it included a \u201cPatent Oath,\u201d which eventually required patent applicants to swear to be the \u201coriginal\u201d inventor of the claimed invention and to their country of citizenship.This oath effectively precluded slave owners from patenting the inventions of their slaves. Additionally, it limited patents to \u201ccitizens of the United States.\n\n...\n\n> On June 10, 1858, the Attorney General issued an opinion titled Invention of a Slave, concluding that a slave owner could not patent a machine invented by his slave, because neither the slave owner nor his slave could take the required patent oath. The slave owner could not swear to be the inventor, and the slave could not take an oath at all. The Patent Office denied at least two patent applications filed by slave owners, one of which was filed by Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, who later became the President of the Confederate States of America. But it also denied at least one patent application filed by a free African\\-American inventor, because African\\-Americans could not be citizens of the United States under Dred Scott.\n\n...\n\n> Slave owners unsuccessfully tried to amend the Patent Act to enable slave owners to patent the inventions of their slaves, which the Patent Act of the Confederate States of America explicitly permitted. By contrast, abolitionists successfully convinced the Attorney General \\[in 1862] to issue an opinion concluding that free African\\-Americans were citizens of the United States, entitled to patent their inventions, among other things.\n\nHowever, before Dred Scott, free African Americans could receive patents.\n\n> The first known \\[free] African\\-American inventor to receive a patent was Thomas Jennings, who patented a method of \u201cdry scouring\u201d clothing in 1821\\.\n\n> But there were also many enslaved antebellum African\\-American inventors who could not patent their inventions, or own property of any kind. Some slave owners probably surreptitiously patented the inventions of their slaves. At least apocryphally, Eli Whitney\u2019s cotton gin was actually invented by a slave named Sam. Likewise, Cyrus McCormack\u2019s mechanical reaper is often attributed to a slave named Jo Anderson\n\n---\n\nSome further reading:\n\"[Race and Selective Legal Memory: Reflections on *Invention of a Slave*](https://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Swanson-Race_and_Selective_Legal_Memory.pdf)\" by Professor Kara W.

The camera will be placed above the front door. Our front door is facing a garden entrance, and so to get to the front door, you must enter via a garden gate which is directly in front (maybe two or three metres) of the front door. The gate is an iron gate and so you can see a very small portion of the street outside if you look from the front door. So in short, the camera will see people coming in through the garden gate as they approach the front door, and may see people passing by the garden gate on the street.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This article](https://wolford-wayne.com/can-your-landlord-spy-on-you-surveillance-rules-explained/) basically says \"it depends\":\n\n* If it is genuinely used to improve tenant safety then that is OK, but if it is used to track your private life then that is not acceptable.\n* Cameras that cover communal areas used by several properties are generally acceptable, but cameras covering individual properties are much less so. It sounds like this falls into the latter category.\n\nAssuming you haven't got the camera yet, I suggest you write to the Landlord asking for a written justification of the cameras, and a policy for the use of the camera. E.g. it will only be viewed if an incident is reported. Once you have the justification you can then look for inconsistencies (e.g. if they aren't planning to snoop at random times, how are they going to notice someone up to no good? And how would they tell?)\n\nYou could also just say \"no\". The installation of this camera probably counts as a material variation of the rental agreement.\n\nYou could also propose a compromise: you will install the camera, but only provide footage as you see fit rather than allowing your landlord to view the camera at any time.\n\nCCTV installations are covered by the GDPR, so you should ask your landlord for the [associated paperwork](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/does-your-use-of-cctv-comply-with-the-gdpr).

This approach addresses several key points:\n\n1. It preserves the landlord's rights by not prejudicing their ability to hold tenants jointly and severally liable under the original agreement.\n2. It allows for individualized terms for each tenant, addressing their different needs and timelines.\n3. It provides a clean break from the old agreement, reducing potential complications.\n4. It allows for a final inspection and potential claims against the bond under the old agreement before new terms take effect.\n\nOption A (creating separate addendums) could be problematic as it may conflict with the original lease that refers to the tenants collectively. Option B (maintaining the current lease) doesn't address the tenants' desire to terminate early.

So to sue them you should have to argue how their drug usage affected you. A risk that did not materialize is not a damage.\n\nNow, you talk about a \"legal risk\". As a rule of thumb, your legal risks come from your actions. If YOU allowed me to use drugs in your car and that did mean that YOU did broke a law, then it is not my fault that you broke the law (it will be my fault the laws that I did broke).

(Admiralty law also applies to boats on the \"navigable waters\" of the United States such as the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.) It has its roots in a mix of customary international law, treaties related to the law of the sea, and domestic statutes. It is closer in some respects to the law of civil law countries than of common law countries, although it is distinct from both.\n\nIn the U.S., admiralty law is part of federal court jurisdiction and the U.S. district courts are our admiralty courts. But, each country with maritime commerce has some version of admiralty law based around a core of customary international law and treaties, with domestic statutes similar to those of other countries statutes dealing with the topic.\n\nAdmiralty law is distinctive and different from domestic law in a variety of circumstances, most notably:\n\n1. The law governing when a ship can be detained in port to make a judgment in an admiralty proceeding against it enforceable. This is similar to a writ of attachment in domestic law (a pre\\-judgment seizure of assets to make a potential judgment collectable) but more broadly available.\n2. The rights of seamen vis\\-a\\-vis their employers.\n3. The relevance of the flag under which a ship sails.\n4. The \"traffic laws\" of the sea.\n5. The duties of a ship that encounters another ship or individuals in distress at sea.\n6. The duties of a ship that encounters hostile others parties, such as pirates, at sea.\n7. The tort law applicable to torts particular to a maritime context that take place at sea. For example, in a collision of ships, or from a failure to honor duties related to distressed ships, or from interference with a ship's commercial activity (e.g. in connection with a fishing expedition).\n8. The law governing property interests and sharing of proceeds from \"prizes\" such as the salvage of sinking, sunk or abandoned ships.\n\nIn general, admiralty law has declined in importance as lots of high value commerce has shifted to air travel, and as ocean going ships have become bigger and better behaved corporate interests, and because modern conditions make ships at sea less isolated from the rest of the world.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A ship flying the flag of Panama collides with a U.S. fishing vessel in international waters, causing significant damage to both vessels.

In this scenario, A actively refused to call for help despite being informed of a life-threatening situation. The law requires assistance even if the person cannot articulate their need for help.

In this situation it would be expected that Charlie would know it is dirty money, but Bob the Banker does not need to be specifically aware the the money has criminal origin. Because of this he implements, if he is for example a cryptocurrency exchange, Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and refuses to deal in certain products, Monero in the UK for example.\n\nWhat if however Bob is not a financial institution but a member of the public (Bob the Builder perhaps)? If he uses a decentralized exchange such as [bisq](https://bisq.network/) he would be performing much the same actions as Bob the Banker or Cryptocurrency exchange, including exchanging fiat currency for cryptocurrency and trading in Monero. The design of the market makes it impossible to perform any such KYC checks, and at least when exchanging fiat currency makes it clear that there is an covert element in the process (you are informed by the interface not to reference the transfer as \"bisq\" or \"cryptocurrency transaction\").\n\nIt is possible for an individual to commit the crime that a bank could be found guilty of by having insufficient money laundering prevention measures?\n\nAs far as jurisdiction as one never really knows where the other party is located any jurisdiction where this is illegal probably makes it illegal anywhere so the most restrictive rules are probably the most relevant.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because money laundering is a form of [transnational crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnational_crime) there is an extensive system of treaties which harmonise, to some extent, the laws of most developed countries. Relevantly to your question, the [United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime](https://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/a_res_55/res5525e.pdf) provides in article 7:\n\n> Each State Party \u2026 Shall institute a comprehensive domestic regulatory and supervisory regime for banks and **non\\-bank financial institutions and, where appropriate, other bodies particularly susceptible to money\\-laundering**, within its competence, in order to deter and detect all forms of money\\-laundering, which regime shall emphasize requirements for **customer identification, record\\-keeping and the reporting of suspicious transactions** \u2026\n\nGenerally, local laws will define concepts like \"money transmitting business\" and require individuals engaged in these businesses to obtain a licence and comply with similar KYC and reporting obligations to a bank.\n\nFor example, in the **United States**, [18 U.S.C \u00a7 1960](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1960) makes it illegal to run an unlicensed money transmitting business. In *United States v. Rockcoons* ([3:17\\-cr\\-03690](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6325721/united-states-v-rockcoons/)), the defendant [committed this offence through peer\\-to\\-peer bitcoin trading](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/man-sentenced-fraud-and-operating-unlicensed-money-transmitting-business):\n\n> Rockcoons advertised his Bitcoin exchange services on the website LocalBitcoins.com. In 2015, HSI identified Rockcoons as the most prolific San Diego\\-based seller. In April 2016, the defendant\u2019s LocalBitcoins.com profile showed that he continued to advertise as a trader and seller of Bitcoin in San Diego, with his profile reflecting that he had engaged in more than 500 transactions. As of October 2017, the defendant\u2019s profile indicated that he conducted more than 1,000 bitcoin trades with more than 644 people. Rockcoons received a commission of as much as 36 percent per transaction.\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, the law in the **United Kingdom** is explained in *Vladimir Consulting Ltd v Financial Conduct Authority* [\\[2022] UKUT 168 (TCC)](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2022/168.pdf). VCL had been trading on LocalBitcoins.com since 2017, but from 2020, was required to become licensed as a \"cryptoasset exchange provider\" under the *[Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1511/contents/made)*.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's potential legal liability?\n\nA) Bob is not at risk of committing any financial crimes because he is a private individual, not a financial institution.\n\nB) Bob could potentially be liable for money laundering offenses, but only if he knowingly trades with criminals.\n\nC) Bob is likely operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and could be held liable for financial crimes in many jurisdictions.\n\nD) Bob is only at risk if he trades exclusively in privacy coins like Monero, but not if he deals in mainstream cryptocurrencies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, Bob's activities closely resemble those of a money transmitting business or cryptoasset exchange provider. In many jurisdictions, including the United States and the United Kingdom, individuals engaged in such activities are required to obtain proper licensing and comply with anti-money laundering regulations, including performing KYC checks and reporting suspicious transactions.\n\nThe case of United States v.

Similarly, the UK case of Vladimir Consulting Ltd v Financial Conduct Authority shows that even individuals trading on platforms like LocalBitcoins.com may need to be licensed as cryptoasset exchange providers.\n\nBy failing to perform KYC checks and potentially facilitating anonymous transactions, Bob could be in violation of these regulations. His liability is not dependent on knowingly trading with criminals (B is incorrect) or exclusively dealing in privacy coins (D is incorrect). The fact that he is a private individual does not exempt him from these regulations (A is incorrect).\n\nTherefore, C is the most accurate statement, as Bob's activities likely constitute operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which could make him liable for financial crimes in various jurisdictions."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5090/is-it-legal-to-access-open-wifi-networks-without-permission", "docs_id": 5090, "title": "Is it legal to access open wifi networks without permission", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say if my neighbor keeps his/her wifi\\-network security open and my wifi settings are set to automatically connect to open wireless networks as they don't need any key to access. \n\nThen considering USA jurisdiction am I committing a crime given that I don't have any permission from my neighbor to do that.\n\nAnd given this situation as an analogy, How is it different from breaking or more suitably just roaming into a house or property without doing any sort of damage, given that it was not secured or left unattended for a while.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Depends on where you are.

Would they ask for a take down for any other reason, when various other manga reader websites are making money off them?\n\nMerely looking at the fact that the other sites have not been taken down is not a good metric to decide if you will face an infringement suit for your own site. Consider the following possibilities:\n\n* The manga on those sites may be published by a different publisher than the manga you want to host, and that publisher of your desired manga is more litigious.\n* The manga publisher may not have been actively pursuing infringement for the last several years, but they may suddenly decide this fiscal year it's a financially good idea to start aggressively pursuing infringement. They will go after the other sites and your site at the same time.\n* Because you plan to *give them money,* you are actively drawing attention to your infringing site. While they may not find it worth their while to seek out whatever new infringing sites pop up every week, in this case, they don't have to come looking for you. You show up to *them*, actively telling them that you're infringing their copyright.\n\nOf course, they might not care. They might love your idea. Regardless, the legally sound way to do this is to ask for permission *before* you do it, rather than forgiveness afterward. If you don't, you are certainly vulnerable to a lawsuit (whether or not the publisher will pursue the opportunity to sue you is a question left to the discretion of the publisher).\n\n> 2. Considering that myself is not going to be making any money off their work, does this still fall into the category of criminal act? If so, are there more than take down notices that can happen? (C\\&D? financial punishment? imprisoning?)\n\nHaving your infringing site taken down is the *minimum* that could happen. If you commit copyright infringement, the copyright holder is fully entitled to file a lawsuit against you at once. It's possible that they could just file a DMCA takedown notice to your ISP to have the content taken down, but they are entitled to sue you for damages as well.\n\nMaybe they won't sue you because it's not worth their while. If not: lucky you! So, ask yourself: do you feel lucky?\n\nCopyright infringement is typically a civil offense and only punished with fines. It can only qualify as a criminal offense [under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7506](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) when the infringement is \"willful\" and meets one of the following criteria:\n\n> (A) for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain;\n> \n> \n> (B) by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180\\-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000; or\n> \n> \n> (C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution.\n\nAs long as you don't violate any of those conditions, your infringement is not criminal. Condition B seems most likely, if I am reading it correctly: if your site serves a $10 book one hundred times, then you've met the $1000 threshold. The threshold of what makes an infringement \"willful\" versus \"ordinary\" is somewhat nebulous; see Wikipedia's article on [Criminal Copyright Law in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Copyright_Law_in_the_United_States).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A manga enthusiast creates a website that hosts copyrighted manga content without permission, but directs all advertising revenue to the original copyright holders.

However, the circumstances are likely to be taken into consideration by law enforcement and the judicial system. Police might choose not to issue a citation if they stop the driver, and if a citation is issued, a judge would likely consider the extenuating circumstances. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest complete legal immunity, which is not the case. Option B is incorrect because it guarantees a reduced or dismissed ticket, which cannot be assured even though it's a possibility."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17963/can-a-us-citizen-with-dual-citizenship-travel-without-getting-a-us-passport", "docs_id": 17963, "title": "Can a US citizen with dual citizenship travel without getting a US passport?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Flying with my daughter next week to Israel.\n\nShe was born in the US, has currently only Israeli passport.\nHer passport does have a US visa of course.\nWe're nonpermanent residents.\n\nSo I have to go and urgently get her a US passport?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a legal requirement for US citizens to have a US passport when entering and leaving the US, though there are some exceptions. (The exceptions mostly concern other kinds of documents that are acceptable when traveling by land or sea to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean.) The law is [8 USC 1185(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1185): \n\n> (b) Citizens\n> ------------\n> \n> \n> Except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe, it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States unless he bears a valid United States passport.\n\nThere is no penalty for violating this law. And, of course, US citizens have an inherent right to enter the US. In practice, therefore, if a border officer recognizes that you are a US citizen without the required documentation, they are supposed to inform you of the requirements and then waive the requirement of section 1185(b) so you can enter.\n\nFor more discussion, see [What is the penalty for US citizens entering/leaving the US on a foreign passport?](https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/86059/19400) on [travel.stackexchange.com](http://travel.stackexchange.com).\n\n---\n\nThere was formerly a regulation allowing US citizen children of foreign diplomats to travel to the US on their foreign passports. This was removed in connection with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. It was at 22 CFR 53\\.2, which read as follows [in 2006](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2006-title22-vol1/pdf/CFR-2006-title22-vol1-part53.pdf):\n\n> (e) When he is under 21 years of age and is a member of the household of an official or employee of a foreign government or of the United Nations and is in possession of or included in a foreign passport;\n\nHowever, [in 2007](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2007-title22-vol1/pdf/CFR-2007-title22-vol1-part53.pdf), paragraph (e) concerned the NEXUS program, and the paragraph concerning children in the household of foreign officials and employees was absent. The change was published in the Federal Register on [24 November 2006](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-11-24/pdf/06-9402.pdf).\n\nThe Department of State's \\[Foreign Affairs Manual] indicates that they continue to follow this policy despite the change in regulations; at [9 FAM 202\\.1\\-2 VISA\\-RELATED ISSUES WTIH U.S. CITIZENS](https://fam.state.gov/searchapps/viewer?format=html&query=visa&links=VISA&url=/FAM/09FAM/09FAM020201.html#M202_1_2), item (c) appears to have been last modified in 2011:\n\n> c.

The children of foreign government officials, however, may use their foreign passport for entry into the United States. \n> \n> \n> (2\\) After the U.S. citizenship of a child has been determined by a citizenship officer, the consular officer may, to avoid delay or difficulty, give a written statement to the parents for presentation to carriers or immigration officials. The statement should make clear that the bearer of the foreign passport is a dual national child of a foreign government official or employee who is traveling to the United States on official business and as such may enter the United States on the foreign passport as an exception to the provisions of INA 215(b) regarding valid passport requirement. \n> \n> \n> (3\\) A child under 12 years of age who is included in the passport of an alien parent in an official capacity may be admitted if evidence of U.S. citizenship is presented at the time of entry. A determination of the childs citizenship should be made by citizenship officer prior to departure from a foreign country and the parent should be instructed to have evidence of such citizenship available for inspection by the admitting Department of Homeland Security Officer.\n\nIf this is indeed how your daughter got her US visa then the State Department's willingness to issue the visa presumably implies that CBP should allow her to enter with her Israeli passport and that visa.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. citizen child of a foreign diplomat is traveling to the United States.

However, to avoid potential issues, a consular officer may provide a written statement to the parents explaining that the child is a dual national of a foreign government official traveling on official business. This statement can be presented to carriers or immigration officials to facilitate entry.

The documentation from reputable sources, such as the International Academy of Family Lawyers and lawhelp.org, does not mention engagement as a prerequisite for prenuptial agreements.
