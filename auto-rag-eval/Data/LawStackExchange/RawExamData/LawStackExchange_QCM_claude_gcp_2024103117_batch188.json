I am a student attending a rather large high school in South Carolina. In order to block to youtube, proxies, games, etc., the school has disabled SSL and TLS (secure socket protocol for web security). These are standards for all web browsers (I get a warning on my MAC that there may be an attack on my computer if I even get on their wifi and open Safari), and what is even more scary (and angering) to me is that they have a fake google certificate which they do not inform people of in any way or agreement. I understand that I am a minor and am resigned that I can do nothing about it, but this must illegal. I cannot imagine what the consequences would be if I did the on a private server. The vulnerability is further irresponsible because it leaves people's private data being transferred over the school network (such as private e\\-mail, logins) unsecured and open to packet sniffing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is more than a comment (too long), but not a definitive answer (since I am unfamiliar with the laws regarding this kind of thing). Please forgive me.\n\nFirst, there are some technical misunderstandings. They are not disabling SSL/TLS. Instead, they are inserting themselves in between these connections so they can make sure you aren't accessing material you are not allowed to access. They may actually be required to do this by law.\n\nHere is how it works. Typically when you connect to, say Google.com, you are given a certificate from Google.com that has a trusted chain all the way up to some trusted root. That trusted root is explicitly trusted by your web browser manufacturer. In order to be able to inspect these sorts of connections, security appliances will actually replace the certificate provided by Google.com with one that the appliance provides. It has to pretend to be Google.com so your browser doesn't freak out. The problem is, this certificate is no longer has a trusted chain to something that the browser manufacturer trusts. It is provided by the security appliance. So often, the appliance will have a root certificate that the administrators of the system must install on every machine they control. Then the browsers on these machines will not complain that the certificate is invalid.\n\nObviously, you are getting the error on your own machine because you have not allowed the administrator to install these certificates on your machine. Nor should you. **You should definitely not allow your school's network administrator to install these certificates on your personal computer.**\n\nYou say that \"leaves people's private data being transferred over the school network (such as private e\\-mail, logins) unsecured and open to packet sniffing\". This is not true. Any HTTPS website you visit is encrypted between your computer and the security monitoring appliance using the pretend certificate I mentioned above. Typically then, the traffic is decrypted and inspected by the appliance. Then it is re\\-encrypted using the real certificate, before being pushed out onto the internet. So, only at the security appliance is data turned back into the clear, only to be protected again before going out to the internet.\n\nSo, is this illegal?\n\nWell, I think you would agree that definitely on the computers that your school owns, they can do anything they want with them. The computers belong to them. Furthermore, the network belongs to them. Likely you signed an agreement (or agree to it each time you connect) that they are allowed to monitor your usage of their computers and their network. This includes when connecting your personal machine to **their** network.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A high school in South Carolina is implementing network security measures. Which of the following statements accurately describes their approach and its implications?\n\nA) The school is disabling SSL/TLS protocols, leaving all data transfers completely unsecured.\n\nB) The school is using a security appliance that replaces website certificates with its own, allowing for content monitoring while maintaining encryption.\n\nC) The school's method leaves all private data open to packet sniffing by anyone on the network.\n\nD) The school is illegally intercepting student communications without their consent.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The school is not disabling SSL/TLS (ruling out A), but rather using a security appliance that acts as an intermediary. This appliance replaces certificates from websites with its own, allowing the school to monitor content while still maintaining encryption between the student's device and the security appliance, and then between the appliance and the internet. This method does not leave data open to packet sniffing (ruling out C), as the connections are still encrypted. While this practice may raise privacy concerns, it is not necessarily illegal if students are informed and agree to the terms of using the school's network (ruling out D).

The vehicle was delivered to me approximately six weeks later and did not match the build I had requested. Investigation with the dealership revealed that the salesperson had submitted the correct build information to her manager for order, which was subsequently entered into the manufacturer's order system incorrectly. Upon finding this out, I opted not to purchase the vehicle. The sales manager who entered the incorrect order did not want me to walk away from the sale and offered to order, paint, and assemble the parts needed to make the build correct. I agreed to this offer and my sale contract states that I am owed these items from the dealership.\n\nFast forward almost four months, I've still not yet received the parts owed to me. Voluntary communication from the dealership has been non\\-existent, and responses to my inquiries have been intermittent and lackluster at best.

Copyright does not protect names or short phrases, so copyright permission is not required (eliminating option A). However, personality rights (or rights of publicity) may apply in some jurisdictions, even after a person's death. These rights can restrict the use of a person's name for commercial purposes without permission. The duration and applicability of these rights vary by jurisdiction, so researching the specific laws where the professor last resided is the most prudent course of action. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it overlooks the potential applicability of personality rights.

Only a tiny share of modern pardons are granted to people who are currently serving sentences for the crimes of which they were convicted or to people who have not yet been convicted of crimes.\n\nMy understanding is that a pardon only effects that you no longer must bear the consequences of a conviction, it does not remove the conviction. Thus I want to ask for clarification on the part where it states that pardoned individuals \"*apply for a job not available to felons, or vote, or get a hunting license and use a firearm*\". I figure the three options are either:\n\n1. I am not entirely correct about what a pardon by the President does.\n2. The prohibitions on felons to applying for jobs not available to felons, voting, get a hunting license and using a firearm are part of the pardon\n3. The statement is not correct.\n\nWhat are the actual legal effects of pardons issued by the President of the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on your location. A felony conviction can limit your rights in various ways, and those rights may or may not be restored at the state level. See [this article](http://alanellis.com/federal-felony-conviction-collateral-civil-disabilities/) for discussion of federal convictions and collateral civil disabilities. The [Dept. of Justics says](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions) that \"a presidential pardon will restore various rights lost as a result of the pardoned offense and should lessen to some extent the stigma arising from a conviction, it will not erase or expunge the record of your conviction\", and \"most civil disabilities attendant upon a federal felony conviction, such as loss of the right to vote and hold state public office, are imposed by state rather than federal law, and also may be removed by state action\".\n\n[This article](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/pr/195110.pdf) surveys civil disabilities of convicts on a state by state basis, as well as at the federal level. For example, voting rights are set at the state level, so a state has to have statutes restoring rights upon a pardon if you are to get your voting rights back. Service on a federal jury would be restored per [28 USC 1865(b)(5\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1865); the federal felon in possession crime has [an exception encoded in it](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921) in the definition of \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" which says\n\n> What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in\n>  accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings\n>  were held.\n>  Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a\n>  person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be\n>  considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such\n>  pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides\n>  that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\n\nSo if you are a state felon, you need a state pardon (or other state procedure) and if you are a federal felon, a state pardon does no good, you need a federal pardon. However, [21 USC 862](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/862) makes mandatory the ineligibility for federal benefits after a third conviction for drug trafficking (either state of federal law), and there is no \"rights restoration\" clause that restores such rights after a pardon even if the convictions are all federal. I have not located any case law establishing whether federal benefits rights restoration for federal convictions flows automatically from a federal pardon (not many 3\\-time drug dealers get federal pardons). A federal felony conviction can also be used as a factor in granting a security clearance (applicable to certain jobs), and current law does not say that a pardoned conviction *cannot* be considered in deciding on a clearance.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a federal felon convicted of drug trafficking three times, receives a presidential pardon.

As his solicitor put it:\n\n> \"Based on previous experience in other cases, laser speed detection devices can produce erroneous results and in this case Mr Herron was convinced he was not speeding as alleged and stated he had telematics data to support that view. When confronted with failings in court the prosecution determined to offer no evidence.\"\n\nThis doesn't really set a legal precedent that \"GPS beats Laser speed gun\" though \\- because the CPS chose not to present evidence.\n\nAs others have commented though there's quite a few potential pitfalls with doing this \\- GPS data carries a certain level of uncertainty, it's pretty accurate these days, to quote GPS.gov:\n\n> GPS\\-enabled smartphones are typically accurate to within a 4\\.9 m (16 ft.) radius under open sky. However, their accuracy worsens near buildings, bridges, and trees.\n\nand specifically for speed measurement:\n\nAs with positioning, the speed accuracy of GPS depends on many factors.\n\n> The government provides the GPS signal in space with a global average user range rate error (URRE) of \u22640\\.006 m/sec over any 3\\-second interval, with 95% probability.\n> \n> \n> This measure must be combined with other factors outside the government's control, including satellite geometry, signal blockage, atmospheric conditions, and receiver design features/quality, to calculate a particular receiver's speed accuracy.\n\nThe thing is there's going to a big range of accuracy in what a phone can offer \\- does it have A\\-GPS, GLONASS, how good is the GPS antenna, where is it positioned in the car etc etc. A lower end device shoved in the driver's is going to offer significantly worse accuracy performance than a top end handset sat in a cradle with clear line of sight to the sky.\n\nIn short it's a long way from being some form of get\\-out\\-jail\\-free card you can use in defense of speeding allegations.

In Canada, married couples typically own property as tenants by the entirety, which means the surviving spouse automatically inherits the entire property upon the other's death, regardless of what's stated in the will. To achieve the desired outcome, the couple needs to change their ownership to tenants in common. This allows each spouse to own a distinct share of the property that can be willed separately. Once this change is made, the wife can specify in her will that her share goes to her son. This approach requires professional legal and tax advice to implement correctly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a will alone cannot override the automatic inheritance in a tenancy by the entirety. Option C is false; Canadian law does allow leaving property to children from previous marriages.

Thus reasonable searches and seizures, especially those authorized by a warrant, are constitutional.\n\nFurthermore, even in light of a constitutional right of privacy derived from this statue, depending on how the \"search history\" is compiled, the 4th Amendment might not even apply, due to the *Katz* doctrine, also known as the \"open fields\" doctrine. Basically, the 4th amendment (as far as searches goes) does not apply to things that are publicly observable; while this would protect a literal \"search history\" compilation (baring a reasonable search), the searches themselves are public queries, broadcasted over the internet.

D1 may argue that both D2 and D3's subsequent actions broke the chain, while D2 might focus solely on D3's actions.

It is more than likely that if you refuse to answer the questions of customs officials in ANY country, you will be denied admittance. The same is true if you refuse or balk at being searched (personally or your possessions), and keep in mind that this is without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The best thing to do is to answer the questions honestly and accurately, but also as narrowly as possible to completely answer. Trying to argue with them will only send up red flags and you will be there longer. Remember it is a privilege, not a right, to enter a sovereign nation of which you are not a citizen.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., customs reserves the right to detain for questioning, search you, your car, your children, your bags, packages, purse/wallet, or any other travel item with full legal authority to do sol they can even examine your electronics (content and hardware). You place your stuff on the exam station and open it. (After the exam is completed, you will be asked to repack and close the baggage.) If you are unhappy with the way you are being treated, you do have the right to ask to speak to a CBP supervisor, but I cannot see anything good coming of it, unless they were super rude without provocation or broke something of value.\n\nThe authority to delay and speak with travelers derives from the United States Code (section citations below) enables CBP to prevent the entry of persons who are inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and to prevent the smuggling of merchandise, including narcotics and other contraband items, into the United States.\n\nSpeaking with travelers and examining merchandise coming into or leaving the United States is just one of the mechanisms used to identify illegal or prohibited items, and to determine whether or not someone is trying to enter the U.S. for unlawful or fraudulent purposes. Unless exempt by diplomatic status, all travelers entering the United States, including U.S. citizens, are subjected to routine Customs examinations. At times, people make the mistake of thinking their civil rights are being violated by being asked questions about their trip, personal background and history, etc. That is not the case.

According to the information provided, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have broad authority to question, detain, and search travelers and their belongings without the need for probable cause or reasonable suspicion. This authority is upheld by Supreme Court decisions and does not violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent applies in criminal proceedings, it does not apply in the same way during customs inspections.

An employer not operating in New York City seeking employees at large wouldn't meet that requirement. While this concept is usually applied in the context of the personal jurisdiction of a court, it is also not irrelevant to choice of law questions.\n\nAs with any law, there are edge cases that could be challenging in which the applicability of the law could be unclear. \n\nFor example, it isn't clear whether this rule would or would not apply to an employer looking for an employee in its Chicago office (e.g. working for the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange)) that conducts interviews and makes hiring decisions for the job at a job fair intended for NYU Alumni that is conducted at its New York City campus, even though it doesn't have offices for the conduct of its primary business in New York City and the staff conducting the job fair are based in Chicago. It might. \n\nBut, suppose that the law did apply to the conduct of the employer at the job fair.

Option D involves the employer directly conducting hiring activities within NYC, making it the most likely scenario to fall under the law's purview. Options A and C involve candidates outside NYC, and the interviews aren't conducted within city limits. Option B takes place entirely outside NYC. While the position is for a NYC office, the law focuses on the employer's actions during the hiring process, not the job's location.

The normal maximum to hold someone is 18 months, so we are well past that.\n\nCan the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court?\nWhen would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual' punishment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court?\n\nYes. This is civil contempt which is imposed to compel compliance with a court order that the disobedient person has the ability to comply with, rather than criminal contempt which is limited to a set time period to punish disrespect for the Court in an instance that is over and complete.\n\nOften, it is eventually vacated on the grounds of futility (i.e. it is clear that further incarceration will not secure compliance) or mootness (e.g. when a witness refuses to testify in a trial and then the trial is completed). In the case of government officials who refuse to comply to an order directed to them in an official capacity, the government official can be released forthwith by resigning from their official post.\n\nLong periods of detention for civil contempt are most common for cases like this where someone refuses to provide the location of something of great value, or in asset protection trust type cases involving millions of dollars worth of assets where the detained person refuses to disclose hidden assets or to take the steps necessary to cause them to be turned over to a creditor or ex\\-spouse, and the Court has determined that the person detained is capable of doing so. Less often, it is done for quite a long time in cases involving national security secrets.\n\nPersons held in civil contempt also have fewer due process protections than persons charged with indirect criminal contempt which is just a procedurally unusual form of crime (direct criminal contempt is even more procedurally unusual and involves less due process, the person held in direct criminal contempt can be jailed or fined for a set period of time summarily by a judge without a hearing for disrespectful conduct in the judge's physical presence with only a brief few seconds opportunity to speak up for himself or herself without a right to counsel in response before being punished).\n\n> When would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual'\n> punishment?\n\nNo. Cruel and unusual punishment applies to punishment for wrongdoing. Civil contempt isn't designed to punish wrongdoing. It is calculated to secure compliance going forward with a lawful court order with which the person incarcerated has the ability to comply.\n\nIn a case of civil contempt, a fundamental principle is that the person detained, who has refused to comply with a court order that the person has the ability to comply with and does so without lawful justification, \"holds the key to the jail\" and can be released forthwith upon complying with the Court's order at any time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A judge has ordered John Doe to reveal the location of stolen artwork worth millions of dollars.

While 18 months is often considered a standard maximum for criminal contempt, civil contempt cases can extend beyond this timeframe.\n\nC) is incorrect. Civil contempt is not considered punishment, but rather a means to secure compliance with a lawful court order.

When do you agree to this?\n\nSecond, if the \"Google's TOS\" is all you need, why do you have the Chrome TOS? Do you need a TOS for every product you create?

What I don't understand is (a) why they have a generic Company\\-wide TOS, and (b) how that relates to product\\-specific TOSes.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"company TOS\" specifically says that it applies to all of Google's Services.

If you use Chrome, you have to comply with all the terms in both documents, except where the Chrome TOS specifically overrides the company TOS.\n\nPresumably they found it inconvenient to have separate documents for all their many services, so they wrote a generic document that would be appropriate for most of them, and then they supplement this with specific documents when individual services need something special.\n\nFor your own apps, you'd have to decide, based on your business needs and in consultation with your lawyers, which of these two models makes the most sense for you.

For example, an adult asthmatic may be fine 95% of the time, but if they were just visiting a friend's house where several cats and dogs live, they may have a brief, minor issue with \"shortness of breath\" or \"wheezing\".\n\nAnd it gets worse if they have OCD and are analytical. An individual like that might, for example, notice that their breathing is 99%, not 100%. (Of course, most people with OCD know and are perfectly able to just ignore the sign at that point, but it can make one flinch for half a second and be slightly unwelcoming.)

On the other hand though, they are also ***chronic***.\n\nNow, I want to highlight this: Common sense is common sense, and normally these signs would be ignored. However, if we use the example above about the cats and dogs, the asthmatic might cough a couple of times, which would be noticeable; but in this case, it does not suggest COVID, and the problem is something that is ***chronic***.

Without that context, the rationale and flow behind the answer didn't seem to follow logically. In particular, when it was mentioned that people are expected to know the law, usually I think of that as mainly applying to the offender, as opposed to the victim. An offender can always still say or do something illegally though, and a victim's knowledge or ignorance of the law doesn't grant the offender a free pass to impede their rights. However with the proper context, the answer does seem to follow.\n\nI could be misinterpreting something, but per a few comments back and forth, I think this is a rough paraphrase/summary, context included:\n\n> Basically the dividing line is a matter of how clearly the alleged offender is addressing the alleged victim. In the case of a typical COVID sign, there's typically supposed to be context that the sign doesn't apply to people who just have things like asthma, unless, for example, a store employee actually addresses the individuals directly. Therefore it is not clearly and unambiguously barring them for symptoms clearly attributable to asthma (or whatever the condition is). In this way, it is similar to how a \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign at the gate of a private property does not apply to friends and family who have previously been welcomed by the owner.\n>   \n>   \n> \n> Also, the precise manner in which the sign is worded can weigh against this, but it doesn't single\\-handedly decide the case.

Under \u00a736\\.201(a),\n\n> No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of\n> disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of\n> public accommodation by any private entity who owns, leases (or leases\n> to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n\nAfter that under activities, it is stated that\n\n> A public accommodation shall not subject an individual or class of\n> individuals on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such\n> individual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or\n> other arrangements, to a denial of the opportunity of the individual\n> or class to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of\n> public accommodation.\n\nand also\n\n> A public accommodation shall not afford an individual or class of\n> individuals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such\n> individual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or\n> other arrangements, with the opportunity to participate in or benefit\n> from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation\n> that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.\n\nmoreover \"separate but equal\" is not allowed.\n\nThe sign does not articulate any denial of opportunity, so that should be the end of the discussion. OTOH I suspect that a sign saying \"Please do not enter this store if you are white\" would be held to be discriminatory, as an indirect denial of permission to enter based on race.\n\n\u00a736\\.208 introduces two important exceptions. First,\n\n> This part does not require a public accommodation to permit an\n> individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that public\n> accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat to the health\n> or safety of others.\n\nThat means that (irrespective of the fact that covid is not a legal disability) it is legal to exclude direct threats to the health of others. And furthermore,\n\n> In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the\n> health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make an\n> individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on\n> current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence,\n> to ascertain: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the\n> probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether\n> reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the\n> provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.\n\nBased on reasonable medical judgment and innumerable official government proclamations, it is reasonable to believe that a person with covid symptoms pose a threat to public health. The law doesn't require you to be omniscient and actually know that customer A has covid and customer B has asthma. \u00a736\\.301 then says more about possible screening requirements.\n\nIt is generally expected that everybody knows the law and will follow the law: ignorance of the law is no excuse, nor is it a cause for a discrimination claim. It would not be legal to exclude a person from a public accommodation when they pose no threat to public health. The customer with asthma is expected to know this law, and is expected to not infer incorrectly that the sign implies that he is being illegally excluded. The customer with covid is also expected to know this law, and is expected to know that it refers to him \u2013 as is allowed under the law.\n\nPotentially illegal discrimination enters the picture once actual exclusion happens, getting you back to \"individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment\".

In general, nobody, not even the police, can enter your home without your permission. The main exception to this rule is that police do not need your permission if they have a search warrant to search your home. To get a warrant, the police must convince a magistrate that they have good reason (ie, \"probable cause\"), such as a gps track, to believe they will find evidence of a crime if they search the house.\n\nThe police in your hypothetical are in a similar situation to police who are tracking the gps signal from a \"[bait car](http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vol128_Joh.pdf)/bike/phone/tablet/package.\" (A bait car is a car/etc that has been fitted with a camera and gps tracker, and left out as bait for thieves.)\n\nAs long as the car is in public view, the police do not need a warrant to search it and arrest the person driving it. However, once the bait car is out of public view, where the police can no longer see it, they need a warrant to go in and recover it, even if they can see it on the tracker. (See, for example, the instructions for bait car programs from the [Eugene](https://www.eugene-or.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5186) and [Reno](http://www.renopd.com/content/gen_ord/S-270-09%20Bait%20Vehicle%20Operations.pdf) Police Departments.)\n\n(For phones, which may not be in \"plain view\" even if the thief is, the police use ring programs to make the phone ring. Hearing a phone respond to a ring program gives them probable cause under the \"hearing\" version of the \"plain view\" doctrine.)\n\nBottom line: In the US, the police need a search warrant. Since search warrants take time and effort, police may be unwilling to get a warrant for something as low valued as a phone.\n\nIf the police can't or won't help, there are various options for privately enforcing one's rights.

Second, I can understand that there may be some confusion about this, but I hope you can understand that the pet rent is very much rent just like the main rental amount. There isn't really any flexibility in paying one month or another based on the pets being in the home or not. Just as you would be responsible for rent, even if you were out of town for a month or two, you are still responsible for the pet rent, even if they have not moved in yet.

Absent any indication in the lease that your cats would not move in immediately, the landlord is right.\n\nI assume that your lease reflects mutual knowledge of your intent to bring your cats over (via a marked checkbox or in \"*d) Pet1 Details: ... Pet 2 Details ...*\"). If so, according to the lease, you officially have pets in the apartment. To avoid being charged unnecessarily, you should have (1\\) ensured that the contract reflects the intended delay regarding your cats, or (2\\) asked the landlord to amend the lease once it is imminent that you will bring your pets over.\n\nOne or multiple administrative reasons justify a landlord to charge pet fees even if there are no pets in the apartment. For instance, the landlord might need to notify his insurer whenever an additional rental unit will host pets, thereby resulting in adjustments to a premium. Likewise, the number of pets might be a factor when a cleaning company bills the landlord.\n\n> The lease was signed with the impression that the $40 would only be\n>  necessary if we brought pets.\n\nHence the relevance of determining whether or not the lease objectively reflects that you notified the landlord of your intention to bring pets and, if so, *when* it would become effective. If the latter is not specified, it defaults to the start date of the lease.\n\n> It also sounds like if we never mentioned pets until, say, 6 months\n>  in, they would charge us pet rent for the previous 6 months even\n>  though the pets were not present.\n\nIt depends. If the landlord \"busted\" you, then he could sanction you in accordance with the terms of the lease. Instead, if you subsequently requested an amendment to the lease, then the landlord would only charge you from the date you officially bring the pets. But the *effective* date needs to be reflected in the lease/amendment.\n\n> Should I take this to court and get a lawyer?\n\nNo. First, for the reasons I mentioned above. Second, because lawyers want money, and they will detect right away that there is really not much to recover in a controversy like this one. Third, because complaining about a relatively small amount ($40/month) tells the lawyer that he or she won't get much money from you either (and lawyers want your money). And fourth, because the yearly total of pet fees indicates that the matter would have to be filed in Small Claims Court, where \\-\\-if I am not wrong\\-\\- parties are not allowed to be represented by counsel.\n\nGoing to court is not \"peanuts\".

According to copyright law, using the likeness of copyrighted material, such as movie or comic book characters, requires either owning the copyright or obtaining a license from the copyright holder. This applies even if the business owner creates the 3D models themselves. The fact that it's a different medium (3D printing instead of 2D images) doesn't change the copyright implications. Answer A is incorrect because creating the 3D model doesn't grant rights to the character's likeness. Answer C is incorrect because making slight modifications doesn't circumvent copyright law - this would likely still be considered derivative work.

Let me give two possible scenarios to illustrate:\n\n*(A) I create a Youtube video about, for instance, a particular language. I want to analyze it and I use a theoretical approach developed in the published writings by Smith (1980, 1991, \u2026) \\[author invented for the purpose of being explicit].

You are free to (indeed expected to) provide citations of factual and theoretical sources; you are free to use the ideas and facts reported or expressed in those works. The title of a book, year of publication, authors name and all the other things that go into a citation are not creative elements, so are not protected by copyright.

Option B is misleading because while Illinois does follow the \"discovery rule,\" the 2-year period isn't automatically granted from the date of discovery. Option C is too definitive, as the civil statute of limitations may still be open depending on case specifics.

Pennsylvania has a law called the \"implied warranty of habitability\" that *ensures that tenants have safe and decent housing. This means that every landlord in Pennsylvania must make the repairs needed to keep the rental housing in a safe, sanitary and liveable condition.* See [PALawHELP.org \\- Your Online Guide to Legal Information and Legal Services in Pennsylvania](https://www.palawhelp.org/resource/deduct-repair-tenants-right-to-a-safe-and-dec?ref=YCeIM).\n\nBut don't schedule repairs until you read that site and talked to PALawHELP.

But, would it be reasonable to say that police powers are those powers of government reserved to the States by the 10th Amendment?\n\nTo what extent that police powers are permitted to Federal government agencies? Are they limited to executive branch agencies? Are they limited to economic issues of interstate commerce?\n\nDoes the existence of a statute ([2 U.S. Code \u00a7 1966 \\- Protection of Members of Congress](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1966)) permit the U.S. Capitol Police to exercise police powers throughout the U.S.? How does this statute fit within the concept of enumerated powers of the federal government?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you're being confused by two separate definitions of \"police power.\" The police power under the 10th Amendment has nothing to do with \"the police,\" i.e. people with guns and badges and uniforms who make arrests. It refers to the authority of a *government* to make rules for the general welfare. Police power is almost always exercised by the legislature, and when the executive exercises it (e.g. by issuing regulations) it's typically operating under conditions set by the legislature.\n\nThe United States has police power in a few situations: DC, federal property and territories, US\\-flagged ships on the high seas, etc. Outside of those situations, the United States instead has enumerated powers. Congress has a power to tax and spend to promote the general welfare, but otherwise it can only legislate to achieve one of the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Now, courts have read Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce very broadly, but there does need to be *some* relation to enumerated powers.\n\n---\n\nYou're asking about the Capitol Police, but they don't have \"police power\" in the 10th Amendment sense. They have the power to carry guns and to arrest people for crimes committed against the United States. This power is limited based on geography and/or the nature of their task; for instance, they have nationwide arrest powers \"\\[i]n the performance of their protective duties,\" but not when they're traveling outside DC on other official duties (e.g. to attend training).\n\nWhile there's no litigation I can dig up that's *directly* on point, courts have repeatedly ruled that Congress has the power to do some not\\-entirely\\-legislative tasks in order to protect its own functions. For instance, in *Anderson v. Dunn* (1821\\), the Supreme Court upheld an inherent power of the House to hold private citizens in contempt of Congress for disobeying its subpoenas and for the Sergeant at Arms to arrest them and bring them before the House. It seems likely Congress would also have the authority to protect its own members from physical violence. The GAO [did an analysis](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-317742) when it was analyzing whether there was a constitutional problem with making Capitol Police IG personnel into special deputy US marshals, and it concluded that there was no issue with congressional employees exercising arrest powers in order to physically protect the legislative branch.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between \"police powers\" as mentioned in the 10th Amendment and the authority of federal law enforcement agencies like the U.S. Capitol Police?\n\nA) Police powers under the 10th Amendment directly grant federal agencies like the U.S. Capitol Police the authority to make arrests nationwide.\n\nB) The U.S. Capitol Police's authority stems from the same police powers reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment.\n\nC) Police powers in the 10th Amendment refer to the government's authority to make rules for general welfare, while the U.S. Capitol Police's authority is derived from specific congressional powers.\n\nD) The U.S. Capitol Police have unlimited police powers throughout the United States due to the interstate commerce clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the distinction between \"police powers\" as mentioned in the 10th Amendment and the specific authority granted to federal law enforcement agencies. Option C is correct because it accurately differentiates between the two concepts. \"Police powers\" in the 10th Amendment context refer to a government's broad authority to legislate for the general welfare, typically exercised by the legislature. In contrast, the U.S. Capitol Police's authority is not derived from these general police powers, but from Congress's power to protect its own functions and members, which has been upheld by courts as part of Congress's inherent powers to carry out its constitutional duties.

Military bases, firehouses, and jails are owned by the public, but many of these have limited access to the public.\n\nIt may be open to the general public, but that does not mean restrictions cannot be put into place, either on times, or activities, or individuals. For example, public parks often have time and activity restrictions; schools have the power to restrict individuals from their premises, either specifically or by general category.\n\nAs a general point of law, the owner of any property, or their agent, can order anyone without the right to stay (e.g. not a co\\-owner or tenant), and that person must depart, otherwise that person is tresspassing. Assuming that the Senior Center is owned by the town, it is probable that the Administrator is empowered to act as the town's agent in this matter.\n\nNow, since this \"No Trespass order\" is specifically directed at you, there is a reason behind it. It may be something you've done. It may be that complaints have been received about your behavior. It may be an actual abuse by someone who doesn't like you. We have no way of knowing. It the order itself doesn't give you a hint as to why, you can ask the town administrator for the reason.\n\nAs for being against your rights, there is nothing inherently illegal about this situation(that is, an agent of a property owner exercising the latter's right to prohibit an individual from said property), but some of the details, especially why it was specifically applied to you as an individual might be a civil rights violation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A town administrator has issued a no-trespass order against a private citizen for a senior center.

Public property doesn't mean unrestricted access, as exemplified by military bases, schools, and other public facilities that can limit who enters and when. The legality of the order doesn't depend on the individual's criminal history (ruling out B), it's not automatically illegal for public buildings (ruling out A), and it doesn't inherently violate civil rights laws or require a court ruling (ruling out D)."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80156/can-i-legally-take-liability-from-a-previous-tenant-what-are-the-limitations-of", "docs_id": 80156, "title": "Can I legally take liability from a previous tenant? What are the limitations of this?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question regarding tenancy laws in the UK.\n\nI took over the tenancy for the place that my dad was living in as I needed somewhere to go in an emergency. I didn't have a deposit so my dad told the landlord to keep his deposit. The landlord didn't bother inspecting the property when my dad moved out, instead he asked me to sign a contract stating that I would take liability for the state of the property \\- I signed this since it was my dad's deposit anyway and I needed to move out ASAP.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the property was that the carpets are in disrepair. There are stains, frays and matted areas all over. It is impossible to keep feet or socks clean and the dirt from the carpets is enough to permanently stain socks. I started wearing flip\\-flops indoors as a hygienic solution.\n\nSince the carpets are in disrepair, I sent an email to the landlord asking for him to replace the carpets. The landlord's response was that it must be a cleaning issue and therefore he will not be replacing the carpets.\n\nMy dad lived in the property for 5 years and did not once clean the carpets. I wouldn't be surprised if he barely used a vacuum cleaner in that time either. That being said, the landlord said that the carpets were \"like new\" when my dad moved in. I have been here for 8 months now. This means the carpets are likely around 6 years old.\n\nMy dad is disabled and was paying for rent with disabled benefits. My brother and his girlfriend lived with him for a few years and I lived with them all for about a year. This means there was probably substantial wear \\& tear to consider on the carpets (which span the entire house except for the bathroom, which is lino).\n\nIn addition to all of the above, when I mentioned the carpets to the landlord during an inspection, he said \"We have already noted the carpets. We will replace them after you've left.\" This to me says both that they were aware they needed replacing *before* I signed the contract to transfer liability, and that they recognise that they need replacing.\n\nMy questions are as follow:\n\n1. Should the landlord not replace the carpets regardless of the situation, since they are presumably at the end of their lifespan and they have practically admitted that they need replacing?\n2. Just how much liability have I taken over from my dad? Is it even possible for someone *without* a disability to take liability from someone *with* a disability?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to take different view to @DaleM and say you cannot take liability for damage caused by a previous tenant, notwithstanding that you purported to agree to that.\n\nI know you stated that you \"took over the tenancy\" but I'll start with the assumption that what you mean is that you signed a new tenancy agreement with the landlord (containing a clause agreeing to be liable for past damage), as this is by far the most common scenario in practice. I'll then examine the alternative scenario. I've asked in the comments for you to clarify how you entered into the tenancy agreement.\n\nNew tenancy agreement\n---------------------\n\nIn a new tenancy agreement, you *cannot* take liability from a previous tenant in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), due to the provisions of the [Tenant Fees Act 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/4/contents). I'm open to being convinced otherwise if anyone has an alternative interpretation of those provisions.\n\nA landlord must not require a tenant to make a prohibited payment:\n\n> **Section 1(1\\)**: A landlord must not require a relevant person to make a prohibited payment to the landlord in connection with a tenancy\n> of housing in England.\n> \n> \n> **Section 1(9\\)**: In this Act \u201crelevant person\u201d means \u2014 (a) a tenant, \\[...]\n\nThe starting point is that *all* payments are prohibited. Exceptions to this are then listed in Schedule 1 of the Act. If it's in the Schedule, you can require payment; if it isn't, you can't.\n\n> **Section 3(1\\):** For the purposes of this Act a payment is a prohibited payment unless it is a permitted payment by virtue of\n> Schedule 1\\.\n\nPayment for damages relating to breach of contract is permitted:\n\n> **Schedule 1, Paragraph 5**: A payment of damages for breach of a tenancy agreement or an agreement between a letting agent and a\n> relevant person is a permitted payment.\n\nIn a typical tenancy agreement, failure to return the property in the condition you found it (allowing for fair wear and tear) is a breach of contract. Hence, it is not prohibited for landlords to require their tenants to pay for damage to property.\n\nThe issue here is that *your dad* committed the breach under *his* tenancy agreement. Under your tenancy agreement there has been no breach. Therefore, requiring payment from your dad is permitted; requiring payment from you is not. Any clause which purports to do so is unenforceable on the tenant:\n\n> **Section 4(1\\)**: A term of a tenancy agreement which breaches section 1 is not binding on a relevant person.\n\nNovated tenancy agreement\n-------------------------\n\nIt's possible that instead of signing a new tenancy agreement, you [novated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novation) the old one. This means that *all three* parties (the landlord, your dad, you) agreed to substitute you for your dad as a party. It is not possible for only you and the landlord to agree to a novation. That's because the outgoing party gives up their rights as well as obligations; hence their consent is required.\n\nAlthough this is commonly be described as \"stepping into the shoes\" of the outgoing party, strictly speaking this is not what happens. Rather, the old contract (between A and B) is extinguished and a new contract (between A and C) is formed on the same terms (or partially on the same terms, depending on what the novation states).\n\nUnder a novation, the default position is that pre\\-novation liabilities remain with the outgoing party. It's possible (and common) to expressly provide something different, which is what has purportedly happened in your case.\n\nThat raises an interesting question as to the effect of Schedule 1, Paragraph 5\\. In my view, while you can expressly provide that *liability* can transfer from B to C in a novated contract, you cannot provide that *breaches* can transfer. A breach is a factual occurance and it's nonsensical to rewrite history by saying that C committed a past breach which in fact B committed. Instead, what you can do is say that C agrees to be *liable* for that past breach. Saying otherwise would be incompatible with the principle that a novated contract is a new contract which extinguishes the old.\n\nAccordingly, my view with regards to Schedule 1, Paragraph 5 is the same as if you had signed a new tenancy agreement (which is effectively what you have done with a novated tenancy agreement). You did not commit the breach, therefore asking you to accept liability for it under the novated contract is prohibited.\n\nNote also that it is permitted to require payment of \u00a350 or the landlord's *costs* in relation to the novation, whichever is greater. However, in my view this applies to only to the outgoing party, being \"the tenant\" who makes the payment \"in consideration\" of the novation of \"the tenancy\" which is done \"at the tenant's request\" (all of which implies we're talking about the existing tenancy, not the new one). The language would appear to exclude the possibility that the incoming party can legally be required to make the payment:\n\n> **Schedule 1, Paragraph 6**:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A payment is a permitted payment if it is a payment \u2014 (a) to a\n> landlord in consideration of the variation, assignment or novation of\n> a tenancy at the tenant's request, \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (2\\) But if the amount of the payment exceeds the greater of \u2014 (a) \u00a350,\n> or (b) the reasonable costs of the person to whom the payment is to be\n> made in respect of the variation, assignment or novation of the\n> tenancy, the amount of the excess is a prohibited payment.\n\nIf I'm wrong **and** the landlord also released your dad from liability for damage to the carpet (which is not necessarily implied by the fact that you agreed to be liable), then it could perhaps be argued that such release is a \"cost\" for the purposes of sub\\-paragraph 1(b) above. However, I would counter\\-argue that it isn't really a \"cost\" since it was taken on voluntarily (the landlord could have simply had your dad remain liable which is the default position) and it isn't \"reasonable\" for the same reason.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under UK tenancy law, a new tenant agrees to take over liability for carpet damage caused by the previous tenant. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The new tenant is fully liable for the carpet damage, as they agreed to take on this responsibility when signing the new tenancy agreement.\n\nB) The landlord can legally require the new tenant to pay for the carpet damage, as long as the cost doesn't exceed \u00a350 or the landlord's reasonable costs.\n\nC) The clause making the new tenant liable for the previous tenant's damage is unenforceable due to the Tenant Fees Act 2019.\n\nD) The new tenant is only liable if the tenancy was novated rather than a new agreement being signed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Tenant Fees Act 2019 prohibits landlords from requiring tenants to make payments that are not specifically permitted by the Act. While tenants can be required to pay for damages resulting from their own breach of the tenancy agreement, they cannot be made liable for breaches committed by previous tenants. Any clause attempting to transfer such liability to a new tenant is unenforceable under Section 4(1) of the Act. This applies regardless of whether the agreement is a new tenancy or a novation of an existing one. Options A and D are incorrect as they misstate the legal position. Option B is incorrect because the \u00a350 limit applies to costs related to variations or novations of tenancies, not to damages from previous tenants."}}
