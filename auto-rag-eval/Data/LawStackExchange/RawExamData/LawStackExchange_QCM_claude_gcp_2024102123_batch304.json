            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I already asked this question several years ago, but it's a little different this time.\n\n---\n\n**Last time, the phrase was:**\n\n\"The world Is Yours\" from Scarface movie and videogame (it's the title).\n\n**Was going to use it:**\n\nInside the game, not the title. Just a reference, like an achievement name for getting all the \"things\" which had nothing to do with Scarface.\n\n**Simplified answer was:**\n\nHas nothing to do with Scarface? just the phrase? it's ok.\n\n---\n\n**Now, the phrase is:**\n\n\\<SECRET BECAUSE GAME IN DEVELOPMENT ;)\\>. But it's a more famous phrase.\n\n**Will be used:**\n\nAs the game title/name. And it has a little bit of something to do with the movie: Both the movie and my game are about Space (Stars, Black Holes, etc).\n\nSo basically, I will use a **famous phrase from a space movie as the title of my space game. No other things are similar, no character names, no similar story, nothing at all. Just both are about space.** So I expect the same answer? ;)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: General Rules\n-------------\n\nThe rules on this vary somewhat by country. In some counties the is no trademark protection unless a mark is formally registers. In others use \"in trade\" offers a degree of protection even in the absence of registration. The US follows the second rule. Some of Europe follows the first.\n\nBut in pretty much all countries trademarks (aka trade marks) are only protected when they are \"used in commerce\" and are only protected against other uses \"in commerce\". This mans that a phrase or design or other possible mark is only protected when it is functioning as a mark, that is it is used by the maker to identify or advertise a product or service (hereafter I use \"product\" to mean either or both).\n\nMoreover a mark is only protected when an alleged infringer uses the mark (or a similar mark) in such a way that people might reasonably be confused into thinking that the infringer's product comes from the same source as the products of the owner of the mark, or is approved, sponsored, or endorsed by the owner of the mark.\n\nA simple literary or pop\\-culture reference is normally not trademark infringement. This is both because a well\\-known phrase is not usually protectable as a mark at all, and because a reference to it is normally not infringement, even if the mark is protected.\n\nThe likelihood of confusion is a very important concept in trademark cases.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThe phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" Is often used as a reference to the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels. But it was never used to brand or advertise those stories, so its use in a novel or video game now would not be infringement. Even if a game used that phrase as a title, it would not be infringement, because the phrase is not protected. All this would still be true even if the Sherlock Holmes stories were still being published.\n\nThe tagline \"In space, no one can here you scream\" was used extensively to advertise the movie *Alien*. It had some protection as a mark (in the US), and might well have been registered for fuller protection (I haven't checked the US register of trademarks, or any other for this phrase). A game titled with this phrase might well be infringing. A game where a character speaks the phrase at some point probably will not be infringing.\n\nCaution\n-------\n\nAll that said, exactly where the limits of infringement lie depend on the detailed factual situation. Before investing sizable amounts of money or time and effort on such a project, it might be wise to consult a lawyer knowledgeable about trademark law in one's particular jurisdiction, and make sure that the risk of suit is not to great for one's tolerance.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential trademark infringement?\n\nA) Using any phrase from a movie as a game title is always considered trademark infringement.\n\nB) As long as the game's story and characters are different from the movie, using a famous phrase as the title is never an issue.\n\nC) The likelihood of trademark infringement depends on whether the phrase was used to brand or advertise the original movie, and if there's a potential for consumer confusion.\n\nD) Trademark infringement only applies to exact copies of movie titles, not to phrases or taglines used in the movie.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. Trademark infringement in this case would depend on several factors:\n\n1. Whether the phrase was used to brand or advertise the original movie. If it was, it's more likely to have trademark protection.\n2. The likelihood of consumer confusion is a crucial factor in determining infringement. If people might reasonably think the game is associated with or endorsed by the movie's creators due to the use of the phrase, it could be considered infringement.\n3. Simply referencing a famous phrase is usually not infringement, but using it as a title for a commercial product (like a game) in a similar genre (space) increases the risk.\n4. The level of protection can vary by country and specific circumstances.\n\nOptions A and B are too absolute and don't account for the nuances of trademark law. Option D is incorrect because trademark protection can extend beyond just titles to include phrases and taglines used in branding or advertising."

Many companies, like Unilever, control multiple brands of competing products without explicitly disclosing their common ownership. This practice is prevalent in various industries, including groceries and automotive. The documentation states that companies are entitled to segment their market as they see fit, and having different features or improvements across brands is allowed. The legality of this practice is not dependent on having a monopoly or specific pricing strategies. While deliberately hiding the common ownership might be challenging in practice, the act of creating and marketing separate brands under the same parent company is generally legal and common in business."

Is\n> this a title insurance situation?\n\nYou aren't far from the mark, but keep in mind that in the U.S. title to real property is not represented by a certificate for a particular geographic area as it is in most of the U.K. and Australia, for example (the modern U.K. land title system was actually invented in Australia). So, unlike those jurisdictions, the full legal description of what you own may not be consolidated into a single, up to date document.\n\nInstead, in the U.S., people file various documents with the real property records (usually maintained on a county level) of the county where the property is located. These records are indexed by grantee and grantor, not by geographic location.\n\nSo, in this case, someone would file a plat for the subdivision you live in and that is a matter of public record. Later on the state transportation department would bring an eminent domain proceeding to seize property for public use in exchange for fair compensation, or would negotiate a non\\-court ordered sale of the land. The decree transferring the property in an eminent domain proceeding and/or the deed transferring the land to the state, would have been recorded in the real property records. But, if there was a discrepancy between how the owner of the property was described in the deed giving that owner title to the property and the name of the owner in the eminent domain matter, this decree or deed or a replat of the land might not get properly indexed.\n\nIf the land was taken while you owned it, you should have received notice of the eminent domain lawsuit, although if you ignored it or failed to realize its significance, a default judgment could have been entered against you in that case with no further notice to you.\n\nIf you purchased the land after the land was taken in a commercial real estate transaction, a title company should have identified the recorded documents that took that land away from you and that limitation should be listed in the deed by which you took title\n\nSometimes the deed will simply reference \"all easements of record\" since the state highway interest will often be a very restrictive easement rather than outright ownership, since this costs the state less to acquire than outright ownership.\n\nIf there is not some reference in the title commitment and the deed conveying the land to you, that references the land that the state took for the highway, then you have a title insurance claim against the title insurance company if this limitation was omitted from the title commitment, and you would have a claim for breach of warranty of title to every prior seller conveying by a warranty deed (which is the norm in arms length sales of real estate for fair market value) that omitted the land taken from the highway after the state took that land.\n\nThe designation of the land taken, if it is actually an easement, wouldn't change the legal description of the property although the existing of the easement would have to be mentioned, at least in a general sense (\"*subject to all easements of record*\") in the deed, and in a specific sense with a copy of instrument creating the easement in the title commitment. The draft title commitment would normally be disclosed pursuant to a real estate contract prior to closing, with an out from the contract available if the title work revealed had an unacceptable problem.\n\nEven if the land was taken outright, the change in the legal description could be subtle, such as \"Lot 1, Block 23 of the *Amended and Restated* Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 456, page 128\\.\" And might not note that the original legal description was \"Lot 1, Block 23 of the Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 34, Page 456\\.\"\n\nThe change could also be stated as a reservation or limitations on the original property description, such as \"Lot 1, Block 23 of the Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 34, Page 456, *subject to* the decree of the Hill Valley County District Court recorded at Book 455, Page 100\\.\"\n\n> Apart from the missing land. The reason this matters now is that they\n> are improving the highway again and taking another 17' and do not want\n> to compensate my for the mature trees that I have screening the house\n> from the highway, because they are already in the right of way or on\n> their land depending on which survey is used.\n\nThe state is required to pay you an appraised fair market value for the land it takes which you can dispute in court (you pretty much always have to surrender the land and the only real issue is the price). If you think that the money offered is too small for the fair market value of the property you should consider hiring a lawyer and your own appraiser to context the valuation.\n\nBut, as you note, if the trees in question are \"are already in the right of way or on their land depending on which survey is used\" then you don't own them and aren't entitled to compensation from the state for taking the trees. Again, this should have been mentioned five years ago in a title commitment and if it wasn't you may have a warranty of title and/or title insurance claim to compensate you for land you thought you were buying but didn't actually own.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John purchased a property 5 years ago with a deed describing the lot boundary as 50 feet from the center of a state highway. Recently, he discovered that the state claims a 70-foot offset into his property due to a highway replat in the 1990s. The state is now improving the highway and taking another 17 feet without compensating John for mature trees in this area. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate course of action for John?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against the previous property owner for fraud\nB) Ignore the state's claim and continue to use the full property as described in his deed\nC) Review his title insurance policy and potentially file a claim for the discrepancy\nD) Accept the state's decision without question, as they have ultimate authority over highway boundaries\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate course of action for John is to review his title insurance policy and potentially file a claim for the discrepancy. This is because:\n\n1. If the state's claim to the additional 20 feet (70 feet instead of 50 feet) is valid and was not disclosed during John's purchase, this could be a title defect that should have been caught and disclosed by the title company.\n\n2. Title insurance is designed to protect property owners against losses arising from defects in title, including undisclosed easements or government claims to the property.\n\n3. If the title company failed to discover and disclose the state's expanded right-of-way, John may be entitled to compensation for the loss of property value and the trees.\n\n4. This approach allows John to seek professional assistance in determining the validity of the state's claim and his rights regarding compensation for the additional 17 feet being taken.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no evidence of fraud by the previous owner. Option B is risky and could lead to legal issues. Option D ignores John's potential rights to compensation or challenge the state's claim. Therefore, reviewing the title insurance policy and potentially filing a claim (Option C) is the most prudent first step."

The matter is mildly obscured by two facts. First, the movie was based on an earlier German book and was adapted without permission. For a while, this was okay because of details of German copyright law, then the US 9th Circuit court decided in [Twin Books Corp. v. Walt Disney Co](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1304377.html)., 83 F.3d 1162 that the original work did not fall into the public domain in the US. However, the artwork in the movie was indisputably created by Disney in 1942\\. Then the question would be whether copyright protection has lapsed. The [rules for duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States#Duration_of_copyright) of protection of works created before 1978 are complex, but under the circumstance that Disney followed the rules for publication and registration, copyright expires in 2037\\.

For works created before 1978, like the 1942 Disney film mentioned, copyright protection extends until 2037, assuming Disney followed proper publication and registration procedures. The artist's location in the UK does not exempt them from respecting US copyrights, especially when dealing with a company like Disney that is known for strictly enforcing its intellectual property rights. Therefore, the artist would need to obtain permission from Disney to use any designs inspired by their films, including depictions of generic animals that appear in those films."

Some places, it seems, it might be illegal as vandalism; some places, it seems it's totally fine, and some places, it seems, are contingent upon enforcement. \n\nPlease help me, Law Stack Exchange. Is it safe to unchain my inner six year old? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have bad news. California's vandalism law prohibits maliciously:\n\n* defacing property with graffiti\n* defacing property with inscribed material\n* damaging property\n* destroying property\n\nChalking the sidewalk probably doesn't sound very malicious, but maliciousness includes \u201can intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d So the questions is whether you intended to do a wrongful act \\-\\- meaning that you intended to do the act, which happens to be wrongful, not that you intended to act wrongfully. So unless you drew on the sidewalk accidentally, the malicious\\-intent requirement isn't going to help you.\n\nSo then you have to ask if your conduct is described by the statute. In [*Mackinney v. Nielsen*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1464004.html), the Ninth Circuit said that sidewalk chalking did not violate the law, but California has since amended the law to add the \"deface with graffiti\" language. I haven't seen any chalk cases since then, but another case, [*In re Nicholas Y.*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1130080.html), from the Second District, dealt with someone who used a marker on a window. He argued that it could be easily erased, but the court said it was still vandalism because:\n\n* it \"mars the surface with graffiti which must be removed in order to restore the original condition\"\n* the definition of \"deface\" \"does not incorporate an element of permanence\"\n* \"marring of the surface is no less a defacement because it is more easily removed.\"\n\nGiven that language, I'd argue that the vandalism statute includes sidewalk chalking.\n\nBut one important element here is that most sidewalks are owned or controlled by the government, so any effort to restrict \"expressive conduct such as writing with chalk\" ([Guilliford v. Pierce County](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19981481136f3d134511292)) expressive activity\" there must comply with the First Amendment.\n\nThe government has varying degrees of latitude on the restrictions it can impose, depending on the character of the space involved. So in a courtroom, whose function is incompatible with free\\-wheeling public debate, a judge can set quite a few rules about how people may speak. But sidewalks are considered a \"public forum,\" where the government's ability to regulate speech is a lot more limited.\n\nSo how does the First Amendment apply?\n\nThere's a D.C. Circuit case (*[Mahoney v. Doe](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1571470.html)*) dealing with abortion protesters who wanted to use chalk on the streets and sidewalks outside the White House. Police told them they would be arrested for violating D.C.'s defacement statute, so they brought a First Amendment challenge. The court upheld the law, saying that it satisfied all three prongs of the public\\-forum test:\n\n1. **The law must be content neutral**, meaning that it prohibits conduct without reference to what is being said. The Court said the defacement statute was content neutral because people could be prosecuted regardless of what they wrote or drew.\n2. **The law must be narrowly tailored**, meaning that it serves a significant governmental interest and does not restrict more speech than is necessary to achieve that goal. The Court said the defacement statute was narrowly tailored because it served the government's interest in maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the area in front of the White House and didn't restrict any speech that does not deface public property.\n3. **The law must leave open ample alternatives for communication**, meaning that even if you can't express yourself in the way restricted, you still have meaningful opportunities to express yourself. The Court said the defacement statute law allowed adequate alternatives for communication because the group could still congregate, march, speak, hold signs, and hand out leaflets.\n\nThere's an interesting wrinkle there in terms of whether the interest in aesthetics is heightened because we're talking about the White House, but generally speaking, aesthetic concerns can still justify speech restrictions. \n\nSo the bad news is that unchaining your inner six\\-year\\-old may subject you to criminal liability. That leaves the question of whether you want to unleash your inner teenager and do it anyway.

According to the information provided, California's vandalism law could potentially include sidewalk chalking as a form of defacement, even though it's easily removable. However, since most sidewalks are government-owned and considered public forums, any restriction on chalking must comply with First Amendment standards. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while chalking can be a form of protected speech, it's not always protected and can be regulated under certain conditions.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because California's vandalism law doesn't explicitly permit chalking, and courts have ruled that easy removal doesn't exempt an act from being considered vandalism.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because malicious intent in this context doesn't require an intent to cause permanent damage, only the intent to perform the act itself.\n\nThe correct answer acknowledges both the potential illegality under state law and the constitutional protections that must be considered when regulating such activity in public spaces."

The car was purchased by his parents in 2009 and is still registered in their name, but Jan has been the primary user since 2010 and is listed as a driver on the insurance. Jan wants to claim exemption from the Dutch BPM (tax on motor vehicle acquisition). Which of the following statements is correct regarding Jan's situation?\n\nA) Jan cannot claim exemption because the car is not registered in his name.\nB) Jan can claim exemption if he transfers ownership of the car to himself before moving.\nC) Jan can claim exemption without any changes, as long-term use establishes the car as part of his household effects.\nD) Jan can only claim exemption if his parents move to the Netherlands with him.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the ECJ case C170/3, there are two key requirements for claiming BPM exemption in this situation:\n1. The person must own the car at the moment of import.\n2. The person must have had a prior connection to the car.\n\nWhile Jan satisfies the second condition by being the primary user since 2010, he does not meet the first condition as the car is still registered to his parents. Therefore, to claim exemption, Jan would need to transfer ownership of the car to himself before moving to the Netherlands. This makes option B the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ownership, not just registration, is the key factor. Option C is incorrect because despite long-term use, ownership at the time of import is still required. Option D is incorrect as the exemption is based on Jan's situation, not his parents' relocation."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I read FERPA, I don't see any clarification as to whether they are talking about written sharing of educational records, or whether they are also talking about verbal disclosures.\n\nFor example, here is [their definition of *disclosure*](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/node/438/):\n\nDisclosure means to permit access to or the release, transfer, or other communication of personally identifiable information (PII) by any means (34 CFR \u00a799\\.3\\). Disclosure can be Authorized, such as when a parent or an eligible student gives written consent to share education records with an authorized party (e.g., a researcher). Disclosure can also be Unauthorized or inadvertent (accidental). An unauthorized disclosure can happen due to a data breach or a loss, and an accidental disclosure can occur when data released in public aggregate reports are unintentionally presented in a manner that allows individual students to be identified.\n\n\"By any means\" suggests that things that have not been disclosed in writing would also be included, but I'm not sure if I'm interpreting that correctly. For example, what about a student's counseling sessions with the school social worker? Does the parent need to be informed, and provide consent, for a university researcher sitting in on, and participating in, these sessions? What about verbal background information about the student's diagnoses shared by the school social worker with the professor? Is the answer different if the university and the high school have signed a memorandum of understanding? Is the answer different if information obtained through presence in the counseling sessions is used for the professor's research activities? The student is 15\\.\n\nI'm aware that one can file a FERPA complaint in case of a violation. If there were a serious FERPA violation, is there also in theory some way of filing for legal damages in such a situation? This is New York, where human rights law does not apply to students in public schools.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've never seen a case directly on point, but the wording of the statutory prohibition on disclosure ([20 USC \u00a7 1232g(b)](https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-20-education/20-usc-sect-1232g.html)) suggests that FERPA prohibits unauthorized disclosures of personally identifiable information, regardless of whether the disclosure is written or oral:\n\n> No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records ... or personally identifiable information contained therein...\n\nSo it explicitly prohibits the release of (1\\) \"records,\" but it also prohibits disclosure of (2\\) PII from those records. PII taken from a record and put onto another piece of paper is still a record, so what is left that the (2\\) could be referring to? I can't think of anything besides oral disclosures.\n\nBut a violation \\-\\- serious or trivial \\-\\- would not be grounds for damages,as FERPA doesn't allow for a private cause of action. [*Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe*, 536 U.S. 273, 289 (2002\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/536/273/) (\"FERPA's nondisclosure provisions fail to confer enforceable rights.\").

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation under FERPA?\n\nA) This is not a FERPA violation because the information was shared verbally, not in writing.\nB) This is a FERPA violation, but the student's parents cannot sue for damages.\nC) This is a FERPA violation, and the student's parents can sue for monetary damages.\nD) This is not a FERPA violation as long as the high school and university have a memorandum of understanding.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario constitutes a FERPA violation because FERPA prohibits unauthorized disclosures of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records, regardless of whether the disclosure is written or oral. The phrase \"by any means\" in FERPA's definition of disclosure encompasses verbal communications. \n\nHowever, as established in Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, FERPA does not allow for a private cause of action, meaning the student's parents cannot sue for damages. The only penalty for a FERPA violation is the potential loss of federal funding for the educational institution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal disclosures are included under FERPA. Option C is incorrect because FERPA does not allow private lawsuits for damages. Option D is incorrect because a memorandum of understanding between institutions does not override FERPA's requirement for parental consent in disclosing a minor student's PII."

(This is \"adverse\" with respect to the counsel's client.)\n\nFor example, imagine a husband and wife are selling a home owned by the husband only and only the husband is represented by an attorney. The wife is unrepresented. During the transaction it is decided that the husband and wife should each receive half of the purchase price. The buyer gives each a check. However, let's imagine the check given to the wife is clearly defective. For example, suppose it was post\\-dated eight months in a state in which such a thing invalidates the check.\n\nDoes the husband's attorney owe a fiduciary duty to the wife to ensure she receives a legally valid document? Would the wife be considered an adverse or neutral party in this instance?\n\nFrom what I can tell, a lawyer has an ethical obligation to ensure that \"a legal process\" is followed, so would this extend to intervening if a legally invalid financial instrument became part of a contract negotiation, even if that instrument did not affect the lawyer's client?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S., the relevant considerations are governed by some state specific variant of the [Model Rules of Professional Conduct](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents/).\n\nIf two people are adverse, there is a conflict of interest and they cannot be represented by the same lawyer, although some conflicts of interests can be waived. The relevant rules for this analysis are primarily 1\\.7, 1\\.8 and 1\\.9\\.\n\nThe model language of Rule 1\\.7 about which there is little variation states:\n\n> Conflict of Interest: Current Clients\n> \n> \n> (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not\n> represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent\n> conflict of interest.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An attorney represents a husband in a real estate transaction where the husband is selling a property solely owned by him. The wife, who is unrepresented, is to receive half of the sale proceeds. The buyer issues two separate checks, one to the husband and one to the wife. The attorney notices that the wife's check is post-dated by eight months, which would make it invalid in their jurisdiction. What is the attorney's ethical obligation in this situation?\n\nA) The attorney must inform the wife about the invalid check, as she is considered a party to the transaction.\nB) The attorney has no obligation to the wife and should only protect the husband's interests.\nC) The attorney should inform the husband and advise him to tell his wife about the invalid check.\nD) The attorney must inform all parties involved in the transaction about the invalid check to ensure a proper legal process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The attorney's primary duty is to his client, the husband. The attorney cannot directly advise the wife, as she is an unrepresented third party and doing so could potentially create a conflict of interest or violate Rule 4.3 regarding dealing with unrepresented persons.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the wife is not the attorney's client, and directly advising her could lead to ethical complications.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in that the attorney's primary obligation is to the husband, but it fails to address the ethical consideration of ensuring a proper legal process.\n\nAnswer D goes too far by requiring the attorney to inform all parties, which could potentially violate client confidentiality and exceed the scope of the attorney's role in representing only the husband.\n\nThe best course of action (C) is for the attorney to inform the husband about the issue and advise him to tell his wife. This respects the attorney-client relationship while also addressing the ethical concern of ensuring a proper legal process. It allows the husband to make an informed decision about how to handle the situation with his wife, maintaining the integrity of the transaction without the attorney overstepping ethical boundaries."

Amendments made by a codicil may alter, explain, add to, subtract from, or confirm \u2013 and otherwise amend a will in any other way, minor or major, short of complete revocation. It is subject to the same formal requirements as a will.\n\nI would think that it would be just as easy to print off a new copy of the will with the necessary amendments, so time saving wouldn't be a reason to create a codicil. If it has the same formal requirements as a will (which I take to mean it needs to be signed by witnesses and such), then why would a person create a codicil? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In modern usage, it is far better to replace a will then to create a codicil primarily because there is only one document to verify the veracity of. As you say, it would be just as easy to print off a new will.\n\nHowever, the ease of printing off a new one is a relatively recent technological development. When wills were typed on a typewriter or, in even earlier times, handwritten, the advantages of a codicil are much more apparent; particularly when you pay your lawyer by the hour.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the historical advantage of using a codicil to amend a will, as opposed to creating an entirely new will?\n\nA) Codicils were easier to authenticate in court than full wills\nB) Codicils required fewer witnesses than a full will\nC) Codicils were less time-consuming and costly to produce when wills were handwritten or typed on typewriters\nD) Codicils allowed for secret changes to a will without the knowledge of beneficiaries\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Historically, when wills were handwritten or typed on typewriters, creating a codicil (a document that amends an existing will) was less time-consuming and costly than rewriting the entire will. This was particularly advantageous when lawyers charged by the hour. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because codicils were subject to the same formal requirements as wills and were not necessarily easier to authenticate.\n\nAnswer B is false because the passage states that codicils have \"the same formal requirements as a will,\" which would include witness requirements.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because codicils do not allow for secret changes; they are formal legal documents that must be executed with the same formalities as a will.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the historical context and practical considerations that made codicils useful before modern word processing technology made it easy to create new versions of entire wills."

At the beach they have a seafood place called [Dirty Dicks](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiwiLGu2bLgAhWSON8KHePBA-oQFjAAegQIHBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dirtydickscrabs.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3sSzj75mwoxRw1GtitrQzt). When I left the beach that name stuck with me. How far can I go to having a profane name to my store? Are there any limits on what I can call my store? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So as per recent Supreme Court decision in [Matal v. Tam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matal_v._Tam), the phohibitation of the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage\" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols was ruled Unconstititutional. At issue, Tam, the bassist and founder of an all Asian\\-American band that was named after a slur for Asians (the linked article contains the Band Name, but to avoid a possible rule violation, I will not use the actual term). Tam was unable to register the trademark for his band due to the term being a slur, despite the bands intention to use the term in a re\\-appropriated manner.\n\nSCOTUS held that the act was unconstitutional and that Trademark protection did not constitute government speech beyond that the specific mark was registered with the government and thus protected. The decision found 9\\-0 in favor of Tam. (The case gained some fame as it immediately ended litigation on the name of Washington D.C. NFL football team as well).\n\nThe other famous case is that of [Jacobellis v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio) which held obsecenity is not protected speech, but that obscenity is to be determined by the most local levels of government. After all, what is Not Obscene to Los Angeles could be highly obscene to the Amish in Pennsylvania (Basically, no opinion was agreed too, but this was concurred with and every Justice held a concurring opinion). This case is famous for Justice Potter Stewart's concurring opinion, in which he stated obscenity should be limited to only Hard Core Porn, but famously did not offer a legal definition of that term beyond \"I know it when I see it \\[and the motion picture involved in this case is not that].\" Basically, check your local limits for guidance, as there is no federal or state law to help discuss this.\n\nFinally, as a small aside, the specific name of the establishment in the OP may be on it's face a little naughty, but \"Dick\" is a diminutive name for \"Richard\" and this gets all sorts of playful puns on it's other vernacular uses. For example, in one comic featuring Batman's young ward Robin (Dick Grayson), who was admonishing other heroes for not protecting their secret identity, one character comments to another that \"Robin is being such a \\-\" only for the second character to interrupt and remind the first \"No real names.\"\n\nAnother example is the stage name of a famous parody artist who sepcializes in singing modern pop songs in the style of a Vegas Crooner or Lounge Singer, Richard Cheese. The pun relies on knowing this nickname.\n\nFor one that is not punning on the body part, The Red Green Show once had a sketch where Red Green (the character's name) was talking with the town's notorious liar, Hap, who in this particular sketch dropped the time he went whaling and chased after the \"Great White Whale Moby Richard.\" Red asks if he meant the titular whale from the novel Moby Dick, to which Hap responds, \"I didn't know him that well, Red.\"",

This answer best reflects the nuanced legal landscape surrounding business naming in the US. The Supreme Court decision in Matal v. Tam struck down prohibitions on registering trademarks that may \"disparage\" persons or groups, expanding First Amendment protections for potentially offensive names. However, the Jacobellis v. Ohio case established that obscenity is not protected speech and that local communities have the primary role in determining what constitutes obscenity. This creates a system where local governments have significant authority to regulate business names based on community standards, but this authority is not absolute and must be balanced against First Amendment protections. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while free speech protections have been expanded, they are not absolute, especially regarding obscenity. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the federal government does not have final say on obscenity; this is primarily determined at the local level. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it ignores the role of both federal protections and local regulations in determining acceptable business names."

Nothing about the request is saved. Not even information like traffic statistics that would confirm a request happened at all.**\n\nAn additional concern would be that website is hosted on a root\\-server with a German provider (Netcup). Do I need to inform people that this provider could theoretically collect data (still nothing more than IP addresses with timestamps and encrypted TLS traffic)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Congrats, you've done well to minimize your processing of personal data. But I think you're still processing personal data, and are subject to the GDPR.\n\nServing a website necessarily involves processing an IP address. This IP address will typically be personal data. While you are not storing the IP address, the GDPR's definition of \u201cprocessing\u201d extends beyond storage and pretty much covers doing anything with that IP address. As far as I know this is not an entirely settled matter, but it's better to err on the side of caution and to assume that you are in fact performing a processing activity. Even a static web page can easily lead to additional relevant processing of personal data, for example if the HTML embeds resources from third party domains.\n\nSince your website is clearly targeted at the public, it does not fall under the GDPR's exception for \u201cpurely personal or household\u201d purposes.\n\nSo I think you do need a (minimal) privacy notice that contains at least the items mentioned in Art 13 GDPR. The main reason why some people try to avoid posting a privacy notice is because it must disclose your identity and contact details. But in Germany, that information has to be provided anyway due to the *Impressumspflicht*.\n\nAs part of your GDPR compliance obligations, you must protect how data is processed by others on your behalf. A hosting provider will typically act as your *data processor*. For this to be legal, you need a contract / data processing agreement that fulfills the conditions in Art 28 GDPR. This contract binds the data processor to only use the data as instructed by you, and not for their own purposes. European hosting providers sometimes include the necessary terms in their terms of service / AGB, but you should check to make sure. Netcup expects you to accept their data processing amendment in your account settings.\n\nIn the hypothetical case that you were not processing any personal data at all, the GDPR would not apply and it wouldn't require you to post a privacy notice. Other laws might still have information obligations, notably the German TMG and TTDSG.",

The definition of \"processing\" in GDPR extends beyond storage and includes any operation performed on personal data. Additionally, as the website is targeted at the public, it doesn't fall under the \"purely personal or household\" exception. Therefore, the owner needs to include a minimal privacy notice containing the items mentioned in Art 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the hosting provider acts as a data processor, requiring a data processing agreement that fulfills the conditions in Art 28 GDPR. This makes option C the correct answer, as it addresses both the privacy notice requirement and the need for a proper agreement with the hosting provider."

Or would any such scheme necessarily be bribery if it were effective?**\n\nFor example, say I adopt a policy of downloading all the legislators' votes, determining what I think was the correct vote on each item, and then splitting my pot of political donations in proportion to the number of correct votes. This policy clearly dispenses money to politicians in exchange for votes, so it's bribery, right? But it's also merely allocating my money towards legislators who have demonstrated that they agree with me and away from legislators who don't. So would this be allowed or not? Why would this be bribery but donating to, say, all the legislators who voted such that they weren't thrown out of the Republican party not be bribery?\n\nWould the calculus change if I took steps to make sure that everyone knows that this is how I allocate my donations, and what my political preferences are? Or if I started publishing some or all of what the \"correct\" votes on particular bills would be in advance? Would it somehow be legal to allocate donations like this but only if I keep it a secret from the legislators to prevent a *quid pro quo* relationship?\n\nWhy, legally, would a mathematical system of donating to legislators who do the things I want qualify as bribery, while a seemingly equivalent fuzzier system of telling legislators what to do, liking the ones who listen to me, and then donating to the legislators I like, would not be?

That means that the trial result is irrelevant \\- no matter what happens, one pays for one's own attorneys fees.\n\nThere are, however, some exceptions:\n\n* First: if the parties are litigating a contract, the contract text\nitself may provide that the prevailing party can recover attorneys\nfees from the non\\-prevailing party. Such \"Attorneys' Fees Clauses\"\nare common. The prevailing party may have to file a motion in the\ntrial court for the judge to add attorneys fees to the judgment\namount; the judge will also be responsible (in ruling on the motion)\nto determine the amount of attorneys fees.\n* Second: specific state statutes may allow the prevailing party to\nrecover \"Statutory attorneys fees.\" This is completely dependent on\nwhether the case at issue fits the various statutory definitions. For\nexample, the Song\\-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (the California\n\"Lemon Law\") provides for the recovery of attorneys fees by an\naggrieved consumer. There are multiple other examples throughout the\nCalifornia Codes.\n* Third: @ohwilleke (to whom thanks) added a comment below that includes other exceptions to the general rule. The comment text was: There are a few other exceptions, e.g. breaches of fiduciary duties involving trust finds, bad faith breaches of insurance contracts, etc. Also, it is possible for attorneys' fees awards to be made because litigation or some specific conduct in litigation is either groundless and frivolous, or violates a court rule. Further, a prevailing party generally gets court costs (e.g. filing fees, expert witness fees, copying costs, and other out of pocket expenses other than attorneys' fees) even when attorneys' fees are not awarded. Most are modest, but not expert witness fees.\n\nIf the case at issue does not fall within an exception, the general rule \u2014 each party is responsible for their own attorneys fees \u2014 applies.",

The work necessary to establish internal controls and then conduct the audits of these internal controls (the internal controls audit is Section 404 of SOX) is the main source of compliance costs.\n* Disclose material off balance sheet transactions.\n* Not defraud, coerce or bribe outside auditors.\n* Not knowingly alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, cover up, falsify, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence an investigation by a government agency, or in a bankruptcy case.\n* Not retaliate against whistleblowers who report fraud.\n* Not sign off as a CEO or CFO as required by the act on financial statements and tax returns knowing that they are fraudulent or do not comply with securities laws and accounting standards.\n\nThere are overlapping civil and criminal penalties, with criminal penalties generally requiring that the individual charged personally had knowledge of, or participated in intentional misconduct.\n\nWhat Impact Does SOX Have On The Cost Of Going Public?\n======================================================\n\n> it seems SOX increases the cost tremendously if it is required for all\n> public companies.\n\nThis is inaccurate propaganda.\n\n[SOX compliance costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act#Analyzing_the_cost-benefits_of_Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley) are on the order of 0\\.4% of the revenues and have been offset by a 0\\.5\\-1\\.5 percentage point drop in interest rates on corporate bonds due to the fact that it reduces the risk of defaults caused by fraud. SOX did not make foreign companies less likely to list their stocks on U.S. Exchanges.\n\nThe costs of compliance with SOX net of the benefits arising from compliance with SOX are negligible rather than \"tremendous\" for most companies, although they can become material. Compliance costs would have been up to about 2\\.4% of revenues if it weren't for the small public company exemptions in the smallest publicly held companies.\n\nSOX modestly shifts the scale at which it makes economics sense to go public towards largely companies, a concern that has been significantly offset by more lenient exemptions for private offerings of stock and bonds.\n\nThis isn't to say that going public and being publicly held [isn't expensive](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/deals/library/cost-of-an-ipo.html):\n\n> Underwriting makes up the largest component of IPO costs by far. Based\n> on the public registration statements of 315 companies, on average,\n> companies incur an underwriter fee equal to 4\\-7% of gross proceeds,\n> plus an additional $4\\.2 million of offering costs directly\n> attributable to the IPO. Legal and Accounting fees also add up and can\n> increase significantly for larger companies that may face additional\n> complexities in preparing for an IPO.\n\nBeing publicly held costs $1 million to $1\\.9 million a year in compliance costs, and in addition disqualifies a company from using pass through taxation (requiring them to pay a corporate level tax on their profits in addition to taxes owed by shareholders, resulting in double taxation).\n\nThe desire to secure pass through taxation is generally a much more important motivation than the desire to avoid the compliance costs associated with being publicly held in most \"going private\" transactions (usually involving leveraged buy outs of companies by their own management which are financed by large banks, or buy outs by private equity companies and hedge funds).\n\nBut, the lion's share of the costs of going public and being publicly held were unchanged by SOX, which had no real impact on underwriters fees, for example. SOX's main impact is that it mainly moderately increases the accounting costs involved.\n\nWhat Is A Publicly Held Company?\n================================\n\nGenerally speaking, a company is \"publicly held\" if (1\\) it has made a public offering under the '33 Act, (2\\) it is listed on a U.S. stock exchange, (3\\) it has more than 500 unaccredited investors, or (4\\) it has more than 2000 investors (including accredited investors) and has more than $10,000,000 of net worth per its balance sheet at year end (even if it has fewer than 500 accredited investors). It is also subject to SOX if it was formerly listed on a U.S. stock exchange and became a foreign company not listed on a U.S. stock exchange.\n\nAs a matter of empirical reality, the vast majority of companies in the U.S. either have few than 50 investors, or are publicly held. Companies in between are quite rare and are economically fairly insignificant in the U.S. economy. The are several million privately held companies, the number of publicly held companies is in the low tens of thousands, and the number of companies in between is probably in the single digit thousands.\n\nGenerally speaking, an offering of stock, bonds or investment opportunities that is open to unaccredited investors and involves more than $5,000,000 of funds raised, or is marketed to the general public, it must be registered under the '33 Act before investments can be offered to the public.\n\nThere are two main \"private offering\" exemptions from the '33 Act found in SEC [Regulation D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_D_(SEC)) that allow stock of privately held companies to be sold without registering under the '33 Act.\n\n[Rule 504](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small-entity-compliance.html) of Regulation D allows investments of up to $5,000,000 a year with minimal requirements but strict limitations on marketing to the general public, and requires stock to be held for at least one year.\n\nRule 506 of Regulation D allows unlimited investments by accredited investors in privately held companies with disclosures that are a simplified bare bones version of what companies that are going public must disclose. \"Accredited investors\" include affluent individuals, certain kinds of professionals, and institutional investors.\n\n[Regulation A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_A) provides additional crowdfunding exemptions, one of which applies to smaller single state offerings regulated by state securities laws, and the other of which applies to larger national crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nCaveat\n======\n\nThis summary should not be relied upon as legal advice. It intentionally oversimplifies a complex body of law to convey the broad outlines of what is covered, but omits details that could be material in a particular case.",

Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the application of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and its impact on ABC Corp?\n\nA) SOX will apply to ABC Corp as soon as it makes a private offering to accredited investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D.\n\nB) If ABC Corp chooses to do a direct listing like Spotify, it will be exempt from SOX compliance requirements.\n\nC) ABC Corp will need to establish internal controls and have them audited annually once it becomes a publicly held company, which is the main source of SOX compliance costs.\n\nD) The costs of SOX compliance for ABC Corp will likely be around 10-15% of its annual revenues, making it prohibitively expensive to go public.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because SOX does not apply to private offerings made under regulatory exemptions like Rule 506 of Regulation D.\n\nB is incorrect because a direct listing still results in the company becoming publicly traded, and thus subject to SOX requirements.\n\nC is correct. The establishment of internal controls and their annual audits (particularly under Section 404 of SOX) is indeed the main source of SOX compliance costs for public companies.\n\nD is incorrect. The information provided states that SOX compliance costs are typically around 0.4% of revenues, not 10-15%. The claim that SOX makes going public prohibitively expensive is described as \"inaccurate propaganda\" in the text."

That client has been receiving the service, but he did not pay for it. He obviously knew how much the service should have cost when he signed up, and there were some months when he was billed and paid appropriately before the glitch happened. The glitch was noticed by the service provider after some months. The client did not attempt to contact the service provider during this time to inquire why his bill changed.\n\nIs it possible to get a decision (in the framework of law) that this client owes this money, or does, from legal perspective, it's company responsibility to provide correct bills in order to be paid appropriately. \n\nIt is of course possible to ask him nicely, and hope he agrees to pay, but if not, who is in the right? The amount we are talking about is quite small, around 400USD.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe in most jurisdictions the payment of the difference can be enforced, though there are usually some mitigations built in for the debtor, and the time limit for enforcement (statute of limitations) may be shortened.\n\n---\n\nIn particular, in **Germany** the situation is roughly:\n\nThe invoice itself usually only carries limited legal weight. It is important for taxation purposes, and is a precondition for enforcing unpaid debts in court, but not much more. In particular, it does not determine the amount payable \\- that is in the contract. So, if contract and bill disagree, it's the contract that counts.\n\nFor example, after entering into a contract, in general a service provider is free to send multiple invoices, each for a part of the total agreed. So if the bill lists a certain value, that is no guarantee that you do not need to pay more \\- however, you *must* receive a new bill before you can be sued for non\\-payment. Asking for more money only becomes impossible when the statute of limitation has expired (in Germany, usually after three calendar years).\n\n*Warning:* The exact situation will depend on the type of contract, the nature of the parties involved (private individuals or companies), and on any applicable small print. So the customer *may* be able to avoid paying, but usually not.\n\n---\n\nHere is a report on a court judgement:\n[Vergessener Rechnungsposten kann nachgefordert werden](http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/Vergessener-Rechnungsposten-kann-nachgefordert-werden-artikel7562746.php)\n\nA company had sent a bill for construction work, then later sent an additional bill claiming they had forgotten one item. The customer refused to pay, was sued and lost. The court decided that the claim is justified and must be paid, unless the company explicitly declared that they will abandon the claim (which it did not).\n\nAlso, the court noted that the decision might have been different if the contract had used a different set of terms and conditions.",

Due to a billing system glitch, the client was not billed for 6 months. The company has just discovered the error. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's ability to recover the unpaid fees?\n\nA) The company has no legal right to recover the fees because they failed to bill the client correctly.\n\nB) The company can only recover fees for the last 3 months due to the statute of limitations.\n\nC) The company can legally request payment for all 6 months, but must issue a new invoice before taking legal action.\n\nD) The client is automatically protected from paying any back fees due to consumer protection laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In Germany, the contract terms generally take precedence over the invoicing process. The company can legally request payment for all 6 months of service provided, even if they failed to bill correctly initially. However, before taking any legal action to enforce payment, the company must issue a new, correct invoice to the client. The statute of limitations for such claims in Germany is typically three calendar years, so all 6 months would still be within this timeframe. While the client might have some grounds to negotiate or dispute the payment, especially if they can prove hardship or reasonable belief that the service was provided for free, the company has a valid legal basis to seek the full amount owed according to the original contract terms."

Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the homeowner's rights and recommended actions?\n\nA) The homeowner has full ownership rights over the road verge and can legally remove or destroy any signs placed there without consequence.\n\nB) The homeowner should contact their Homeowners Association (HOA) to handle the removal of unauthorized signs from the road verge.\n\nC) The City of Austin sign code allows the homeowner to remove the signs, but it's recommended to call 311 instead of taking action personally.\n\nD) The homeowner has no rights regarding signs in the road verge since it's city property, and must allow all signs to remain in place.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the City of Austin sign code (\u00a725-10-103) prohibits placing signs on public property, including road verges. While anyone is technically allowed to remove these \"bandit signs,\" the city recommends calling 311 instead of taking personal action. This is likely to prevent potential conflicts between individuals. The homeowner doesn't have full ownership rights (eliminating option A), there is no HOA mentioned in the scenario (eliminating option B), and the homeowner does have some rights regarding the signs despite not owning the property (eliminating option D). Therefore, option C is the correct and most appropriate answer based on the given information."

According to the documentation, the California Secretary of State allows submission of 3 or 4 names on the formation document in order of priority. This strategy provides the best chance of successfully registering the desired name or a close variation.\n\nOption A is risky because even though the company merged out long ago, there might still be naming conflicts.\n\nOption B is not necessarily effective because the documentation states that the SoS staff primarily focus on the first two words of an entity name, so adding a suffix may not resolve potential issues.\n\nOption D is unnecessary and there's no indication that waiting longer would increase the chances of successful registration.\n\nThe most prudent approach is to submit multiple variations of the desired name, allowing the Secretary of State to approve the most appropriate option that doesn't conflict with existing registrations."

The new lease signed in January 2020, even though it's nearly identical to the previous one, is considered a separate agreement that resets the 9-month period. The provision about penalties is likely tied to the current lease period, not the cumulative tenancy. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new lease is treated as a fresh agreement, and the time spent under previous leases does not typically carry over for such provisions."

Before you pay for a lawyer, it might help for you to know roughly what you're up against.\n\nThe contract case is where you pay a person to render some type of assistance in creating music. What you apparently didn't know at the time as that might have given the other party some right to the music. That of course depends on what they did. That right comes from the possibility that they have copyright in the music because they created the music (\"help\" is vague, we don't know what they actually did). If they only supplied technical non\\-creative assistance, they gain no rights to your music. If the two of you created the music, then you are the authors and you share rights to the music equally, so you can do what they want and so can you. If they entirely created the music entirely for you, then they hold the copyright. In *that* case, there's a theoretical possibility that they could say \"You can't use that work\". Even without an explicit \"work for hire\" clause in the contract, you can exploit the work under the theory (established in the US, wonder where in the world you are talking about) that they have granted an impicit license to use. That is, the courts will not say \"We assume you paid this person a bunch of money so that they could create music for their sole use\". If the goal is for you to have copyright, they you need to enter into a new contract, where they give you something you want (they transfer copyright to you), and you give them what they want (money? help painting the house?). This *quid pro quo* is known as \"consideration\" in contract law: without it, you don't have a contract and the putative transfer of copyright is revocable. The \"something\" that constitutes their obligation under the contract has to be a *new* obligation.\n\nIn the case of the translation volunteers, the matter is simple: the translators hold copyright to their translations. Your use of their work is with permission, but it's not irrevocable \u2013 you don't have a contract (lack of consideration). Again, if you pay them something in exchange for transfering their work to you, you have an enforceable contract. A licensing scheme that lack consideration runs a risk of revocation. The goodish news is that you may have the required consideration: you gain the right to use, in exchange for attribution.\n\nAnother legal detail is that under [17 USC 203](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/203), transfers and licenses *can* be terminated, except in the case of a work for hire. Had you made these works for hire in the first place, that would not been an issue. You should read this section to see how it would apply to your case.\n\nOf course, you do have to hire a lawyer to analyze the facts of your problem and make a specific recommendation.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright situation?\n\nA) The developer automatically owns all copyrights since they initiated the project.\nB) The translators and musicians have no copyright claims as they voluntarily contributed or were paid.\nC) The translators likely hold copyright to their translations, while the musicians' copyright status depends on their level of creative input.\nD) All contributors automatically fall under a Creative Commons license by participating in the project.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The translators likely hold copyright to their translations as they created original work, even if done voluntarily. For the musicians, their copyright status depends on their level of creative input. If they provided purely technical assistance, they may not have copyright claims. However, if they created original music, they likely hold copyright or co-ownership rights, depending on the extent of their creative contribution. The developer doesn't automatically own all rights without proper contracts, and voluntary contribution or payment alone doesn't negate copyright claims. Creative Commons licenses aren't automatically applied without explicit agreement. This situation highlights the importance of establishing clear copyright agreements before collaborative work begins."

In the United States, truth is an absolute defense against libel claims. As long as the information John publishes in the ad is factually correct, his intent to potentially damage Sarah's reputation is irrelevant from a libel perspective. The ad doesn't disclose highly sensitive personal information that would constitute an invasion of privacy. Simply stating the existence and amount of a debt, even if it's embarrassing, is not considered \"highly offensive to a reasonable person\" in legal terms. Option A is incorrect because truth negates libel claims regardless of intent. Option B is wrong because disclosing a debt isn't typically considered a privacy violation. Option D is incorrect because mentioning the purpose of the loan, even if it highlights a business failure, wouldn't change the legal status of the ad as long as it's truthful."

I decided to take a stand for the fun of it and called Dominoes Pizza head office to complain. I asked them to stop fly tipping inside my home but they said it was nothing to do with them, they paid Royal Mail to do it. This did seem to irritate me so I asked them would it be OK and nothing to do with me if I paid someone to fly tip trash in their restaurants. As expected, they hung up. I then contacted Royal Mail to complian that my local postman was ignoring the no junk mail sign. The person on the line told me that posting junk mail was part of the postmans job and it was OK to ignore the sign. This did not go down well either. I gave them my objections to this and I also asked about how I could get this to stop. I was quite surprised as to how this works.\n\nFirstly you are considered automatically opted in unless you opt out.\n\nThere is no easy way of opting out. You have to download a form from [here](https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/293/%7E/how-do-i-opt-out-of-receiving-any-leaflets-or-unaddressed-promotional-material%3F). Print it out and send it off.\n\nThe opt out only lasts for 2 years. After that you have to reapply.\n\nAnyway my questions are these... How is this even legal? Can I invoice the advertiser or Royal Mail for a disposal fee? Can I get the Royal Mail prosecuted for fly tipping? From a health and safety point of view they are causing a fire risk not to mention damage to the environment. I want it to stop but object to this implied opt in and having to send a form when conveniently for them, it cannot be done online or even over the phone. Rather than be a victim, I wish to profit from this or at the very least annoy them back. I welcome your thoughts. :\\-)\n\nIt is not just me, there are millions of UK residents affected. Can it be stopped?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, these are flyers/leaflets. Not unaddressed mail in envelopes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Junk mail is perfectly legal\n----------------------------\n\nFrom [Preventing unsolicited mail](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05762/SN05762.pdf) published by the House of Commons Library:\n\n> It is not illegal for a company to send unsolicited mail unless the material is obscene or threatening. No legislation exists which can protect a householder from receiving it.\n> \n> \n> If postage has been paid, Royal Mail is legally obliged to deliver all addressed mail, which includes mail that is addressed \u201cto the occupier\u201d as well as mail that is personally addressed. However, there are various options available to an individual who wishes to stop unwanted and unsolicited direct marketing mail.\n\nFrom you description, it appears that Dominos paid for the mail to be delivered \u201cto the occupier\u201d and the Royal Mail has a legal obligation to do so (unless you opt out).",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What are reasonable costs for replacing a carpet in a rental property?\n\nHere's the background \\- a bedroom carpet in a rental property has a bottle of wine spilled on it. The tenant apologises to the landlord and agrees (verbally) to replace the carpet at the end of the tenancy.\n\nAfter moving out, the bill for the new carpet was much more than the tenant expected. The room was slightly larger than estimated (requiring 4 x 4m of carpet instead of the initial guestimate of 3 x 3m) (the actual size is about 3\\.1 meters each side). In addition, the bill also includes the cost of delivery and fitting, plus new underlay and the removal of the old carpet. The end result is that the bill is about 4 times the tenants 'guestimate' and nearly half the overall deposit. The tenant is now reluctant to pay.\n\nDoes the tenant have any wriggle room on paying this bill? is it fair and reasonable (and legal!) for the landlord to include the cost of delivery, fitting and removal of the old carpet? Or should the tenant be limited to just paying for the carpet and the landlord pick up the rest of the costs?\n\nFurther info \\- tenancy was a 12 month Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST). Carpet was new at start of tenancy, the bill comes from a reputable high\\-street carpet retailer. The replacement carpet is similar in quality (and cost) to the original. 10% has been deducted from the bill to cover depreciation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your tenancy agreement most likely has terms requiring you to hand the property back in good condition or similar condition to how it was at the start, and to pay for any damage which you cause, allowing for any fair wear and tear. Spilling a bottle of wine on the carpet is not fair wear and tear, but at the same time the landlord cannot reasonably expect to get back a brand new carpet after a 12 month tenancy. In my opinion he has covered for that by deducting 10% from the cost, so the bill you are left with seems reasonable. It's not the landlord's fault his carpet was destroyed, so there's no particular reason he should have to pay for the delivery and fitting.\n\nWith that said, the landlord would have been required to register your deposit with a tenancy deposit scheme and provide you with prescribed information within 30 days of receiving the deposit pursuant to [section 213 of the Housing Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/213). Assuming they did so then you can challenge any deposit deduction using that scheme's dispute resolution procedure. Doing so is free of charge so you have very little to lose other than your time. In my experience the dispute resolution services, which are not courts, can come up with some fairly irrational and badly considered decisions, so it is entirely possible you will get lucky. I have seen deductions reduced by 50% for reasons that appear to make little sense.\n\nIn the event that the landlord failed to register your deposit *and/or* provide you with prescribed information within the required deadline, then you are in better luck. You can sue your landlord in the County Court under [section 214 of the Housing Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/214) and the court must make an order awarding you an amount between 1 and 3 times the deposit.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant spills wine on the carpet in a rental property and verbally agrees to replace it at the end of the tenancy. The final bill is much higher than expected, including costs for delivery, fitting, new underlay, and removal of the old carpet. What is the most accurate statement regarding the tenant's responsibility?\n\nA) The tenant is only responsible for the cost of the new carpet material, not the additional services.\n\nB) The tenant can refuse to pay since the verbal agreement wasn't in writing.\n\nC) The tenant is likely responsible for the full amount, minus the 10% depreciation deduction.\n\nD) The tenant can automatically reduce the bill by 50% due to the unexpected costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, the tenant is likely responsible for the full amount of the carpet replacement, including associated costs like delivery, fitting, and removal of the old carpet, minus the 10% depreciation deduction. This is because:\n\n1. The damage (wine spill) is not considered fair wear and tear.\n2. The tenant agreed to replace the carpet.\n3. The landlord has already accounted for the 12-month use by deducting 10% for depreciation.\n4. The replacement carpet is similar in quality and cost to the original.\n5. The bill comes from a reputable retailer.\n\nWhile the tenant may find the cost higher than expected, the landlord is not obligated to cover the additional services required for proper installation. The tenant could potentially challenge the deduction through the tenancy deposit scheme's dispute resolution procedure, but based on the information provided, the full amount (minus depreciation) seems reasonable and in line with the tenant's responsibilities."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Several years ago I was stopped in public by the police. Someone had 'identified' me as abusing them in terms of their gender two years before that. Had that happened, I suppose it would have been classified as a hate crime. In fact, it was a case of mistaken identity and a senior police officer phoned me the next morning to say so and apologise.\n\nMy concern was that, although the previous day I had fully co\\-operated with the police, one of them said, \"We will not arrest you yet, but you will have to come in for an interview\". There was no interview because the case was dropped the following morning. There was certainly no arrest or any further proceedings of any kind.\n\nHowever I was quite shocked with the idea that I could perhaps have been arrested on the grounds of an allegation, merely because someone else made the accusation without any evidence other than their own word.\n\n**Question**\n\nIs it the case in the UK that someone could call the police and have someone arrested merely on the basis of an accusation of a verbal hate crime, even though there is no evidence whatsoever apart from the word of the accuser?\n\n---\n\nEDIT\n\nThe accusation was something like, \"Two years ago this person said hateful things to me about my being transgender\". That's all I ever found out. The accuser didn't name me because they didn't know the name of the person who said it. Apparently it was a chance encounter in the street but I don't know the details and the police wouldn't tell me. The accuser had spotted me walking in the street and called the police based on that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Is mere accusation without evidence other than testimony of the accuser, grounds for arrest in the UK?**\n\nIt depends on the circumstances, especially when dealing with non\\-recent allegations where independent and corroborative evidence may be difficult to locate and/or recover, but in my experience it is very rarely an option to arrest soley on the say\\-so of one complainant unless there is a compelling reason to do so. It's also fraught with potential risks \\- [Operation Midland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midland) being a prime example of when it can go horribly wrong.\n\nAlso, no\\-one can \"*call the police and have someone arrested*\" in the [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\") \\- the police are under a duty to carry out a \"proportionate investigation\" in to allegations of crime and then make their own minds up on how to proceed based on the available intelligence and evidence.\n\nFocussing on [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), the most commonly used power of arrest\\* is at [s.24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24?timeline=false) which, along with [PACE Code G](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pace-code-g-2012), requires an officer to:\n\n1. Reasonably *suspect* that an offence is being, has been or will be committed.\n\n* On a scale of 0 to 10 \\- with 10 being total knowledge and 0 being no opinion at all \\- suspicion may be as low as 2 or 3 whereas belief starts at 7 or 8\\.\n\n2. And reasonably *believe* an arrest is *necessary*.\n\n* One commonly used mnemonic for the *Necessity Test* under s.24 is:\n\n**ID COP PLAN**:\n\n> **I**nvestigation \\- prompt and effective investigation of offence or conduct\n> \n> \n> **D**isappearance \\- prevent prosecution being hindered by disappearance of a person\n> \n> \n> **C**hild / Vulnerable person \\- protection of\n> \n> \n> **O**bstruction of highway\n> \n> \n> **P**hysical injury to themselves or someone else\n> \n> \n> **P**ublic (in)decency\n> \n> \n> **L**oss or damage to property\n> \n> \n> **A**ddress not know\n> \n> \n> **N**ame not known\n\nI cannot say why the officer did not make an arrest in the OP's case. I surmise that he did not deem it *necessary* based on the above mandatory criteria but rather considered that a [voluntary attendance interview](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/voluntary-police-interview-your-rights) would be the most appropriate course of action given the circumstances and information available to him at the time.\n\n\\*There are other statutory and common\\-law powers of arrest, but they all follow the same procedures as above",

Copyright is always protected by the laws of a particular nation, by the courts of that nation. Because of the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention, I can sue you outside of my country, and will be treated as a person of that country. The conventions don't say who has jurisdiction, that is where you have to sue, so you have to resort to conventional jurisdictional principles. If you are in Europe, under the Brussels Convention, that means I have to sue you in your country of domicile (if you reside in multiple European nations, I get to decide which country to sue you in). The English courts are slightly different in that they generally hold that you sue in the country where the act took place, but (Lucasfilm v Ainsworth) you can sue in UK courts for infringement that occurs in the US. As you can see, this can get complicated. I can't sue you in Mongolian courts (assuming neither of us has any connection at all to Mongolia), but I could sue you (being a hypothetical UK citizen) in UK courts if you did the infringing deed while in Mongolia.\n\nMongolian courts enforce Mongolian copyright law, US courts enforce US copyright law. Therefore you first have to decide what country you plan to sue in (from the plaintiff's perspective).",

The reason for the latter distinction is [somewhat complicated](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/coroner/newyork.html), but not terribly relevant here since New York City has abolished coroners in 1918, according to Wikipedia, although other New York \\[State] counties might not have done that.)\n\nSo, how can one legally dispute that finding of suicide recorded on the death certificate in New York City, in particular?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Here is the section](https://nycadmincode.readthedocs.io/t17/c02/) of NYC law on the medical examiner. \u00a717\\-207 provides for a \"Root cause analysis\", in case there is a \"significant event\". A significant event, as defined in that section, is where there is probably a technical screw\\-up in the office of chief medical examiner; the designated root cause analysis officer then develops guidelines for determining whether a significant event has occurred, then reporting, and other procedures. Then if it is determined that there was a screw\\-up, there shall be a report written, and this may get reported to the mayor or city council. Although there is no explicit statement therein about outsiders [filing a complaint](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/contact-doh.page), you can always file an administrative complaint, and the law does say that there shall not be any disclosure of the identity of \"any complainant, victim or decedent\".\n\nI assume the purpose of this complaint would be to force the medical examiner to change his report. If you simply just want to proffer an alternative claim, you can hire your own pathologists to make a different conclusion. One might care about the suicide / homicide distinction in case there was for instance an insurance policy that depended on the cause of death not being suicide. In which case, you would sue the insurance company, and the jury would look at the evidence for and against the suicide claim. As far as I can tell, there is no mechanism purporting to force the medical examiner to re\\-write his report and reach a different conclusion (the courts will not compel him to express a particular viewpoint).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In New York City, if a family disagrees with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner's finding of suicide, which of the following is the most accurate description of their legal options?\n\nA) They can directly petition the court to force the medical examiner to change the cause of death on the death certificate.\n\nB) They can file an administrative complaint that may trigger a \"Root cause analysis\" if a significant event is determined to have occurred.\n\nC) They can appeal to the Centers for Disease Control to overturn the medical examiner's decision.\n\nD) They have no legal recourse and must accept the medical examiner's determination as final.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most accurate option is B. According to the NYC law on the medical examiner, there is a provision for a \"Root cause analysis\" in case of a \"significant event,\" which could be triggered by an administrative complaint. While there's no explicit statement about outsiders filing complaints, the law does allow for complaints to be filed without disclosing the complainant's identity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the courts cannot compel the medical examiner to change their report or express a particular viewpoint.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Centers for Disease Control does not have the authority to overturn a local medical examiner's decision.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while families cannot force the medical examiner to change their report, they do have some legal options, including filing complaints and potentially pursuing legal action against insurance companies if the cause of death affects policy payouts.\n\nIt's important to note that families can also hire their own pathologists to reach a different conclusion, which could be used in potential legal proceedings, even if it doesn't change the official death certificate."

When I asked what ordinance I violated (this was info I wanted to pass on to my attorney if the need arose), the policeman had to think a minute and then said I was impeding traffic. (This was strange in and of itself \\- in my experience with this department, the officers always name the ordinance violation that they're investigating. He did not, I had to ask near the end of our conversation.) I told him that there were a number of cars parked the same way on the same street, in the direction he was heading once he left. I made it clear I was NOT complaining about those people, I just wanted to know why I was being singled out. He assured me they'd do a sweep of the street. (I have footage from the next 5 days of the street, and it was never cleared by the police of vehicles \\- I have it for day and night times.)\n\nWhen I went down the road to turn around and park the way he ordered me to, I saw the same officer going down the road, swerve around a much larger vehicle and keep going.\n\nI called the police department, and reported all this. His sergeant called me back and asked me three questions: if I was within 20 feet of a stop sign (nope), if I was in front of hydrant (none on that corner) and if I was as far off the road as possible (i.e., on the curb and yes, I was). He said he'd review the body cam footage and get back to me (he hasn't). I am willing to drop the issue, as long as I don't feel I'm being singled out. But the weird lack of sync between the policeman, who never raised any of the points his sergeant did, and his sergeant, along with the fact that the officer seemed to have trouble naming the ordinance of which I was supposedly in violation got me thinking: what happens when an officer can't name an ordinance or law that is supposedly broken, but either orders you to do something based on the supposed violation or tries to arrest you for the same? (This is in Louisiana.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It seems you found out what happened. The police are wrong all the time and usually absolutely nothing happens from it.\n\nThe police are not required to tell you why you are being arrested. See supreme court case Devenpeck v. Alford.

Alford established that police officers are not legally required to inform an arrestee of the reason for their arrest at the time it occurs. While it may be considered good police practice to do so, it is not a legal requirement. However, the police must be able to justify probable cause for the arrest to the court. This aligns with option C, which correctly states that officers are not required to tell the arrestee why they are being arrested, but must justify probable cause to the court."

Mierzwinski*, \\[1982] 1 SCR 860\\):\n\n> In summary, a lawyer\u2019s client is entitled to have all communications made with a view to obtaining legal advice kept confidential. Whether communications are made to the lawyer himself or to employees, and whether they deal with matters of an administrative nature such as financial means or with the actual nature of the legal problem, all information which a person must provide in order to obtain legal advice and which is given in confidence for that purpose enjoys the privileges attached to confidentiality. **This confidentiality attaches to all communications made within the framework of the solicitor\\-client relationship, which arises as soon as the potential client takes the first steps, and consequently even before the formal retainer is established.**\n\nWhile the judgment somewhat conflates the terminology of confidentiality and privilege, these are distinct concepts. Privilege is the right of the client. It is a rule of evidence and has a constitutional dimension that protects against state intrusion. The duty of confidentiality is imposed on practitioners by law society rules. *Desc\u00f4teaux* was in context clearly speaking about privilege and has been cited for this point related to privilege in many subsequent cases.

I tried to extract answers by posing some scenarios but that proved to be inefficient. So I am trying a new way here to get the answer of the questions in my head.\n\nI might have irritated some of you by now but trust me this question is really a proper question, so read it extremely carefully.\n\n**Two** types of EU family reunification are there\\-\\-\\-for direct family, and for extended family. It seems that extended family members have little legal weight for succeeding in an appeal in case their application is rejected (for whatever reason). BUT, I have found that whenever genuine applications for extended family members (as defined by EU law) have been refused, they eventually succeed in their appeal and the Court finally overturns the refusal and grants residence card.\n\nExamples: [UK case](https://sterling-law.co.uk/en/right-of-residence-granted-to-an-extended-family-member-of-eea-national-after-refusal-based-on-insufficient-evidence/)\nand [Ireland case](https://berkeleysolicitors.ie/minister-ruled-to-have-been-incorrectly-applying-eu-law-relating-to-membership-of-the-same-household/)\n\nIn both cases the Court eventually found **that the Minister wrongly refused residence application by stating that the evidence or documentation is insufficient** while it was actually more than sufficient. This means that either such Minsters are deliberately doing that or they are incompetent, but it is likely that the former will be the case most of the times.\n\nBut anyway there is at least a right to appeal, even though extended family members have weaker rights in the courtroom than direct family members. At least they can **reach** the courtroom and in my opinion, that is all what is required, as the Court will definitely overturn a decision by the Minister ***which was wrongful*** (note that wrongful means that genuine cases and proper documentation was refused for some or the other reason(s)).\n\nHow do the rights of direct and extended family members differ when genuine cases with proper documentation always win in the end (be it directly, or after an appeal)? Extended family has weaker rights, but how? All genuine cases eventually win like the examples I provided above (Minister wrongfully stated that evidence was insufficient and the Court very well overturned that). In what way then, extended family members have weaker rights than Direct family members?\n\nI know you would say that extended family do not have residence **as a right**, like direct family has, but that's not my point. My point is that although extended family members do not have it as their right, genuine cases always make their way into the EU. If the minister takes advantage of the fact that extended family does not have any legislative backing/support, and that their applications can be refused on whatever grounds they like, the minister wouldn't succeed in his mission as the Court would eventually overturn the wrong practice of not accepting genuine cases and proper evidence. So how does having a right differ from not having a right (direct vs extended) *when the final outcome is going to be the same for genuine cases with proper documentation/evidence?* **I am asking *how does it differ?***\n\n***PS***: It is also not the case that Courts couldn't help extended family members because they don't have any European legislation for them. My examples clearly demonstrate that Courts **do** overturn decisions of ministers **even though extended family has nothing** **as a right** in EU law *simply because the Court will undo the illogical and unlawful*. Moreover, in the Irish case above, it is interesting to further note:\n\n*\"The court does not consider that a approach by a decision\\-maker which amounts, in effect, to \u2018Put in an application, I will not tell you even at the most general level, not even by way of non\\-binding guidance, what type of material I am looking for, but I will let you know if I do not see it\u2019 is reasonable or entails fairness of procedure. It is unreasonable and unfair that the Minister should know what, at a general level, he is looking for when it comes to assessing applications generally, but will give no sense to applicants as to what it is that he is looking for, i.e. the unreasonableness/unfairness flows not from the Directive or the Regulations per se but from the closeted manner in which the Minister has elected to discharge his obligations to the detriment of applicants who, as a consequence of his approach, are unfailingly operating to some extent \u2018in the blind\u2019 when making an application such as that at issue here.\"*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The rights are different\n------------------------\n\nDirect family has an automatic right of residence \\- all they need to do is prove that they are direct family.\n\nExtended family has the additional obligation of proving hardship. In addition to proving their familial relationship they must also prove that they will suffer actual hardship if they remain where they are. Basically, that means that there are legitimate reasons that they are unable to earn a living commensurate with the standard in their home country not the \\[usually] better standard in the EU. For example, that they are unable to work because of age, disability or persecution.\n\nThe evidence for this hardship is subject to assessment by the decision maker to determine if the legal requirement has been met. In marginal cases, provided the decision maker has considered all the evidence and has arrived at a decision that a reasonable person could arrive at and has adequately explained their reasoning process *they are legally allowed to be wrong*.",

Option B is incorrect, as extended family members actually have weaker legal standing. Option C overstates the courts' role - they will not automatically overturn rejections if proper procedures were followed. Option D fails to acknowledge the real differences in rights and burdens of proof between the two categories, even if some genuine extended family cases may eventually succeed on appeal."

Options A and C are incorrect as they misrepresent how D's circumstances can be considered. Option D is incorrect as it oversimplifies the factors the jury can consider, ignoring that some circumstances beyond age and sex can be taken into account."

Before bringing a claim, the parties are expected to follow the [Practice Direction \u2013 Pre\\-action Conduct and Protocols](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct).\n\nIf there is a specific protocol, then you follow that; otherwise you follow the general one in the above link, pursuant to [Para. 1(2\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#1.1). A list of specific protocols can be found at [Para. 18](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#18.1) but note that this is slightly inaccurate and you should also check the list [here](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/protocol). If the debt is being pursued by a business against an individual then the [Pre\\-Action Protocol for Debt Claims](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/pdf/protocols/debt-pap.pdf) applies. I won't go into detail on the procedures themselves since you can read them directly in the links I've provided, other than to say that they do contain provisions relating to what information should be communicated between the parties prior to initiating proceedings. For example, under [Para. 6](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#6.1) of the general protocol:\n\n> The steps will usually include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the claimant writing to the defendant with concise details of the\n> claim. The letter should include the basis on which the claim is made,\n> a summary of the facts, what the claimant wants from the defendant,\n> and if money, how the amount is calculated;\n\nIf a party fails to comply with the applicable pre\\-action protocol, this does not affect the outcome of the case (i.e. whether they win and if so, what they are awarded). Instead, it gives the Court discretion to apply sanctions in relation to costs and interest. Under [Para. 16](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#13.1) of the general protocol:\n\n> The court will consider the effect of any non\\-compliance when deciding\n> whether to impose any sanctions which may include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) an order that the party at fault pays the costs of the\n> proceedings, or part of the costs of the other party or parties;\n> \n> \n> (b) an order that the party at fault pay those costs on an indemnity\n> basis;\n> \n> \n> (c) if the party at fault is a claimant who has been awarded a sum of\n> money, an order depriving that party of interest on that sum for a\n> specified period, and/or awarding interest at a lower rate than would\n> otherwise have been awarded;\n> \n> \n> (d) if the party at fault is a defendant, and the claimant has been\n> awarded a sum of money, an order awarding interest on that sum for a\n> specified period at a higher rate, (not exceeding 10% above base\n> rate), than the rate which would otherwise have been awarded.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In England and Wales, a law firm sends a letter of demand to an individual for an unpaid debt without any prior contact. The individual claims this violates proper debt collection procedures. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The law firm has clearly violated debt collection procedures, as they must make multiple attempts to contact the debtor before sending a letter of demand.\n\nB) The letter of demand is an acceptable first contact under the Pre-Action Protocol for Debt Claims, but the law firm may face sanctions if they didn't include all required information.\n\nC) The law firm's actions are entirely proper, and there are no specific requirements for debt collection procedures in England and Wales.\n\nD) The individual can have the case dismissed due to the law firm's failure to make prior contact attempts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, a letter of demand is typically the first contact in debt collection proceedings. The Pre-Action Protocol for Debt Claims applies when a business pursues a debt against an individual. While sending a letter of demand as first contact is acceptable, the protocol specifies certain information that should be included in this communication. If the law firm failed to include all required information, they may not have fully complied with the protocol. However, non-compliance doesn't automatically invalidate the claim or lead to dismissal. Instead, it may result in potential sanctions related to costs and interest at the court's discretion. Options A and C are incorrect because they misstate the requirements of the debt collection process. Option D is incorrect because failure to comply with pre-action protocols does not lead to automatic dismissal of the case."

In general, it is fine to use trademarks to refer to the products trademarked, provided that a reasonable person would not be confused about who creates or provides the product, and would not think that the trademark holder has endorsed, authorized, or sponsored the book or other product that refers to the trademark.\n\nIt is common to include a disclaimer stating that trademarks are owned by specific parities, and the author or publisher is not claiming them, nor claiming any endorsement or affiliation. Such a disclaimer makes the nominative function of the trade mark use clearer, and would make it harder for the trademark owner to prevail in an infringement suit. \n\nSee [This law.se question and answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39072/what-is-trademark-tarnishment-or-dilution-under-us-law) for more info.",

This scenario falls under the principle of nominative use. Authors can use trademarked names to refer to specific products or companies in their books, as long as it's done in a way that doesn't confuse readers about who owns the trademarks or imply any endorsement or affiliation. It's common practice to include a disclaimer stating that trademarks belong to their respective owners and that the author/publisher isn't claiming ownership or association. This approach allows authors to discuss relevant technologies and companies while respecting trademark laws.\n\nOption A is incorrect because obtaining permission for every trademarked term would be impractical and unnecessary under nominative use. Option B is too permissive and doesn't acknowledge the need for careful use of trademarks. Option D is overly cautious and would significantly reduce the book's usefulness and clarity."

I think I did some community service and the case is now sealed.\n\nWhen submitting my background application, if it says \"have you ever been convicted or arrested?\", should I say yes or no?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One answer is that you should say \"yes\", because it is a [federal felony](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) (5 years prison term) to say \"no\", because it is untrue, and you know it is untrue. This assumes that the question simply asks \"Have you ever been convicted or arrested; please explain\", with no qualifiers like \"as an adult\".\n\nIf you are absolutely positive that the record was sealed, an alternative answer is \"no\", based on a law like [RCW 13\\.50\\.260(6\\)(a)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.50.260), which say you can legally \"act as if it didn't happen\":\n\n> If the court enters a written order sealing the juvenile court record\n>  pursuant to this section, it shall, subject to RCW 13\\.50\\.050(13\\),\n>  order sealed the official juvenile court record, the social file, and\n>  other records relating to the case as are named in the order.\n>  Thereafter, the proceedings in the case shall be treated as if they\n>  never occurred, and the subject of the records may reply accordingly\n>  to any inquiry about the events, records of which are sealed.\n\nCalifornia has a [similar law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=781.&lawCode=WIC). The problem here is that this is state law, so a valid defense for a state charge of lying, but you need to comply with federal law, and states cannot tell the FBI what to do. It is variously rumoured that the FBI does not report sealed records, but it is unwise to count on rumours, and even if it is general discretionary policy for them to delete information about sealed records when reported from the state, it is not guaranteed that the policy is absolutely always followed. You can request an [Identity History Summary Check](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks) from the FBI.\n\nSo the safest path is to get an informed opinion, tailored to your facts, from your attorney.",

The background check application asks, \"Have you ever been convicted or arrested?\" What is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Answer \"No\" because the case was sealed and California law allows treating sealed juvenile records as if they never occurred.\n\nB) Answer \"Yes\" and provide a full explanation of the juvenile incident, including the sealing of the record.\n\nC) Consult with an attorney before answering the question to ensure compliance with both state and federal laws.\n\nD) Answer \"No\" and hope that the FBI doesn't report sealed juvenile records.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While it may be tempting to answer \"No\" based on California state law regarding sealed juvenile records, this approach carries risks when dealing with federal agencies. Answering \"Yes\" and providing a full explanation is honest but may not be necessary if the record is truly sealed. The safest course of action is to consult with an attorney who can provide advice tailored to the specific situation, considering both state and federal laws.

I am asking this question because I am getting worried that my Australian citizenship might be revoked. The source of my worries is that I vaguely remember reading an article saying something like, \"Those who obtain Australian citizenship merely for convenience of travel and do not intend to permanently live in Australia can be stripped of their Australian citizenship.\" I read that article many years ago and am unable to find it now.\n\nI did research on the Internet, but have been unable to find a definite answer. On the one hand, I found no mentions whatsoever of people stripped of Australian citizenship just for a long period of absence from Australia, and I found no mentions of any requirements to stay in Australia in order to retain Australian citizenship. On the other hand, there seems to be a legal avenue to strip people like me of Australian citizenship: I recall that I had to explicitly confirm in my citizenship application that I intended to permanently reside in Australia, and I am afraid that moving to Europe from Australia just a couple of weeks after getting Australian citizenship might be seen as strong evidence that I lied about my intent to permanently reside in Australia. Many sources on the Internet say that Australian citizenship can be revoked in cases of false or misleading information in the citizenship application.\n\nThe actual reason for moving to Europe was that I had a good job offer from there, had been struggling already for about half a year to find a good job in Australia, did not want to take a low\\-skilled job like a salesperson at Coles or have a long unemployment gap in my CV, and was running out of my savings. I never had plans to permanently reside in Europe, and I accepted the European offer just to avoid a long interruption of my career as a highly skilled worker, to fix my finances, and to buy some time to figure out how to develop my career further.\n\nIt is very important to me to retain Australian citizenship, especially given that my career prospects in Europe do not look good and that I am unlikely to get a permanent residence permit in Europe in the foreseeable future. I have retained citizenship of my country of origin, so I am a dual citizen, but my country of origin is a poorly developed country whose cultural values I do not share, and I do not want to end up living there at all. I consider Australia my home, so to speak.\n\nSo I would be very thankful for any information regarding my question stated in the title of this post.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not normally\n------------\n\nThe loss of citizenship is dealt with in Part 2 Division 3 of the Citizenship Act 2007\\.

What kind? When was the last time you have been in an accident? These are also highly personal but may have tangential relevance.\n\nIs an attorney permitted to ask questions like those in either paragraphs two and three? Is the witness allowed to decline to answer such questions for reason of irrelevance, or other grounds?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is an attorney permitted to ask questions like those in either paragraphs two and three?\n\nYes. That does not mean that they will be considered relevant or even appropriate, though.\n\n> Is the witness allowed to decline to answer such questions for reason of irrelevance, or other grounds?\n\nYes. In general, though, it would be safer for the witness to state an objection (be it on the basis of irrelevance, confrontational, asked \\& answered, *as to form*, etc.) and answer the question nonetheless, rather than simply refusing to answer it. By simply declining to answer a question regardless of the basis for refusal, the witness risks affording a crooked lawyer the opportunity to *falsely generalize* that the witness was uncooperative.\n\nOne exception to the idea of \"object\\-and\\-then\\-answer\" is where some privilege is the alleged basis for the objection, since the substance of the answer could be such that it amounts to waiving the privilege even where that privilege is legitimate.\n\nThe witness may also opt to answer the lawyer's irrelevant questions even without stating an objection. Some questions are so obviously irrelevant, dull, or stupid that a failure to raise an objection will be inconsequential. In such scenarios, raising objections can only lengthen the deposition transcript and make it harder to read.\n\nFor a real\\-life example of deposition with plenty of dull questions, take a look at the transcript (which I split in parts [one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYVnJGUGJhem1ReDQ), [two](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYem1wTVF2WUxlQjA) and [three](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYNHk1ZE9qRkg3X2c)) of the 4\\-hour deposition where I myself was the witness (you can download the case file, almost in its entirety, from [this page](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html)).\n\nYou will notice that I did not raise objections during the deposition, the main reason being what I explained above: To avoid giving the opposing counsel an opportunity to falsely accuse me in court of being uncooperative during deposition.\n\nFurthermore, addressing the crook's futile questions (1\\) projects transparency and helps on the witness's part, and (2\\) precludes a false \\& misleading impression as if the witness had something to hide. After all, wrongdoers are the ones most interested in eluding testimony in ways very similar to [this other deposition](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYcGI1cFN6TGJqTWs).\n\nThe reason of being of objections is precisely that the law \"is aware\" that, as a matter of fact, lawyers indulge in all kinds of abusive questions when taking sworn testimony \\-\\-be it in trial or at deposition\\-\\- of a witness.",

This approach allows the witness to voice concerns about irrelevant questioning while still appearing cooperative. It prevents giving the opposing counsel an opportunity to falsely claim the witness was uncooperative. Refusing to answer or only answering directly related questions could be seen as evasive, while answering all questions without objection fails to establish a record of the witness's concerns about irrelevant questioning."

According to the case law provided, specifically United States v. Hart and United States v. Ramos, courts have explicitly ruled that there is no materiality requirement for false statements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542.

Option B is incorrect because courts have consistently interpreted the statute as not having a materiality requirement, rather than including one. Option C is incorrect because while 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1425 has been interpreted to have a materiality requirement, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 has been explicitly interpreted not to have such a requirement."

In D.C. v Heller, the Supreme Court interpreted the Second Amendment as protecting an individual's right to possess and carry firearms. The Court defined \"keep arms\" as having weapons in one's possession, and \"bear arms\" as carrying weapons for the purpose of confrontation or self-defense.

The Second Amendment, as explained in Heller, protects against infringement of the right to keep and bear arms, but does not explicitly grant a right not to bear arms or prohibit laws mandating gun ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, it does not explicitly guarantee a right not to bear arms.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Heller specifically rejected the interpretation that \"keep and bear Arms\" only applies to militia service, instead affirming it as an individual right.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Second Amendment does not contain any language explicitly forbidding laws that require gun ownership.

Or maybe this report is a summary based on many evidence, but anyway, final result of expert conclusion \"probability that Bill was killed by John is 80%.\"\n\nLet's say expert is very professional, experienced and nobody has doubt about his competence and etc. Everybody trust this expert.\n\nWhat is the correct verdict in this case?\n\nIf 80% is not enough to establish guilt, what should the number be?

On shooting range was 3 persons, John, Bill and James. John and James shot from the gun at the same time and Billed was killed accidentally, unintentionally. They had the same guns and bullet was not found and they cannot determine exactly who's bullet actually killed the Bill. Let's assume that it was proven, that for both John and James it was criminal negligence. Somebody definitely have to go to jail.

Jurymen themselves set the standard of what is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nAnd they further said that judges should:\n\n> adhere to and not to attempt needless explanations of the classical statement of the nature of the onus of proof resting on the Crown.\n\nThat is: \"beyond reasonable doubt\" means what that particular jury decides that it means and any judge who tries to clarify it beyond that is setting up an appeal for whichever side loses.\n\nThis is reflected in the [NSW Supreme Court's Criminal Trials Bench Book](https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/criminal/summing_up_format.html) (essentially a crib sheet for judges):\n\n> Let me now say something to you about the onus of proof. This is, as you have already been told more than once, a criminal trial of a most serious nature and the burden of proof of guilt of the accused is placed on the Crown. That onus rests upon the Crown in respect of every element of the charges. There is no onus of proof on the accused at all. It is not for the accused to prove \\[his/her/their] innocence but for the Crown to prove \\[his/her/their] guilt and to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.\n> \n> \n> It is, and always has been, a critical part of our system of justice that persons tried in this court are presumed to be innocent, unless and until they are proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This is known as the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d. **This expression \u201cproved beyond reasonable doubt\u201d is an ancient one.** It has been deeply ingrained in the criminal law of this State for almost two hundred years and **it needs no explanation from trial judges.**\n> \n> \n> The Crown does not have to prove, however, every single fact in the case beyond reasonable doubt. The onus which rests upon the Crown is to prove the elements of the charges beyond reasonable doubt and I shall subsequently outline to you the elements of the charges.\n> \n> \n> In a criminal trial there is only one ultimate issue. Has the Crown proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt? If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, the appropriate verdict is \u201cGuilty\u201d. If the answer is \u201cNo\u201d, the verdict must be \u201cNot guilty\u201d.\n\nYour examples\n-------------\n\nThe jury in each particular case will consider the evidence that has been put forward and either accept it as true or not true (or some of it as true and some of it as not true).

Judges are advised not to provide additional explanations or attempt to quantify the standard. The NSW Supreme Court's Criminal Trials Bench Book emphasizes that this expression is deeply ingrained in criminal law and needs no further explanation from trial judges. The jury is tasked with considering the evidence, deciding what to accept as true, and determining if the prosecution has proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on their own understanding of that standard in the context of the specific case."

I realize that this is, in practice, highly unlikely to happen. But I seek to understand to what extend that the could theoretically apply to such a large crowd.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I am aware that American law has a concept of each member of a group being jointly responsible for the actions of other members of the group\n\nThis is much too broadly stated to be accurate. There is no general law of group responsibility in the US.\n\nUnder US law, when a group of people agree to do something jointly that is illegal, or using illegal means, they can all be charged with [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal)), and the acts of one used in the trial of another. But it must be proven that an accused knowingly jointed in the conspiracy to convict that accused person. See [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 371](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371)\n\nWhen [one person assists another to commit a crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accomplice), in any of various ways, a charge of \"accessory\" or of \"aiding and abetting\" or of \"being an accomplice\" can be brought. But this will again involve proof that the accused knew that the conduct involved was criminal.\n\nWhere a person commits or tries to commit a felony, alone or as part of a group, and a death results, the person can be charged with [felony murder](https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/felony-murder/). A classic example is where an armed bank robbery occurs and one of the robbers is shot and killed by a guard. Each of the robbers may be charged with felony murder, even if none if them knew or intended that anyone be harmed or killed. But the felony must be one of a limited list provided by statute. The federal statute is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1111](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111) which limits the crimes that can trigger the rule to \"arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery\". The [DC code \u00a7 22\u20132101](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-2101.html) limits the rule to\n\n> arson, as defined in \u00a7 22\\-301 or \u00a7 22\\-302, first degree sexual abuse, first degree child sexual abuse, first degree cruelty to children, mayhem, robbery, or kidnaping, ... any housebreaking while armed with or using a dangerous weapon, or ... a felony involving a controlled substance\n\nOnly a person who could be shown to have been committing or attempting one of the listed felonies could be charged with felony murder.\n\nMerely \"being part of the crowd around the capital\" would not provide grounds to charge anyone with felony murder, and to charge someone as accomplice to murder it would need to be shown that the accused intended someone to be killed. It might be that some few of the intruders could be charged with felony murder, depending on the exact facts, but probably most could not.\n\nSee also [What are the legal violations and criminal penalties likely to be for the protesters that entered the Capitol on January 6, 2021?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59953/what-are-the-legal-violations-and-criminal-penalties-likely-to-be-for-the-protes)",

The felony murder rule, as defined in both federal (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1111) and DC (DC code \u00a7 22\u20132101) statutes, allows for murder charges when a death occurs during the commission of specific felonies.

Trademarks generally protect the use of a term within the specific area of commerce in which it's being used. In this case, energy drinks are far removed from the video game industry and the fictional alien species context.\n\nOption B could be seen as infringing because it uses the name in a similar context (alien race in a science fiction setting) as the original trademark. Option C directly uses the name for game characters, which is very close to the original use and likely to cause confusion. Option D, while not a video game, still uses the name in an entertainment context related to space themes, which could be seen as related to the original use.\n\nThe energy drink (Option A) is in a completely different market and unlikely to be confused with the video game's alien species, making it the least likely to be considered trademark infringement."

This would alter the legal obligations of the remaining tenants without their consent.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while Shelter can provide advice, they do not have legal authority to facilitate the removal of a tenant from a joint tenancy.

Or do I need to achieve some particular level of security?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not illegal to post *your own* files where others can easily download or share them on your own server or a public website.

According to the documentation, to legally serve copyrighted material that belongs to others, you need to have explicit permission or a license from the copyright holders. This requirement is independent of the security measures implemented on the server. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because password protection alone does not grant legal rights to store or share copyrighted material without permission. \n\nAnswer B is partially correct about storage but incorrect about sharing. While personal storage might be overlooked, any form of sharing without permission is still illegal.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because implementing security measures similar to Dropbox does not bypass the need for proper permissions or licenses from copyright holders. Dropbox itself requires users to comply with copyright laws and doesn't allow sharing of copyrighted material without proper rights.\n\nThe level of security implemented on the server is a separate issue from the legal right to store and distribute copyrighted material.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Here's what I witnessed some time ago: \n\nThere is a large ground level chess set set at an outdoor mall, with squares about 2x2 feet and pieces 2\\-3 feet high, about 5 lbs each. This chess set is usually used by small kids, 2\\-5 year old, who move the large chess pieces, make around themselves, pretend to ride the horses, etc. \n\nOne day a much bigger kid, 10 year old or so, apparently elated by the lack of supervision, ran into that chess playground, and started throwing the 5 lbs chess pieces with force across the chess set in random directions, sometimes missing the toddlers by inches. The thrown pieces would sometime bump the other pieces around the toddlers, sometime miss a toddler's head or leg by inches, etc. This lasted for at least 5 min.\n\nAnd in those 5 min of quite dangerous bombardment not a single adult would attempt to restrain the minor. Some parents would take their toddlers out of the chess board games despite their protests; some would get closer to their kids within the chess board while watching the 10\\-yo, apparently with intent to intercept a chess piece if it would fly at their kid; some adults would just watch what's happening from the benches. And nobody would interfere with the apparently dangerous youth, not physically, and not even verbally.\n\nI gathered from the conversations nearby that the adults were just afraid to restrain the youth for the fear of being accused later that they were doing something illegal against the minor. The parents were more afraid to be branded abusers of that child than of the physical harm said child would do to their own kids.\n\nThus the question: how realistic where their fears in the state of California? If an adult physically restrains a child and claims that the child was a danger to others can the adult have legal problems?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If an adult had physically restrained the miscreant brat, they could be sued for / charged with battery (which does not mean \"beating up\", per [Cal Penal 242](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=240-248), it is the \"willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another\". In either case, there is a defense that can be mounted, the \"defense of others\" defense, to the effect that the person had a reasonable belief that it was necessary to prevent physical harm to others. Which means, the jury would imagine themselves in that situation and guess how likely it is that someone might get hurt. Lofting 5 lb chess pieces at a 2 year old *could* poke out an eye, especially since they haven't learned to duck at that age \u2013 however, I question (as would an opposing attorney) the characterization \"quite dangerous\". At any rate, it would depend on the level of danger posed. There is also a \"proportionality\" requirement for the defense of others defense: \"The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger\" (CalCrim instruction 3470\\). The battery might not have been necessary, since simply getting between the criminal and his victims could have been sufficient. \n\nAs to whether there would actually be a lawsuit, that depends in part on the mind\\-set of the parents. Assuming that the level of force did not rise above simple bodily contact, it is unlikely that a jury would vote to convict / find liable, but certainly not impossible. If under those circumstances the results would not be in serious doubt, then it is unlikely that the person would be prosecuted (the prosecutor wouldn't bother with such a case). We may also assume that a decent attorney would persuade the offended parent\\-client that it is not a good use of their money to pursue he matter. Still, the risk is not negligible, since you don't know whether you'll have bad luck with the jury, or whether the child suffers from eggshell skull syndrome and *then* you would be is serious trouble. I don't think the fears are unrealistic, though they may be improbable, and they could be definitive for people who live in fear.",

However, they could mount a legal defense using the \"defense of others\" argument. This defense requires that the person had a reasonable belief that their action was necessary to prevent physical harm to others, and that they used no more force than was reasonably necessary. The success of this defense would depend on factors such as the level of danger posed and the proportionality of the force used. While this approach carries some legal risk, it is not automatic conviction (as in A), nor is it completely free from legal consequences (as suggested in C and D). The correct answer acknowledges both the potential legal risk and the possible defense."
