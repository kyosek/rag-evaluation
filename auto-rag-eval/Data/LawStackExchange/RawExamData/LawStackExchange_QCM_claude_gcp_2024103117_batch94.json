The usual means are to demonstrate motive, means, and opportunity. All those weight against the defendant.\n\nThe \"standard\" defense is to dispute one or more elements of the foregoing. But in this instance, the defense attorney uses an \"indirect\" defense; that Z had similar means, motive and opportunity to do the deed, thereby casting \"reasonable doubt\" on Y's guilt.\n\nThe prosecution objects: \"Z is not on trial here, only Y.\"\n\nWhat are the canons of trial law that govern how far the defense can go to \"put Z on trial\" in order to defend Y? (Let's say that Z is the prosecution's star witness, but someone who might have been given immunity in exchange for testimony against Y.) Or is it a matter that is largely left to the discretion of the judge?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Offering up evidence that another person committed a crime is a standard and accepted, although rare, criminal defense strategy.\n\nIt is mostly not used very much because most crimes for which defendants are charged were not committed by somebody else, and because most innocent defendants lack the investigative and economic resources to identify enough information about another potential suspect to present such a case credibly.\n\nThe defense would have to articulate to the judge that the reason for offering up evidence about Z is to support Y's theory of the case that Z and not Y committed the crime, in order to overcome a relevance objection. But, the defendant had wide latitude to do so in order to create a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.\n\nIn most circumstances, it would be a reversible abuse of discretion to prevent the defendant from introducing evidence to support a theory of this kind.\n\nA similar strategy, for example, was recently used in [a preliminary hearing in a case involving a high profile murder in Colorado](https://arkvalleyvoice.com/suzanne-morphew-murder-to-proceed-to-trial-barry-morphew-bail-set-at-500000/) where a man stands accused to murdering his wife (the man is Barry Morphew) has developed a theory that his wife was murdered by someone else based in part, for example, on the evidence of unidentified DNA near the murder scene allegedly associated with previous crimes in DNA databases.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal trial where the defendant Y is accused of murdering X, the defense attorney wants to present evidence suggesting that Z, the prosecution's star witness, actually committed the crime. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal principles governing this situation?\n\nA) The defense is strictly prohibited from presenting evidence about Z, as only Y is on trial.\n\nB) The defense may present evidence about Z, but only if Z has not been granted immunity by the prosecution.\n\nC) The defense has wide latitude to present evidence about Z as an alternative suspect, as long as it's relevant to creating reasonable doubt about Y's guilt.\n\nD) The prosecution's objection that \"Z is not on trial here\" is typically sufficient to prevent the defense from presenting evidence about Z.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In criminal trials, the defense has considerable latitude to present evidence supporting alternative theories of the crime, including evidence suggesting that someone else (in this case, Z) committed the offense. This strategy is known as an \"alternative suspect\" or \"third-party culpability\" defense. \n\nThe key points supporting this answer are:\n\n1. It's a standard and accepted (though rare) defense strategy to offer evidence that another person committed the crime.\n2. The defense would need to articulate to the judge that the evidence about Z is relevant to Y's theory of the case.\n3. Courts generally allow wide latitude for defendants to present evidence that might create reasonable doubt.\n4. Preventing a defendant from introducing such evidence could be considered a reversible abuse of discretion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the defense is not strictly prohibited from presenting evidence about alternative suspects.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the granting of immunity to a witness doesn't necessarily prevent the defense from presenting evidence about that person as an alternative suspect.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the prosecution's objection alone is not typically sufficient to prevent the defense from presenting relevant evidence about an alternative suspect.\n\nThe judge has some discretion in determining the admissibility and extent of such evidence, but generally must allow the defense to present its case if the evidence is relevant to creating reasonable doubt about the defendant's guilt."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51700/at-what-point-do-you-become-culpable-for-the-content-of-packages-addressed-to-yo", "docs_id": 51700, "title": "At what point do you become culpable for the content of packages addressed to you in the mail?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If someone was to address and mail a package to me that included something that was prohibited where I live either because I requested it or alternatively because they decided to for some reason unknown to me (gift, attempt to frame me, my address is accessible to truly intended recipient,... ).

Taking [Washington drug laws](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=69.50&full=true) as an example, the numerous prohibitions generally start \"It is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally...\". If you requested it, you are intentionally in possession. If someone sent it to you without your knowledge, you didn't knowingly or intentionally possess it, but after you open the package and see that it is a controlled substance, then you are knowingly in possession. In that case, you are expected to notify the police that you're received something against the law to possess, but of course there could be a couple of minute lag between your realization and you getting the police on the phone. There is no statutory provision to the effect that you have 5 minutes from the point of discovery to call the police, instead, the jury would consider whether you were making reasonable efforts to inform authorities of the crime and become *not* in possession of the illegal goods. The grayness resides in how much time can elapse between discovery and arrival of the police, who relieve you of possession, and depends on circumstances (The first question would be, why didn't you call right away?)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John receives a package addressed to him containing illegal drugs, which he did not order or expect.

In the United States, possession of illegal substances is the key factor in determining criminal liability. Once John opens the package and becomes aware of its contents, he is technically in knowing possession of illegal drugs. The best course of action is to immediately contact law enforcement to report the situation. This demonstrates that John had no intent to possess the drugs and is actively trying to resolve the situation legally.\n\nOption A is incorrect because by resealing and returning the package, John would still be in knowing possession of illegal drugs and could be seen as attempting to distribute them.\n\nOption B is problematic because it extends the period of knowing possession without taking action, which could be interpreted as intent to keep the drugs.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially illegal, as disposing of the drugs could be seen as attempting to destroy evidence or conceal a crime.\n\nBy choosing option C, John takes immediate action to inform authorities, which is the best way to protect himself from potential criminal charges in this situation."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59073/what-limitations-can-be-placed-on-the-activities-of-shell-companies", "docs_id": 59073, "title": "What limitations can be placed on the activities of &quot;shell&quot; companies?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to Wikipedia, one of the reasons for using a [shell company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation) is that \"Shell companies can be used to transfer assets from one company into a new one, while leaving the liabilities in the former company.\" My understanding, from a response to an earlier question, is that this much is legal.\n\nBut suppose the assets have been pledged as collateral for liabilities, and there are contracts governing this process. If shell companies are used to \"shuffle assets\" between, say companies A, B, and C, so that the assets and liabilities are separated, is this still legal? Or can these transactions be \"collapsed\" so that one combined company has ownership of both assets and liabilities and the contracts that govern them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a company transfers out so much of its assets that it is left insolvent at the end of the transaction, without receiving substantially equivalent value in exchange, outside some very isolated circumstances where substantially equivalent value is conclusively determined to be present as a matter of law (e.g. certain auctions), the transaction is a \"fraudulent transfer\" and the transferor and transferee can be held liable as a result under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act present in every U.S. state, and under parallel provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nSometimes, this can apply even when the liabilities don't arise until after the asset has been transferred out, when the liability is foreseeable and the company is undercapitalized.\n\nOften this kind of situation can also give rise to liability on a piercing the corporate veil or \"alter ego\" theory against the owners of the company, or to liability imposed on directors and/or officers of the company for making distributions or transfers of assets that render a company insolvent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: XYZ Corp, facing financial difficulties, decides to transfer its valuable assets to a newly created shell company, leaving behind significant liabilities in the original company.

This scenario describes a classic case of a fraudulent transfer, which is illegal under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act adopted by all U.S. states. When a company transfers assets without receiving substantially equivalent value in return, leaving itself insolvent, it's considered a fraudulent transfer. Both the transferor (XYZ Corp) and the transferee (the shell company) can be held liable. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because this strategy is not legal and has significant potential repercussions.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct about the importance of compensation, but even with market value compensation, if the transfer leaves the original company insolvent, it could still be considered fraudulent.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because creditors have more options than just suing the shell company.

Firstly, such an announcement is very likely to be protected by the First Amendment regardless of whether the announcement is made by the President or by any other person, because making an announcement is clearly a form of speech. In some cases, there might be concerns that a particular invention implicates the national security of the United States, in which case disclosure of the invention is unlawful (see [35 USC 181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181)), but the President [can unilaterally declassify anything](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/), so under [35 USC 187](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/187), the President is very likely exempt from the entire secrecy law altogether. Obviously, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea for the President to ignore the national security implications, but they have the legal power to do so if they wish.\n\nThere are also serious questions about the Constitutionality of 35 USC 181, because it constitutes a prior restraint on speech, and prior restraints are nearly always unconstitutional under well\\-established Supreme Court precedent. See particularly *United States v. Progressive*, which frustratingly never reached a firm conclusion on a closely\\-related issue, due to the government dropping the case. Nevertheless, there is a colorable legal argument that even national security considerations are not an adequate basis to impose a prior restraint on specific people in this fashion. If this argument is correct, then anyone can announce the invention of anything they like, President or not.\n\nAs to whether the President can patent it, it depends on whether they received federal funding to conduct the research, or did it on their own time and with their own money. If they did it on their own time, then the answer appears to be \"yes, they can patent it,\" as far as I can tell. If they did it with federal assistance, then [complicated rules apply](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/part-II/chapter-18) to protect the national interests of the United States.\n\nAs far as conflicts of interest are concerned, the normal way to deal with this problem is to put all of the President's assets (held before they were elected) into a [blind trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_trust), which might or might not then proceed to liquidate and/or diversify the President's portfolio in order to further distance it from any specific company or industry's interests. By design, the President should neither know nor control how, when, and whether that diversification happens.\n\nIt's not common for the President to invent something world\\-changing while in office, because the presidential office is already more than a full\\-time job. As a result, any specific discussion of how this problem would be solved will necessarily be somewhat speculative. I imagine that the President would proceed to create a corporation or other legal entity, give the patent to that entity, and then hand its ownership over to the President's pre\\-existing blind trust. But this is very much uncharted territory, and it's possible that the White House might come up with an alternative means of insulating the President from the conflict of interest. For example, they might form some sort of committee to formally advise the President and provide a paper trail of justifications for the President's actions with respect to their invention.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A sitting President of the United States invents a revolutionary clean energy technology in their spare time.

They can also patent inventions developed on their own time and with their own resources. However, to manage potential conflicts of interest, the typical procedure would be to transfer ownership of the patent to a blind trust that manages the President's assets.

Where are the pitfalls?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Giving advice on business or personal matters isn't legal advice. In this specific example it sounds like they have counsel in state already, the relative is not representing them as their attorney.\n\nGiving legal advice often isn't unlicensed practice of law. It could be though. If the lawyer was representing a client in court, taking them on as a client, accepting money for legal services, or preparing a motion it would be a problem.\n\nMany states offer reciprocity to lawyers licensed in some other states, or are part of the uniform bar exam. And if they are only covering federal law, like immigration it is typically not an issue. There is an exception for in house counsel, as the business is not harmed when an attorney practices outside of where they are licensed because they do so for the benefit of their employer, and they understand the risks. So it is possible to practice law legally in a state you were not originally licensed in some cases.\n\nMJP or UPL violations can be misdemeanors in the worst case. Unless a client was financially harmed, or there were other serious ethical breaches like a sexual relationship with a client, it is very rare for the bar to get involved.

While giving legal advice to a family member in another state where the lawyer is not licensed could potentially be considered unauthorized practice of law (UPL), the circumstances described present a low risk of disciplinary action. The lawyer is not charging for services, not representing the sibling in court, and not preparing legal documents. Additionally, the advice pertains to federal tax law, which is generally less restricted by state boundaries. However, there is still some risk, especially if the sibling suffers financial harm as a result of the advice. Answer A is too extreme, as UPL violations for informal family advice rarely result in severe disciplinary action.

However, copyright may be held by the person who hired the creator to create the work, that is, the work may be a \"work for hire\". In the US, this refers to \"a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment\". As you describe it, this is not a work for hire.

Copyright in the pictures *of* the relative might be jointly held by the relative and the person operating the camera. The creative (protected) elements include not just the act of pressing the button, it includes all sorts of setup stuff. Then the relative and the other person may hold joint copyright in the work. Since copyright is about protecting a person's creative work and it is unclear whether the operator contributed creatively to the work, it's impossible to say whether certain of those pictures are \"Copyright Relative and Anonymous\". If I hand a person my camera and say \"Take a picture of me\", that doesn't constitute the kind of creativity on my part that is protected by copyright law (whereas a more detailed description of what should be the camera angle relative to the rock and the sun etc. would involve requisite creativity).

Copyright is generally held by the person who creates the work, which includes not just the act of pressing the shutter button, but also the creative elements involved in setting up the shot. In this scenario, the photographer has contributed significant creative input by arranging the scene, props, lighting, and composition. The assistant's role of simply pressing the button when instructed does not typically constitute enough creative input to warrant copyright ownership. \n\nThis aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v.

The photographer's creative contributions in this case would likely be considered sufficient to establish sole copyright ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely pressing the button doesn't typically confer copyright. Option C could be considered in some cases of joint creative input, but given the scenario described, the assistant's role is minimal.

Obviously records to be maintained for ccpa should be separate given the format and laws .\nSecondly for gdpr there is an obligation tell about E.U. authorities that in my non lawyer knowledge is not required for ccpa .\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not an either\u2013or. You may have certain rights under both CCPA and GDPR, but they have rather different mechanisms for determining their scope.\n\n**When does the CCPA apply?**\n\nCCPA applies to certain businesses and consumers. It covers any business (regardless of legal structure) that that does business in the State of California and has a certain scale. A consumer means a natural person who is a California resident.\n\nThese aspects are not influenced by your current location. When you as a California resident travel to the EU, you still have all your CCPA rights against businesses that do business in California. You do not have any CCPA rights against businesses that don't do business in California, for example a national rail company in the EU you've bought a train ticket for.\n\n**When does the GDPR apply?**\n\nWhereas the location of the user/data subject can be a factor in the GDPR context, their residency or nationality does not.\n\nThe GDPR applies to all processing activities by data controllers who are established in the EU, including any businesses, non\\-profits, and individuals. This includes processing activities in the context of an EU establishment of a non\\-EU company. For example, GDPR would apply with respect to processing of personal data by a hotel you're staying at in the EU.\n\nThe GDPR also applies to non\\-EU data controllers in the context of (a) offering goods or services to people who are in the EU, or (b) monitoring behaviour of people who are in the EU. Here, \u201coffering\u201d does not mean \u201cdoing business\u201d, but \u201ctargeting or marketing\u201d. For example, you might have installed a smartphone app that assists with sightseeing while in Paris. If this app monitors your behaviour while you are in the EU (such as by tracking your GPS position to alert you to nearby points of interest), that would fall under the GDPR while you are in the EU. The app may also fall under the GDPR per case (a) if it is marketed to / targeted at people who are currently in Paris.\n\nThat the GDPR applies in such cases comes from the offering/monitoring while you are in the EU, not from your continued presence in the EU. You would be able to exercise your GDPR rights relating to this processing even after leaving the EU.\n\nNote that some service or processing activity can fall under CCPA and GDPR simultaneously.\nFor example, this app would also fall under CCPA if the company also does business in California, e.g. if it also provides sightseeing information for Los Angeles or San Francisco.\nAnd both CCPA and GDPR could apply when an EU company does business in California.\n\n**Under which privacy law would a deletion request be dealt with?**\n\nIn practice, most companies don't have this sorted out properly and results are unpredictable. Ideally, a company would just comply with both laws simultaneously, thus making it unnecessary to determine which law applies. Information that is only required under on law can be provided with conditional statements, e.g. \u201cIf this processing activity is covered by GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country\u201d.\n\nAs mentioned above, both laws can apply simultaneously.

What are some exceptions for the Quiet Hours law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"Quiet Hours law\" is part of environmental protection laws: it regulates noise immissions. \n\nIn general, what is allowed differs quite a bit depending on zoning and day vs. night.  \n\nE.g. in a purely industrial area outdoor noise immission may be up to 70 dB(A) any time of the day. Whereas in hospital or nursing home zones only 45 dB(A) during the day and 35 dB(A) during the night are allowed.\n\nIt also depends on the type of noise source, e.g. construction noise has a longer night (20:00 \\- 7:00 compared to 22:00 \\- 6:00 for normal \"commercial\" noise sources) and some penalty for early/late day noise, commercial noise has a penalty\\* for early/late daytime and sundays; sports noise has day, night and quiet hours and they differ working days vs. sundays and holidays. There are no legal limits on noise emitted by children (incl. kindergarden, playgrounds), but neighborhood noise (party) does have restrictions, and machine\\-emitted noise has further restrictions. \n\n\\* penalties: some of these regulations use [weighted sound pressure levels](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewerteter_Schalldruckpegel) that upweight certain particularly disturbing characteristics of the noise (information content of noise, particular tones sticking out, impulse\\-type\u00a0\\[sudden] noise, ...). \n\nFestivals and events are covered by the \n\n* \"recreational noise directive\" ([Freizeitl\u00e4rmrichtlinie](https://www.lai-immissionsschutz.de/documents/freizeitlaermrichtline_1503575715.pdf), state law) \n\n\t+ puts emphasis on communal planning as in don't put hospital and fair grounds or outdoor recreational swimming pool next to each other, keep some distance between the local skateboard ramp and residential housing.  \n\n\tAlso, the town market place (where fairs are held) would be an urban zone (or \"core\" zone) which has higher noise limits than a purely residential zone.\n\t+ Exceptions can be granted for rare (up to 18 days/year) events and festivals that are tightly bound to a particular location (\"hohe Standortgebundenheit\", e.g. [Kieler Woche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiel_Week), [Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest) or the annual village fair, but also \"moving\" festivals like the [Hessentag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessentag)) or socially adequate and accepted.  \n\n\tThese exceptions can include moving the night hours up to 2 hours (usually only for Friday or Saturday evenings or evenings before public holidays).\n\n\tThe higher the (expected) noise level and the more often, the more strictly the exception has to be evaluated. Also, not more than 2 weekends in a row are supposed to be subject to such rare events, and the neighboring residents have to be told (usually \\>\\= 2 weeks in advance).\n\n\tThere are also technical measures such as focusing sound on the festival area and making sure loud speakers do not emit sound in other directions more than necessary.\n* \"sports grounds noise directive\" ([Sportanlagenl\u00e4rmschutzverordnung](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bimschv_18/BJNR015880991.html))\n\n\t+ again, higher immission levels are allowed for rare events, rare being up to 18 days/year\n\t+ exceptions can be granted for sports events of major national or international importance, so when the soccer world cup came to Germany, residents had to put up with that.\n* sometimes exceptions are granted by directive, e.g. [public viewing during the 2018 soccer world cup](https://www.bmu.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Download_PDF/Laermschutz/wm_2018_laermschutz_bf.pdf)\n* Pubs are commercial businesses and subject to the [TA L\u00e4rm](http://www.verwaltungsvorschriften-im-internet.de/bsvwvbund_26081998_IG19980826.htm), but sometimes somewhat less strict rules be used (e.g. [see here for NRW](https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Broschueren/laermschutz_in_biergaerten.pdf)). A pub thus cannot be in a *purely* residential zone: where you have a pub, you are at least in a general residential zone which has higher noise limits.  \n\nDiskotheken (night clubs) are often in industrial zones.\n* A private party is so\\-called neighborhood noise (Nachbarschaftsl\u00e4rm) and imission here is governed by [state law, plus possibly communal bylaws and last but not least binding clauses in e.g. the rent contract](https://www.mietrecht.com/ruhezeiten/).\nIf there isn't any particular law (AFAIK, e.g. Hesse does not have a state law on this), there's the catch\\-all [\u00a7117 OWiG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/englisch_owig.html#p0697) on Inadmissable Noise: \n\n> (1\\) Whoever, without a justified reason, or to an inadmissible extent, or to an extent avoidable under the circumstances, causes noise which is suitable to create considerable disturbance to the general public or to the neighbourhood, or to inflict harm upon the health of another, shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.\n\nA common rule of thumb would be that between 22:00 \\- 6:00 and on Sundays or holidays you shouldn't do anything that can be heard outside your flat ([Zimmerlautst\u00e4rke](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmerlautst%C3%A4rke)). \n\nA typical *practical* approach is to tell your neighbours that you'll have a party and will they please excuse if there's some noise?

Max copyrighted video length, Attribution,...etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fair Use\n--------\n\nFair use (in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") which is the only jurisdiction where it applies) is defined by [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). It does not matter whether the user is a formal educational institution nor not. It will matter whether the use is educational or not, but that alone will not determine whether a use is a fair use or not. There is no set limit of length below which a use is a fair use. In general the more of the source that is used, the less strong the case for fair use is, but in some cases the use of the entire source can be a fair use, and in others the use of even a small fraction has been held not to be a fair use.\n\nThat a use is on a Youtube channel does not determine whether it is a fair use or not.\n\n### The Four Factors\n\nThe actual law specifying the factors to consider reads:\n\n> The fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nCourt cases have said that no one of these factors is final \\- each must be considered. Some cases have emphasized one factor, some have emphasized another. In addition the law permits a court to consider other factors, not listed specifically in 17 USC 107\\.\n\n### The factors analyzed\n\nThe effect of the factors is, roughly:\n\nFactor (1\\) favors fair use when the use is for educational purposes. It also favors fair use when the use is not for profit. Note that this is not the same as no fee being charged. Profits made by advertising can also be considered. And a non\\-profit user may still charge a fee to cover costs.\n\nFactor (2\\) favors fair use when the original is basically factual, such as a textbook or a news report, and weighs against fair use when the original is a creative work, such as a work of fiction, a poem, or a song.\n\nFactor (3\\) favors fair use when only a small part of the original is used, and weighs against fair use when much or all of the original is used. There is **no** absolute standard for how much, either in terms of word count or duration, is allowable.\n\nFactor (4\\) favors fair use when the actual and potential market for the original is not harmed by the use. It weighs against fair use when the use might tend to reduce the paid market for the original. If an individual use would have only a minimal effect, but if many people were to make similar uses that would have a sizable negative effect on the market, that would weigh against fair use. If there is a potential market that is not being exploited currently, but which the copyright holder might exploit in future, and the use might harm such a potential market, that would weigh against fair use. In the use would tend to substitute for the original, so that people would be less likely to seek out the original, that would weigh against fair use.\n\nFair use cases often use the term \"transformative\". A use is transformative when it uses the work is a significantly different way from the original. For example, a poem may be published to cause an emotional effect on the readers. But a poetry text may use the verse as an example of a technique of poetic composition. That would be a transformative use. Being transformative is sometime thought of as a fifth factor, but more often as a way to analyze factor (1\\). In any case a transformative use is much more likely to be held to be a fair use.\n\nUS Registration\n---------------\n\nUnder current US law, any copyrightable work is protected teh moment it is \"fixed in tangible form\". This includes bein written down, and beign saved as a computer record, as well as an executed sculpture or pictorial work. (A copyright notice and Registration was required prior to 1978\\.) This matches the law in almost every other country.\n\nHowever, one must file for and obtain a certificate of registration before one can file suit in a US court for copyright infringement. In addition, unless one registers a work with the US copyright office before the infringement occurs, or within three months after the work is first published, certain rights under US law are forfeited. Specifically, the right to statutory damages, and the right to costs and attorney fees. Statutory damages can be assessed on proof of infringement, with no need to prove the amount of financial harm done or any profit by the infringer. They can range anywhere from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, or up to $150,000 if the infringement is found to be \"willful\".

Copyright law does not distinguish the various chronological states of a work as it is developed, whereby you might say that the text is really a series of 100 versions, each one being a derivative of the previous one. Instead, you have one whole work, the final product (the version of record). If you then want to recycle the text or graphics of that paper (beyond what is covered by fair use), you would need permission from the (new) rights\\-holder. You would need to scrutinize the language of the transfer agreement, but it is unlikely that any agreement also transfers copyright in earlier drafts, or elements of earlier drafts.\n\nIf an earlier version had a clearly different drawing which you also created, the courts would probably not find that you had transferred the rights to that drawing as part of the rights transfer of the version of record (assuming no explicit \"and all previous works\" clause). But if earlier versions had a minimally different drawing, it is reasonable to think that the courts would find distribution of that earlier image to be infringing. One of the main questions asked in an infringement case is whether the works are substantially similar. If your earlier version of the text has \"But\" where the published version has \"However\", the versions would be so substantially similar that the earlier version would be found to be infringing, despite not being a verbatim copy of the published version. The same goes for minor changes to drawings. The essential question, I think, is whether you have \"the same drawing\" versus \"a different drawing\", and I find it difficult to figure out where the bright lines are for substantial similarity in drawings.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An academic researcher publishes a paper in a journal, including a complex diagram composed of several line drawings arranged in a specific layout with arrows.

The data controller is the person or entity responsible for the data processing. They determine the purposes and means of this processing. A data processor merely performs data processing on the controller's behalf.\n\nThe processor must not process data for their own purposes, but can make low\\-level decisions about the means of processing. For example, a controller may specify the purpose of ensuring the security and integrity of the services, or the purpose of creating basic statistics. The processor might implement this in part through the means of keeping a logfile. Often, such purposes are agreed upon via a data processing agreement or the terms of service, leading to the legal fiction that the processor was instructed by the controller.\n\nIn your scenario, the controller is presumably not subject to the GDPR1, and therefore does not need a clear purpose or a legal basis for their processing activities. However, the EU\\-based data processor is bound by the GDPR, and can only process data as instructed by the controller. The processor has to comply with the GDPR with respect to *how* they carry out the processing activities, but the processing activities themselves don't have to be GDPR\\-compliant. Thus, it might be perfectly fine for an EU\\-based hosting provider to keep logfiles with IP addresses, even if those logfiles wouldn't be GDPR\\-compliant.\n\n1: Whether GDPR applies to a non\\-EU data controller depends not on whether processing occurs in the EU, but on whether the controller is offering goods or services to people in the EU, or observing behaviour of people in the EU \u2013 see Art 3(2\\) GDPR.\n\nThe cited guidelines continue to enumerate which provisions of the GDPR would still apply to EU processors working on behalf of non\\-EU data controllers (pages 12\u201313\\). These requirements are about how the controller and processor work together and relate to internal compliance of the data processor, but they do not affect the processing activities themselves.\n\nYou mention that you would link to the hosting provider's privacy policy and direct data subject requests to the hoster. This misunderstands the role of the data processor. The data controller is the single point of contact for data subjects. The data processor is not a data controller in this scenario. They cannot issue a privacy policy for the controller's processing activities, and cannot respond to data subject requests. Their only relationship is with the data controller. If the hosting provider were to post a privacy policy for these processing activities, they would act like a controller (possibly a joint controller) and could bring the processing activities within scope of the GDPR \u2013 not what you are intending.\n\nHowever, since GDPR does not apply to the processing activities in this scenario, the data subject rights in the GDPR do not apply. As far as GDPR is concerned, no privacy policy is needed and no data subject requests have to be answered. If the data processor receives such requests, their only obligation is to forward them to the controller, who can then handle them (possibly ignoring them).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner located outside the EU uses a hosting company with servers in the EU.

However, the EU-based hosting company, acting as a data processor, must comply with GDPR processor obligations regarding how they carry out processing activities. This includes internal compliance and how they work with the controller, but doesn't make the processing activities themselves subject to GDPR. The hosting company cannot act as a controller by issuing privacy policies or handling data subject requests directly.

So if the discretion vests solely in the President, she can state that she won\u2019t be doing X because *she can always change her mind*, however, discretion rarely vests solely in a single office.\n\nFor the example you cite, it\u2019s likely that a number of people down the line from the President have discretion and **telling** them what to do is likely unlawful (whether anyone would sue or who might have standing is another question).

While the President has authority to set policy priorities, they cannot simply order the non-enforcement of existing laws or override the discretionary authority of other executive branch officials.

In particular, using a volunteer workforce tends to exempt you from this under Sec 513(a)(1\\). Selling only donated items also works under Sec 513(a)(3\\).

Of course, it would depend on the reason for the ban and the procedures the museum went through in imposing the ban and permitting you to challenge it.\n\nIn your case, though, the ban has already been lifted, so there's probably not much room for any kind of legal action.\n\n**EDIT:** Since there are several people contesting \\-\\- with no law to support them \\-\\- the validity of this answer, here's a case discussing the First Amendment implications of access to museums:\n\n> As a limited public forum, there are certain First Amendment activities permitted on \\[National Civil War Museum] grounds and others that are not.

The employer can enforce a 30-minute unpaid lunch break policy, provided that the break is taken in one continuous period somewhere in the middle of the workday and the employee is allowed to spend it away from their desk or workstation.

There is no general legal concept like there is in civil law jurisdictions. Further, even if there was such a clause, it would need to capture Covid\\-19 within the definition of Force Majeure either by defining it sufficiently broadly or by naming \u201cpandemics\u201d a one type of Force Majeure event.\n\nEnglish law has the much narrower doctrine of frustration but that requires that the supervening event becomes *impossible*, not just more onerous or expensive. It doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible for a contract to have a *change of law* clause \\- this would probably apply to Covid\\-19 since the proximate reason for your work stopping is likely a government regulation. However, these are generally worded to allow the payee to recover additional costs of complying with the law, not to reduce the payer\u2019s obligations. Notwithstanding, I\u2019m guessing that your contract doesn\u2019t have one of these either.\n\nIn your case you are required to keep paying and the have the scaffold removed before the deadline or you will be in breach and liable for damages.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's legal position?\n\nA) The company can invoke the doctrine of frustration to suspend payments, as the lockdown has made performance impossible.\n\nB) The company must continue payments as agreed, as they have assumed the risk of such events under English contract law.\n\nC) The company can rely on an implied force majeure clause, as pandemics are generally considered force majeure events.\n\nD) The company can unilaterally pause the contract due to the change in law caused by the lockdown regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In English law, force majeure only applies if explicitly stated in the contract, which is not the case here. The doctrine of frustration is very narrow and requires impossibility, not just difficulty or increased cost.

If the advisor is an expert in the field he or she is advising about?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most important consideration is whether you're giving advice \"as\" something special. An example would be claiming to be a medical doctor and advising people to do something clearly harmful such as \"take 10 Tylenol and call me next week\". In such an extreme case, there could be criminal charges. Less severe would be an accountant giving grossly wrong and incompetent tax advice to a client, in which case the accountant could be civilly liable. (For instance, telling a client \"you don't have to declare royalties for textbook sales\"). In such cases, a client depends on the professional to give competent advice, and you rely on him to work according to a certain professional standard of care. There is a difference between the standard of care that an ordinary \"reasonable person\" owes to any other person, and the standard of care owed by a professional in an area. What would be excusable bad advice that I might give on how to build a wall would be inexcusable if given by an engineer.\n\nThe basic idea is that if you interact with a person (even indirectly, manufacturing something that a 3rd party buys), you have a certain duty to be cautious. If this is just an ordinary\\-person on ordinary\\-person interaction, then the parties (both parties) are expected to exhibit the degree of caution that a \"reasonable person\" would exhibit (attempts to pin down what a \"reasonable person\" would do have proven impossible, though juries always know subjectively what a reasonable person would do). However, your duty to not give bad advice is offset by the advice\\-taker's duty to not take bad advice \u2013 that is, if a reasonable person would know that taking 10 Tylenol is a bad idea (thus I, as a non\\-physician might have some duty to not give such stupid advice), then the person who stupidly took 10 Tylenol was contributorily negligent in taking the 10 Tylenol.\n\nAs far as I can tell, if you do not represent yourself as a member of a technical guild (lawyer, doctor, accountant, many others) giving technical advice in that capacity, and you are not directly contracting with a person (i.e. they hire you to give them advice on how to keep your yard from falling over the cliff), then you can say stuff like \"If X, then you should Y\", and not have to pay if someone does that Y and they suffer a loss.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A popular finance blogger, who is not a licensed financial advisor, regularly posts investment tips on their blog.

Are there any known examples of a grand jury \"going rogue\" as they describe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Traditionally, anyone could bring a bill of indictment to a grand jury. [This article](http://www.constitution.org/lrev/roots/runaway.htm) from Creighton Law Review provides some historical context. Government prosecutors are the overwhelming norm now, but private prosecution used to be more common. Indeed, New Jersey still has limited authorization for private prosecution (Court rule [3:23\\-9(d)](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/r3-23.html)). The New Jersey rule governing the grand jury is [3:6](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/rule_3_6.pdf), and rule 3:6\\-8(a) on return of indictment says:\n\n> An indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more\n>  jurors and shall be returned in open court to the Assignment Judge or,\n>  in the Assignment Judge's absence, to any Superior Court judge\n>  assigned to the Law Division in the county. With the approval of the\n>  Assignment Judge, an indictment may be returned to such judge by only\n>  the foreperson or the deputy foreperson rather than with all other\n>  members of the grand jury. Such judge may direct that the indictment\n>  shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been\n>  released pending trial and in that event it shall be sealed by the\n>  clerk, and no person shall disclose its finding except as necessary\n>  for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\n\nNote that the jurors decide on an indictment and return the indictment to a judge, not the prosecutor. In the rules governing grand juries, the prosecutor is allowed to be present and to speak, but has no official controlling role, other than whatever leadership is granted by the foreman. I don't know whether it is universal that grand juries do what the prosecutor tells them to, such as indicting a ham sandwich, but at least theoretically they have the power to act independently. The rules actually do not say who can ask questions of a witness, which could lead one to conclude that of course it is the prosecutor (and that the prosecutor does everything, except vote on the indictment).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to New Jersey court rules and historical practice, which of the following statements most accurately describes the power of grand juries in the state?\n\nA) Grand juries can only indict based on cases presented by government prosecutors.\n\nB) Grand juries have the power to indict independently, but this power is rarely exercised in modern practice.\n\nC) Private citizens can freely bring cases directly to grand juries for indictment without any involvement from prosecutors.\n\nD) Grand juries must always obtain approval from a prosecutor before returning an indictment to a judge.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The information provided indicates that grand juries in New Jersey technically have the power to indict independently, without requiring a prosecutor's initiation or approval. This is supported by the New Jersey court rule 3:6-8(a), which states that indictments are returned directly to a judge, not to a prosecutor. Additionally, the historical context suggests that grand juries traditionally had more independence.\n\nHowever, the statement from Dennis Kearney, a former assistant prosecutor, indicates that such independent action by grand juries is \"very unlikely\" and unprecedented in modern practice. This aligns with the idea that while the power exists, it is rarely exercised.\n\nOption A is incorrect because grand juries do have the theoretical power to act independently. Option C overstates the ease with which private citizens can bring cases to grand juries in modern practice. Option D is contradicted by the court rule, which does not mention prosecutor approval for returning indictments."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43349/excluding-yourself-from-a-class-action-lawsuit-and-then-suing-based-on-the-settl", "docs_id": 43349, "title": "Excluding yourself from a class action lawsuit and then suing based on the settlement in small claims?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The equifax class action lawsuit seems to have been settled, [but it seems clear that people aren't going to get the expected payout.](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748981/ftc-equifax-settlement-payout-125-dollars) If I really wanted to stick it to Equifax for what I consider negligence; could I sue them in small claims court? Does it matter if my state (Colorado) was or was not part of the team that sued them as part of the class?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can sue them in small claims court if the court has jurisdiction. If they have any presence in the state, that might be sufficient. If they have no presence in the state, then you can't sue them in any state court in your state.\n\nAbsent presence in your state, you would have to file in a state where they have a presence. (You can't file in federal court because the federal court would not have subject matter jurisdiction.)\n\nIf you didn't agree to be a member of the class, then you have preserved your right to sue. It doesn't matter if your state was or was not a member of the class.\n\nI'd have to look at the particulars, which I don't have. So I'm making some assumptions.\n\nTo file a suit against an entity, the court in which you're filing must have jurisdiction. To have jurisdiction, the entity must have at least a threshold level of presence in your state. The tiniest office will suffice. An employee in the state who works from home might do. But if the entity has no presence in the state, you have two choices.\n\n(1\\) You can file a diversity suit in federal district court, but that requires that the case has a reasonable expectation of award of more than $75,000 or presents a federal question of law.\n\n(2\\) You can file in a state court that has jurisdiction over the defendant\n\nThere's something called forum shopping, where the defendant has a presence in multiple states, albeit the headquarters is in one state, and the plaintiff seeks to sue in the state where the plaintiff is most likely to win and receive the greatest award. Courts don't like this. I'm not sure how they handle it. But surely they would want the plaintiff to justify choosing the particular forum.\n\nIt might be reasonable, for example, if the defendant's HQ is in NY, the plaintiff is in CO, the defendant doesn't have a presence in CO, but does have a presence in KS reasonably close to plaintiff. The reasoning would be that neither party is suffering a hardship. Of course, it might matter if the defendant's only KS location was a 5'x5' storage unit in Kansas City.\n\nThere may be laws that further limit where the suit may be filed. There may be a relationship between the parties that limits where the suit may be filed. There may be some arbitration thing, arising from law or relationship.\n\nThe courts may impose limitations on the options available to those who decline to join.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LICENSED ATTORNEY.

John cannot sue Equifax in Colorado small claims court because Equifax lacks presence in the state, which is necessary for the court to have jurisdiction. He also cannot sue in federal court unless the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 or there's a federal question of law involved. However, John may be able to file a suit in a state where Equifax has a presence, such as Georgia or another state where they have operations. This option allows John to pursue legal action against Equifax, provided he didn't agree to be part of the class action settlement.

As they seem to have a 'contact the webmaster' approach to it, is it possible to get the content (at the minimum the inacurate one) removed from their index?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR applies to such sites if they offer services in the EU/EEA. If they clearly wanted to avoid being subject to the GDPR, they should block visitors from the EEA. For the GDPR, only location matters. Other concerns like residence or citizenship are generally irrelevant.\n\nPersonal data does not turn non\\-personal just because it was public. So the GDPR still applies when the data was collected from public sources. However, the data controller (who determines the purpose of processing) often has to balance your rights and interests against other interests (e.g. when using *legitimate interest* as a legal basis for some processing). For the purpose of publicly displaying your data, only showing data that was already public anyway makes it easier to argue that this is fine.\n\nBut when the GDPR applies, you have data subject rights. Relevant rights include:\n\n* a right to access, to see all the data they have about you\n* a right to rectification, to correct wrong data they hold about you\n* a right to restriction, effectively an opt\\-out\n* a right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)\n\nThese rights apply both against the website and against Google Search (arguably, both are doing the exact same thing). Google correctly points out that they can't remove information from the Web, but they can hide information from search results.\n\nIf you feel that your requests have not been resolved correctly, you can issue a complaint with your country's data protection authority. In theory you can also sue them.

Both the approach for a right\\-hand turn and a right\\-hand turn shall be made as close as practicable to the right\\-hand curb\n\nThe approach for the second turn is being made from the middle of the road. Neither of the exceptions apply, as 22100\\.5 is about U\\-turns at traffic lights, while 22101 is about turns controlled by markings or signs.\n\nAdditionally, since you describe the route as a \"curve to the street and turn right out\", it's probably in violation of [Section 22105](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22105.): \n\n> No person shall make a U\\-turn upon any highway where the driver of such vehicle does not have an unobstructed view for 200 feet in both directions along the highway and of any traffic thereon.\n\nSince the driver didn't make a complete right turn, it's likely that the forward view of oncoming traffic was partially blocked by the car's A\\-pillar or even the passenger seat, while the backward view of traffic was limited because none of the car's mirrors was pointed in the correct direction.\n\nIt's certainly in violation of [Section 22108](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22108.):\n\n> Any signal of intention to turn right or left shall be given continuously during the last 100 feet traveled by the vehicle before turning.\n\nThe side road's not a hundred feet wide.

Section 22100: The approach for the second turn was not made close to the right-hand curb.\n2. Section 22105: The U-turn-like maneuver likely didn't allow for an unobstructed view for 200 feet in both directions.\n3.

Section 22102: If in a business district, this U-turn-like maneuver at an intersection may be illegal.\n5. Section 23103: The maneuver could be considered reckless driving due to disregard for safety.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signaling alone doesn't make the maneuver legal.
