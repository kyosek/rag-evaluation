Can a person create a corporation completely anonymously without any trace going back to the person?\n\nWhat happens in court when one spouse refuses to identify any assets, or pay alimony or provide any kind of spousal support at all?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a typical divorce proceeding, both sides are required to provide a sworn statement of their finances, and to respond to written interrogatories, produce documents (e.g. financial statements made in loan applications, balance sheets, tax returns, bank statements, and copies of deeds and certificates of title and stock certificates) and be deposed in pre\\-trial discovery proceedings. Divorce lawyers have the authority to subpoena third\\-party records custodians and to take a small number of depositions of third\\-party witnesses prior to a permanent orders hearing and can usually get permission to take more if there is evidence suggesting that it would be fruitful to do so. There are a variety of sanctions that may be imposed for failure to cooperate, including adverse inferences regarding the facts that would have been disclosed if there had been disclosures in the discovery process. Still, it behooves a client to know as much as possible before commencing the process, since having lawyers gather this information during the course of divorce litigation is expensive and isn't always perfect.\n\nWhere misconduct is suspected, a spouse's lawyer will typically retain forensic accountants and/or private investigators and will compare bank and accounting and tax records with other public records such as real property records, corporate records and tax filings. Unless an asset has produced no income or expenses flowing through a personal or business account, it will usually show up somewhere. Spouses will also often have familiarity with where to look based upon living with a spouse and often will have obtained copies of relevant correspondence or documents to provide a lead \\- perhaps a letter asking a spouse to fill out corporate paperwork or receipt from a foreign bank account.\n\nThis investigation process (collectively called discovery) usually takes place between the filing for a divorce and the half year or more later when a permanent orders hearing is held. Often, in complex cases and cases where there is a likelihood that assets have been hidden, the final hearing will be set later after the original filing than it would otherwise be, and the planned hearing will be longer in light of the evidence that will need to be produced at that time.\n\nIn my state, a spouse has up to five years after a divorce to reopen a proceeding is undisclosed assets are discovered.\n\nIt isn't impossible to hide assets in a divorce, but it isn't easy either.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a divorce proceeding, what is typically the most effective method for uncovering hidden assets?\n\nA) Hiring a private investigator to follow the spouse\nB) Relying solely on the client's personal knowledge of assets\nC) Utilizing the legal discovery process, including subpoenas and depositions\nD) Waiting until after the divorce is finalized to search for hidden assets\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective method for uncovering hidden assets in a divorce proceeding is typically utilizing the legal discovery process, including subpoenas and depositions (option C). This process allows divorce attorneys to obtain sworn statements of finances, written interrogatories, and various financial documents. They can also subpoena third-party records and take depositions. This comprehensive approach is more likely to uncover hidden assets than hiring a private investigator (A), which may be useful but is not as thorough. Relying solely on the client's knowledge (B) is limited and may miss hidden assets.

This was one of the major design goals of the Constitution and is reflected in several other areas (e.g. the structure of the Senate); the smaller states wouldn't have agreed to join the Union if such concessions hadn't been made.\n\nThere's a general principle in law that [\"the specific overrides the general\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_specialis). You're not going to get anywhere by trying to read into the word \"vote\" when there is explicit text saying something different.

Article II, Section 1 says only that \"each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors...\" There is no requirement that the state should hold an election to determine the appointment of the electors.

This is not a frequently litigated issue, with lots of case law. I note that in the case you link to, the court limited the statute to false claims made \"with a fraudulent purpose\". This normally means that the claimant is attempting to secure an improper **financial** or materiel advantage. In the *United States v. Tandaric* case, the person convicted had falsely claimed to be a US Citizen on an employment application for a company which did not hire non\\-citizens, and so gained a job through this false statement. He could have been convicted of ordinary Fraud. The court has not been as protective of Fraud under the First Amendment as it has been of speech generally, or even of false but non\\-fraudulent speech. I am not at all sure if the court would overturn this law in a similar case today. \n\n**Edit**: In the *United States v.

The courts have historically interpreted this statute as requiring a \"fraudulent purpose,\" typically involving an attempt to secure an improper financial or material advantage. In this scenario, the undocumented immigrant is falsely claiming citizenship on a job application, which directly relates to potential employment and financial gain. This closely mirrors the situation in United States v.

The court in United States v. Achtner suggested that the law was not intended for \"mere boast or jest\" or to satisfy curiosity, which would apply to these scenarios.

Moreover, if the method of selection is not original, or the organization is obvious (and the ordering seems to be alphabetical by family name, which is fairly obvious), there may be no copyright at all under the US Supreme Court decision [*Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.)\n\nThat a certain family has used a particular motto is a fact, and like other facts is in no way protected by copyright, whether the use or creation of the motto was hundreds of years ago or last week. A collection of facts can have protection provided that it has originality by virtue of the selection of facts made, or their arrangement.\n\nUnder the EU database law, somewhat greater protection is given to the contents of a database than would be under US or UK copyright law. But even under that law, the claims made by this site are probably unenforceable.\n\nThe [site heraldryclipart.com](https://www.heraldryclipart.com/) make a number of copyright claims which I think are quite invalid.

The U.S. Copyright Office explicitly states that mottos and slogans contain insufficient authorship for copyright protection. However, the database as a whole may have limited copyright protection if there is originality in the selection, coordination, or arrangement of the mottos. This protection would not extend to the individual mottos or facts, but to the creative aspects of the compilation. The website's claim of owning copyright on individual historical mottos is likely unenforceable, and their restriction on copying up to 10 mottos is not based on solid legal grounds.

In a civil RICO case, it is not necessary to actively litigate against all parties involved in the alleged criminal enterprise. The case can proceed against a single defendant, even if other participants have settled, are deceased, judgment proof, or are not actively part of the litigation. This allows for flexibility in pursuing RICO claims while still maintaining the requirement of a criminal enterprise with multiple parties.

The question of whether the act is infringing, however, is fairly simple.\n\n\"Violating copyright\" reduces to the act of creating an unauthorized copy or derivative work of a protected work. Photocopying a book is an example: it doesn't matter that there is a machine between you the actor who gets sued and the protected object. If you feed a protected work into a program which spits out some other kind of object \u2013 a \"derivative work\" \u2013 you still need permission.\n\nThere is an element of \"getting away with\" law\\-breaking in any copyright infringement. The person who has to sue you has to prove that it was *their* intellectual property that you illegally took. This is easiest in the case of text, and increasingly harder with visual and musical art. The plaintiff would argue \u2013 knowing the details of the program \u2013 that the specific output could only have been produced by feeding in their protected work. The defendant would counter\\-argue that various other works (protected or not) give the exact same output.

Even if the final output is a stylized SVG representation, using copyrighted images in the training process without permission could be considered creating a derivative work. The fact that there's an AI program between the input and output doesn't negate potential copyright issues.

The notion that a teacher must warn or face the shooter before engaging is incorrect. In such emergency situations, the priority is to stop the threat and protect lives. The case of Tennessee v.

So don't have anything to do with the alleged theft of trade secrets.\n\nHowever, to my surprise, the other two defendants went to at least 3 different attorneys and neither was willing to take up the case (I don't know the reason yet \\- will discuss with them tomorrow). The tenants are young and have limited life experience and are totally at risk of default judgement if they don't take up the case themselves or still can't find attorney.

Here are my 2 defense arguments that I came up with to at least build defense against the trade secret misappropriation:\n\n1. Most hair salons attract new customers based on business' reputation that is readily accessible on public websites, like Yelp or Google. Contrary to secretive tech startups, beauty salon customers after receiving service are explicitly encouraged by the employee or employer to post public, non\\-anonymous reviews describing their experience without any restrictions. Which implies that customer list can't be a trade secret because there is no effort to hide customer identities.\n2. Most returning customers are usually seeking their favorite hair stylist. Which means that customer list alone can't be constructed as trade secret. It should be viewed as trade secret only in tandem with their favorite hairstylist that they are explicitly seeking. Which means that the moment their favorite hairstylist leaves the employer the information becomes incomplete and hence can't be a trade secret anymore.\n\n**Would, in your opinion, something written like above convince court?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The customer list is indeed a trade secret if the shop kept its customer list secret and has an advantage from having that customer list, while others don\u2019t have it. And I would think that is the case, because a competitor laying their hands on the list could for example send special offers to the customers in the list. \n\nThe question is whether your two hairdressers *took that customer list* and whether the store has reasonable evidence that they did. If customers find out where their favourite hairdresser moved to that\u2019s no legal problem. \n\nCan\u2019t understand why no attorney wants to take the case. To the attorney it doesn\u2019t make a difference whether they took the list or not. If they took the list then his or her job is to end the case with the smallest possible amount of damages being paid. \n\nPS. Just read in the comments that there is an accusation of \"intentional interference with economic relationship\". I would want a lawyer who knows the difference between perfectly legal competition which includes trying to get customers to move their business, and \"intentional interference with economic relationship\". \n\nPS. Really make sure that these guys appear in court. With a lawyer.

The response indicates that a customer list can indeed be considered a trade secret in California if the business kept it secret and derived an advantage from it. However, the crucial legal question is whether the defendants actually took and used the list, not just whether it qualifies as a trade secret.

Could the U.S. company's used violate copyright or trademark?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Slogans, titles, and other short phrases are generally not subject to copyright protection. They can be subject to trademark protection.\n\nTrademark protection is limited in several ways. It is limited by industry. In this case, according to the question, the two companies are marketing the same sort of product, so the industry limitation would not apply. (A wine slogan might not be protected against use to promote a soda, and surely would not be protected against use to promote a computer brand.) In addition, trademark protection is limited to the geographic market area in which it is used. A slogan or trademark used to promote a grocery chain in upstate New York would not be protected against the use of the same slogan in northern California, for example. Separate countries are usually separate market areas, and in addition, have different trademark laws and trademark registration procedures. (Some countries require registration for any trademark protection to apply. The US does not, although it gives stronger protections to registered trademarks.)\n\n(Trademark protection is also limited to use in trade or commerce, but here both companies seem to be using the slogan in trade.)\n\nIf the US company used its slogan to sell wine in Canada, it might be subject to a lawsuit in Canada under Canadian law for infringing the Canadian company's mark. If the Canadian company had been selling wine using the slogan in the US, then it might have grounds for a US suit, under US law, for trademark infringement against the US company.\n\nIf the US company was the fist to use the slogan **in the US** and the Canadian company later started using the slogan in the US, then the US company might have grounds for a suit, as it would have the US rights to that slogan in the wine business. However, if the earlier Canadian use had included advertising that went across the border into the US, that might well reduce the US company's rights, especially if it was relying on use in trade alone, rather than relying on having registered the mark.\n\nIf the US company sold and advertised only in the US, and the Canadian company sold and advertised only in Canada, then neither would seem to have valid grounds for a trademark suit against the other.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A US-based wine company created the slogan \"Vintage Bliss\" for its marketing campaigns within the United States.

Since the US company is using the slogan only within the United States, and the Canadian company has been using it only in Canada, neither company would likely have grounds for a trademark infringement suit against the other in their respective countries.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because slogans are generally not subject to copyright protection, and trademark rights are limited by geographic area.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the Canadian company would not have grounds for a US trademark infringement suit unless it had been using the slogan in the US market.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because slogans can indeed be protected by trademark law, but this protection is limited by factors such as geographic area and industry."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79087/does-a-non-exclusive-non-transferable-data-license-allow-the-re-use-of-this-data", "docs_id": 79087, "title": "Does a non exclusive non transferable data license allow the re-use of this data to be shared through a public API service?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are a commercial company that wants to offer easy access to EU geographic boundaries spatial data through an API service.

I would assume that if such an actor dressed up as a monster suddenly attacks someone who out of sheer reflex harms the actor, then the victim of the prank is not culpable if a reasonable person would likely have reacted the same way (please correct me if I'm wrong). But if an actor dressed like a monster just wanders around the street, especially around Halloween, and is attacked by someone, then the attacker is culpable, as no reasonable person would have thought the actor was a threat. (please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nBut let's consider the following scenario:\n\n* **Alice** has a close relative, or boyfriend, or someone she cares deeply about, let's call him **Bob**.\n* Alice thinks Bob is too lazy, too comfortable, and wants to enact a scenario to thrill Bob up a little, and make him more self\\-confident and courageous.\n* So Alice hires **Darren** who is a well known stage illusionist / prankster / movie director, to put Bob through a scenario which seems dangerous (but is actually harmless), in order to instill some courage in him.\n* Darren creates an elaborate setup, for example fake news broadcasts made specifically for Bob, movie props, a big cast of actors, stage illusion tricks etc. to make it seem like there is an apocalyptic scenario, or that mythical monsters are real, or something similar, and the scenario is so professionally done that most reasonable people would be convinced it is real.\n* **Charlie** is one of the actors hired for the show, and is dressed up as a mythical monster (zombie, vampire, lich, whatever) which reasonable people in real life know not to exist, but due to the elaborate setup mentioned above, Bob is gradually convinced is real.\n* Bob attacks and kills Charlie, sincerely believing Charlie to be the aforementioned mythical monster. During this, Charlie wasn't actively attacking Bob, it's Bob who sought out and hunted down Charlie.\n* Neither Darren, nor Charlie, nor Alice intended this to happen. In fact Darren made all reasonable precautions to prevent such accidents, but despite all these precautions the tragedy still happened. Darren is a professional who organized similar events previously, without a single previous incident.\n\nWho is culpable for Charlie's death? What will the three of them be finally charged with?\n\n*Addendum* : would it be different if Charlie hadn't played the role of a non\\-human, but a human instead (like an evil necromancer who is responsible for the apocalyptic scenario), so Bob killed him knowing he was a human but believing to be a threat to the whole world, and believing the scenario to be truly apocalyptic?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Laws on self\\-defense vary greatly from nation to nation. Generally, one cannot *hunt down* a hypothetical threat but one can *defend against* an actual threat or even a *mistakenly assumed* actual threat where no actual threat exists. **Alice** set it up so that **Bob** would feel threatened.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the **self\\-defense** defense for homicide rests on the state of the mind of the suspect, insofar as it can be determined, and failing that on a \"reasonable person\" standard.\n\n* Presumably **Bob** genuinely felt threatened by **Charlie** and says so afterwards. \"I thought he/it/whatever was trying to harm me. I didn't know it was a harmless actor.\" Just how much harm Bob needs to make self\\-defense stick varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It could be fear of imminent, serious bodily harm, or fear of being victimized in any sort of crime (*stand your ground* laws).  \n\nAs the comment by user6726 points out, just protraying a zombie or whatever isn't enough, there has to be threat to Bob.\n* **Bob** cannot hunt **Charlie** down because Charlie \"is\" an evil lich or whatever. Bob can defend himself against attacks by Charlie and (in some jurisdictions) against intrusions by Charlie in his property. So it makes a difference if Bob hunts in his own backyard or further afield.\n* The well\\-documented and extensive efforts by Alice and Darren to fool **Bob** should support Bob's statement. Say the court/jury believes that it was reasonable (or at least \"not entirely unreasonable\") for Bob to be afraid.\n* Since the perceived self\\-defense would apply *even if* Bob thought the attacker was human, thinking that it was non\\-human should make little difference. Except that it would further showcase the degree to which Bob was fooled to see a threat.\n* If the whole endeavor by **Alice** and **Darren** broke laws, the death *might* fall into felony homicide in some jurisdictions. This one could come to technicalities because Bob wasn't their accomplice. Otherwise, Darren's track record might prevent the two from being charged for negligent homicide.\n\nConsider the well\\-publicized cases where either the police or civilians shot unarmed people, and say that they *thought* the victim was armed and a threat to them.

Not having a phone line does not make a dwelling uninhabitable (unless your locale specifically says so). In [California](http://housing.ucsc.edu/cro/pdf/telephone.pdf), it is required that the landlord maintain at least one jack and working lines (this is a direct requirement, not expressed in terms of habitability). Not in [Chicago](http://www.tenants-rights.org/residential-landlord-tenant-ordinance/) (warning: obnoxious talk occurs on that page).

There are two reasons why it doesn't. First, the typical understanding of \"utility line\" pertains to wires or pipes outside the building, which does not help you.

This is perhaps the most common usage.\n\nA person who does not own something, but expects to, may forfeit that expectation. When a would\\-be buyer puts down a deposit as before, but the seller breaches the contract, the seller may forfeit the deposit, that is may lose the right to retain the deposit, with it going back to the would\\-be buyer instead.\n\nOne may also forfeit a right or privilege. Under the older US copyright law, for example, when a copyright holder failed to renew a copyright, the holder was said to forfeit the copyright. When a criminal defendant fails to assert a privilege, such as the privilege of medical confidentiality, the defendant is said to forfeit that privilege.\n\nA thing lost because of incorrect or improper conduct can be called a forfeit, in this case the word is a noun.\n\nIf a person does not pay property tax, the property may be forfeit to the state for lack of proper tax payments.\n\nAnd \"forfeit\" may be used as a verb to describe the legal process of causing someone to undergo a forfeiture. In this case it is a bit like \"foreclose\". In the first example above where a buyer puts down a deposit but breaches the contract, the seller may \"forfeit the deposit\" that is take legal action to secure legal ownership of the deposit, because of the buyer's failure to comply with the contract.\n\nIn all these cases something of value is lost because of some failure or improper act on the part of the person who loses it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a real estate transaction, Seller S agrees to sell a property to Buyer B for $500,000.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the deposit?\n\nA) S can automatically keep the deposit without any legal action.\nB) S must return the deposit to B since B was unable to secure financing.\nC) S may forfeit the deposit, meaning S can take legal action to retain it.\nD) B has forfeited the deposit, but S must prove damages to keep it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the legal usage of \"forfeit\" in this context. When the seller (S) \"forfeits the deposit,\" it means S can take legal action to secure ownership of the deposit due to the buyer's (B) failure to comply with the contract terms. This usage aligns with the explanation that \"forfeit\" can be used as a verb to describe the legal process of causing someone to undergo a forfeiture.\n\nOption A is incorrect because S cannot automatically keep the deposit without any legal action. There's usually a process involved.\n\nOption B is incorrect because B's inability to secure financing doesn't automatically entitle them to a return of the deposit, especially when \"time is of the essence\" was specified in the contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while B has indeed failed to meet the contract terms, S doesn't necessarily need to prove damages to keep the deposit.

Why are they so closely associated with each other as to have just one tag on the site, but Northern Ireland and Scotland each seem to be their own worlds?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What Do England And Wales Share Legally?\n========================================\n\n> Why are they so closely associated with each other as to have just one\n> tag on the site, but Northern Ireland and Scotland each seem to be\n> their own worlds?\n\nMost laws of general applicability, such as criminal law, and private law (i.e. the law governing the interactions of private parties like property law, contract law, landlord\\-tenant law, employment law, etc.) are enacted by the National Parliament at Westminster (or effective as part of a shared English common law of case precedents) and shared by England and Wales which have a uniform integrated court system.\n\nIn contrast, Scotland and Northern Ireland have greater autonomy to enact laws of general application because more authority has been devolved to those regional governments than to the National Assembly of Wales. They also have their own court systems.\n\nHistoric Causes\n===============\n\nWales was basically fully integrated into England starting in the 1200s and subsequently restored some autonomy.\n\nScotland never lost its high level of autonomy and was initially joined to England only by virtue of having the same monarch, rather than being the same country. The United Kingdom was formed first by the personal union of monarchs from 1603 (under King James VI of Scotland a.k.a. King James I of England) followed by a federal style merger of governments approved by the Scottish and English parliaments in 1706\\-1707, rather than by conquest and it has much more government autonomy in generally applicable legislation and its judicial system than Wales does, and more than Ireland had when it was ruled by England. On the other hand, Scottish sentiment towards independence was not exactly unanimous in support of staying with the U.K. in the last referendum in 2014 when 44\\.7% of votes cast were for independence with 84\\.6% voter turnout (including voters as young as age 16\\).\n\nNorthern Ireland's story is a bit more complicated as Ireland had a legal status similar to Wales from a similar medieval era, but this was complicated by the Irish independence struggle ultimately leading to the creation of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The fine line and complexity of the situation in Northern Ireland is illustrated by this map, and strong autonomy was necessary to allow it to maintain the fragile Protestant\\-Roman Catholic balance in a divided society there:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdKM6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdKM6.png)\n\nEach of the components of the United Kingdom has a separate and historically determined status that is not exactly parallel to any of the others. England has no national assembly of its own, sufficing to use the national parliament for its laws despite the fact that some seats in that parliament that govern it are selected in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Likewise, before the U.S. gained independence, different parts of the U.S. had distinct relationships to the U.K., as did the various colonial possessions of the U.K. (e.g. India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania, Hong Kong).\n\nThe U.K. is an exemplary example of the philosophy that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. To pluck out just one more random example of the English tendency, \"Scotland Yard\", the national police force headquarters in the City of Westminster within the City of Greater London in England, has jurisdiction over England and Wales, but not over Scotland.\n\nLegal Distinctions Between England And Wales\n============================================\n\nTo provide a few other examples in addition to the example of language related laws noted by @WeatherVane (noted on my recent visit to England and Wales) and to embellish on that point a little further, the Welsh language is resurgent in Wales where it is a mandatory subject in public schools (often in the North with Welsh as the primary language of instruction) with about 30% of the population (more than 800,000 people) who either speak it as a first language (which is common among the very old and among young people in Northern Wales) by people who are mostly bilingual with English (but may reach for an English word or two now and then) or as a fluent second language.\n\n* The Anglican Church is the established church in England, but not in Wales where it was disestablished in 1916\\. The legal implications of this are subtle, but not non\\-existent.\n* Government agencies are not required to hoist the British flag with primacy over the Welsh flag, and indeed, the British flag is rarely seen there.\n* Primary and secondary education are administered separately in England and Wales with attendant laws on issues like truancy, dress codes, financial arrangements, testing, and certain holidays. This distinction primarily exists to facilitate Welsh language instruction, which is the primary language of instruction in some schools, and a secondary language in others.\n* More generally, the manner in which many government services (e.g. public housing) is administered, and in which tax dollars are expended is not precisely the same between England and Wales.\n* Certain laws regulating immigrants (related to immigrant financial security and leases to immigrants, more or less) differ between England and Wales, although this is a temporary matter and the long term plan is for these laws to be integrated across the United Kingdom.\n* The Welsh Senedd (a.k.a. National Assembly for Wales, i.e. the regional parliament) has some independent legislative power, although honestly, the scope of its legislation is typically closer to what you might see in a U.S. home rule city or a school board, than in a U.S. state government. In [particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government):\n\n> The 20 areas of responsibility devolved to the National Assembly for\n> Wales (and within which Welsh ministers exercise executive functions)\n> are:\n> \n> \n> * Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development\n> * Ancient monuments and historical buildings\n> * Culture\n> * Economic development\n> * Education and training\n> * Environment\n> * Fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety\n> * Food\n> * Health and social services\n> * Highways and transport\n> * Housing\n> * Local government\n> * National Assembly for Wales\n> * Public administration\n> * Social welfare\n> * Sport and recreation\n> * Tourism\n> * Town and country planning\n> * Water and flood defences\n> * Welsh language\n\n* I suspect, but do not know, that land use regulation and occupational and business licensing in Wales is less favorable to big businesses and franchises, based upon the fact that such businesses are far more common in England than in Wales, even controlling for places that are similar in population density.

It includes (emphasis mine):\n\n> 3. \"Firearm\" means (a) any pistol or revolver; or (b) a shotgun having\n> one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length; or (c) a rifle\n> having one or more barrels less than sixteen inches in length; or (d)\n> any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle whether by alteration,\n> modification, or otherwise if such weapon as altered, modified, or\n> otherwise has an overall length of less than twenty\\-six inches; or (e)\n> an assault weapon.

Loading it makes it apparently no longer an antique, but a (normal) black powder firearm, with the normal firearms rules applying to carrying, transporting, and using them for legal or recreational purposes \\- which for NYC would mandate [a registration since 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_New_York#cite_note-42) and in 2010 would have required license\\-to\\-carry.\n\n> Opinions of the State Attorney General:P: \"December 19, 1977 (informal No. 77\\- 00\\): Unloaded replica muzzle loading percussion pistols may be sold, purchased and possessed without a license.

So as a result: you can have it, but not be able to load it or you need a firearms registration/license.

However, in a practical manner, it seems that the supply of black powder might be rather limited in NY and sometimes close to impossible without a license for explosives \\- at least that's what some half\\-hour of reading muzzleloader boards told me, but legally you could buy less than 5 lbs without a license as that would be not an explosive under the law.\n\n> \\[NYCL LAB]**\u00a7451 Definitions**\n> \n> \n> 1. \"Explosives\" means gunpowder, powders used for blasting, \\[...], smokeless powder, \\[...] but shall not include \\[...] quantities of black powder not exceeding five pounds for use in firing antique firearms or artifacts or replicas thereof.\n> \n> \n> **\u00a7458 Liceses \\& Certifications**\n> \n> \n> \\[You need a license to buy, handle or use any explosives as defined above]\n> \n> \n> 8.

But if you want to prepare the charges/paper cartridges yourself, you need that license. And afaik you need to be a gunsmith to make a gun yourself. And shooting ranges are required to require that you have \"Beschuss\" on your black powder weapons (proof test). The correct proof mark is Eagle over **SP** for \"schwarzpulver\". You would be technically allowed to get an Eagle over **N** (for Nitrocellulose) and shoot with black powder, but you are not allowed to load nitro into an SP.

But contract law and section 1194 of the Labor Code encompass *what the law is* in regard to your matter.\n\n**Edited to add** (per A.fm.'s [remark](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41369/compensation-for-working-more-than-contract-states/41420?noredirect=1#comment76475_41420))\n\nIn case you are being paid for all the hours you work and your concern is only whether/when should your hourly wage be higher than the regular rate, the answer depends on whether your schedule meets any of the conditions listed in [Section 510(a)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=510.):\n\n* any work in excess of eight hours in one workday;\n* any work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek (you mention having worked *around* 24\\-40, which suggests but is not conclusive that the threshold of 40 hours is not exceeded);\n* the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek;\n* any work in excess of 12 hours in one day (entitling to twice the regular rate of pay);\n* any work in excess of eight hours on any seventh day of a workweek (entitling to twice the regular rate of pay).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John is an employee in California who signed a contract to work 20 hours per week. For the past year, he has regularly been scheduled for 35 hours per week and has worked those hours. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential claims?\n\nA) John has no valid claim because he voluntarily worked the extra hours.\n\nB) John can only claim unpaid wages for hours worked beyond 40 per week.\n\nC) John can pursue recovery of unpaid wages under both statutory and breach of contract claims.\n\nD) John is only entitled to overtime pay for hours worked beyond 8 per day.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct. Based on the documentation, John has two potential legal theories to pursue recovery of unpaid wages:\n\n1. Statutory claim: Under Section 1194 of the California Labor Code, John can claim unpaid wages because the implied agreement to work more than 20 hours constitutes an agreement to work for less than the legal minimum wage.\n\n2. Breach of contract claim: John can pursue an implied contract claim for the hours worked beyond the original 20-hour agreement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because voluntary work does not negate wage claims. Option B is incorrect because John's claims are not limited to hours beyond 40 per week. Option D is incorrect because while overtime may apply for hours beyond 8 per day, it doesn't encompass all of John's potential claims."}}
