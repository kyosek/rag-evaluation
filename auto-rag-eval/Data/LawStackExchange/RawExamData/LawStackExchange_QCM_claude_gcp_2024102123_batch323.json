            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A certain University in New Jersey is holding a conference and organising an afternoon of excursions and leisure activities. It requires that participants sign a waiver containing the clause (emphasis mine):\n\n> In exchange for {UNIVERSITY}\u2019s grant of permission for Participant to participate as a registered Conference Participant in an excursion or activity, for himself or herself, his or her parents, guardians, heirs, assigns, agents, and all those in privity with Participant, do hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant not to sue {UNIVERSITY}, its trustees, officers, employees, and agents from liability from any and all claims, **including negligence**, personal injury, accidents, assaults, kidnappings, or illnesses (including death) and property or economic loss related to or arising from, but not limited to, participation in the Seminar\\[sic].\n\nand also:\n\n> I have read this waiver of liability and assumption of risk agreement, fully understand its terms, and understand that I am giving up substantial rights, including releasing the University from all liability related to or arising out of the Conference excursion or activity. I acknowledge that I was provided this document with sufficient time to consider its provisions, ask questions and to seek review of it counsel\\[sic]. I am signing the agreement fully and voluntarily, and intend by my signature to be a complete and unconditional release of all liability to the greatest extent allowed by law.\n\nIt isn't realistic for me to seek professional legal advice on a waiver for an afternoon's excursion. To what extent does NJ law allow an institution to demand a waiver from the negligence of itself or its agents?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The University is probably entitled to put a term like this in its contract. \n\nIn general, one can waive in advance, liability for negligence, but not gross negligence, willful and wanton misconduct, reckless conduct, or intentional conduct, from the person seeking the waiver. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the validity of these clauses in the case of *[Gina Stelluti v. Casapenn Enterprises LLC](http://www.pepperlaw.com/publications/nj-supreme-court-broadens-reach-of-prospective-liability-waivers-2010-09-30/)* (August 5, 2010\\), which involved a negligence waiver in a contract with a private gym.\n\nAlso, since this is conditions on an afternoon of fun activities, rather than something mandatory or necessary, this waiver does not appear to be conditioned on giving up a substantial thing to which you are otherwise entitled. If the waiver were conditions upon something which you had an unconditional right to (e.g. a public high school education), it might not be valid because it would not be supported by valid consideration. In contrast, here, you get the right to participate in something fun, which you did not have an unconditional right to have, in exchange for the liability waiver.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A university in New Jersey requires participants in a conference excursion to sign a liability waiver that includes protection against claims of negligence. Under New Jersey law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of this waiver?\n\nA) The waiver is unenforceable because it attempts to exempt the university from liability for negligence, which is not permitted under any circumstances in New Jersey.\n\nB) The waiver is likely enforceable for claims of ordinary negligence, but would not protect the university against claims of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\n\nC) The waiver is completely enforceable and would protect the university against all claims, including those of gross negligence and intentional misconduct.\n\nD) The waiver is only enforceable if the participant was given at least 30 days to review it with legal counsel before signing.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the New Jersey Supreme Court case Gina Stelluti v. Casapenn Enterprises LLC, liability waivers for ordinary negligence are generally enforceable in New Jersey. However, waivers cannot protect against gross negligence, willful and wanton misconduct, reckless conduct, or intentional conduct. The fact that the waiver is for a voluntary recreational activity (conference excursion) rather than a necessary service also supports its enforceability. Option A is incorrect because negligence waivers can be valid in NJ. Option C is too broad, as it includes protection against gross negligence and intentional misconduct, which are not allowed. Option D introduces an arbitrary time requirement not mentioned in the provided information or New Jersey law."

Instead, it simply means to ask politely or formally. In legal contexts, some requests may be backed by law and thus require compliance (like subject access requests), while others may not. The key point is that the obligation to comply comes from the legal context or backing, not from the use of the word \"request\" itself. Option D accurately captures this nuanced understanding, reflecting that legal requests maintain the general meaning of the term while acknowledging that the requirement for compliance varies based on the specific legal context."

As I understand, EU insurers are now prohibited from doing business with freight companies that transport Russian oil by sea \u2013 unless they comply with the cap. I have three questions:\n\n1. Can Russian companies simply enjoy insurance services from other providers?\n2. Can Hungary, Bulgaria and other countries, which are exempt from the law, resell non\\-capped Russian oil and let the Russian government rake in just as much?\n3. It may seem implausible now, but what if the market price drops below the cap level of $60/bbl?

The idea is that these cover enough of the respective market to *significantly impact* Russian trade.\n\nWhen it comes EU members abusing exceptions, note that the relationship between Hungary and much of the EU is currently quite adversarial. But Hungary would like to remain a net recipient of EU funds, and that limits the things Hungary and others can do.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes a key aspect of this policy's implementation and potential impact?\n\nA) The price cap primarily relies on restricting Russian access to domestic insurance providers within Russia.\n\nB) EU member states with exemptions, like Hungary and Bulgaria, can freely resell Russian oil at any price without consequences.\n\nC) The policy's effectiveness depends on the EU's significant market share in shipping, insurance, and related services for oil transportation.\n\nD) If global oil prices fall below the cap of $60/barrel, Russian oil will automatically be sold at a premium above market rates.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The policy's effectiveness is based on the EU's substantial market share in crucial services for oil transportation, including shipping, insurance, and reinsurance. This leverage allows the EU to impact Russian oil trade significantly, even beyond its borders.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the policy targets EU insurers and service providers, not Russian domestic ones.\n\nAnswer B is mistaken as EU members with exemptions still face limits on their actions due to broader EU relationships and funding considerations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the cap sets a maximum price, not a minimum.

State constitution changes are not allowed under this right. Only the legislature can pass constitutional amendments, then subject to voter approval of just \\>50% votes.\n\nThere have been conflicts over the Init. right because the legislature sets the conditions in state laws to get a petition onto the ballot.\n\nThe constitution statement is:\n\n> The people reserve to themselves the power to approve or reject at the\n> polls any act or measure passed by the legislature. This power is\n> known as the referendum, and legal voters may, under such conditions\n> and in such manner as may be provided by acts of the legislature,\n> demand a referendum vote on any act or measure passed by the\n> legislature and cause the same to be submitted to a vote of the people\n> for their approval or rejection.\n> \n> \n> The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws, and enact\n> the same at the polls independent of the legislature. This power is\n> known as the initiative, and legal voters may, under such conditions\n> and in such manner as may be provided by acts of the legislature,\n> initiate any desired legislation and cause the same to be submitted to\n> the vote of the people at a general election for their approval or\n> rejection.\n\nEssentially, the citizen initiative and referendum rights have been used as checks and balances by the people against the legislature. The legislature has become hostile to citizen initiatives and referendums after some laws were overturned and some laws were passed by citizens on popular subjects the legislature refused to pass or even consider for years.\n\nIn 2018, the legislature changed the law to make it much more difficult to get Inits. on the ballot. Previous law (and current as of 2023\\) requires that valid signatures must equal 6% of the total votes cast in Idaho in the last presidential election, and at least 6% of signatures must come **from each of 18 of Idaho's 35 districts** (51%). The new law required 6% of signatures **from all 35 districts** (100%).\n\nBecause of Idaho's vast geography and many rural districts, this makes the process nearly impossible. It effectively empowers **just one district out of thirty\\-five (3%) to effectively veto** the Init. from getting on the ballot for all of the state voters to decide for themselves whether to make it law or not.\n\nTo illustrate the challenge of getting rural signatures in Idaho, legislators are paid extra money for constituent services like fuel to drive around to speak with voters and are paid according to the square miles of each county. Urban county legislators are given $400, while some rural county legislators are paid $3,200 to reach out to their constituents. Those vast distances are what make some areas too difficult to gather 6% of the required signatures.\n\nHowever, the state supreme court unanimously declared the law unconstitutional because it \"was so restrictive that it violated a fundamental right under the state\u2019s constitution.\"\n\nJudicial quotes included:\n\n> \"the legislature\u2019s duty to give effect to the people\u2019s rights is not a\n> free pass to override constitutional constraints and legislate a right\n> into non\\-existence, even if the legislature believes doing so is in\n> the people\u2019s best interest.\"\n> \n> \n> \"dramatic check on the ballot qualification process without showing a\n> compelling need for such a check,\"\n> \n> \n> \"all qualifying initiatives or referenda are already subjected to a\n> statewide vote.\"\n> \n> \n> \"The legislature\u2019s actions amounted to ... a law that made the\n> initiative and referendum process more difficult for proponents of\n> future ballot propositions, while simultaneously making it more\n> difficult for those opposed to the new law to pass a referendum to\n> repeal that very law.\"\n\nAn example given was that the largest urban district, Boise, could stop an agricultural initiative that is popular in the other 34 districts. When Medicaid expansion was passed in 2018 by the citizen initiative process (61%), one single rural district could have vetoed the question from even getting onto the ballot where all voters (urban and rural) got to decide on it.\n\nThis year, 2023, the legislature is close to passing a constitutional amendment that does the same thing as the law that was ruled unconstitutional. Because the people have no power to change the constitution, it's likely to be a permanent death for citizen Inits.\n\n**1\\. Before the election, can a lawsuit prevent the amendment question from being put on the ballot?**\n\n**2\\. If passed into the constitution, would a court still have the ability to rule the restrictions unconstitutional?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> 1. Before the election, can a lawsuit prevent the amendment question from being put on the ballot?\n\nNo. Generally speaking, the constitutionality of an otherwise procedurally proper ballot initiative is not ruled upon until after it has passed (eliminating the need to rule unnecessarily on the constitutionality of failed initiatives).\n\nOf course, if someone tried to put it in the ballot when the existing law conditions for putting it on the ballot were not met (e.g. because a deadline for doing so wasn't met) that could be challenged in court by a party with standing to do so.\n\n> 2. If passed into the constitution, would a court still have the ability to rule the restrictions unconstitutional?\n\nProbably not. The constitution as newly adopted doesn't sound like it would forbid doing that. This seems to be the whole point of the constitutional amendment in the first place and it the amendment to the constition is approved, that requirement is gone.",

According to the information provided, such insurance policies requiring the use of specific mail-order vendors are legal and common practice. The consumer's choice is exercised at the point of selecting an insurance plan. If an employee is dissatisfied with the restrictions, their primary recourse would be to select a different insurance plan if that option is available to them. The policy does not violate any laws, and there is no automatic right to exemptions or alternative options. While antitrust laws could potentially be applied to break up large pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts, this would be a broader regulatory action and not something an individual employee could pursue as a remedy to their situation."

Intentional: The sales representatives are knowingly exaggerating product capabilities.\n2. Material: The exaggerations significantly influence customer decisions (securing larger contracts).\n3. Damaging: Customers experience actual harm due to relying on false claims.\n4. Reasonable: It was reasonable for customers to rely on the claims made by the company's representatives.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because minor exaggerations that don't significantly influence decisions would not meet the \"material\" criterion of fraud.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct but misses the \"reasonable reliance\" aspect. If claims were implausible, it might not be considered reasonable for customers to rely on them without verification.\n\nAnswer D focuses only on personal benefit to employees, which is not a defining criterion for fraud in this context.

The question tests understanding of complex interstate commerce and tax law concepts. Option B accurately reflects the situation described in the documentation. States like Louisiana have passed laws redefining \"physical presence\" to include in-state affiliates, which would require Amazon to collect sales tax even without traditional physical locations. This new definition conflicts with the precedent set in Quill Corporation v.

I argued that it applies to militias only though. Am I correct in assuming this, or does the \"well regulated\" part apply to gun ownership in general? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR: It's controversial, but it looks like it also protects the rights for the individual.\n\n> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nWhile the exact explanation is a matter of opinion, it reads like it's a subject, a reason and a right to the subject. Your question is essentially whether or not the subject is a group, an individual or both. The definition of \"Militia\" can be multiple things though, due to the age of the 2nd Amendment it changed over time and wasn't very exact to begin with.\n\n> * \"the Militia ... civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.\"\n> * \"the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.\"\n> * \"And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\"\n> * In a militia, the character of the laborer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of a soldier.\"\n> * \"the militia system ... implied the general obligation of all adult male inhabitants to possess arms.\" .\n\n[This site](https://web.archive.org/web/20120720004917/http://www.the-eggman.com/writings/right_to_arms.html) explains it quite well in my opinion.\n\n> ```\n> \"A well regulated Militia,\n> being necessary to the security of a free state,\n> the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\n> shall not be infringed.\"\n> \n> ```\n> \n> The first two phrases are related to each other. The fact that the third phrase is separated from the verbal phrase by a comma indicates that the verbal phrase has more than the third phrase as its subject. The abbreviated grammatical construction actually renders the meaning of the Second Amendment as: `\"Neither a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, nor the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall be infringed.\"`\n\nSo what does the Supreme Court think about the explanation?\n\n> Current Supreme Court case law defines the Second Amendment (second part) as protecting from infringement by the federal and state governments, the right of the individual to keep and to bear a weapon which is part of the ordinary military equipment or which use could contribute to the common defense.\n\nThree cases are cited:\n\n* U.S. v. Planned Parenthood v Casey (120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992\\))\n* U.S. v. Verdugo\\-Urquidez (108 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1990\\))\n* U.S. v. Miller (83 L. Ed. 1207 (1939\\))\n\nAccording to [the SAF](http://www.saf.org/justice-dept-reversal-on-second-amendment-hailed-by-gun-rights-foundation/) the Justice Department includes individuals to be protected by the 2nd Amendment.\n\n> The Justice Department\u2019s enlightened interpretation of the Second Amendment as an individual right was hailed today by the firearms civil rights organization that has supported a key Texas case that led to a federal appeals court ruling upholding the individual rights concept.\n\nAnd:\n\n> \u201cToday\u2019s constitutional scholars, including Prof. Laurence Tribe, confirm that the Second Amendment is an individual right,\u201d LaCourse continued. \u201cFor years, our own Justice Department has been deaf and blind to such scholarship, and the Fifth Circuit ruling forced the government to face the facts. Solicitor General Olson and Attorney General John Ashcroft deserve credit for their courageous reversal of four decades of constitutional denial.\u201d\n\nWhile the above is biased, it does state the opinion of non\\-trivial parties.",

According to the documentation, the police can conduct a welfare check on the resident and, if necessary, take them for a mental health evaluation. This is the most appropriate initial step, as it addresses both the neighbors' concerns and the resident's potential need for medical assistance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Fair Housing Act may prevent the HOA from enforcing noise-related rules if the outbursts are due to a mental health issue.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no mention of direct threats, which would typically be necessary for a restraining order.

As long as you did not decline to rent to a tenant because of information you learned in a credit report or commercially available criminal background check, you are not required to notify them. However, it is a good business practice to notify them in writing as Nij's post suggests. However, it would be a good idea to keep a copy of the letter for you records and possibly write down some notes. Such as, \"other applicants had higher income,\" or \"could not verify rental history.\" These kinds notes one the letters you mail out will be you friend should you ever be accused of improper discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, etc.. \n\nDeclining to Rent Based Upon a Credit Check or Commercially Available Background Check:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe federal law that governs credit checks and commercially available background checks is the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"). The FCRA regulates \"[consumer reports](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681a),\" which includes credit reports and criminal background checks that are assembled by companies. (The FCRA does not apply if you, yourself, are going to the state police or courthouse to get background check records). \n\nUnder the FCRA, requires that people who make decisions against someone based on information in a credit or background check, notify that person. The FCRA calls this decision against someone an \"[adverse action](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681a)\" and requires that you provide the affected party the following information: \n\n* The name, address and telephone number of the company that supplied the consumer report, including a toll\\-free telephone number for companies that maintain files nationwide;\n* A statement that the company that supplied the report did not make the decision to take the adverse action and cannot give the specific reasons for it; and\n* A notice of the individual's right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of any information the company furnished, and the consumer's right to a free report from the company upon request within 60 days.\n\nThe FCRA calls this notice an \"Adverse Action Notice.\" [*See* 15 U.S.C. 1681m.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681m) An adverse action notice can be oral, written, or electronic. Obviously, written or electronic would be the best since you can prove that it was sent.\n\nAlso, be aware that the FCRA has civil penalties if it is violated. \n\n---\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has a helpful guide that lists some of the basics of when you do and do not need to provide adverse action notice.\n\nWebsite: [Using Consumer Reports: What Landlords Need to Know](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-landlords-need-know)\nBrochure: [FTC Facts for Business](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/bus49-using-consumer-reports-what-landlords-need-know.pdf)\n\nHowever, it does not cover criminal background checks, which have many of the same rules as the credit checks under the FCRA.\n\n---",

Holding any personal electronic device, even when stopped at a red light, is explicitly prohibited under Washington's law.\n\nC) Incorrect. While the tablet is dash-mounted, using a finger to swipe through playlists goes beyond the \"minimal use\" exception and constitutes browsing electronic data.\n\nD) Correct. Listening to audio content through wireless earbuds from a device stored in your pocket doesn't involve holding the device or using your hands/fingers to operate it, which is allowed under Washington's hands-free law."

My father died a few years ago, and my grandfather last year. I have been living on the property for 3 years now, paying bills and assisting in paying the insurance and taxes on the land. In that time, I got married. My husband and I would like to stay on the family land and my grandma is overjoyed. We have plans that include building a house and starting a small business which would be housed, at least initially, on the land. She is so happy that she is talking about deeding the land directly to me soon instead of passing it on after she dies, and my aunt is supportive\\-I don't think she wants the hassle. Her only stipulation is that it would go directly to me and not my husband, which he understands. She offered the land to each of my siblings to caretake before me, but I was the only one to accept and move to the property. Now my siblings want to be named on the deed as well, and have some level of control. My concern is that if something happens to me and my husband has built his life here, what assurance does he have of not getting thrown out in the street? Is there a good solution to make everyone happy here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unfortunately, there is the law answer, and there is the family answer.\n\nThe law answer is fairly straightforward \\- she deeds the land to you, and you leave it your husband if you precede him in death.\n\nThe family answer is different. Many families have been torn asunder by inheritance issues. Your siblings seem to think they deserve a share, which is problematic if you are building there. Your choices are to split the land but buy your siblings out, establish a long\\-term structure lease on the land, or take the land and deal with sibling fallout. There may be other options an estate lawyer can recommend. Note that if your siblings are co\\-owners, then soon there will be many more as their children inherit.\n\nYou need a local lawyer to do any of the above.",

By deeding the property solely to the granddaughter, it respects the grandmother's wishes and the aunt's support. It also allows the granddaughter to leave the property to her husband in her will, addressing the concern about his future security. This option avoids potential complications of shared ownership with siblings or complex trust arrangements. While it may cause some family tension, it provides the clearest legal path forward and aligns with the grandmother's apparent intentions. However, as the documentation suggests, consulting with a local lawyer would be crucial to properly execute this plan and consider any state-specific legal implications."

I found a [firearms permit questionnaire](http://www.honolulupd.org/downloads/applicationquestionnaire_HPD131BR05_13.pdf) from the Honolulu Police department, but it simply asks,\n\n> 6. Have you ever been diagnosed as having a significant\n> behavioral, emotional, or mental disorder?\n\nwithout providing any guidance as to what is meant or what criteria the applicant should use to determine significance, or even whether the applicant should apply legal or clinical factors.\n\nI can think of all sorts of possibilities for how one could reasonably interpret the clause:\n\n* This refers only to people whose disorder is so significant that they have been declared legally incapacitated and placed under guardianship.\n* This ties in with eligibility for certain disability benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If the person doesn't receive any of these benefits, and/or has been found to be ineligible for them due to insignificance of their illness, they are not ineligible under this clause.\n* This applies only if a person has been *specifically* advised by a health care practitioner that the person is too ill to safely use a firearm.\n* There is an administrative agency, such as the Department of Health, that formally and individually evaluates persons with diagnosed behavioral, emotional, or mental disorders in order to determine if their conditions are \"significant\" enough to trigger firearm ineligibility. If someone has gone through this process and received a determination of Insignificance, they can be confident that they are not covered by this law, can answer \"no\" on application forms, etc.\n* There is an official list of \"significant\" diagnoses, and all other diagnoses are considered \"insignificant\".\n* The individual makes their own determination \\- the statute is not intended to apply penalties, but rather to provide gentle guidance to persons with disabilities to not engage in activities that they are not able to handle, the same way that a person with uncontrolled diabetes might be discouraged from entering a speed cake\\-eating competition.\n* All diagnoses are initially deemed \"significant\", but the \"no longer adversely affected\" clause allows a health care practitioner to certify that a person can safely use a firearm despite their diagnosis (even though, at first glance, it appears to apply only in cases where the illness is *no longer present at all*).\n\nThis question is **not** a debate thread on gun control or disability rights.\n\nIf this clause has been ruled void or unenforceable (e.g. unconstitutional, void for vagueness, etc.) but remains in the statute book for historical reasons, that's an answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is, practically speaking, impossible for a layman to know whether a given situation constitutes a significant behavioral, emotional, or mental disorder. Instead, a technical expert would make that determination. So most of the question isn't legal, it's psyychiatric. There is a book that spells this out ([Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM\u20135\\)](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm)), which is the current standard (updated from DSM\\-4\\). [This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3101504/) discusses some of the differences, if that helps. W.r.t. DSM\\-4, the authors note that \n\n> the phrase \u201cclinically significant\u201d is in some ways tautological here;\n>  its definition is precisely what is at stake when defining a mental\n>  disorder.\n\nThe legal stance that the Hawaii legislature took is that they don't get into the business of defining \"significant\" as opposed to \"insignificant\", they defer to the professional organization. In a legal proceeding, if there is a professional difference of opinion, the two sides would testify as to the defining criteria in DSM\\-5 and the facts that the experts have observed about the individual.\n\nHowever, on the face of it, it is simple. Have you been officially diagnosed with a significant mental disorder. If no, you can buy a gun, if yes, you may not buy a gun.",

According to copyright law in many countries, including Canada as mentioned in the example, choreography is typically protected as a \"dramatic work\" or \"artistic work\" under copyright law. Learning choreography in a class and then teaching it elsewhere without permission could be considered copyright infringement. Even if the instructor doesn't charge for their classes, using copyrighted material without authorization is still problematic. Physical movements alone may not be copyrightable, but the specific arrangement and creative expression in choreography can be protected. Finally, while recording and distributing videos would certainly be an infringement, copyright protection extends to the performance of the work as well, not just recorded versions."

Obviously unlike in the U.S. there is no constitution establishing the framework of law making and keeping, the powers of the parliament and crown, etc.\n\nSo then also how is the whole system of government and separations of powers etc in England and the U.K. defined?\n\nDoes the answer to this differ between different parts of the U.K.?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Organically rather than by design, laws and courts preceded the theoretical constitutional basis. Kings developed a practice of legislating in council, rather than solo, meaning that their edicts went out not as \"the King decrees XYZ\" but \"the King, with the assent of the archbishops, bishops, abbots, barons, etc., decrees XYZ\". This eventually became the Parliamentary system, wherein only Parliament could make laws (especially about raising taxes) and the King alone could not.\n\nBecause of the gradual evolution, it's not easy to point to the first such statute or even the first proper \"Parliament\". The form was not settled. Nowadays we expect Acts to start with a set \"enacting formula\", to be published in a set way, and to be called \"Acts\" at all. Earlier laws lacked these elements. It was common for Parliaments to transact a variety of business, such as appointing officials or distributing money, without strictly distinguishing a category of what we would now call a \"public general Act\", something setting out broadly applicable rules under the tenor of law. To take an early example, the Domesday Book was undoubtedly commissioned by William I in council in 1085, but we could argue for a long time whether that really counted as a law made by the King alone or through a proto\\-parliamentary approach. The Assize of Clarendon in 1166 is closer \\- we have the text and it refers to the counsel of all the barons \\- but still not obviously \"an Act\". Magna Carta came in 1215 and was repeatedly confirmed by successive monarchs in slight variations; only the 1297 version is currently deemed to be an Act still partially in force.\n\nAt the same time as this legislative activity, a bewildering array of courts applied essentially customary law for local cases. If you commit a murder in Durham in 1300 and would like to not be executed, then you would be appealing (I think?) to the mercy of the Prince\\-Bishop in his own court. A few dozen miles away and the process and authority was different.\n\nThings gradually became more uniform and systematized, and by the sixteenth century there was enough critical mass of legal philosophy to try to \"explain\" the legal system more formally and in recognizably modern terms. We may as well take Edward Coke's *Institutes of the Laws of England* (1628\\-1644\\) as a turning point: four volumes setting out a comprehensive view of what English law was all about. In contrast, take Bracton's similar work of 1235, which was the first real analysis of case law in England. Bracton was writing in a context without a general idea of precedent, and where the binding extent of Roman civil law was not clear. By Coke's time that was well established. But they are both trying to make sense of the law as they found it: giving explanations for the data, if you like. (A parallel course was taking place in Scotland with its institutional writers, although they ended up with a different system from England's. They were equally trying to explain what they saw.)\n\nSome of the early modern authors contributed to figuring out which decisions of past Parliaments or councils should be taken to be Acts, as such. Coke, in particular, also set out the criterion that an Act should purport to have been made by all three of the King, Lords and Commons. Our modern consolidated versions of the statute book derive from this time, and on legislation.gov.uk you can see the oldest Act still in force, [The Statute of Marlborough 1267](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen3cc1415/52/1/paragraph/p1). That's different from the oldest Acts ever made, as discussed above, a more slippery concept.\n\nIdeas such as the separation of powers are reverse\\-engineered in this way. Indeed, it's not obvious that Britain has that separation. It may not be the right way to understand the governmental and legal order that has developed. John Locke might have thought it would be a good idea, but Walter Bagehot denied it was a useful frame for analyzing the interrelationships of various public bodies.",

Which of the following approaches would be compliant with Google's Terms of Service?\n\nA) Store the book IDs and titles locally in the app's database for faster sorting and retrieval.\nB) Keep only the book IDs in local storage and fetch titles from the API when needed for sorting.\nC) Cache the entire book data locally, including IDs, titles, and other details, for a smoother user experience.\nD) Perform all sorting operations on the server-side using real-time API calls, without storing any data locally.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) Incorrect. Storing book IDs and titles locally violates Google's Terms of Service, which prohibit keeping permanent copies of data retrieved from their APIs.\n\nB) Incorrect. While this approach attempts to minimize data storage, it still involves keeping book IDs, which are considered Google's content. This violates the Terms of Service.\n\nC) Incorrect. Caching entire book data locally is a clear violation of Google's Terms of Service, as it involves storing significant amounts of API-retrieved data permanently.\n\nD) Correct. This approach adheres to Google's Terms of Service by not storing any API-retrieved data locally. All operations, including sorting, are performed using real-time API calls, ensuring compliance with the prohibition on content storage."

The Government of Canada's guide on legislative drafting [has a section on gender\\-neutral language](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/legis-redact/legistics/p1p15.html). It emphasizes that \"gender\\-specific language should not be used in legislation.\" The first\\-listed alternative strategy (alongside others) is to \"use the singular 'they' and its other grammatical forms... to refer to indefinite pronouns and singular nouns.\"\n\nIt acknowledges that \"\\[i]n the past, the masculine pronoun was commonly used in the English language to signify the non\\-specific 'he or she'\" but that \"\\[i]t is now generally well\\-accepted that gender\\-specific language should only be used for references to persons of one gender or the other.\"\n\nOne example from the guide:\n\n> Every taxpayer shall file their tax return no later than April 30 of the year following the year in which they earned the income on which they are paying taxes.\n\n### Guidance from the British Columbia Law Institute\n\nIn the guide, [*Gender Diversity in Legal Writing*](https://www.bcli.org/wp-content/uploads/Gender-Diversity-in-Legal-Writing-1.pdf), the institute explains:\n\n> Canadian lawyers no longer write law, or write about the law, as if it only applies to men of European descent who own real property. ... Language and the law continue to evolve, moving towards even more inclusive language in legal writing. ... The highest levels of our profession have recognized that gender inclusivity is a matter of justice and professionalism. The British Columbia courts require all counsel to identify themselves and their pronouns. ... We have adopted gender\\-inclusive ways of referring to people, in particular the use of \u201cthey\u201d as a singular pronoun.\n\nThe guide says:\n\n> They/them is also used as a gender non\\-specific singular pronoun when a writer does not know a person\u2019s pronouns.\n\n> Just like the pronoun \u201cyou,\u201d they/them can be used in singular or plural forms.\n\nOne example it provides:\n\n> Minister Williams said they misspoke when they said their budget was \u201cbalanced to the last penny.\u201d\n\n### French text\n\nIt is slightly more complex to render French legal writing to be gender\\-inclusive, given that adjectives and third\\-person plural pronouns are gendered, but the Government of Canada's Translation Bureau [shares several resources](https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/ressources-resources/ecriture-inclusive-writing/principes-francais-guidelines-french-eng), including [guidance from the Commission de la construction du Qu\u00e9bec](https://www.ccq.org/-/media/Project/Ccq/Ccq-Website/PDF/Communications/Autres/guide_de_redaction_epicene_final.pdf), and [an article from the Canadian Bar Review](https://cbr.cba.org/index.php/cbr/article/view/4660/4495).",

The Government of Canada's guide on legislative drafting explicitly recommends using \"the singular 'they' and its other grammatical forms... to refer to indefinite pronouns and singular nouns.\" This guidance is supported by other authoritative sources like the British Columbia Law Institute, which states that \"they/them\" can be used as a gender non-specific singular pronoun.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the use of \"he/him\" as a generic pronoun is no longer accepted practice, with the government guide stating that \"gender-specific language should not be used in legislation.\"\n\nOption B is incorrect because the singular \"they/their/them\" is not only recommended for legislative drafting but is also accepted in court proceedings and legal writing, as evidenced by the British Columbia courts requiring counsel to identify their pronouns.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the guidance for gender-neutral language is not limited to federal documents.

After the service is completed, the company requests credit card information via email, which the customer finds unsecure. What is the most accurate statement regarding this situation?\n\nA) The customer is legally obligated to provide credit card information via email as requested by the company.\nB) The shipping company can refuse to consider alternative payment methods and demand payment only through email.\nC) The customer and shipping company must negotiate a mutually agreeable payment method, with the customer still owing for the service.\nD) The customer can refuse to pay entirely since the payment method was not specified before the service was rendered.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, if the payment requirement was not specified before the service was provided, the customer is not obligated to accept the company's preferred method. However, the customer still owes for the service rendered. Both parties must now find a mutually agreeable payment method. The company should be compelled to consider more accommodating payment options, while the customer remains responsible for paying for the service received. This situation highlights the importance of establishing payment terms and methods before providing services, especially for significant amounts or when dealing with distant clients."

After four years of no contact, Jane would likely struggle to convince a judge that she faces immediate danger from John.

Any case in which liability would be found under \\[42\\.1], it would also be found under \\[42\\.2] The reverse is not the case \\-\\- there are situations in which liability would be found under \\[42\\.2] but not under \\[42\\.1] \\-\\- specifically cases where a properly acting defendant might or might not have been able to avert the harm.\n\n### Question 2\\.\n\n**No**, not at all. There could be a case where it is clear that the accused failed to act to try to avert the harm, and therefore did not \"act as he ought to have\" but it is also clear that any such attempt would have failed, that it was not within the power of the accused to prevent the harm. In that case, the rule stated by Herring says there will be no liability, even though the accused failed in duty.\n\nFor example, suppose someone fell in front of an oncoming train, and that the law is that a bystander has a duty to try to rescue the victim. Suppose that the bystander stays still and makes no attempt to help. Then the bystander did not \"act as he ought\". But suppose further that evidence clearly establishes that given the distance of the bystander from the track, and the distance between the train and the victim, the most diligent bystander possible would not have had time to effect a rescue. Then there is a failure of duty, but no liability under this rule.\n\n(If you argue that a bystander has no duty at all, suppose instead a railway employee or a police officer who does have a duty to assist a victim in such a case.)",

In light of the legal principles discussed regarding omissions and causation, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The lifeguard cannot be held criminally responsible because his omission did not cause the harm, as the child would have died anyway.\n\nB) The lifeguard is criminally responsible because he failed to act as he ought to, regardless of whether his action could have prevented the harm.\n\nC) The lifeguard's criminal responsibility depends on whether the court applies the \"would have\" standard or the \"might have\" standard of causation.\n\nD) The lifeguard is not criminally responsible because he eventually attempted a rescue, fulfilling his duty of care.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the nuanced debate over causation standards in criminal omissions. Option C is correct because the lifeguard's criminal responsibility indeed hinges on which causation standard the court applies. Under the stricter \"would have\" standard (42.1), the lifeguard might not be held responsible since evidence suggests the child would have died even with immediate action. However, under the broader \"might have\" standard (42.2), the lifeguard could be held responsible because immediate action might have given the child a chance of survival, however small.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes only the stricter standard applies. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the causation requirement entirely. Option D is incorrect because a delayed attempt doesn't necessarily fulfill the duty of care, and the timing of the response is crucial in this scenario."

Could the judge ask for clarifications (or other questions) on the written testimony?\n\n**Clarification:**\n\n> Your statement may or may not be in evidence at the trial\n\nHere the prosecutor must provide the defendant with all evidence that could be used during the trial, and I have seen my statement in it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You did not give the police \"written testimony\", you gave them a statement. Testimony is given under oath or affirmed as true under penalty of perjury, a statement is just a statement.\n\nThe statement is not part of the \"proof\". Proof is an evidentiary burden that must be met by the evidence to obtain a result. If this is really a criminal matter, the police must prove that you committed the offence \"beyond reasonable doubt\". However, driving offences are almost always civil penalties, not criminal ones, so the burden of proof is the much lower \"on the balance of probabilities\".\n\nThe police are under no obligation to enter your statement into evidence. They might, but if they don't and you want the judge to know about it, you have to enter it into evidence through your testimony. The police are there to prove you guilty, they have very little incentive to help you prove your innocence.\n\nA trial works by the prosecution presenting their case, calling witnesses who testify, can be cross\\-examined by the defense and then re\\-examined by the prosecution. Then the defense has their turn in much the same way. The defense doesn't have to mount an active defense because the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, however, if the only evidence is that given by the prosecution, that burden may not be too difficult to reach. That said, for traffic matters in local courts, this will not necessarily be done with the same formality as the Supreme Court but whatever latitude is allowed is up to the judge.\n\nWhen a witness testifies they are not normally allowed to refer to written materials \\- they are supposed to do it from memory. Courts will usually allow some witnesses to refer to written materials: police to their notebooks and experts to their reports but this is the exception rather than the rule. For civil cases, the parties can agree that testimony will be by written statement that are provided before the trial \\- this is done for reasons of efficiency, however, this is not usually the case when someone is being prosecuted.\n\n> Since I have nothing to add to my story, am I allowed to remain silent and to read the written testimony instead?\n\nYour statement may or may not be in evidence at the trial. If you want it to be, you should testify that you made a statement to the police and that you are happy for that to be your testimony \\- you will probably be allowed to swear as to its veracity and the prosecutor can object to some or all of it on the normal grounds (relevance, hearsay etc.) for which the judge will make a ruling, perhaps striking out the offending parts.\n\nYou can choose not to testify, the court will then make a decision on the evidence advanced by the prosecution.\n\n> Assuming they both have the same content, could a judge put more trust in the oral testimony than in the written one?\n\nThere is no written testimony q.v.\n\n> Could remaining silent compromise my defense?\n\nYes. If the evidence consists of a police officer saying you were speeding (say) and that's all, the judge can choose to believe the police officer.\n\n> Could the judge ask for clarifications (or other questions) on the written testimony?\n\nThey might.",

The documentation clearly states that the police are under no obligation to enter the defendant's statement into evidence. If the defendant wants the judge to consider the statement, they may need to testify about it and enter it into evidence through their testimony. The statement is not automatically considered \"written testimony,\" and the defendant cannot simply remain silent and have it read instead of providing oral testimony. Additionally, while the judge might ask for clarifications, they are not required to do so, especially if the defendant chooses to remain silent."

These subscriptions could be paid for with a credit card, for example, regardless of what country the card is issued in.\n\nI don't understand why any sort of EU presence would even be necessary in these cases.\n\nFor example, why couldn't Facebook just dissolve all of its EU\\-based subsidiaries?

While Facebook and similar tech giants don't charge users directly, they generate significant revenue from EU-based advertisers. Dissolving EU subsidiaries would result in a major loss of this revenue. Additionally, abandoning the EU market could lead to the rise of GDPR-compliant competitors, threatening Facebook's global market dominance. The \"winner-takes-all\" effect is crucial to Facebook's success, and giving up the EU market could jeopardize this advantage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the EU could potentially block access, this isn't the primary reason companies comply. Option C is incorrect as Facebook and many tech companies don't sell tangible products to users. Option D is incorrect because GDPR specifically applies to data of EU residents, not globally."

The documentation states that legally, the customer could pursue action in either their own jurisdiction (Germany) or the jurisdiction of the sending company (Mississippi). However, it notes that taking action in the sender's jurisdiction (Mississippi) would likely be more effective in compelling the company to respond or take action, even though it would be more troublesome for the customer. This aligns with option C, which accurately reflects the dual-jurisdiction possibility while highlighting the potential advantage of pursuing action in Mississippi.

Ownership and risk can transfer at the same or different times, also as agreed.\n\nIf the parties do not explicitly agree, and if it\u2019s relevant to a dispute, the court will need to establish when the transfer occurred. If there is a commonly used standard for this in the industry in which the parties operate, the court may make that an implicit term of the contract.\n\nIf there isn\u2019t an industry standard, then the most likely outcomes are that both ownership and risk transfer from B to A when B delivers the goods to A or when A accepts the delivery (for example, A might reject the goods if they are faulty or not as specified).\n\nOf course, if delivery is through an intermediary such a logistics company or an import/export firm it may be difficult to pinpoint the moment of delivery. This will likely turn on whether the intermediary is A or B\u2019s agent. If A\u2019s the transfer will likely be when the intermediary receives it from B, if B\u2019s agent then likely when they deliver it to A.

This follows the principle that the party in possession of the goods bears the risk. While advance payment has been made, this alone does not transfer ownership or risk. The shipping company may be liable to Company Y, but as between X and Y, Y would typically bear the risk until delivery. Company X and Y do not automatically share responsibility without a specific agreement to that effect. Therefore, Company Y is most likely responsible for the damage during transit."

Item G addresses moisture problems. If that item is checked \"unknown\", then you would need to establish that the seller knew, and that could depend on whether the person selling is the person who lived there (e.g. if the house was sold by a trust on behalf of the occupant at the time).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Oregon, a homeowner discovers water intrusion issues in their house three years after purchase. They learn from a neighbor that the previous owner experienced similar problems but didn't disclose this information during the sale. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's legal options?\n\nA) The homeowner has no legal recourse as the 2-year statute of limitations for fraud cases has expired.\n\nB) The homeowner can pursue legal action for breach of contract within the next 3 years.\n\nC) The homeowner can only take legal action if they can prove the seller personally lived in the house and knew about the water intrusion.\n\nD) The homeowner may have legal options under both contract and fraud laws, depending on the specifics of the seller's disclosure and when the issue was discovered.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate because:\n\n1. There is a 6-year statute of limitations for contract cases in Oregon, which hasn't expired yet.\n2. For fraud or deceit cases, the 2-year limitation begins from the discovery of the fraud, not the purchase date.\n3. The seller's disclosure is required by Oregon law and includes questions about moisture problems.\n4. The homeowner's ability to pursue legal action may depend on proving the seller's knowledge and the specifics of the disclosure form.\n5. Both contract and fraud-based claims might be possible, depending on the circumstances.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they misstate the applicable statutes of limitations. Option C is too narrow, as legal action might be possible even if the seller didn't personally live in the house, depending on what they knew and disclosed."

This nomination power is not subject to congressional oversight or legal challenge, making it a non-justiciable matter. While it may be ethically questionable, a President can legally base their nomination on any factor they choose, including personal biases or preferences. The Senate's role is limited to providing \"Advice and Consent\" after the nomination is made, not in the selection process itself.

My property manager doesn\u2019t wear a mask around myself and other residents and does not take any COVID precautions. I have said that I want him to wear a mask, but he has ignored that. I'm hesitant to say anything to the management company or the landlord because I am not sure if he is the landlord. I\u2019m worried that if I say anything, nothing will change and he will be less responsive to maintenance needs (the apartment has shoddy electrical wiring and heating and I depend on him being responsive when things go wrong). What are my rights as a tenant when it comes to COVID and how do I get him to wear a mask around me?\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One path would be to get compliance, by demonstrating that it is legally required. The best evidence that he is legally required to wear a mask is [this](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx) recent mandate from the Department of Public Health. However, I cannot find a corresponding executive order, which may be in a generic form empowering CDPH to issue orders. Any imposition of penalties for violation must be publicly announced and rest on legislative authority. The mandate is not generally enforced, except in a few cases regarding bars and restaurants. There are various persuasive avenues that you could pursue, such as asking CDPH to come talk to him (unlikely, but you could try), complaining to the property owner, appealing to local social media to apply pressure (possibly putting yourself at legal risk for defamation, if you make a false statement).\n\nThere are two more involved legal actions to contemplate. One is to terminate the lease and move elsewhere. This would likely result in an action to collect the remainder of the rent, but the strategy would be to argue that the manager has interfered with your private enjoyment of the premise. A second, highly improbable, is to sue the manager and get an enforceable court order requiring him to wear a mask. Courts have a prejudice against ordering people to take actions when other options exist (terminating the lease, monetary compensation). It could be an interesting but expensive test case to see if you could get a judge to order the manager to wear a mask.\n\nSo yes they are obligated to wear masks, but legal enforcement is going to be difficult at best.",

I understand that simply entering a reasonable URL I expect to have access to (such as `example.com/auth?name=user`) is legal, while intentionally trying to get access to someone else's account (such as `example.com/auth?name=admin&id={stolen auth token}` is not.

E.g. is simply typing someone else's username in a login page together with an empty password enough to be considered an attack? If not, then there is the line?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \u201cAttack\u201d is not a legal term\n----------------------------\n\nNeither is \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cexploit\u201d. When someone is charged with a crime, the state makes very specific which crime(s) the accused has committed and, from that flow the elements that the state must prove beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nArkansas no doubt has laws about this but since it\u2019s being \u201cinvestigated by the FBI\u201d the suspicion is that a Federal crime was committed. Of course, \u201cunder investigation\u201d just means that someone told the FBI about it, whether the FBI does anything is up to them. As the TV show [Yes, Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister) put it \u201cunder consideration\u201d means we\u2019ve lost the file, \u201cunder active consideration\u201d means we\u2019re looking for it.\n\nThe most relevant Federal law is the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) (CFAA) under which there are a number of crimes but the most applicable is:\n\n> (2\\) intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2014\n> \n> \n> (C) information from any protected computer;\n\nThe person in the article:\n\n* intentionally \\- check\n* accessed a computer \\- check\n* without or exceeding authorisation \\- we\u2019ll get back to this\n* obtained information \\- check\n* from a protected computer \\- check. Any computer with internet access is a \u201cprotected computer\u201d under the Act and this includes mobile phones.\n\nSo the only question is did the person not have authorisation or exceed the authorisation they had?\n\nIt\u2019s clear that they were not explicitly authorised.\n\nPublishing something with a URL and \\*without any security \\*on the web is *possibly* implicit authorisation. For example, you are authorised to access this web page whether you are a signed up member of Stack Exchange (SE) or not.\n\n**However**, down at the bottom of this page is a Legal link which *may* create a binding contract between you and SE (see <https://law.stackexchange.com/a/13571/344>). The CFAA is drafted so broadly that breach of a contract may trigger criminal sanctions (see the sad case of [Aaron Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#United_States_v._Aaron_Swartz_case). Criminal sanction for a civil wrong is ... odd ... but not prohibited by the legal system \\- government has the power to decide what is and isn\u2019t a crime.\n\nAs it currently stands the CFAA is a wide\\-reaching and draconian piece of legislation. There is a line but if you start to think you might be crossing it, you are probably already well over it.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I own a 3\\-bedroom, ex\\-council flat in London (UK) which I'm renting out via an agency as I currently reside outside the country.\n\nDuring all my communications with the agency, they always mention three tenants. In fact, there are three names in the contract and I have multiple emails/Whatsapp messages that prove so.\n\nLast week I got to know that there are in fact four people living in the flat. The agency claims that this tenant has always been in the flat and in their systems, and that it was a 'typo'. This means they always knew they were four people and they never communicated that to me.\n\nAfter having a conversation with my agent (who isn't the one who had the contract signed, but a different person in the same agency), he didn't give any reasons why the fourth tenant was never added to the contract. All I got were excuses and blaming the previous person that managed the contract.\n\nMy questions are, where does this put me legally and what are my options? If I decide to break my agreement with the agency, do I have grounds to do that? Also, if I want to keep the tenants, how should I proceed? And if I don't want to keep them, do I have that option?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> My questions are, where does this put me legally and what are my\n>  options? . . . Also, if I want to keep the tenants, how should I\n>  proceed? And if I don't want to keep them, do I have that option?\n\n*Your Rights With Respect To The Tenants*\n\nIf the agency is telling the truth and the agreement made with the agent was for four tenants but their records and document only listed three by accident, you probably can't insist on additional rent or evicting the fourth tenant because if your agent does something on your behalf, that is binding on you just as much as if you had signed them up personally in that manner. This is true even if the agent didn't actually have the authority to rent the place to four people based upon your communications with the agent, because the agent has \"apparent authority\" to bind you in your agent's dealings with the prospective tenants.\n\nYou probably have the right to insist that the fourth tenant sign the lease to conform to the actual agreement that was reached (four tenants in exchange for the rent stated in the lease). If the fourth tenant refuses to do so, that would be a repudiation of the lease/contract and would prevent him from claiming that he is a valid tenant of the property pursuant to the agreement reached with landlord through his agent. If the fourth tenant refused to sign, you could therefore insist that the fourth tenant pay additional rent or be evicted if you wanted to.\n\nOn the other hand, if the agent is not accurately relating the facts, and there was never any agreement to have more than three tenants (as your communications with them and the written lease suggest), then you would have the right to evict the fourth tenant or insist on additional rent from that tenant. But, it might be hard to prove that the agent is not being accurate because it sounds like the agent and the tenants will testify consistently with each other and there were probably no other witnesses to the discussions between them.\n\n*The Fourth Tenant Might Have Liability Anyway*\n\nAlso, at common law, you could sue the fourth person for unpaid rent during the period that the tenant was actually there anyway, since the fourth tenant was in \"privity of estate\" with you. (If someone actually signs the lease then they are in \"privity of contract\" with you.)\n\nEngland abolished the doctrine of privity of estate in most circumstances for residential tenancies [in 1995](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-107-7057?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&comp=pluk&bhcp=1). But, it is possible that this fact pattern is one of the situations in which the privity of estate doctrine remains in force since the 1995 reforms largely apply to assignments of leases by people who are tenants on the original lease, rather than occupants of a rented property who never signed a lease and never received a formal assignment. I don't have the legal research tools to confirm that accurately. But, none of the U.K. Landlord and Tenant Acts currently in force that I could locate addressed that issue, so the common law rule may still apply in this situation. \n\nIf the doctrine of privity of estate does allow a suit against the fourth tenant based on occupancy without signing a lease, the incentive to even try to get the fourth tenant to sign a lease is very small indeed \\- you get no benefit at all from it other than slightly easier proof in an unpaid rent collection lawsuit if the agent's story is believed. If it doesn't the considerations earlier in this answer still apply.\n\n*Practical Considerations*\n\nAll of this being said, there is also a practical consideration to consider. It you try to kick out the fourth tenant or impose additional rent on the fourth tenant, if the fourth tenant refuses to sign the lease, or if you believe that the original agreement did not include the fourth tenant, you still have to weigh the pros and cons of bringing an eviction or unpaid rent lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit will cost you money (requiring you to advance money even if you are awarded attorneys' fees which may be impossible to collect from the tenants). You won't get your attorneys' fees for the lawsuit if you lose and will also have to pay their attorneys' fees if you lose. Tenants whom you are suing are unlikely to be cooperative on any other matter upon which you want their cooperation, and may bad mouth you, for example, in online consumer reviews. Unlike a typical eviction where the rent is not paid, it is very likely that the eviction will be contested, and if it is, the court could order the fourth tenant to sign the lease, but provide you with no other remedy if the court believes the story put forward by the tenant and the agent.\n\nIf you don't sue, you won't incur attorneys' fees, you can still evict everyone if the rent isn't paid, you can still try to collect unpaid rent from three other people, and you are much less likely to have a dispute with or non\\-cooperation from the tenants. The only benefit you get from having a fourth person on the lease if that was the original deal (or if you can't prove that it wasn't the original deal) is that you have one more person you can sue for back rent if the rent isn't paid.\n\n> If I decide to break my agreement with the agency, do I have grounds\n>  to do that?\n\n*Terminating The Agent*\n\nOften you can terminate an agreement with an agency without cause. If the agency agreement says that you can, you are free to do so and probably should because at a minimum they are sloppy and poor communicators.\n\nGenerally speaking, even if you can't terminate the agreement without cause, you can terminate the agreement for cause, and the contradiction between their prior communications with you and their current communications with you probably constitute good cause to terminate the agreement both if they are telling the truth not, and if they are not accurately recounting the facts now.\n\nBut, to be clear, terminating the agent won't affect the rights of the tenant.\n\n*Suing The Agent*\n\nIf you clearly do lose money because the three tenants on the lease don't pay rent and for example, you get a judgment against them which can't be collected due to bankruptcy or them moving abroad to a place where it is not economical to collect a money judgment from them, or just not having any assets or income (or some combination thereof), and it turns out that the law does not allow you to sue the fourth tenant, and the fourth tenant was not judgment proof, you would probably have a right to sue the agent for the lost rent caused by the agent's negligence in failing to get all four tenants to sign the lease. \n\nBut, the cost of proving that in a typical case would not be worth the money since this would be much harder to prove than simply proving that someone signed a lease agreeing to pay rent and didn't pay rent as agreed. If the agent didn't agree to pay for your losses voluntarily it might not be worth the time, trouble and risk of not prevailing in that lawsuit to pursue, even if you could get attorneys' fees for your suit against the agent if you won (which you probably could in England). The risks of doing that include paying the agent's attorneys' fees is you lose.",

We have been warned that anyone living on campus who uses profanity in the dormitory lobby will be written up for a violation of residency agreement and the student code of conduct.\n\nNothing in either document clearly establishes what constitutes profanity, how it is a violation of the aforementioned notices, or why this is punishable at all. The only thing I found in their literature states that profanity is in poor taste and is thus not acceptable. This was immediately preceded by language demanding that students obey school policy as well as state and federal law.\n\nSo the codes say it is unacceptable, but I can find no case law to back this up. *[Cohen v Calif.](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108360/cohen-v-california/)*, *[Matal v. Tam](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4403807/matal-v-tam/)*, and *[People v. Boomer](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1659438/people-v-boomer/)* seem to be the most relevant in the discussion, but I find the jargon a bit dense.\n\nThis policy seems to be incongruent with federal interpretations of free speech and further work by the ACLU. If the language I use is not used to incite violence, issue a threat, or utter fighting words, can they enforce punitive action?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a state university, the institution would be subject to First Amendment restrictions on their restrictions. They cannot prohibit expression of religious or irreligious viewpoints, they cannot prohibit expression of racist or anti\\-racist viewpoints, and so on. That said, there may be some murk pertaining to anti\\-discrimination legislation and the concept of a hostile environment. See for example [this statement from U. Michigan](https://hr.umich.edu/working-u-m/workplace-improvement/campus-commitment/what-hostile-environment): the underpinnings of any such restrictions are pretty broad (see the [USC statement](https://policy.usc.edu/student-misconduct/), including titles VI and VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and so on \u2013 those sorts of concerns apply to private schools as well).\n\nSWOSU has a long [list of prohibited activities](http://www.swosu.edu/resources/policies/students/affairs-activities/coc-proh-activ-defined.aspx). The only rule that marginally looks like it could cover bad language is the ban on\n\n> General misconduct that adversely affects the student's suitability as\n>  a member of the university community such as immorality, commission of\n>  major crimes, inciting disorders, association with known criminals,\n>  peace disturbances, disorderly conduct, and all acts that recklessly\n>  endanger the students or others.\n\nAnd that would be an incredible stretch.\n\nThe [residence handbook](http://www.swosu.edu/resources/pubforms/DisplayMedia.aspx?pid=403) states, pertaining to the rooms, that\n\n> Obscene material, including, but not limited to, pornographic\n>  literature, X\\-rated movies, and displays of profanity or language that\n>  is offensive to others may not be displayed.\n\nI assume that someone would be offended by the B word, so you can't display that on a poster in your room. This does not apply to verbal profanity or profanity in the lobby. Since they don't make the residency agreement publicly accessible, I can't see what they might have said there that implies a no\\-profanity rule. I should mention that university employees often over\\-interpret their authority, so it is not guaranteed that this is actual university policy (even is distributed by the front desk in a dorm). It may, however, be necessary to sue the university in order to get a clear indication that this is official policy, and that the policy is not a violation of the First Amendment. I would expect that the rationale has to do with \"hostile environment\". A second runner\\-up would be that it's about \"disorderly conduct\", which is where [Florida A\\&M](http://www.famu.edu/regulations/2.012%20Student%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20%20%20%20%20%20%204-14-14.pdf) places their anti\\-profanity rule.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal standing of this policy?\n\nA) The policy is entirely legal and enforceable as it falls under the university's right to maintain a non-hostile environment.\n\nB) The policy is likely unconstitutional as it violates First Amendment protections, unless the profanity constitutes fighting words or incites violence.\n\nC) The policy is legal only if it is explicitly stated in the university's official residence agreement and student code of conduct.\n\nD) The policy is enforceable only if the profanity used creates a hostile environment as defined by anti-discrimination legislation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because state universities, as government institutions, are bound by First Amendment restrictions. They cannot prohibit speech based solely on content, including profanity, unless it falls under specific categories like fighting words or incitement to violence. The policy as described likely overreaches constitutional bounds.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while universities have some latitude in maintaining their environment, a blanket ban on profanity would likely be too broad to withstand First Amendment scrutiny.\n\nOption C is incorrect because even if the policy is explicitly stated in official documents, it could still be unconstitutional if it violates First Amendment protections.\n\nOption D, while touching on a relevant concept of hostile environments, is too narrow. Not all profanity creates a hostile environment, and the policy as described seems to ban all profanity regardless of its impact."

I've NEVER stolen anything from their store (or any other store of this chain) before, and the store manager claims that their store has video surveillance. He can't admit that they have video evidence of ME personally stealing anything (which, if they have surveillance, they should have proof of, no?), but apparently, one of their employees has (mistakenly) identified me as a thief, resulting in my being permanently banned from their store. On top of that, the store manager claims that one of his employees (who he's named personally) is the one of who says that he saw me stealing merchandise. Yet, I've talked to this same employee before, and HE claims that another Asst. Manager of the store is the one who claims they saw me stealing something. So right there, they already have an inconsistency in their story.\n\nThere are other stores of this chain around me that I could can and do go to, but I don't like the idea of being labeled \\& treated unfairly for something that I didn't do, and on top of that, I feel like\\-\\-and I know this sounds...fantastical\\-\\-they're intentionally lying just to have a reason to ban me from their store.\n\nIs this right? And is there anything legally that I can do about this?\n\nThank any and all who answer in advance, and I look forward to hearing you all's thoughts on the situation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In theory, a store can ban you or anyone else for any reason except those protected by law against discrimination. As a practical matter, you potentially have various forms of recourse.\n\nThe first thing to do is to write the the CEO of the chain, with a long detailed letter describing the incidents, and naming names. Most CEO's don't want to deal with this kind of bad publicity, and will at least order an investigation, and make amends, if the internal investigation is in your favor. This would apply even to the late Sam Walton, if the chain is WalMart, or whoever the current CEO is.\n\nIf you are a member of a protected minority, or even have dark skin, you can sue the chain on those grounds. There will be a presumption that they barred you on grounds of race or color. Then the burden of proof will be on them to show that they didn't bar you for those causes. \n\nAs a form of \"entrapment,\" you should take a witness, basically the most influential person you can get hold of that's not a family member, to the store with you to ask them why you were barred. The mayor of your town would be ideal, more llkely it would be a boss, teacher, or clergyman, but in any event, someone who knows you well. If you can get them to accuse you of stealing in front of this third party, you have the makings of a defamation case.\n\nAnd even if you aren't a minority, you can sue them anyway. You can demand \"discovery\" of all internal documents, videos, etc. relating to your case. Your lawyer will also the right to \"depose\" (cross examine) all offending managers.There's a good chance that something embarrassing will turn up in the process. (Many defendants settle in connection with discovery.) You might want to hire a second (libel) lawyer to teach you how to publicize the case without running into libel laws.\n\nIf all this fails, the store can probably bar you, but you want to make it prohibitively expensive for them to do so, meaning that most rational people wouldn't bar you after the above. If they do, they're not rational and you're better off not using the store.",

[Cathi Herrod](https://www.azpolicy.org/about/leadership-team/cathi-herrod/) of the [Center for Arizona Policy](https://www.azpolicy.org/) [has claimed](https://twitter.com/azpolicy/status/1521328485553229824):\n\n> It is totally unprecedented for a draft opinion to be leaked.\n\nIs it unprecedented, or have draft SCOTUS opinions been leaked before?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Politico, who published this most recent leak, [also has an article about prior SOCTUS leaks](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-draft-opinion-00029475). Most of them were very minor or speculative, along the lines of the following two examples given:\n\n> In 1972, while Roe was under deliberation, an unbylined Washington Post story detailed the justices\u2019 internal wrangling on that subject. The Post story \u2014 which appeared days after the justices ordered a second round of arguments in the case \u2014 was attributed to anonymous informed sources and did not quote any draft opinions or internal memoranda, but described them in significant detail.\n\n> In 1979, ABC News Supreme Court correspondent Tim O\u2019Brien went on air with reports predicting the outcome of two decisions that were days away from release. Chief Justice Warren Burger launched an inquiry into whether anyone at the court had breached protocol, and a Government Printing Office employee involved in setting type for the court\u2019s rulings was transferred to a different division. The staffer denied leaking any information.\n\nA [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-court-roe-wade-politico-history-of-leaks-2022-5) article attributes the original Roe leak to a memo written by Justice William Douglas.\n\nThe Politico article continues listing a few other examples of a similar vein, where convenient coincidences suggested someone had an inside line on how the court was leaning: a passionate Senate speech here, an article predicting case decisions there, etc. When a leak is strongly suspected, the fingers are usually pointed at one or more of the court's clerks. The aforementioned Business Insider article also mentions that a [clerk leaked information to Vanity Fair about *Bush v. Gore*](https://www.proquest.com/docview/227362225).\n\nPolitico does mention the following as a more substantive example:\n\n> The gravest violations of Supreme Court confidentiality came just over a century ago and led to a law clerk being accused of leaking the outcome of cases to Wall Street traders so he and they could turn a quick profit.\n\n> The Justice Department fingered Ashton Embry, a longtime clerk to Justice Joseph McKenna, with being the source of leaks in business\\-related cases handed down in 1919 related to a wartime ban on liquor distilling and so\\-called patents allowing railroads to use particular lands.\n\nThe case suffered a number of setbacks, including a lack of any insider trading laws at the time and a disappearing witness, and ultimately Embry was never convicted of anything, or even brought to trial.\n\nAnd it ends with an extremely recent example from a few months ago:\n\n> During oral arguments on a Trump\\-era immigration policy this February, Justice Stephen Breyer mentioned that red states\u2019 claim of standing to defend the policy was \u201cpretty similar to what we had just allowed\u201d in a case involving who could defend a Kentucky abortion statute. But the high court had not yet ruled in the Kentucky case. It did so eight days later, ruling 8\\-1, as Breyer and many less\\-informed others had predicted.\n\nA full leak of a decision does not appear to have occurred before now. Leaks that appear to have been based in substantial part on (draft) opinions do appear to have occurred before, just not as a complete document. But insofar as the Embry incident may have resulted in actual and intentional profiteering off of leaked information it stands as a rather serious and consequential breach.",

This action avoids launching from park property but may still violate the \"otherwise operate\" clause.\n\nB) This is correct. Carrying a powered-off controller does not constitute \"operating\" a drone and is likely permissible under the ordinance.\n\nC) This would likely violate the \"otherwise operate\" clause of the ordinance, as you would be actively controlling the drone while on park property.\n\nD) This directly violates the ordinance's prohibition on launching and landing within the park.\n\nThe key is that while local governments cannot regulate airspace, they can regulate activities on their property, including the operation of drone controllers.

But the judge keeps allowing them to do it. Is there a rule or law that dictates how a judge can allow a legal team to use hearsays?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a quite complicated area of evidence law in the U.S. as there are many statements which are inadmissible under the hearsay rule, but there are also many statements that would otherwise be hearsay that fall within exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn U.S. federal court practice, hearsay is governed mostly by [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/table-of-contents/) 103, 104(a), 201, 801\\-807, and 1101\\.\n\nMost state court rules of evidence in the U.S. with regard to hearsay closely track the Federal Rules of Evidence. Some states do not follow this pattern but are substantively very similar as the Federal Rules of Evidence largely track of the common law rules of evidence before they were codified.\n\nRule 801 provides two exclusions from the definition of hearsay and a foundational definition. Rule 802 prohibits the introduction of hearsay into evidence unless an exception applies. Rule 803 provides 23 exceptions to the rule. Rule 804 provides five more exception to the rule. Rule 807 provides a final residual exception. So, in proceedings where the hearsay rule applies there are 31 main exceptions to the general rule, in addition to the argument that the general rule does not apply, but this still excludes lots of statements. Rule 201 (judicial notice) is another exception.\n\nSome of the main reasons to admit hearsay are that:\n\n1. It is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted (e.g. to prove the someone was present and talking at a place not that what they said was true, or to prove that someone said something defamatory or fraudulent, or to prove the someone made a \"verbal act\" with legal significance like agreeing to a contract or ordering someone to do something).\n2. It is a statement of a party opponent or someone affiliated with a party opponent (i.e. someone affiliated with the other side in the lawsuit or criminal case).\n3. It is a prior statement of a person made under oath and subject to cross\\-examination.\n4. It is a business record or public record or an \"ancient document\" (currently ancient means before 1998 in the federal courts, and typically more than twenty\\-years old in the state courts).\n5. It is a market quotation.\n6. It is a statement made describing things \"in the moment\", for medical diagnosis, or when the facts were fresh in the \"declarant's\" mind.\n7. It pertains to rights in real property, or to family relationships.\n8. It is a statement contrary to the interests of the person making it.\n9. It is a statement made when the declarant's death was believed to be imminent (i.e. a dying declaration).\n10. It is a statement made against someone who caused the witness to be unavailable.\n11. There are reasons that the statement is reliable and the intent to provide the statement is cleared with the court in advance.\n12. The matter upon which a statement is made is of general public knowledge not reasonably subject to dispute, is easily confirmed without doubt by a court, or is from a learned treatise.\n\nHearsay objections are also waived if a timely objection isn't made to them. See Federal Rule of Evidence 103\\. And, courts have some discretion to allow hearsay testimony on immaterial matters or matters that are not seriously disputed in the case for expediency's sake.\n\nRules 104(a) (excluding preliminary matters) and 1101 set forth when the hearsay rule applies and when it does not. Rule 1101 excludes from the rule a variety of preliminary matters, mostly in criminal cases such as:\n\n* grand\\-jury proceedings\n* extradition or rendition;\n* issuing an arrest warrant, criminal summons, or search warrant;\n* a preliminary examination in a criminal case;\n* sentencing;\n* granting or revoking probation or supervised release; and\n* considering whether to release on bail or otherwise.\n\nRule 805 governs the complicated situation of hearsay within hearsay. Rule 806 coordinates the hearsay rule with rules on how it is proper to introduce evidence about the credibility of a witness.\n\nThere is also a constitutional rule of criminal procedure, called the \"confrontation right\" that established minimum standards for the exclusion of hearsay evidence in criminal trials even when a court's procedural rules do not exclude it.\n\nMost states also have a hearsay rule pertaining to oral promises made by dead people called the dead man's statute, and limitations on introducing oral statements related to written agreements called respectively, the parole evidence rule and the statute of frauds.\n\nIn contrast, in the U.K. courts, roughly speaking, hearsay is generally admissible when the person making the underlying hearsay statement is available to testify, or is unavailable, which subsumes a large share of the U.S. hearsay rule, and makes much more hearsay admissible. U.K. practice would also allow admission of almost anything without a U.S. hearsay exception since they are derived from British common law evidence rules related to hearsay.\n\nThe main purpose of the hearsay rule is to prevent a defendant in a criminal case or lawsuit from being denied an ability to cross\\-examine witnesses in court because they would like to present evidence by affidavit or letter instead, effectively placing that burden on the prosecution in criminal cases, or on a plaintiff in simple civil cases, rather than forcing the defendant to pro\\-actively subpoena witnesses for the other side in the case. The rule has a broader sweep than that, but that is its core purpose.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a high-profile civil trial, the plaintiff's attorney attempts to introduce a statement made by the defendant's former employee about the defendant's business practices. The statement was made during a casual conversation at a company party two years ago. The employee has since moved abroad and cannot be located. Under which exception to the hearsay rule might this statement potentially be admissible?\n\nA) The present sense impression exception\nB) The business records exception\nC) The statement against interest exception\nD) The residual exception\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. The present sense impression exception typically applies to statements describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. This statement was made two years ago, not in the moment.\n\nB) Incorrect. While this relates to business practices, it doesn't qualify as a business record. Business records are typically formal documents kept in the regular course of business, not casual conversations at parties.\n\nC) Correct. The statement against interest exception (Rule 804(b)(3) in the Federal Rules of Evidence) could potentially apply here. If the statement about the defendant's business practices was sufficiently against the employee's interest (e.g., it could have jeopardized their job or exposed them to liability), and the employee is unavailable (which they are, having moved abroad and being unable to be located), this exception might allow the statement to be admitted.\n\nD) Incorrect. While the residual exception (Rule 807) could potentially apply, it's generally considered a last resort when no other exceptions fit. Given that there's a potentially applicable specific exception (statement against interest), courts would typically consider that before turning to the residual exception.\n\nThis question tests understanding of hearsay exceptions, particularly in complex scenarios where multiple factors (unavailability of declarant, nature of the statement, context of the statement) must be considered."

According to standard legal practices, illegally obtained money that is seized during a criminal investigation is typically forfeited to the state. This occurs through asset forfeiture laws, which allow the government to take possession of assets believed to be connected to criminal activity. \n\nOption A is incorrect because returning the money to the criminal would essentially allow them to profit from their illegal activities, minus a small fine. \n\nOption B is not correct because destroying currency is generally illegal and wasteful.\n\nOption D, while it might seem plausible, is not the standard practice. The burden of proof typically falls on the accused to prove the legitimate origin of suspicious funds, not on the state to hold the money until such proof is provided.\n\nIt's important to note that this forfeiture can occur even if the individual is acquitted of criminal charges, as the standard of proof for asset forfeiture is often lower than that required for a criminal conviction."

It does not ban all full-body swimwear, but rather focuses on clothing with religious connotations. Wetsuits and other non-religious full-body swimwear are not affected by this ban. While the ban would indeed prevent nuns and priests from swimming in their religious attire (as mentioned in option D), this is not the primary focus of the regulation. The ban is broader than just burkinis (contrary to option B) but does not extend to all full-body swimwear (contrary to option A). Therefore, option C most accurately represents the scope and intent of the ban as described in the provided information."

They will advocate one way or another;\n>  this is undeniable. The instructions are purposefully confusing. The\n>  reason is this: when we fight over jury instruction, inherently, one\n>  of us will want an instruction that is hard to understand, for a lay\n>  person. This is because we want them to apply the law as it is\n>  commonly (mis)understood, not as it truly is, because that's not good\n>  for our case.\n\nAnd a comment sums the answer up nicely:\n\n> tl;dr jury trials have become a theater where attorneys on each side\n>  will try to confuse the poor laypersons on the jury into voting in\n>  their favor. Lawyers will typically see through that and negate all\n>  the showmanship that the attorneys will do.\n\nThis is the first I've heard of this, and it seems unethical, unjust, and deceitful, all words that one would expect never to be able to use when talking about the legal system. \n\nWhy is this allowed? Why doesn't the law ensure that jurors, laymen and experts alike, are given clear and concise instructions? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While it is true that jury instructions are typically less than optimal, it is ideological hyperbole or cynicism to claim that instructions are *purposely* confusing. The ultimate source of the confusion is that the legal system has to assume (pretend) that it has clear\\-cut rules that any reasonable person can easily understand and automatically apply. In order to maintain uniformity of the law, there is an externally\\-defined instruction that a judge may read (rather than giving *his* personal spin on what \"reasonable doubt\" means or what the relationship is between \"reasonable doubt\" and convicting a defendant). Once the relevant body of government (committee of judges and lawyers) has established the apparently correct formula for expressing the applicable legal concept, they don't mess with it, until SCOTUS overturns decisions enough times based on crappy instructions.\n\nLegal professionals are trained to carefully scrutinze language so as to achieve a single interpretation of a given clause (never mind the fact that there turn out to be many such interpretations). Since they can apply these interpretive rules, it is assumed that anyone can apply them. But in fact, we know that people *don't* just use literal semantic principles to reach conclusions \u2013 but the law resist pandering to that imperfection in human behavior.\n\nThere is a huge literature on problems of jury instructions, some of the better of which relies on psycholinguistic experimentation to establish that a given instruction is confusing or gives the wrong result. See for example Solan's \"[Refocusing the burden of proof..](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1293&context=faculty)\" (and references therein) that addresses the problem of the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" instruction, which has the unintended consequence of implying that the defense has an obligation to create a doubt (which is not the case, and allows conviction if there is the weakest imaginable evidence which hasn't been refuted). But who gets to decide what the improved instructions should say? The instructions have to correctly state what the law holds (where \"the law\" means not just statutes, but the trillions of relevant court decisions and applicable regulations). Thus there is massive inertia, and improved jury instructions will not come about quickly.",

When a property management company signs a lease agreement on behalf of a landlord, they are acting as an agent for the landlord. The landlord, not the property management company, is the actual party to the contract. Therefore, the termination of the property management company's contract does not affect the validity of the lease agreement between the landlord and the tenant. The lease remains fully valid and enforceable, and no action is required from the tenant. This principle is consistent with the legal concept that changes in property management or even ownership do not invalidate existing tenancy agreements in most jurisdictions."

W (which includes you and some others) have an NDA with company A, which prohibits A from using any material information provided by W, for two years.

It depends in whether you have a property interest in the protected information / relation. For example, if you were just a wage employee of W and you quite, you probably have no property interest in the information. If you were a partner and were bought out, there will surely be some written statement of the division of company property. You might have bargained away that right in exchange for more cash; or you might have retained the interest. If you have a property interest in the protected info, you could sue for (your share of the) damages. This is about who has standing.

I'm wondering at what point not reporting a crime is itself a crime.\n\nI know that if someone happens to witness a bar fight and doesn't immediately call the cops they are not guilty of a crime (or I assume they aren't, unless they're technically guilty and simply never prosecuted for it). This implies that the refusal to report a crime is not, by itself, a crime.\n\nHowever, I'm also pretty sure if, for example, a women knows her boyfriend is sexually assaulting their child and turns a blind eye to it she can be convicted as an accomplice to the crime. Likewise, I think if you're riding in the car with someone who does a hit and run you are required to report it or be an accomplice.\n\nSo I'm wondering where this line is drawn. At what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?\n\nFurthermore, if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate \u2013 for instance a wife getting a new fur coat after her husband robs a bank despite her not approving of the husband's actions \u2013 does this make her an accomplice? Is there a line here to draw, presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR\n-----\n\n**Never**; unless there is a specific law in the jurisdiction that requires it, however, that is a separate crime, it doesn't make you an accomplice to the first crime.\n\nThere is no general obligation to report a crime; some jurisdictions may have legislated to make reporting mandatory, either generally or for specific professions.\n\n[Accomplice](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Accomplice)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the link, an accomplice is:\n\n> One who knowingly, voluntarily, and with common intent unites with the principal offender in the commission of a crime. One who is in some way concerned or associated in commission of crime; partaker of guilt; one who aids or assists, or is an Accessory. One who is guilty of complicity in crime charged, either by being present and aiding or abetting in it, or having advised and encouraged it, though absent from place when it was committed, though mere presence, **Acquiescence, or silence, in the absence of a duty to act, is not enough, no matter how reprehensible it may be, to constitute one an accomplice.** One is liable as an accomplice to the crime of another if he or she gave assistance or encouragement or failed to perform a legal duty to prevent it with the intent thereby to promote or facilitate commission of the crime.\n\nMandatory Reporting\n-------------------\n\nMany jurisdictions impose an obligation on certain professions to report suspected crimes. The most common and obvious being a police officer who generally has an obligation to report all suspected crimes. Other professions include doctors, teachers, nurses etc. in the case of suspected child abuse; sometimes this extends to elder abuse but usually doesn't include an obligation to report spousal abuse.\n\nIf a person with such an obligation fails to report, they have not become an accomplice to the original crime or any future crime; they have broken a different law on their own.\n\nGeneral consequences\n--------------------\n\nIn general, a witness to a crime is not required to report it. They could be asked to give a statement but are not obliged to and would not be subject to arrest. If they were subpoenaed to appear in court as a witness then they would be obliged to do so and give evidence; failure to do either would be contempt of court.\n\nTo be clear, a perpetrator of a crime is also not obliged to report it and is protected from contempt by rules about self\\-incrimination like the US Fifth Amendment. As an aside, NSW, Australia has recently passed a law that while maintaining the accused's right not to testify has allowed juries and judges to draw inference from the silence in their deliberations.\n\nSpecific Laws\n-------------\n\nSome jurisdictions have specific laws that make it a crime not to report. For example, in New South Wales, Australia Section [316](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s316.html) of the Crimes Act makes it an offence to conceal a serious indictable offence (i.e. one with a maximum penalty or 5 or more years gaol) that a person \"knows or believes\" has occurred without \"reasonable excuse\". The punishment is up to 2 years; if you solicit or accept any benefit for concealing it, the punishment is 5 years. Prosecution for people who came by the information as a result of practicing certain [professions](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/cr2015173/s4.html) requires permission of the Attorney General.\n\nPrivilege\n---------\n\nA person may become aware of a crime through disclosure as part of a professional\\-client relationship. Such disclosures may be subject to privilege.\n\nAt common law, only the lawyer\\-client relationship is legally privileged meaning that a lawyer cannot disclose what their client has said to them. This does not cover advice on committing or covering up a crime \\- if a lawyer does this there is no privilege and the lawyer may become an accomplice.\n\nClosely related is the litigation privilege where communications prepared as part of litigation (including criminal prosecutions) are protected even if they are not between the lawyer and the client.\n\nSome jurisdictions have statutorily extended this privilege to other relationships: doctor\\-patient, priest\\-confessor, pastor\\-parishioner, accountant\\-client, psychologist\\-patient etc. Check your local guides.\n\nYour examples\n-------------\n\n1. The bar fight witness has no obligation to report and is not an accomplice. In NSW, this is the crime of [affray](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s93c.html), a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.\n2. The mother of the child has no obligation to report and, unless she is assisting or encouraging the commission of the sexual assault, is not an accomplice. Further, spousal testimonial privilege does not apply; i.e. the mother could be compelled to give evidence against the boyfriend or face contempt. In NSW, this is the crime of [Sexual intercourse\\-child under 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s66a.html), a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.\n3. The passenger has no obligation to report and is not an accomplice. In NSW, this is the crime of [failing to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death or grievous bodily harm](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52ab.html), a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.\n\nSub\\-questions\n--------------\n\n> At what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?\n\nAt the point where the person moves from being a witness to a participant by assisting or encouraging the perpetrator.\n\n> ... if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate, ..., does this make them an accomplice?\n\nNo, however, if the person knows that the benefit are the proceeds of crime then they could be charged with receiving stolen property and would not have good title in the property even if they didn't know.\n\n> presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?\n\nIt depends if they know the money is the proceeds of crime; if they do then receiving it is a crime in its own right but it doesn't make them an accomplice.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah owns a small cafe. One of her regular customers, Tom, is known in the community to be involved in illegal gambling operations. Sarah suspects that the money Tom uses to pay for his daily coffee and pastry comes from his illegal activities. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's legal position?\n\nA) Sarah is legally obligated to report Tom's suspected illegal activities to the authorities or she could be charged as an accomplice.\n\nB) Sarah becomes an accomplice to Tom's crimes by accepting payment for goods, even if she doesn't actively encourage or facilitate his illegal activities.\n\nC) Sarah has no legal obligation to report Tom's activities, but if she knowingly accepts money that she believes to be proceeds of crime, she could be charged with a separate offense.\n\nD) As long as Sarah does not directly participate in Tom's illegal gambling operations, she cannot be held legally responsible in any way for serving him or accepting his money.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, there is generally no legal obligation to report a crime unless specific laws in the jurisdiction require it (which is not mentioned for this scenario). However, knowingly accepting proceeds of crime can be a separate offense, even if the person is not directly involved in the original criminal activity. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no general obligation to report a crime, and failure to report doesn't make someone an accomplice.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because merely accepting payment for goods doesn't make someone an accomplice, especially if they're not encouraging or facilitating the crime.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Sarah wouldn't be an accomplice, she could still potentially face legal consequences for knowingly accepting proceeds of crime.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the concepts of mandatory reporting, accomplice liability, and handling proceeds of crime."

What does that mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Syed was convicted of two crimes: first\\-degree murder and kidnapping. In many American court systems, including civilian criminal courts in the state of Maryland, convicts receive a sentence for *each* offense. They don't get one overall sentence to address all their crimes. Sentencing guidelines may make sentence *calculation* work by computing one sentence for all the offenses, but the sentence is actually imposed by specifying a certain sentence for each offense and setting them to run concurrently or consecutively to match the guidelines sentence. \n\nThe judge gave Syed life on the murder charge, but he also needed a sentence for kidnapping. The judge picked the maximum of 30 years. Thus, life plus 30\\. The sentences can run either concurrently or consecutively; if one sentence is life, that isn't necessarily an important issue, but it could potentially have parole implications.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Adnan Syed, he was sentenced to life plus 30 years. Which of the following statements best explains this sentencing structure?\n\nA) The judge made a mistake and accidentally added an extra 30 years to the life sentence.\nB) The \"plus 30 years\" is a standard addition to all life sentences in Maryland.\nC) Syed was convicted of two separate crimes, with distinct sentences for each that could run either concurrently or consecutively.\nD) The 30 years represent a minimum time Syed must serve before being eligible for parole on his life sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Adnan Syed was convicted of two separate crimes: first-degree murder and kidnapping. In the American court system, particularly in Maryland, convicts receive individual sentences for each offense they are found guilty of, rather than one overall sentence. The life sentence was for the murder charge, while the additional 30 years was the maximum sentence for the kidnapping charge. These sentences can be set to run either concurrently (at the same time) or consecutively (one after the other). Even though one sentence is life imprisonment, the distinction between concurrent and consecutive sentencing could have implications for parole eligibility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the judge did not make a mistake; this sentencing structure is intentional and based on convictions for multiple crimes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the additional 30 years is not a standard addition to all life sentences in Maryland, but rather a specific sentence for the kidnapping charge.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the 30-year sentence could potentially affect parole considerations, it is not explicitly defined as a minimum time to be served before parole eligibility on the life sentence."
