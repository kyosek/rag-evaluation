There is no mobile app for the current operating systems, last time it has been updated 6 years ago and now you can't play it on newer phones. But you still can play the game at their Website for free.\n\nNow what if I create an Application, that uses a web\\-browser engine to \"stream\" the game, so you can play it. The website gets cut off, only the game is visible. Could Miniclip sue me for that?\n\nI don't talk about other things like a name for the app. If I would call it \"Gravity Guy\", they can sue me, I mean the specific scenario \"The app connects to Miniclip and opens the game in fullscreen, so I can play it\". While connecting and opening, the user only sees a Loading\\-screen\n\nEDIT: With streaming, I just mean that a javascript game you normally have in your browser gets displayed in fullscreen on your phone. The game is not by me, but as the app is just a browser for it, it shouldn't be illegal I think\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That's an interesting question. You want to set up a business that essentially combines three different concepts: \n\n* Network streaming from your PC to a different screen across the network using remote screen software; e.g. [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/features/), or a Chromecast, e.g. playing a PC\\-only game on your iPad, which I've done.\n* Basically [AWS](https://lg.io/2015/07/05/revised-and-much-faster-run-your-own-highend-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html): Renting a dedicated server, racked in a server room far, far away, and remote\\-screening off that server. AND, time\\-sharing the dedicated server; i.e. the server is dedicated to you *while you are using it*, and an hour later your environment may be boxed, and the actual iron allocated to someone else.\n\nSo in principle, you'd have an array of racks and racks of dedicated PCs, all headless or blades. They'd all be preloaded with a standard image, with a virgin (un\\-customered) Steam, GoG, Battle.net etc. etc. Customer would \n\n1. Lease a dedicated PC from you, and you'd grab one out of the pool of available PCs.\n2. Remotely controlling it (a\\-la Parsec): Launch Steam etc., log into *their* account.\n3. Install a game on it.\n4. Play the game as long as they liked.\n5. Quit playing and log out.\n6. You'd wipe the PC's disk and return it to the pool.\n\nI'm with you so far. ([Blizzard isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/comments/cmi5wa/anybody_homestreaming_world_of_warcraft/)). \n\nWhere you might get in trouble is you try to *also* combine this idea with [GameFly](https://www.gamefly.com). Remember when Netflix was DVDs showing up in your mail, and you'd stick them in the pouch, mail it back, and the next one would automatically show up? That's the classic video rental model. The video store pays once for the tape ($89 for a VHS tape back in the day) and doesn't pay per\\-rental. Parallel to Old Netflix was a service called GameFly, that still exists (as does Old Netflix). So I suppose the next shoe to drop is that if your user wants to play a DVD\\-based console game, \"an elf in your warehouse\" will (in a few seconds) grab one of your stock copies and drop it in the DVD slot, right? (except the elf, and the DVD slot, will be virtualized.) *Now you better watch out*. \n\n---\n\nThe case to pay heed to is [Aereo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aereo). Aereo was a public\\-policy advocacy litigation firm; they just didn't know it. They thought they were an Internet streaming company offering streaming and time\\-shifting of over\\-the\\-air TV to people in the NYC service area). \n\nNYC citizens have trouble with TV reception because of all the steel buildings. Aereo *already knew* it would be illegal to just have one well\\-placed antenna and stream to everybody. So they had a well\\-placed warehouse with *thousands* of antennas, each connected to a PC with a DVR. So **each customer would get a dedicated antenna and PC/DVR**. And I thought that settled the matter; but they finally got in front of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said \"**Nope, the clever technology implementation does NOT negate the obvious intent of Congress, in requiring cable companies to pay TV stations for the right to rebroadcast their stations**. It looks, walks and quacks like a cable TV operation, so we're treating it like that for the law.\" Their house of cards immediately collapsed *because they now owed years of back fees to all the TV stations they were streaming*, and that broke their back.",

It is standard legal knowledge that copyright law protects expression and not ideas, that some element of creativity is required for a work to be protected, and that words and short phrases are not protected. It is also often widely believed that permission of the copyright holder is required to create a \u201crelated product\u201d, such as a video game version of Star Trek, Harry Potter or James Bond (now partially in the public domain). Certain graphics associated with the protected work clearly require a license to use (I explicitly am not asking anything about trademark protection). If we set aside copying of graphic objects, and copying of non\\-minimal stretches of text, is there any case law evidence that supports the belief that any work \u201cabout\u201d a protected work requires a copyright license? For example, does the case law tell me whether I can legally write a novel fully exploiting the ideas of the Man\\-Kzin Wars novels (a warlike feline spacefaring race etc.)?\n\nAn optional complication involves the putative non\\-copyrightability of words. The words \u201cchmee; chrowl; kzinrret; kdaptist; sthondat; strakh; wtsai\u201d are introduced in protected works \u2013 they are not words of English. They pass the sniff\\-test for creativity, but the US Copyright Office by policy declines to register individual words. However, presence of these words is clear evidence of copying of a protected work. It therefore may be important to distinguish infringement claims that involve the ideas of a protected work, and the additional copying of distinctive terminology.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A copyright protects particular expressions of ideas, not ideas themselves. So, general themes are not generally protected by copyright. Indeed, there is actually case law [to the opposite effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire), that prevents thematic elements particular to a genre from being granted copyright protection:\n\n> Sc\u00e8ne \u00e0 faire (French for \"scene to be made\" or \"scene that must be\n> done\"; plural: sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire) is a scene in a book or film which is\n> almost obligatory for a book or film in that genre.

I am seeking, after years of struggle,medication and therapy, a diagnosis.\n\nLast week, I booked a consultation for the next available slot at an aesthetic clinic to enquire about dermal fillers. At the appointment the following day, the clinic director told me she instead recommended something called a thread lift, a much more extreme and invasive non\\-surgical face lift procedure. I am a 33 year old female, and even though she had my date of birth right in front of her on the consultation form, she kept telling me my genetics were against me as I had serious collagen loss at age 36\\. I was at that moment in a complete irrational, impulsive, obsessive frenzy and said I wanted to do the procedure. They told me they could move things around that day and book me in for in just over 1 hour that same day. I signed the forms and then paid \u00a34000, over half of my entire savings, for the procedure an hour and a half later.\n\nI am in complete shock that I did this and truly believe I wasn't in a clear and logical state of mind. I am also shocked that the clinic did no screening for mental health flags and also that they offered me the procedure in such a short timeframe after my initial consultation (1\\.5 hours later), without giving me time to go away, reflect on the information they'd provided, to research and make an informed decision. If I had done that, I'm certain I wouldn't have gone ahead with it and willingly given away such a substantial sum of money.\n\nI'm unsure if there is anything I can do here, as I obviously willingly signed the forms and agreed to it all on the day. The forms also included sentences around 'i understand I can withdraw at any time/I'm not being pressured into going ahead,' which I ultimately signed.\n\nAre there any UK laws specifically around consumers making poor decisions during a mental health crisis, and/or medical service providers not screening for such concerns, and/or not giving patient sufficient time to independently make a considered decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You went to this clinic voluntarily out of your own free will; things would be different if they had contacted you first. Did they have any reason to screen you for mental health problems? If you mentioned mental health problems, that might make a difference. Did they in any way force you to sign up and pay, for example walk with you to a cash machine? That might make a difference.\n\nIn the forms it said \"I understand that I can withdraw at any time\". That's what you should have done. \"I'm not being pressured into going ahead\" on the other hand would likely be worthless, since if you were pressured, you would have signed this anyway. But that doesn't mean you were pressured, you'd have to give evidence for this.\n\nUnless you can show that your mental problems are so bad that you will make decisions against your will, this looks difficult. And if you have those mental problems, that might mean that someone else would have to make those decisions.\n\nI would suggest consulting a lawyer and ask for their opinion. A lawyer would know better than you or me, and lawyers can often write convincing letters, for example they might convince the clinic to charge you only their actual cost. Which would still be expensive, but a lot cheaper than \u00a34,000\\.",

The consumer voluntarily signed the consent forms, which included clauses about understanding the right to withdraw and not being pressured. This makes it challenging to seek full legal recourse. However, the short timeframe between consultation and procedure, along with the lack of mental health screening, could potentially be used as grounds for negotiation with the clinic or through legal channels. The answer suggests consulting a lawyer, who might be able to negotiate a partial refund or reduced fee based on the clinic's actual costs. Options A and D are incorrect as there are no specific UK laws mentioned that require mental health screening or automatically void contracts in such situations. Option B overstates the strength of the legal case, given the voluntary nature of the consumer's actions."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice under US copyright law?\n\nA) It is always legal to use book cover images from the Google Books API for commercial purposes.\nB) It is never legal to use book cover images from the Google Books API without explicit permission from the copyright holder.\nC) The legality of using book cover images from the Google Books API depends on various factors, including fair use, public domain status, and specific licensing agreements.\nD) Google Books API automatically grants users the right to redistribute all images for any purpose.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legality of using book cover images from the Google Books API is complex and depends on multiple factors. As explained in the documentation:\n\n1. Google may have a license to distribute the images, but this doesn't necessarily extend to users of their API.\n2. Fair use statutes might allow the use of book covers for identification purposes in some jurisdictions.\n3. Some book covers might be in the public domain and thus free to use.\n4. The specific licensing agreements between Google and copyright holders can vary.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes and assumes blanket permission. Answer B is too restrictive, as there are cases where usage might be legal without explicit permission. Answer D is incorrect because Google does not automatically grant redistribution rights for all images in their API."

The 14th Amendment prohibits the deprivation of liberty \"without due process of law.\" This means that liberties can be restricted if done so through proper legal channels. The legislative process, when conducted properly, typically constitutes due process. Therefore, laws passed through the normal legislative procedure can restrict certain personal liberties (such as recreational drug use or gambling) without violating the 14th Amendment.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. While individual words cannot be copyrighted, curated lists of words chosen for a specific purpose can be protected by copyright. This is similar to how Hasbro owns the copyright to the Scrabble dictionary.\n\n2. The presence or absence of a title does not determine copyright status.\n\n3.

According to the information provided, the formation of a contract in online retail typically occurs at the time of shipping, not at the time of order placement.

How do people do it and why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While software is often the subject of pirating, the term is also used generally for unauthorized use of any copyrighted material. It turns out that this terminology is very old. [Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement#.22Piracy.22) that this sense of the word piracy is attested as far back as 1603 CE and was used as part of the language of a copyright treaty as early as 1886 CE. \n\nIn particular, people who use or distribute unauthorized copies of movies, television shows, videos of live concerts, and music are also frequently said to be engaged in pirating of the material.\n\nThe term is used in this context in [testimony before Congress](https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat052505.html) by the chief U.S. Copyright official in 2005\\.\n\n[Critics of the term](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html) argue that \"piracy,\" which originally meant armed robbery of tangible property on the high seas (a form of theft), is an inapt way to describe copyright infringement which is really different in kind than theft because copyright infringement does not deprive anyone of use of the materials, it merely impairs the legally granted monopoly of someone regarding how it shall be used. As Matthew Yglesias [explains at Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html):\n\n> If I steal your car then you don't have a car anymore, whereas if I\n>  duplicate a digital media file we both end up with it.

Great.\n\nLet's say that in addition to engineering (or whatever), I write a nonfiction book about investing in commercial real estate. Can I secure an original work of authorship, as in a **copyright**, because it is out of scope?\n\nWhat about extending that to a **patent**? If I come up with an original process for effectively fermenting kombucha, what are the ramifications of filing a provisional patent assigning the rights to myself?\n\nAre there clear criterion for what is \"in\\-scope\" and \"out\\-of\\-scope\"?\n\nFor clarity, the jurisdiction is U.S./Nevada.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not clear, until the parties make it clear, though individual states may have partially answered the question. There may be a requirement for the business to clearly delimit what they are laying claim to. So if there are clauses exempting works created by the employee wholely on their own time, not using company property including confidential trade secrets, which in not directly related to the company's business including anticipated developments, then that clearly delimits what the company can claim. An expression like \"in the course of employment with the company\" is vague and could refer to \"during that time period\" or to \"as a result of\". If the intent is \"during that time period\", then you should say it that way, and perhaps the candidate will decide to not take the position. Since the company gets to write the contract, the courts will interpret ambiguous language against the interest of the contract's author.\n\nIf the contract is written differently for copyright versus patents, then patents could be handled differently. The main difference between patents vs. copyright is that patents are more valuable, so the company has a stronger incentive to snag all patents, but this is not a function of the law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An engineer employed by TechCorp in Nevada has signed a standard employment agreement with an intellectual property clause stating that all inventions and works created \"within the scope of and during the period of\" their employment belong to the company. Which of the following scenarios is MOST LIKELY to be considered outside the scope of this agreement?\n\nA) The engineer develops a new algorithm for optimizing database queries during their lunch break at work.\nB) The engineer creates a mobile app for tracking personal finances on weekends using their personal computer.\nC) The engineer invents a new type of ergonomic office chair while brainstorming ways to improve the company's work environment.\nD) The engineer writes a science fiction novel about AI during their daily commute on public transportation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is most likely to be considered outside the scope of the employment agreement because:\n\n1. Writing a science fiction novel is not directly related to the engineer's primary job responsibilities or the company's core business.\n2. It's created during the commute, which is typically not considered work time.\n3. It doesn't use company resources or confidential information.\n4. It's a creative work (copyright) rather than a technical invention, which may be interpreted differently in some agreements.\n\nOption A is likely within scope as it's related to the engineer's work and done during work hours. Option B, while done on personal time and equipment, could potentially be seen as related to the company's work if they deal with financial software. Option C is directly related to improving the work environment and could be seen as within the scope of employment. The novel in Option D is the least likely to be considered within the scope of the employment agreement."

However, these do not contain adequate treatments of legal content acquisition. \n\nProviding that an individual:\n\n1. Seeks to use copyrighted content that is not available from publicly\\-licensed sources (e.g. MovieClips.com, public domain)\n2. Uses content in an objectively \"fair\\-use\" manner\n3. Takes illegal measures to acquire content (e.g. [ripping DVDs](http://lifehacker.com/5978326/is-it-legal-to-rip-a-dvd-that-i-own), torrent, breach of contract)\n\n\t* Will fair\\-use and source legality be determined separately in a court of law?\n\t* Further, will a judicial determination that the content source (or method of acquisition) was illegal necessarily determine that usage was \"unfair\"?\n\t* Conversely, does fair\\-use ever justify the method of sourcing content (especially dvd\\-ripping)? This has been implied in responses elsewhere on stackexchange.\n\nContext: United States\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two senses in which \"content\" acquisition could be legal / illegal. One regards the act of copying from a source, and the other regards the legality of accessing that source. Copyright law does not distinguish between making an unauthorized copy from a DVD that you own, as opposed to one that you stole.\n\nThere is a practical difference between stealing a DVD and copying it, or hacking into a computer and stealing material, in that these acts involve a crime plus an actionable civil tort (copyright infringement): they involve \"illegal acquisition\" in the second sense, but not necessarily the first. Conversely, acquisition of a borrowed or owned DVD is not illegal, but acquiring material (copying) from the source may be illegal.\n\nCopyright law does not distinguish whether your access was legal or illegal. If you steal a DVD and copy an amount that is consistent with fair use, you may be prosecuted for theft, but that would not create liability for copyright infringement that would not exist if access to the material were lawful. \"Ripping\" and \"torrent\" are just popular ways of data acquisition typically associated with infringement. Copying from a DVD is not illegal, and streaming, no matter how fast, is not illegal. Copying without permission or in excess of fair use is what is illegal.\n\nHowever, outside the bounds of the law, the rights holder might find it okay if you make a copy if you own the DVD (the main record industry special interest organization at some point said \"we don't mind\", but that doesn't change the law). \n\nThe Creative Commons copyright\\-renunciation license CC\\-0, and expired\\-copyright works (so\\-called \"public domain\") are effectively immune to the limitations of fair use, in the former case because permission has been unconditionally granted, and in the latter case because the law no longer protects the work (copyright is not perpetual). Most publicly\\-licensed material is conditionally licensed, and thus it is possible to infringe copyright of publicly\\-licensed material (by not satisfying the license conditions). Even so, *all* licensed (and non\\-licensed) works are subject to a fair use analysis. Whether or not you break into a computer or have permission to access the computer, and in either event if you copy material subject to the Creative Commons Non\\-Commercial license NC, your liability for copyright infringement is strictly a function of whether you have complied with the license terms, or else your use is \"fair use\".\n\nIf a person puts an illegal copy of a book \"out there\" and protects it with a password that only he knows, the courts are likely to treat such an offense more generously, as compared to a person who wholesale steals hundreds of books and makes them flagrantly available to one and all. This isn't part of the official treatment of copyright violation, rather, it is an allowed and permissible element of discretion that juries and courts have, in rendering judgment.",

According to the information provided, copyright law does not distinguish between whether your access to the content was legal or illegal when determining fair use. Fair use is evaluated based on how the content is used, not how it was acquired. However, illegal methods of acquiring content (such as stealing) can lead to separate legal consequences outside of copyright infringement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because fair use can apply to content regardless of how it was acquired.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the method of acquisition is not a key factor in determining fair use, although it may lead to separate legal issues.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because ripping a DVD, even one you own, is not automatically considered fair use. The amount copied and the purpose of the copying are factors in determining fair use, not ownership alone."

Furthermore, the links must\n> not be nofollowed.\n\nThe relevant section (4c) of the licence itself says:\n\n> If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\nIn the Meta Stack Exchange discussion it is argued that Stack Exchange are trying to assert restrictions which are not part of the CC BY\\-SA licence:\n\n1. To hyperlink each author, in addition to the page itself\n2. To use a direct link rather than a shortener\n3. To not use nofollow\n\nDoes the CC BY\\-SA licence allow primary distributors to specify restrictions like these, or can secondary distributors ignore them and still be compliant with the licence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Stack Exchange \"requirement\" of a particular type of attribution is unlikely to be enforceable, given the terms of the CC BY\\-SA license.\n\nThe actual Creative Commons license, the part that governs the relationship between the parties, is the \"legal code\" license agreement. The CC BY\\-SA agreement contains two clauses relevant to the form of attribution.\n\nOne, as the question points out, is paragraph 4(c), which states that \"credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner.\" This language is much less restrictive than the StackExchange blog post.\n\nThe other relevant clause is the last clause of the agreement, paragraph 8(e), which is a standard integration clause:\n\n> This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nIn other words, any changes to the license, which would include any additional restrictions on the nature of the attribution that may be given (besides the \"reasonable manner\" specified in the license) are effective only if both parties agree to do so in writing.\n\nThe specific law applied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is going to vary, but in general, in the United States, when you have a fully integrated agreement such as this license, a court will not look at anything outside the four corners of the agreement to determine the parties' rights and duties.\n\nIf a court finds this to be a fully integrated agreement, and refuses to consider \"parol evidence,\" meaning statements outside of the contract, then StackExchange can post a page asking people to attribute content in a particular way, but no, they cannot require it.",

I had this check from a ad company that was in my car, at the time I didn't have a account so I got his money out of the atm.\n\nThen I proceeded to deposit my check like I have down before, they said it takes 24 to 48 hrs like always. Monday morning comes around and the bank called him and said they were closing his account for fraudulent check. All the bank did was close his account no charges.\n\nBut today because we are not together he thinks he can press charges on me can he?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It will depend a lot on how you endorsed the check. You should have signed the check over to your ex, and put \"For Deposit Only\" in ex's account. I bet you didn't do anything like that, because that's fairly obscure banking stuff they don't teach in school anymore.\n\nBut yes, taking money out of an account not yours, without permission and without replacing that money, will put you in legal jeopardy **because you did not promptly replace the money** /cover it / make it good. The substance of the crime is in not replacing the money promptly.\n\nI mean it's technically a crime if you do replace the money, but there is no *mens rea* or \"guilty mind\", which is an essential element of a crime. For instance, I one pumped gas and drove off. I got a phone call from a police detective, and I immediately high\\-tailed it back to the gas station and paid my bill with a hearty apology. *Nothing more was made of it*.\n\nSince your boyfriend now seems to be hostile, I would advise re\\-paying your boyfriend using a payment method which is tracked and leaves a paper trail \\- like a cashier's check from a bank where you have a relationship. If you pay the boyfriend cash, nothing proves you paid it!\n\nYou might even consider opening your own account at the bank involved in this crisis. Then you can say \"look, that wasn't a fraudulent check at all, I just used bad judgment sharing an ATM, and I'd like to deposit that check into my own account here\". The banker may be able to do that relatively efficiently, since they will have the check (or a Check21 compliant certified copy). Expect that money to have a long hold on it.",

Additionally, opening an account at the same bank where the incident occurred allows the person to demonstrate that the original check was not fraudulent, just mishandled. This approach addresses both the legal concerns of repaying the money and potentially resolving the issue with the bank. Option A is risky because cash payments can't be proven. Option B ignores the potential legal consequences. Option D is unnecessarily passive and could lead to more serious legal issues."

The conclusion that a crime \"will be committed, but for...\" also has to be clearly supported by reason.",

She believes the only way to prevent this is by disabling Bob's own vehicle. Which of the following actions would most likely be considered legally justifiable under the necessity defense?\n\nA) Alice steals Bob's car keys to prevent him from driving to her house\nB) Alice calls the police to report Bob's planned theft\nC) Alice slashes Bob's car tires to immobilize his vehicle\nD) Alice hacks Bob's car computer to disable the ignition system\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe necessity defense requires that the action taken be the only reasonable means to prevent a crime, with no less harmful alternatives available. In this scenario:\n\nA) Stealing Bob's keys is itself a crime and not the only option available.\nC) Slashing tires is an act of vandalism and excessive given other options.\nD) Hacking the car's computer is likely illegal and unnecessary given alternatives.\n\nB) Calling the police is the correct answer because it's a legal action that can prevent the crime without committing another offense. It's the least harmful option that fulfills the requirement of necessity by involving proper authorities rather than taking matters into one's own hands illegally. This aligns with the principle that necessity defense is only valid when there are no other legal means to prevent the crime."

My ex's attorney, who I contacted a week ago, told me she's so busy that she does not intend to contact my ex until her bigger cases are out of the way and she gets settled in with a new office assistant. She seemed to gloat on the fact that it'll take longer to get a hearing than to wait until she has time. She knows that if she drags it out, I stand to face minor financial damages and harm to my credit.\n\nIs the attorney's behavior ethical, particularly in terms of communicating w/ clients over material concerns? Also, I have a lurking suspicion that my ex didn't pay her.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In jurisdictions where the ABA's model rules have been adopted, an attorney \"shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, *see* [Rule 4\\.4](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_4_respect_for_rights_of_third_persons.html). But here, it's unlikely the delay would amount to a violation of ethical standards unless it drags on for a lengthy period of time.\n\nAlso, the attorney typically does owe her client\u2014note, not a third party\u2014a duty of diligence, which implicates timeliness. In many jurisdictions, lawyers \"shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness,\" *see* [Rule 1\\.3](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_3_diligence.html), and lawyers \"shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation,\" *see* [Rule 3\\.2](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_2_expediting_litigation.html). Nevertheless, lots of attorneys are sanctioned for neglecting client matters, even under this fairly open\\-ended reasonableness standard, although that's often for not doing the work at all (rather than for simply being slow).\n\n[united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ethical implications of this behavior?\n\nA) The attorney's conduct is clearly unethical and violates multiple rules of professional conduct.\nB) The attorney's behavior is entirely ethical as long as her own client approves of the delay.\nC) The attorney's conduct may be questionable but likely doesn't violate ethical standards unless the delay becomes excessive.\nD) The attorney has no ethical obligations to the opposing party and can delay the case indefinitely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most accurate response based on the information provided. While the attorney's behavior raises ethical concerns, it likely doesn't definitively violate ethical standards unless the delay becomes prolonged or excessive. The ABA Model Rules state that attorneys should not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to delay or burden a third person (Rule 4.4), but short-term delays due to workload are not necessarily violations. The attorney does have a duty of diligence to her own client (Rule 1.3) and should make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation (Rule 3.2), but these are judged on a reasonableness standard. Brief delays are common in legal practice and usually don't constitute ethical violations unless they become excessive or cause significant harm. Options A and D are too extreme, while B incorrectly suggests client approval alone would make the conduct ethical."

[Copyright](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) includes several rights \\- the right to make copies, the right to create derivative works, the right to distribute and sell copies, etc. Both the author and the publisher are going to do one or more of these things in the act of writing and publishing the book. Being ignorant of the copyright status is not a defense to infringement, although if they were \"not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright\", statutory damages [may be reduced](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504).\n\nIt's possible that the publisher has a clause in the publishing contract saying the author must pay if the publisher gets sued. However, this won't prevent the lawsuit from naming the publisher; it just means the publisher can later seek money from the author.\n\nDetermination of [fair use](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) is a multi\\-factor test. I can't say for sure whether the use of the image would or would not fall under fair use, especially without reading the book (context is important), although at a glance it seems unlikely that this would be fair use. The nature of the use seems to be cover art for a book (probably against fair use), the nature of the copyrighted work is a creative image (against fair use), and it looks like the entire image is used (against fair use.) I'm not sure how the use of image will impact the market for the original, although the image owners could argue that allowing anyone to use the image freely would impact the market for official licensed use.",

Both the author and publisher can be sued for copyright infringement, regardless of their knowledge of the copyright status. Copyright law protects various rights, including the right to make copies, create derivative works, and distribute copies. Both the author and publisher engage in these activities when writing and publishing a book.

What are examples of employer breaching employee contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most simple way how an employer can violate a work contract is usually not mentioned specifically, but heavily implied: **Non\\-payment of wages.**\n\nIf the employer does not pay by the due date, he is in breach of the contract, as he had agreed to pay. But what happens then is dependant on the country you are in and the governing laws.\n\n### Example: [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nThe laws for the protection of the employees are strong in Germany. In the case of nonpayment by due date, the employer automatically is in violation of law and doesn't even need to be notified extra, the moment he doesn't pay he is liable for interest. He's *also* liable for *extra* expenses that the employee accrues because the payment is late. If the non\\-payment continues, the employee may reduce or stop working, depending on the amount of wages outstanding, until the outstanding wages are paid (partially). Neither of these results from the laws are ever referenced in work contracts, but their presence in the law is implied. It also leads to the wording in work contracts such as these:\n\n> \u00a71 \\[What is the employment contract for]\n> \n> \n> \u00a72 \\[Start and end of the employment]\n> \n> \n> \u00a73 *Compensation*\n> \n> \n> 1. Employer will pay employee X as wage per month \\[sometimes also phrased in an hourly rate].\n> 2. Payment is due till the last day of a calendar month by money transfer to a bank of employee's choice.\n> \n> \n> \u00a74 *weekly worktime* \\- The regular work time per week is Y hours.\n\nThe wording makes it rather clear, that non\\-payment of the compensation (wage) is a breech of the contract, having the aforementioned effects that are written out in the laws: \u00a7 286 Abs.2 Nr.1 BGB \\& \u00a7 614 BGB dictate the interest after the payment date and when that is. \u00a7 273 Abs.1 BGB allows the employee that is not paid on time to reduce the work done until the missing payment is done, and it is generally assumed that two full missing monthly wages allow to fully stop working till the missing amount is lower than this. \u00a7 626 Abs.1 BGB states, that the employee can, without notice period, dissolve the work contract if 2 monthly wages are not paid, as long as he notified the employer of not having paid on time in the proper way (\"Abmahnung\" \\~ Writeup).\n\nAnd atop that, as [gnasher](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/525/gnasher729) notes, not paying the employee still forces the employer to pay the income tax on the amount that is owed to the employee, and the tax has even to be paid before the employee is.",

Let\u2019s even say the drugs were hidden in the same boxes.\n\nHeck, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say a John Doe with some moral conscience had stumbled upon the documents, for example while using the washroom where they were hidden.\n\nMy question is thus: Would these law\\-enforcement officers or John Doe be \u201cforgiven\u201d from seeing the classified documents? It\u2019s not like they *knew* there were classified documents there, and they just stumbled upon them\u2026\n\nWhat would happen to them, legally?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is nothing to forgive.\n\nThe question presupposes that it is a crime to lay eyes on classified information. Crimes related to classified information generally have an element of intent. For example, from [18 USC 793](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793) (emphasis added):\n\n> (a) Whoever, **for the purpose of obtaining information respecting the national defense with intent or reason to believe** that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation ...\n> \n> \n> (b) Whoever, **for the purpose aforesaid, and with like intent or reason to believe** ...\n\nThe other subsections are similar, but subsection (e) is most directly applicable to the present hypothetical, so here it is in full:\n\n> (e) Whoever having **unauthorized** possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, **willfully** communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, **or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it**;\n\nSeeing the files is not *per se* a crime. Finding the files and failing to ensure that they are returned to the government (or retuning them to the government while transmitting the information to unauthorized parties) is a crime.",

During the search, the agent accidentally discovers classified government documents hidden in a bathroom. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications for the agent?\n\nA) The agent has committed a federal crime by viewing classified documents without proper clearance.\nB) The agent must immediately cease the search and obtain a new warrant specifically for classified documents.\nC) The agent is legally protected as long as they do not willfully communicate the classified information to unauthorized parties.\nD) The agent is required to destroy the classified documents on-site to protect national security.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, crimes related to classified information generally require an element of intent. Merely seeing classified documents accidentally does not constitute a crime. The agent is not \"forgiven\" because there is no crime to forgive in simply viewing the documents unintentionally. However, the agent has a legal obligation to ensure the documents are properly handled and returned to the appropriate government authorities. As long as the agent does not willfully communicate the information to unauthorized parties or fail to return the documents to the proper authorities, they have not committed a crime under 18 USC 793. Options A and D are incorrect as they misstate the legal requirements. Option B is also incorrect, as the agent can seize the documents under the plain view doctrine without needing a new warrant."

This practice likely has historical and quasi-legal roots, stemming from past regulations that may have treated fruit oils and kernel/seed oils differently. For example, palm fruit oil and palm kernel oil have different regulatory statuses in some countries, and olive seed oil is not commonly used in food products. By specifying \"fruit\" oil, manufacturers provide clarity about the exact nature of the ingredient, which can be important for consumers with specific dietary needs or preferences, and also ensures compliance with any lingering regulatory distinctions between fruit and kernel/seed oils."

You can't copyright a word, or even a short phrase, whether or not it's a title. This is a matter of trademark law.\n\nSecond, it would probably not be a violation of trademark law, assuming the title is relevant to the work and you aren't trying to mislead people into thinking it's a King game. See the case [Rogers v. Grimaldi](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/524053/ginger-rogers-v-alberto-grimaldi-mgmua-entertainment-co-and-pea/) (2d Cir. 1989\\), in which Ginger Rogers and the estate of Fred Estare sued over a movie which was titled \"Ginger and Fred\". Under the Rogers test, the title of an expressive work does not violate trademark law \"unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.\"\n\nHowever, it is very possible that you'd be sued by King, and it's even possible you'd lose. While the Rogers test has been adopted by other circuits besides the 2nd (for example, see the case [Fox v. Empire](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/11/16/16-55577.pdf), 9th Cir. 2017, in which the Rogers test was applied and the court found that the title of the TV show Empire did not violate the trademark of Empire Distribution), it probably hasn't been adopted by every circuit, and I don't think the Supreme Court has ruled on it.

The use of \"saga\" in a game title is primarily a trademark law issue, not a copyright one. Based on the Rogers v. Grimaldi case and the Rogers test, the title of an expressive work (like a video game) does not violate trademark law if it has artistic relevance to the underlying work and doesn't explicitly mislead as to the source or content of the work. \n\nOption A is incorrect because this is not a copyright issue, and using \"saga\" wouldn't automatically result in legal action. \n\nOption B is overly cautious; explicit permission isn't necessarily required if the use meets the Rogers test criteria. \n\nOption D is too permissive; while common words can't be entirely owned, their use in specific contexts (like video game titles) can still be subject to trademark considerations.\n\nWhile the developer might still face a lawsuit from King (as the company has shown willingness to litigate), they would have a strong legal defense if their use of \"saga\" is artistically relevant and not misleading about the game's source."

In joint legal custody situations, both parents typically have the right to access their children's school and medical records. However, as the documentation suggests, schools and medical providers may still refuse to provide this information for various reasons, even if there are laws supporting the parent's right to access.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We got into an interesting debate at work today after someone joked that a prostitute would be cheaper than dating someone. The crutch of the debate was whether Federal employees or military could use a prostitute if they went to Las Vegas.\n\nProstitution is legal in certain parts of LV. However, the debate was whether there was a Federal law that would prohibit travelling to another state for the express purpose of using a prostitute. At least one person suggested it was illegal due to human trafficking's laws, though I'm not convinced that is accurate.\n\nSo, could a Federal employee legally travel to LV with the intent of using a prostitute there? As a related question is it possible that it's legal, i.e. I won't end up in jail, but would be grounds for termination from Federal employment; though I realize the latter question may be more policy than a legal question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Short Answer\n\nIt is not illegal for a federal employee or anyone else, who is not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to travel to Nevada for the purposes of engaging the services of a prostitute in the counties of Nevada (Clark County where Las Vegas, Nevada is located is not one such county) where it is legal.\n\nBut, this is an offense under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice applicable primarily to U.S. military personnel while serving in that capacity, even in cases where prostitution is legal under local law and the service member is not married.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**Legal Prostitution In Nevada, In General**\n\nAs another answer correctly notes that in Nevada:\n\n> Clark County, the county in which Las Vegas is located, has made\n> prostitution illegal. . . . You also can't do it in Reno (it's illegal\n> in Washoe County) and the nearby independent city of Carson City\n> (Nevada State Capital).\n> \n> \n> In fact, the law only permits counties with a population of 70,000 or\n> less to do it per county law. And before you ask, you can't go to\n> Rachel, Nevada (closest settlement to Area 51\\) for some\n> extraterrestrial ladies of the night as well as Lincoln County, while\n> qualifying for legalized prostitution . . . prohibits it.\n> \n> \n> Of the 16 counties in Nevada, only 10 allow prostitution, all of which\n> must be done through regulated licensed brothels only. Even then, only\n> 8 counties have at least one active brothel in operation.\n\n**Civilian Legal Considerations In The U.S. Not Involving International Travel**\n\nIt seems as if the concern of the original post might be with the Mann Act.\n\n> [The Mann Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act) (also known as the White\\-Slave Traffic Act of 1910\\) is a\n> federal law that criminalizes the transportation of \u201cany woman or girl\n> for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other\n> immoral purpose.\u201d\n\n([Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mann_act))\n\nThis has been revised in a manner that, among other things, is now gender\\-neutral and limiting it to circumstances in which the act for which the prostitute is transported is illegal. It was the first federal human trafficking law in the U.S.\n\nThis act applies to transporting the prostitute across state lines, not the prostitute's customer.\n\nCloser to the mark is the [Travel Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_Act):\n\n> The Travel Act or International Travel Act of 1961, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952,\n> is a Federal criminal statute which forbids the use of the U.S. mail,\n> or interstate or foreign travel, for the purpose of engaging in\n> certain specified criminal acts.\n\nBut, since the travel would be for the purpose of an act that is legal at its destination, it wouldn't apply.\n\nInternational treaties on sex tourism are inapplicable to domestic travel, and I don't try to analyze their applicability here.\n\nNone of these relevant laws treat military personnel or federal employees differently.\n\n**Prosecutions Under The Uniform Code of Military Justice**\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice provides an internal means of prosecuting military service members who are currently serving and a small number of other persons, via courts\\-martial, which are quasi\\-criminal proceedings with quasi\\-criminal punishments.\n\nArticle 134 of the UCMJ is its general provision which is a catch\\-all article barring anything \"of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\", and also certain unenumerated offenses which are illegal under local law where the offense is committed, or under federal law. Article 134 encompasses many sub\\-offenses which are enumerated in the Manual For Courts\\-Martial but not in the statutory language of the UCMJ itself.\n\nOne of the offenses which the Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the United States prohibits is adultery (which only a handful of U.S. states do and Nevada does not), so this would be an activity, if carried out, that would be subject to court\\-martial for a married member of the military who is currently serving in the military and thus subject to court\\-martial jurisdiction. Adultery prosecutions under the UCMJ are reasonably common even now.\n\n(A lesser included offense of adultery under the UCMJ is \"wrongful cohabitation\" which is akin to adultery and bigamy but does not require a showing a sexual intercourse.)\n\nAlso, as noted in the comments to the question, while patronizing a prostitute is not a specific offense in the UCMJ in the statute itself, it is another offense that can also be prosecuted under Article 134\\. It has been DOD policy [since at least 2006](https://www.stripes.com/news/patronizing-a-prostitute-is-now-a-specific-crime-for-servicemembers-1.43314) to prosecute service members under Article 134 for engaging in prostitution, whether or not the service member is married, and whether or not prostitution is legal under local law. (Prostitution is not illegal under federal law other than the UCMJ.)\n\nThis is not obvious from the language of Article 134 of the UCMJ (which is codified at 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 934\\), itself, which states:\n\n> Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and\n> neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed\n> forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed\n> forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject\n> to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a\n> general, special, or summary court\\-martial, according to the nature\n> and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of\n> that court. As used in the preceding sentence, the term \u201ccrimes and\n> offenses not capital\u201d includes any conduct engaged in outside the\n> United States, as defined in section 5 of title 18, that would\n> constitute a crime or offense not capital if the conduct had been\n> engaged in within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of\n> the United States, as defined in section 7 of title 18\\.\n\nBut, the primary and authoritative interpretive authority for Article 134 of the UCMJ is the [Manual for Courts\\-Martial](https://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/ucmj/UCMJ_Article134_General_Article.pdf), with the force of a law or validly adopted regulation. This indicates that prosecutions for pandering a prostitute under Article 134 does not require a showing that it is illegal to do so under local law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. military service member travels to a county in Nevada where prostitution is legal and engages the services of a prostitute. Under what circumstances could they potentially face disciplinary action?\n\nA) Only if they are married, as it would constitute adultery under the UCMJ\nB) They cannot face any disciplinary action, as the activity was legal where it occurred\nC) Only if they transported the prostitute across state lines, violating the Mann Act\nD) They could face disciplinary action under Article 134 of the UCMJ, regardless of marital status or local legality\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, the Department of Defense has a policy to prosecute service members under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for engaging in prostitution, whether or not the service member is married, and whether or not prostitution is legal under local law. This falls under the catch-all provision of Article 134, which prohibits conduct \"of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while adultery is indeed prosecutable under the UCMJ, the policy applies to all service members regardless of marital status.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the UCMJ can apply even when the activity is legal under local law.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Mann Act applies to transporting prostitutes across state lines, not to customers, and is not relevant to this scenario."

If you get it, great. Then you could do it with the owner's blessing.\n\nIt's possible to do your write up without the owner's permission, but then you have to be *much* more careful. For instance, the names of games cannot be copyrighted. No one can prevent you from writing \"A Guide to Bridge,\" or \"A Guide to Chess,\" etc. On the other hand, some games are *trademarked,* in which case you will need to attach a TM (trademark) symbol when referring to them. In this case, see a lawyer.\n\nYou are also allowed to discuss the game itself \"in your own words,\" but you must be careful not to \"plagiarize\" anything from the rules, or the official game description. That is, while you can refer to specific aspects of a game, such as building houses and hotels, the leash on copying is fairly short, as little as five words. This does not refer to five words in a common sequence referring to a single thought like \"The United States of America,\" but it could refer to five words in an original or unusual sequence such as \"I think therefore I am,\" by Rene Descartes, or \"X houses and Y hotels,\" where the numbers X and Y define the number of houses and hotels in a certain board game trademarked (I believe) by Parker Brothers.",

In Canada, linking does not reproduce any part of the original work and is not considered infringement.\nB) Incorrect. Sweden, along with EU regulations, does not consider hyperlinking as communication of the work to the public, thus it's not infringement.\nC) Correct. While the US doesn't have a clear-cut rule, knowingly providing and profiting from links to infringing content could potentially be seen as contributory infringement, especially if there's financial gain involved.\nD) Incorrect. Spain has ruled that linking is not potential copyright infringement, considering it does not constitute a new communication to the public.\n\nThe question tests understanding of international differences in copyright law regarding hyperlinks, with the US having the least clear stance and potentially considering certain linking practices as infringing under specific circumstances."

See [Article 21(2\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/):\n\n> 2. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\n\nThis is not new, something similar was already put in the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002) ([2002/58/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058)):\n\n> Article 13\n> \n> \n> Unsolicited communications\n> \n> \n> 1. The use of automated calling systems without human intervention (automatic calling machines), facsimile machines (fax) or electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing may only be allowed in respect of subscribers who have given their prior consent.\n> 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services **provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object**, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use.\n\nIn any case, it must be possible to stop this direct marketing, without any effect on other email or services. (See also [recital 43](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-43/), regarding freely given consent).\n\nIf you want to, you can [complain at the supervisory authority](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-77-gdpr/), which I believe is the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) in the UK, or you can [go to a court](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-79-gdpr/) directly.",

The customer wants to unsubscribe from marketing emails but continue receiving important event information. The company's unsubscribe page only allows opting out of all communications or continuing to receive marketing emails. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The company is compliant with GDPR as long as they provide any form of unsubscribe option.\n\nB) The company is violating GDPR by not allowing the customer to selectively opt out of marketing emails while still receiving event information.\n\nC) The company can continue sending marketing emails without violating GDPR if they mention a future preference center.\n\nD) GDPR does not apply to email marketing for existing customers who have purchased services.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to GDPR Article 21(2), individuals have the right to object to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time. This right should be independent of other services or communications. The company's practice of not allowing customers to opt out of marketing emails without also unsubscribing from important event information violates this principle. The customer should be able to choose which types of communications they receive, especially being able to opt out of marketing while still receiving essential information about services they've paid for. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent GDPR requirements or falsely suggest that the company's current practices are compliant."

I have recently been told that when you are in traffic court there are no references to federal law and to try to use federal law would be considered \"pseudo law\" , or a sovereignty issue. But from what I can find , the real rule is The U.S. Constitution declares that federal law is \u201cthe supreme law of the land.\u201d As a result, when a federal law conflicts with a state or local law, the federal law will supersede the other law or laws. This is commonly known as \u201cpreemption.\u201d\n\nI am the \\-3 and deleted [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/61313/36788). I am guessing I will be kicked off the site but I don't understand, because I am being told I can't use federal law when I have very effectively. So I am confused on how I win in court. Is it always a fluke ? Please don't consider this a rant. It is a legitimate legal question that I assumed was answered when a judge took a fix\\-it ticket and turned it into a $1200 ticket (because I was fighting it) and then apparently just gave me the win even though I was using the Federal Law from the USC Title 18 to define what a motor vehicle was in a State court. But I am not ranting, or upset at all. I'm just wondering, could a judge made such a simple mistake and cost the courts all that money ? Not the $1200, but to pay all the overhead of appearing 4 times and the warrant. Granted, I do believe my answer was PERFECT, I also know I could be wrong. And with my answer being pulled so easily, I must be missing something. I'm looking at 10 votes for an \"answer\" to this question, and yet it doesn't answer the question whatsoever. So if my question falls against this site, I apologize. That is not my intention. Please help me understand. Was my judge just uneducated?\nThis question cannot be answer simply by claiming the question is frivolous. That would be absurd. I think I need to make this point , I have successfully used this in court, and it's a good thing that we all can because some judges (1 in particular) would stoop so low as to say neither \"the United States Constitution nor the Supreme Court rulings matter in court since California is not a state\". When in fact The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution Under the Supremacy Clause, found in Article VI, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, both the Constitution and federal law supersede state laws.\n\nThe Federal law being applied is the United States code definition of Motor Vehicle, what shows that the state laws are in direct conflict with the Constitution and the federal laws. And no State can take a right and turn it into a crime and issue a license and a fee for it. In a sense saying that you can have your right if you pay us for it. That would not be a right.\nA couple other important points that may clear up some \" answers \". When the case is called, I tell the judge I am here in propria persona speaking for the named defendant, all I say is for the record and I invoke art. 4 sec. 4 of the Constitution which guarantees me a Republican form of Government. Im not a US Citizen but an American National (non statutory citizen) and I set my court. When I asked him if it was civil or criminal, he said \"you tell me\". I said it can't be either since there is no injured party and no contract.\nI believe that locks the court up.\nThey cant throw statutory at me because there is no written rule for a criminal case thats statutory jurisdiction and so I couldnt have a fair trial.\nAlso by using the Constitution and Supreme Court cases that say I have the right of motion /travel then I would have a perfect case for willfulness. Immunity.\nFailure to show a cause of action in which relief could be granted.\nAs far as I can see, all the rules I am using are theirs.\n\nThe right of the citizen to travel upon the highway and to transport his property\nthereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and\nobviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business for\nprivate gain in the running of a stagecoach or omnibus.\" State vs. City of\nSpokane, 186 P. 864\\.\nWhat is this Right of the Citizen which differs so \"radically and obviously\" from one who\nuses the highway as a place of business? Who better to enlighten us than Justice Tolman of\nthe Supreme Court of Washington State? In State vs. City of Spokane, supra, the Court also\nnoted a very \"radical and obvious\" difference, but went on to explain just what the difference\nis:\n\"The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a common right to all,\nwhile the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is true that in the US, valid Federal law supersedes state law or regulation when there is a conflict. Precisely because of this, state laws and regulations are normally carefully written to avoid such conflicts.\n\nIt is very unusual for a federal law issue to apply in traffic court. The question does not say what Federal law issue you think will apply to your case. Most issues where Federal law might plausibly affect a state court process, such as a fourth amendment violation on a search and seizure issue, would not apply in traffic court, although they might apply in a criminal court proceeding. Federal law does not generally deal with traffic issues, nor does it preempt state traffic laws, because there is normally no conflict.\n\nThere is a group of people, who often call themselves [\"sovereign citizens\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) who have a habit of making wildly invalid legal claims, and trying to claim that much of the law does not apply to them. Such people often assert elaborate theories about why certain laws do not apply, not infrequently involving the Federal Supremacy Clause. Such claims are invalid, and will not be received well by a court. A claim that one travels by \"conveyance\" rather than by \"car\" and thus state laws do not apply is such an invalid claim.\n\nThe argument made in [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61251/no-blinker-in-a-left-turn-lane-is-it-illegal/61313#61313) is such an invalid claim. Chapter 18 of the US code does regulate commercial vehicles to some extent. Therefore **in that chapter** \"motor vehicle\" does mean \"commercial vehicle\" because those federal regulations do not apply to private vehicles. This does **not** mean that state regulations that apply to private vehicles are preempted or otherwise invalid.\n\nIf you think a Federal Issue will apply during a traffic court session, it would be wise to consult a lawyer in advance. Many lawyers offer free or low\\-cost initial consultations.\n\nIf you think a relevant legal issue is not being addressed, politely, briefly, and clearly explain the issue that you think applies. Do not yell at the judge or other court personnel. Do not try to \"make up your own rules\". You will be given a chance to indicate your side of the issue.\n\n**Response to recent edit, and related comments**\n\nWithout a record of the actual court hearing you describe, there is no way to determine if the judge was acting correctly or not. Even with the record there might well be no way to determine what the judge had in mind, or why s/he acted as s/he did.\n\nI maintain that any argument that state traffic codes are in fact preempted by federal law, or apply only to commercial vehicles, or that an ordinary personal car is not a \"motor vehicle\" because of a definition in Blacks or any other dictionary, is legally unsound and frivolous, and could well subject a person who makes it in court to penalties for contempt. A particular judge might not want to bother with the matter, of course.\n\nI think i have answered the question as asked, in a way likely to be most helpful to people in general. Others may have other views.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a traffic court case, a defendant claims that federal law supersedes state traffic laws due to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal validity of this argument?\n\nA) The argument is likely valid, as federal law always supersedes state law in all matters.\n\nB) The argument is probably sound, especially if the defendant cites the definition of \"motor vehicle\" from Title 18 of the U.S. Code.\n\nC) The argument is generally invalid, as state traffic laws are carefully written to avoid conflicts with federal law, and federal law rarely preempts state traffic regulations.\n\nD) The argument's validity depends on whether the defendant identifies as a \"sovereign citizen\" or an \"American National.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. State traffic laws are typically carefully crafted to avoid conflicts with federal law, and federal law rarely preempts state traffic regulations. The Supremacy Clause only applies when there is a direct conflict between valid federal and state laws, which is uncommon in traffic court cases. Arguments based on federal definitions of \"motor vehicle\" that only apply to commercial regulations, or claims of being exempt from state laws due to \"sovereign citizen\" status, are generally considered legally unsound and frivolous in court. While federal law can supersede state law in cases of conflict, this principle rarely applies in routine traffic court matters."

Without the issuer gaining anything of value, how is there adequate consideration/why is the agreement still considered a contract?\n\nAgain, I understand that consideration need not be monetary, it can be the other party waiving a right. But that right must exist prior to entering into the agreement. The EULA grants the user the right to use the product so prior to entering into the agreement the user has no right to use it to begin with.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The user gains the use of the software, the EULA issuer gains the limitations on how the user of the freeware will use it, that for example, prevent the freeware user from exploiting the issuer's labor by reusing it for profit. Consideration doesn't have to be monetary.\n\nAs a practical matter, sometimes the business model is to give the software away as a loss leader and to have the issuer make their money with training and consulting on how to use it.\n\nAlso, even in the absence of consideration, a promise upon which the person benefiting from the promise reasonably relies is enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\nFurther, EULA stands for \"end user license agreement\" and there are many times that license agreements aren't full fledged contracts. They are merely limited grants of permission to use something, often not even amounting to a full fledged property right or contract right.\n\nFor example, if I let my neighbor walk into my living room while we talk and have tea, the right of the neighbor to be in my living room is called a license, even though it is not a contract.

Which of the following statements best explains why this EULA can be considered a legally binding contract, even without monetary compensation?\n\nA) The software company gains nothing of value, so the EULA is not actually enforceable as a contract.\n\nB) The user's agreement to the limitations on use specified in the EULA constitutes adequate consideration for contract formation.\n\nC) The EULA is only enforceable if the software company provides paid support or training services.\n\nD) The EULA is not a contract, but merely a revocable permission to use the software.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. Even though the software is free, the EULA can still be considered a legally binding contract. The software company gains value through the user's agreement to abide by the limitations specified in the EULA, such as not using the software for commercial purposes or redistributing it. This agreement by the user constitutes adequate consideration for contract formation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the software company does gain something of value through the EULA, namely the user's agreement to use limitations.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while some companies may use this business model, it's not necessary for the EULA to be enforceable. The EULA can stand on its own as a contract.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in that a license can be a limited grant of permission, but it's incorrect to say the EULA is not a contract.

For example, there are [Gems in *Guild Wars 2*](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem) which are originally purchased with cash (but may then be traded in\\-game using the game's normal currency). Taking the example a step further, [*Hex: Shards of Fate*](http://www.hextcg.com/) (an online\\-only trading card game with similarities to *Magic: The Gathering*) has a \"platinum\" currency which may only be purchased using cash via the game's store, and is the only way of purchasing new booster packs of cards in the game. The developers have expressed that they want players to feel that their collection of digital cards has real value and the in\\-game auction house facilitates trades of cards, the rarest of which are trading for amounts in platinum valued up to about $100 each. The terms and conditions for the game state (as many other games do), and I'm paraphrasing here, that items within the game may not be traded for outside of the game for real currency. Not only does this make monetary sense for the developers, but I assume this is also to avoid a stack of legal troubles around money laundering and gambling/gaming laws in different territories.\n\nHowever, [Entropia Universe](http://www.entropiauniverse.com/) ([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropia_Universe)) has as its key feature an in\\-game economy which is tied directly to US dollars, and specifically allows players to \"cash out\" of the game and back into real money. They have even gone so far as to produce bank cards which withdraw from the game and have now formed an actual bank to regulate trades.\n\nMy question is why are there not more games which take this approach of a game economy tied directly to real money? I understand that the economy needs to be carefully designed and balanced to avoid over\\-inflation (in\\-game) or other exploits leading to in\\-game currency being \"created\" from nothing, but the bigger concern seems to me to be the legal issues this would create. Given the amount of random chance involved in the game is this not effectively gambling? If so, how does Entropia Universe allow worldwide users without kicking up a storm of trouble from different regional authorities and governments? Surely this is exactly the kind of thing which is banned in certain US states (I am not a US citizen) or other countries. Is it because the game is based in Sweden and their more permissive laws allow for it? If so, do the laws of the country in which the player resides not take precedent? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can see at least two defenses.\n\n1. **Game of Skill Defense**.

One could claim the game itself is a form of entertainment and, therefore, all funds spent while playing the game are for entertainment purposes only vis\\-a\\-vis the game itself. And not any alleged gambling within the game.

For example, they disagree on what their obligations are under a contract, but there isn't actually a breach of contract which one party wants to sue the other for.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company, TechCorp, and its employee, Jane, have a dispute over the interpretation of an arbitration clause in Jane's employment contract. There is no pending lawsuit, but TechCorp wants to ensure the dispute is resolved through arbitration. Which legal action would be most appropriate for TechCorp to take, and why?\n\nA) File a motion to compel arbitration, as it would immediately force Jane to participate in arbitration.\n\nB) Pursue a declaratory judgment action, as it would clarify the legal rights and obligations of both parties regarding the arbitration clause without ordering any specific action.\n\nC) File a lawsuit against Jane for breach of contract, as it would allow TechCorp to argue for arbitration within the context of ongoing litigation.\n\nD) Take no legal action and wait for Jane to file a lawsuit, at which point TechCorp can respond with a motion to compel arbitration.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action for TechCorp in this situation would be to pursue a declaratory judgment action. This is because:\n\n1. There is no pending lawsuit, so a traditional motion to compel arbitration in response to a lawsuit is not applicable.\n\n2. A declaratory judgment action is specifically designed to resolve uncertainties about legal rights and obligations between parties, which is exactly the situation described here regarding the interpretation of the arbitration clause.\n\n3. This action would allow the court to clarify the parties' rights and obligations under the arbitration clause without ordering any specific action, which is ideal when there's a disagreement but no actual breach or dispute requiring immediate arbitration.\n\n4. It's a proactive approach that can prevent future litigation by clarifying the situation before any actual breach occurs.\n\n5. Unlike option A, it doesn't force arbitration immediately, which could be seen as overly aggressive when there's just a disagreement over interpretation.\n\n6. It's more appropriate than options C and D, which involve either unnecessary escalation (filing a lawsuit) or passive waiting, neither of which efficiently addresses the current uncertainty."

She is the business owner and really the only representative of the business; but still the judge said that a person can not speak for the business and cited some statute (i still havent gotten that). Is this possible and how is it possible?\n\nSo long story short, I have a friend that owns a LLC. She was sued by someone and instructed to appear in court (**to represent the llc by the way**). She was unable to appear in court and \"appeared\" over the phone (not sure if that makes a difference). After the opposing council said their piece she began to say her piece and the judge instructed her to stop talking and that she \"could not speak on behalf of the LLC.\"\nThe judge also cited some statute, but I don't have that right now. (i will find out what it is later when i see her in person)\n\nSo I guess a couple linked questions; FYI we live in Wyoming (if that is important)\n\n**Is there a statute that can keep the llc representative from speaking for it?**\n\n**How are you supposed to defend the llc that clearly can not speak for itself?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally, a managing member of an LLC cannot speak for the LLC in court. The LLC needs to hire a licensed lawyer to do that.\n\nThe general rule is that entities may not represent themselves \"pro se\" through non\\-lawyer officers and must have a licensed attorney represent them in any court matter (in practice, a court will usually allow an officer or manager to write a letter to the court asking for a brief extension of time to a deadline to obtain a proper lawyer, even though that is logically inconsistent). If an entity does not hire a lawyer, a default judgment will enter against it.\n\nIn other words, a CEO or manager or managing member of a company isn't allowed to speak for it in court. This rule is almost universal in the world of legal systems descended from English common law, although sometimes there are narrow statutory exceptions.\n\nThe manager of an LLC is a person to whom legal process may be directed to begin a lawsuit, but that isn't the same as representing the LLC in court.\n\nWyoming does have an exception to the general rule for small claims court cases at Wyoming Statutes \u00a7 1\\-21\\-202(b), which states: \n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 33 of the Wyoming\n>  Statutes, in small claims court, the state, governmental entities,\n>  natural persons, corporations, partnerships, associations or other\n>  organizations may litigate actions on behalf of themselves in person\n>  or through authorized employees, with or without an attorney, provided\n>  that if an attorney appears, the opposing party is entitled to a\n>  continuance for the purpose of obtaining an attorney of its own.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that small claims court only governs claims of $6,000 or less, and only in cases where the Plaintiff has elected to file a suit using small claims court procedures.\n\nI note that this question is tagged \"small claims court\" but it isn't clear from the circumstances set forth in the question whether this is merely a claim for a small amount of money or is truly a claim that was filed using the special small claims court procedures in which an attorney is not required.\n\nWyoming Statutes \u00a7 33\\-5\\-101 et seq. is the law regulating attorneys which prohibits the unauthorized practice of law that is the basis for the general rule at Wyoming Statutes \u00a7 33\\-5\\-117 which states:\n\n> It shall be unlawful, and punishable as contempt of court, for any\n>  person not a member of the Wyoming state bar to hold himself out or\n>  advertise by whatsoever means as an attorney or counselor\\-at\\-law.\n\nThis statute isn't perfectly clear on its face, but is understood to codify the universal common law rule so it isn't ambiguous in any way.",

This exception applies specifically to small claims court cases. In small claims court, LLCs and other entities may represent themselves through authorized employees or members, with or without an attorney, as long as the claim is $6,000 or less. \n\nOption A is incorrect because being the sole owner doesn't override the general requirement for attorney representation outside of small claims court. \n\nOption C is incorrect because there's no provision for judges to grant special permission for non-attorney representation outside of small claims court. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the small claims court exception.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the specific circumstances under which non-attorney representation is allowed for LLCs in Wyoming, highlighting the importance of knowing both the general rule and its exceptions."

Over the next 20 years, they made several improvements to the original design, patenting each new version. In 2020, the original patent expires. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the rights and limitations of TechInno and its competitors after the expiration of the original patent?\n\nA) TechInno retains exclusive rights to manufacture and sell all versions of the chip, including the original design.\n\nB) Competitors can manufacture and sell chips identical to the original design, but cannot use any features from the subsequent patented improvements.\n\nC) The expiration of the original patent automatically extends the protection of all related patents filed by TechInno.\n\nD) TechInno can sue competitors for patent infringement if they use the original design, claiming it's integral to their newer patented versions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: When a patent expires, the invention enters the public domain and becomes free for anyone to use, manufacture, or sell. In this case, competitors can legally produce chips identical to TechInno's original design once its patent expires in 2020. However, they must be careful not to infringe on any of the subsequent patents TechInno holds on improvements to the original design. These later patents only protect the new features and modifications, not the underlying original design. TechInno cannot extend the protection of the original patent through later improvements, nor can they sue competitors for using the now-public original design, even if it forms the core of their newer products. This question tests understanding of patent expiration, the public domain, and the limits of patent protection for improvements on existing inventions."

For example, freemen theories have been used at times to reject courts' jurisdictions, attempt to enforce or invalidate debt, and many others.\n\nIt might be difficult to prove a negative, but with theories like these, I'd be willing to bet that if there's a court anywhere that has upheld any of them, we'd know all about it.\n\nI'm looking for a detailed response that describes and debunks prominent variants of these theories \u2013 or shows that they've succeeded.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My research has turned up no instances of anyone successfully advocating these ideas in court.\n\nThese are crackpot pseudo\\-legal theories that have no legal validity whatsoever. And are also a bit troublesome and problematic for the rest of us.\n\nThey are mostly advocated by people who:\n\n* don't want to pay taxes or otherwise conform to laws they don't like;\n* are conspiracy\\-minded; and\n* have come across a pseudo\\-legal theory that helps them justify their position.\n\nFor example, [an author of this Wikipedia article explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemen_on_the_land):\n\n> \"Freemen\" believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call \"common\" (case) and \"natural\" laws. Under their theory, natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use \"fraud or mischief\" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence \u2013 their body and their legal \"person\". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a \"strawman\" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this \"strawman\" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name \u2013 for example \"John of the family Smith\", as opposed to \"John Smith\".\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington tried and convicted Kenneth Wayne Leaming for retaliation by making false claims and wrote:\n\n> Defendant \\[Kenneth Wayne Leaming] is apparently a member of a group loosely styled \"sovereign citizens.\" The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendant\u2019s peculiar habits.\n> \n> \n> First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names has some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that \"the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America . . . are terminated nunc pro tunc by public policy, U.C.C. 1\\-103 . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2\\.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing \"United States,\" he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, it\u2019s the same country.\n> \n> \n> Second, sovereign citizens, like Mr. Leaming, love grandiose legalese. \"COMES NOW, Kenneth Wayne, born free to the family Leaming, \\[date of birth redacted], constituent to The People of the State of Washington constituted 1878 and admitted to the union 22 February 1889 by Act of Congress, a Man, \"State of Body\" competent to be a witness and having First Hand Knowledge of The FACTS . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 1\\.)\n> \n> \n> Third, Defendant evinces, like all sovereign citizens, a belief that the federal government is not real and that he does not have to follow the law. Thus, Defendant argues that as a result of the \"REGISTERED FACTS,\" the \"states of body, persons, actors and other parties perpetuating the above captioned transaction(s) \\[i.e., the Court and prosecutors] are engaged . . . in acts of TREASON, and if unknowingly as victims of TREASON and FRAUD . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2\\.)\n> \n> \n> **The Court therefore feels some measure of responsibility to inform Defendant that all the fancy legal\\-sounding things he has read on the internet are make\\-believe......**\n\n### Paper Terrorism\n\nOne particularly problematic \"successful\" tactic employed by these individuals is the filing of false liens. They take advantage of the fact that property liens are not vetted prior to being recorded. These false liens illegally cloud the title to real property and adversely affect the sale of property by adding unnecessary time and expense to the process.",

It is a **legal position**. The lawyer, acting on behalf of the agency from which you requested information, is giving the reasons why that agency is declining your request. The lawyer is presumably either an employee of the agency, or has the agency as a client. In any case, this is notice of the position that the agency would be likely to adopt if you took further legal action, such as a suit to compel disclosure.\n\nLawyers provide such position statements ion behalf of clients or employers all the time. Such statements indicate why certain action is taken, what basis the client or employer has for taking or not taking certain action, and often indicate the nature of the defenses or theories that will be used should a lawsuit follow, although the client or employer is free to change the theory at the pleading stage.\n\nNot only is it not unethical for the lawyer to respond in this way, the agency is, I am fairly sure, **required** by the law to provide a valid reason when a request is declined. That is what they have done, provide a reason that they claim is valid, with some legal reasoning about why it is valid.\n\nNote that I express no view on whether the reason given is in fact valid, or would be sustained in a suit.

It is a defence to have lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possession. Generally speaking, carrying for the purpose of self defence is not a reasonable excuse (there was a case where the circumstances persuaded the court that the defendant feared an imminent attack).\n\nSection 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 makes it an offence to possess any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing. That includes pepper spray. \n\nA dye spray is not a firearm because it is not designed to discharge a noxious liquid and generally speaking it is not an offensive weapon because it is not designed to do harm, although it may become an offensive weapon if you possess or use it intending harm.\n\nYou may use any article to hand in self defence or defence of others so long as you only use reasonable force and you didn't plan for violence or deliberately go armed with the article.\n\nIf you went to the sports shop and purchased a cricket bat or you're going to or coming from playing cricket then you have a reasonable excuse to be carrying a cricket bat. Likewise if you need tools (knives, wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers) in the course of your work (chef, tradesman) or hobby (fishing, DIY) or religious or national costume (kirpan, sgian\\-dubh) then you have a reasonable excuse to be carrying those.

While a cricket bat is not inherently illegal to possess, carrying it specifically for self-defense would likely be considered an offense under Section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. This act prohibits carrying articles intended for use to cause injury to a person in public places, and self-defense is generally not considered a reasonable excuse.\n\nC) Correct. A dye spray is not classified as a firearm because it does not discharge a noxious substance. It is also not typically considered an offensive weapon as it's not designed to cause harm. Therefore, it would be legal to carry for self-defense purposes.\n\nD) Incorrect.

E.g., if every 100 persons having a job 70 are men and 30 are women, I would expect that every 100 divorces where one is sentenced to pay alimony to the other there were approximately 30 where the woman has to pay the man, while I really think the actual number is enormously smaller in reality (and if someone can cite some reliable numbers about this ratio it would be great).\n\nSo what are the legal criteria to decide who pays alimony to whom?\n\nADDED: Let's focus on USA but answers / comments related to other jurisdictions would still be of interest.\n\nADDED: I found [this Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2014/11/20/why-do-so-few-men-get-alimony/) that *appears* to mention official, reliable numbers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> the ratio of divorced men paying the ex wife versus divorced women\n>  paying the ex husband should more or less reflect the ratio of\n>  employed men vs. employed women\n\nNot necessarily.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A pretty common trope in different kinds of media is the idea that large corporations or rich people can screw people like they want and get away with it, because they have oh so many lawyers at their disposal. Mr. Burns from the simpsons comes to my mind immediately.\n\nIs there any truth behind this assumption? Can a large lawyer team render you invulnerable to certain lawsuits? I have no experience with any real applications of jurisprudence, so I find it really strange.\n\nSome points I can think of:\n\n* When the lawsuit is so large and complicated that you need the manpower to sift through all its aspects. Still, if you poisoned an ecosystem your guilt should be provable and you would be condemned no matter the number of lawyers.\n* Intimidating your opponent with the number of your lawyers to make them concede to a extrajudicial solution.\n* It's just a code for bribing the judges.\n\nBut none of those would explain this phenomenon properly. Is it even a real thing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are times when having a large law firm work on a case can be an advantage.\n\nIt is rare for the number of lawyers working on a particular case to be more than three or four plus a few paralegals, even in a case where there are virtually unlimited resources at a party's disposal.\n\nIn those cases, the primary benefit of having a large law firm at your disposal is that by paying top dollar for those attorneys, you may (but certainly don't always) get particularly competent attorneys at firms that have good systems in place.\n\nIf you are willing to spend the money you can also have the attorney and paralegal team work exhaustively to leave no stone unturned in terms of legal research, style and proofreading, \"wild goose chase\" factual and legal research of matters like trial court arguments from other cases that the opposing counsel has participated in, and trial presentations with lavish presentation quality.\n\nFor example, in one case where my firm was litigating against a large law firm in state supreme court arguments, the firm had seven law firm partners who had served as clerks in that court earlier in their careers participate in mock oral arguments to help the appellate lawyer who would be presented the case in oral arguments to the Colorado Supreme Court prepare (with four members of your core team and seven mock justices plus some paralegals participating this was a $5000\\+ per hour activity).\n\nA typical run of the mill appellate brief prepared competently might take 100 hours, while a large firm might devote 800 hours to the same task (both of these are hypothetical round numbers suggested just to get the point across).\n\nThis incredibly intense working up of cases, moreover, often involves attorneys who aren't really starting from scratch as they has handled many similar cases before in their careers, while their smaller firm competition may have only encountered the issues presented for the first time.\n\nYou are also paying for connections and experience. For example, a large law firm may have an easier time retaining the most decorated expert witnesses to argue on their behalf. These attorneys may also have handled numerous cases in front of the judge or judges who will be deciding the case (and if they haven't someone else in the large firm probably has) and thus can better predict what approach will be received best by that particular judge.\n\nThe exception to the rule that the maximal economies of scale are reached with a quite small group of lawyers is that in addition to this core group of lawyers, some cases, such as class action lawsuits, or cases involving complex transactions (e.g. construction project disputes in a large project with hundreds of contractors) may require an immense amount of factual discovery in the trial court in the form of depositions of dozens or hundreds of people with relevant knowledge, and/or review of vast volumes of documents (e.g. I've had several cases with whole rooms stacked floor to ceiling with relevant documents in banker's boxes).\n\nIn cases like those, you need an army of senior paralegals and junior attorneys to interview witnesses, take depositions and review and summarize documents to get to the bottom of the factual matters needed to prove a case.\n\nThe down side of this approach, however, is that it is extremely expensive relative to the alternatives per task, and frequently impossible to recover your costs and attorney fees from the other party, perhaps because they aren't permitted to be awarded, perhaps because a judge would find some or all of your fees and costs to be unreasonable, or perhaps because the other side simply can't afford to pay them.\n\nSo, using a firm like this really only makes sense if the stakes involved are very high, or if there are long term strategic reasons to litigate. Spending $1,000,000 on attorneys' fees and costs is a very expensive way to litigate a $100,000 one off dispute. But spending $1,000,000 on attorneys' fees and costs is perfectly sensible if there is $100,000,000 in controversy in the case at hand, or if a favorable outcome will influence the outcome of a large number of future disputed of the same type.\n\nThe other dirty little secret is that lots of the work done by large law firms for which their clients pay an immense amount of money isn't done very well. One inherent down side of being large is that a large law firm is bureaucratic and prone to the kinds of mistakes that all large organizations have, for example, in diffusing responsibility for mistakes that can allow mistakes to fall through the cracks. Also, while the typical large law firm lawyer is typically more knowledgable than the typical small firm lawyer about the field at issue, this doesn't always happen. Sometimes junior attorneys get assigned too much responsibility on cases in areas where they have blind spots in their knowledge, and sometimes a large firm attorney ends up working a case due to personal connections with the client rather than because that attorney is the most qualified person in the firm to handle it.\n\nAlso, while some very brilliant lawyers do indeed work at large law firms, technical competence isn' the only consideration in hiring. Successful large firm lawyers need to be team players, need to conform and function well in a large bureaucracy, and need to have the social capital to be comfortable on a day to day basis with the firm's other lawyers and their affluent and big business clients. Many large firm lawyers have those soft skills while having only competent rather than excellent legal acumen.\n\nFurther, since most large law firm lawyers go straight from law school to a big firm (sometimes with a detour clerking for a judge for a couple of years), and large law firms handle mostly very big cases that are usually settled by lead attorneys before going to trial, most large law firm attorneys aren't particularly experienced at trial work. Some large law firms compensate for that by laterally hiring former prosecutors, former criminal defense lawyers and former high volume personal injury litigators to do that work, but often, large law firms have few lawyers in the courtroom with much trial experience relative to how many years they have practiced law. They may be very well prepared, but often there is no substitute for hands on trial experience.\n\nStill large law firms tend to fight extremely hard in trial, but tend to be pushovers in settlement discussions. This is driven by the reality that the client will incur huge amounts of attorneys fees and costs to go the distance, and by the fact that professionally, the worst thing that a large firm lawyer can do it to have an unexpected and unpredictable bad outcome at trial. So, large firm attorneys seek to give their clients low expectations about what is possible in litigation in order to make it possible to make cases with significant uncertainty go away with settlements larger than would really have been necessary to settle the case with a more total client litigation and settlement cost sensitive law firm.",

Then someone goes to add a new person, \"Jane Doe, @janedoe\". We don't know that was a previously removed person, to prevent from being added again. So that's conundrum 1\\.\n\nThe next conundrum is, say we have a hidden internal database of previously deleted people, so we can match against when people try to add new people, and prevent them from adding existing people. First off, there is no real simple way of being able to tell that \"Jane Doe, @janedoe\" and \"Jane Doe, jane.doe@gmail.com, @janedoe\" are the same person. Perhaps they deleted their email address and someone else with the same name took it up. Or many other reasons it would be hard to tell. So we can't really prevent in that way.\n\nBut we also still have this hidden internal database of previously deleted users. We need sufficient data for each user to know which users have been deleted, so we can optimally remove new users with the same identifying pieces of info. So then now it's basically, we have a private and a public database of users, the private one used to maintain security but requires detailed user info, and a public database that has whatever info we choose to make public.\n\nAlso, having the \"deleted user database\" could be a security hole, whereby users try creating random addresses and usernames, until they get \"locked out\" of one of them, knowing they discovered a deleted account which must be a real account.\n\nSo I don't really see a clear way to actually delete people's data in such a community\\-driven site, do you? What are the laws around this?\n\nMust Wikipedia delete the page of Barack Obama if he asks of it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Neither the GDPR, nor the CCPA, nor any other data protection law that I am aware of, requires that when information is deleted on request, that similar information not be collected and stored in future. Under the [GDPR Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) there would have to be a lawful basis for any processing, including storage, assuming that the GDPR applies to the directory in question. There could be a claim that such processing was lawful under article 6(e) \"performance of a task carried out in the public interest\". I do not know if any such claim has been adjudicated.\n\nThus there is no need to hold a database of previously erased records to determine if a new record should be blocked as \"previously deleted\".\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, I believe takes the position that the GDPR does not apply to Wikipedia, I am not sure of their detailed arguments. But surely articles on well\\-known people, such as a former US president, would be covered under the same provisions as would cover news reports and historical books about such a person. Perhaps that would also come under article 6(e)",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A community-driven business directory website allows users to add and edit information about local businesses and individuals. If a person requests their information to be removed from the site, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the site's legal obligations under data protection laws such as GDPR?\n\nA) The website must maintain a hidden database of all deleted records to prevent re-addition of the same information in the future.\n\nB) The website is legally required to permanently block any future submissions containing information similar to deleted records.\n\nC) The website can remove the requested information but is not obligated to prevent similar information from being added in the future.\n\nD) The website must implement a system to automatically detect and reject any new submissions that match previously deleted records.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, data protection laws like GDPR do not require websites to prevent the collection or storage of similar information in the future after a deletion request. The website can comply with the deletion request without maintaining a database of deleted records or implementing systems to block future similar submissions. The site would still need a lawful basis for processing any information, but there is no legal obligation to prevent re-addition of similar data. This approach allows the community-driven nature of the site to continue while still respecting individual deletion requests."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a little paranoid about being plagiarized.\n\nLet's say I publish music on Youtube (for example) and several blogs. I only publish the audio on a compressed lossy format. I keep safe on my hard drive the lossless audio file. If for any reason someone decides to plagiarize me, can I go to court and support my authorship with those lossless audio files? Because they wouldn't have the lossless audio.\n\nOn the other hand, am I already protected by uploading my material to Youtube? If I send a gmail email to myself, does it help? Does private registration services such safe creative help? I know there is no substitute for an official copyright register, but as an artist, I create a lot of Images, Music Demos, Drawings and is economically impossible to register each of my creations.\n\nFinally, If the material I upload contains footage of my face or even only my voice. Would that be enough as a proof? Or maybe should I add image/audio footprints as a protection measure?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: People often confuse \"proof\" and \"evidence\" and in the legal system we often use them interchangeably when we probably shouldn't. Proof, in a scientific or mathematical sense, is something that is irrefutable and conclusively proves the point unless the assumptions it is based on are proven false. Evidence, on the other hand, is merely something that tends to make a fact at issue in the case more or less likely to be true. (Paraphrasing Federal Rule of Evidence 401, which determines relevant evidence)\n\nTrying to create proof that would be irrefutable such as proof of original authorship is very difficult. But amassing a bunch of evidence is usually pretty easy and often what wins court cases. If you offer a hand\\-written and dated ledger entry that you created a work on a certain date, and you testified to its veracity in order to get it properly admitted at court, you would likely have more proof than most people for many crucial facts in court cases. Unless there is a reason to suspect the entry is fraudulent, then often the other side won't be allowed to opine that it might be fraudulent. In civil trials, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, however the plaintiff only needs to persuade by a standard of \"more likely than not\" or to put it another way 51% of the evidence. If your evidence shows that you most likely created the work, simply saying the evidence might have been faked isn't usually enough to get the defendant into a winning \"less likely than not\" analysis of the situation.\n\nI have seen court cases won on the file system date in a computer, which are pretty easy to tamper with, but absent a reason to suspect tampering, was treated as strong evidence of the date of a document. You can certainly improve from that low threshold of proof, so I wouldn't go overboard trying to document your discovery in a way that is foolproof.\n\nRegistration is required in order to file suit, but you don't need to do until you are aware of an infringer. There are many benefits to registering, such as a presumption of validity after 5 years, but cases have been won by people who only registered in order to file suit.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a copyright infringement case, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between evidence and proof of authorship?\n\nA) Proof of authorship must be irrefutable and conclusive to win a copyright infringement case.\nB) Evidence of authorship needs to be beyond reasonable doubt to succeed in court.\nC) Multiple pieces of evidence that make authorship more likely can be sufficient to win a case, even without conclusive proof.\nD) Only official copyright registration can provide adequate proof of authorship in court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation emphasizes that in legal proceedings, especially in civil trials like copyright infringement cases, \"proof\" and \"evidence\" are often used interchangeably. While absolute proof of authorship is difficult to establish, multiple pieces of evidence that make authorship more likely can be sufficient to win a case. The burden of proof in civil trials is \"more likely than not\" or 51% of the evidence. Various forms of evidence, such as dated ledger entries, file system dates, or even testimony, can contribute to building a case for authorship. The key is to amass enough evidence to persuade the court that your claim of authorship is more likely to be true than not, rather than providing irrefutable proof. This aligns with option C, which correctly captures the essence of how evidence functions in copyright infringement cases."

A lawyer as a witness is fine. A spouse as a witness is not ideal as she would be an interested party if there was a dispute over whether it was executed.

Many states and international institutions have already made clear that they will not accept the result, because it seems obvious that the outcome will be faked and people are not free in their decision.\n\nTherefore my question: What would be a *legal* way of achieving this? Are there any international laws on that, or does it depend mostly on the laws of the countries involved? I do know that there have been some polls about regions changing state in the past (e.g. the [1919 poll in Vorarlberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksabstimmung_1919_in_Vorarlberg)), but I don't know of a recent one and I don't know of any successful ones.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So generally, when a region of a nation tries to break away and form a new nation or join a nation, it's acceptance as a nation is generally based on the **Diplomatic Recognition** of other Nations. This can either be *de facto* or *de jure*, with the former acting in a manner of having some acknowledgement of a government of a territory, while a *de jure* recognition typically is stronger with embassies, consulates, and treaties between the two nations. For example, the United States has *de jure* recognition of France and vice versa, while they merely have *de facto* recognition with Iran (They recognize there is a government of the territorial area known as Iran, but they feel that the current government is illegitimate and refuse to engage with it in diplomatic relationships. Iran similarly knows there is a United States, but refuses to recognize it for political reasons as well.). When two nations do not have *de jure* recognition they will often appoint another nation \"Protecting Power\" who will act as a representative of the appointing nation in the nation they do not recognize. Currently, the Swiss Embassy in Iran has an office dedicated to U.S. affairs as it is the Protecting Power of the United States in Iran. Iran has asked Pakistan to have the same duties. And before you ask, yes, it is the geopolitical equivalent of two people in the same room not speaking to one another, but telling a third person to give the other person a message (U.S.: Switzerland tell Iran that they will give us back our citizens who are being held in their jail cells or we will drop bombs on them. Switzerland: *rolls eyes* Iran, the U.S. says they want their guys back or they will bomb you. Iran: Oh yeah? Tell U.S. 'Death to America!' Switzerland: *eye roll* They said... U.S.: Already routing the bombers!)\n\nIf a region is claimed by more than one government, than it becomes disputed territory. Presently China has a lot of disputed territory with its neighbors and Maritime neighbors. Ongoing disputes include territories also claimed by India, Bhutan, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and The Philippines. Interestingly, the dispute with Taiwan is over who is the real government of China... Taiwan claims much of the other disputed territory China does... plus some territories which China has resolved disputes over.\n\nThe Russia\\-Ukraine situation will likely leave the territory in question (The Donbas and Crimea Regions) listed as disputed. Generally, disputed territory doesn't mean nations cannot be friendly, as the United States has a number of territorial disputes with Canada, despite being very strong diplomatic allies (with the single largest land boarder between two nations in the world, disputed territory was bound to happen). Perhaps the most interesting is the now resolved dispute of the San Juan Island in Washington State. Oversimplified History has a good video about it on his YouTube channel, specifically the \"Pig War\" confrontations and does a pretty good job of highlighting just how dramatic the change to the modern border would have been.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the concept of \"de facto\" diplomatic recognition between nations?\n\nA) Full diplomatic relations with embassies and consulates\nB) No acknowledgment of a government's existence\nC) Informal acknowledgment of a government without full diplomatic ties\nD) Recognition only through a third-party \"Protecting Power\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\"De facto\" diplomatic recognition refers to an informal acknowledgment of a government's existence and control over a territory, without establishing full diplomatic relations. This is in contrast to \"de jure\" recognition, which involves formal diplomatic ties including embassies and consulates (option A). Option B is incorrect as it describes a complete lack of recognition. Option D describes a mechanism used when there is no direct diplomatic recognition, not \"de facto\" recognition itself. The correct answer, C, accurately captures the essence of \"de facto\" recognition as described in the passage, where nations acknowledge a government's existence without fully engaging in formal diplomatic relationships."
