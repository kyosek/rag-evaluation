Original jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court cannot be limited (nor expanded) by the US Congress, but the appellate jurisdiction can.\n\nMy understanding is as follows: the US Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is not necessarily exclusive, and thus other courts can also have original jurisdiction over these cases, which is known as concurrent jurisdiction. The plaintiff can thus choose the court in which he files the lawsuit. If the plaintiff chose to start the case not in the US Supreme Court, but rather in another court having original jurisdiction, then the US Supreme Court could have only appellate jurisdiction over such case.\n\nIs it correct?\n\nIf so, could the US Congress strip the US Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases over which the US Supreme Court has original jurisdiction?\n\n*Edit: In an already deleted answer, It was argued that SCOTUS' original and appellate jurisdiction is mutually\\-exclusive, according to [Marbury v. Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison). However, it seems that SCOTUS has rejected this argument in [Cohens v. Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohens_v._Virginia) in which SCOTUS held that \"where the words admit of appellate jurisdiction, the power to take cognizance of the suit originally does not necessarily negative the power to decide upon it on an appeal, if it may originate in a different Court\" and \"The general expressions in the case of Marbury v. Madison must be understood with the limitations which are given to them in this opinion\".*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an interesting question that, to the best of my knowledge, has never presented itself.\n\nThe statutory limitations on the appellate jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court are very narrow and to my knowledge, there has never been an attempt to limit it with respect to matters of which it has original jurisdiction as well.\n\nTo make it a bit more concrete, one class of orders which is not appealable in federal court jurisprudence is an order remanding a case that is removed to a federal court back to its state court of origin. The reasoning behind this rule is that if there is concurrent jurisdiction, there is no legally cognizable harm in doing so in the judgment of Congress, and if the state court lacks jurisdiction, then the lack of jurisdiction can be appealed in the state court action and a new federal case can be commenced in a court with jurisdiction over the case.\n\nIf SCOTUS decided that a limitation on its appellate jurisdiction in this case was unconstitutional, as a practical matter, no one else could overrule its decision, so, effectively, it would have to consent to the limitation.\n\nA closely related unresolved question of constitutional law is whether Congress has the power to deprive all courts of jurisdiction over some particular otherwise justiciable legal right necessarily established by the U.S. Constitution as an end run around amending the U.S. Constitution.

The correct answer is D, based on several key points:\n\n1. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases involving ambassadors and where a state is a party, as stated in the Constitution.\n2. This original jurisdiction is not exclusive, as the documentation clarifies that other courts can have concurrent jurisdiction.\n3. The plaintiff (in this case, the state) can choose where to file the lawsuit, which they did by filing in the district court.\n4.

Congress cannot limit the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, but they can potentially limit its appellate jurisdiction. However, this has not been definitively tested for cases where the Court also has original jurisdiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the original jurisdiction is not exclusive.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that a permanent resident must be \"physically present in Canada\" for at least 730 days in a five-year period. Technically, being in Peace Arch Provincial Park does meet this criterion of physical presence in Canada.\n\n2. However, this strategy, while potentially valid based on the letter of the law, is unusual and may face scrutiny. Immigration authorities might question the intent behind such frequent, short visits, especially if they appear designed solely to meet the residency requirement rather than demonstrating a genuine connection to Canada.\n\n3. The answer acknowledges that this approach could potentially work, as it does comply with the literal wording of the law. The park is undoubtedly on Canadian soil, and any presence there counts as being in Canada.\n\n4. The \"challenges\" mentioned reflect the reality that immigration decisions involve some discretion, and authorities might view this strategy skeptically, potentially leading to a need for legal challenges as mentioned in the question.\n\n5.

But I asked my professor what's an example of something that would qualify for open transaction status today. He did not have an answer. \n\nAny ideas?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Open transaction treatment is very rare because transactions structured completely openly are very rare. If they happen, it would be in an earn\\-out situation. For example, if you sell an asset in consideration for 10% of the revenues from the asset,to be paid to you until the time when the S\\&P 500 index reaches 28,000 \\- you may get an open transaction since neither the time nor the amount of consideration may be determined at the time of sale.\n\nAs I said, it rarely happens.

Which of the following best describes the tax implications and potential challenges of this transaction?\n\nA) This would likely qualify as an open transaction, allowing the startup to defer recognition of gain until the amount becomes determinable.\nB) The transaction would be treated as a closed transaction, with the startup required to estimate future revenues and recognize the entire gain immediately.\nC) The IRS would likely reject this structure and require the parties to set a maximum cap or time limit to avoid open transaction treatment.\nD) The startup could choose between open or closed transaction treatment, depending on which is more advantageous for their tax situation.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This scenario closely aligns with the rare circumstances that could qualify for open transaction treatment in modern tax law. The key elements that support this classification are:\n\n1. Indeterminate consideration: The 5% of future revenues has no predetermined ceiling or maximum amount.\n2. Indefinite timeframe: There is no time limit specified for the revenue-sharing arrangement.\n3. Inability to reasonably estimate: Given the nature of AI technology and its potential future applications, it would be extremely difficult to make a reliable estimate of future revenues at the time of sale.\n\nThis structure mirrors the example provided in the documentation of a truly open transaction: selling an asset for a percentage of future revenues without a predetermined end point. While open transactions are indeed rare in modern tax practice due to sophisticated estimation methods and the preference for closed transactions, this scenario presents a case where the future consideration is genuinely indeterminate.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it assumes the transaction must be closed, which isn't always the case in such unique circumstances. Option C is misleading; while the IRS generally prefers closed transactions, they don't have the authority to require parties to structure deals in a specific way. Option D is incorrect because the choice between open and closed treatment isn't at the discretion of the taxpayer but depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the transaction.\n\nThis question requires students to analyze the complex interplay between transaction structure and tax law principles, applying their understanding to a real-world scenario in the technology sector."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34147/motion-practice-and-timeliness", "docs_id": 34147, "title": "motion practice and timeliness", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a defendant does not timely reply to a response, then a judge orders the defendant to file a reply within x amount of days; is that prejudicial to the responding party?\n\nPrejudicial to plaintiff because:\nThe defendant lost the opportunity to file a reply by not filing a reply timely.\nThe defendant lost the opportunity to file a reply by not filing a good faith request for extension of time to file a reply showing good cause for not timely filing that reply.\nJudge did not order defendant to show good cause for not timely filing a reply before ordering a reply be filed.\nNo good cause has been shown for why defendant did not make a timely reply prior to the issuing of an order for defendant to reply.\nThe defendant is being given x amount of more days to prepare a reply than the plaintiff is being offered to make a sur\\-reply.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most courts and tribunals have an overriding duty to serve the interests of justice.

The correct answer, A, aligns with the overarching principle stated in the documentation that courts have \"an overriding duty to serve the interests of justice.\" It recognizes that while missing deadlines may be frustrating, it doesn't necessarily cause injustice. Instead, preventing a party from fully presenting their case would be more likely to cause injustice.\n\nOption B represents a common misconception that strict adherence to deadlines always serves justice, but it fails to consider the court's broader duty to ensure fair proceedings. Option C introduces a seemingly fair solution but doesn't address the core issue of justice being served by allowing full case presentation.

Under [8 USC \u00a71409(a)(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409#a_3), one of the requirements is that the father must agree in writing to provide financial support for the child until they reach the age of 18\\. If all the conditions of [8 USC \u00a71409(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409#a) are met, then [8 USC \u00a71401(g)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401#g) applies \"as of the date of birth\" of the person, i.e., they are considered a US citizen from birth.\n\nThus, the person's citizenship is conditional upon a particular act that must be performed before they reach the age of 18\\. As long as the father has written down somewhere, prior to the child's 18th birthday, that they agree to support the child financially until the age of 18 (or even just signed such an agreement written by someone else), this condition is fulfilled and the child is a citizen if all other conditions are met. If the child is over the age of 18 but has such a document in their possession that is dated before their 18th birthday, they can use it to prove that the condition was met and that they are a US citizen. However, if by the time the child turns 18 the father is still alive but has never made such a written agreement, then the child is not a US citizen.\n\nThere are two ways to interpret the law:\n\n1. It grants citizenship. If, at some point between the child's birth and the child's 18th birthday, all the conditions of 8 USC \u00a71409(a) are fulfilled, then the law grants citizenship to such child, and this grant is retroactive to their birth. (This interpretation raises the constitutional question of whether such a citizen would be eligible for the presidency.)\n2. It takes away citizenship. The child is born a citizen, but if the child reaches the age of 18 and the conditions have not been met, their citizenship is taken away by operation of law. It is constitutional for Congress to provide for the loss of citizenship of individuals who were born outside the US and not naturalized in the US. See [*Rogers v. Bellei*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_v._Bellei). However, this interpretation seems less likely to me. I would normally think that if Congress had intended to write a law that takes away citizenship, they would be a bit more explicit about it. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that a person who is still under the age of 18 and for whom the condition still *could* be met in the future could claim current US citizenship in e.g. removal proceedings.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Constitutionally, a person is only required to be granted U.S. citizenship if they are born in the United States. Any other form of citizenship is as provided by statute. So, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409 makes some people citizens who would not otherwise be citizens in its absence. In that sense, it grants citizenship.\n\nMeanwhile, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(g) supports the proposition, which is a legal fiction in some cases, that someone is a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States, and hence eligible to run for President someday, and is retroactively considered to have been a citizen in the meantime for myriad other purposes, despite the fact that in the case of an unmarried non\\-citizen mother and a citizen father, this right is not vested and could never come into being if the required actions aren't taken after the fact.\n\nIncidentally, this statute has been upheld against constitutional challenges. *[Miller v. Albright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/420/case.pdf)*, 520 U.S. 420 (1997\\).\n\nSo, while you would like to clearly distinguish between someone having citizenship granted and having citizenship revoked, Congress, in its wisdom, has not been so accommodating and has declined to clearly distinguish between the two interpretations.\n\nThis statute is a bit like the question of [Schr\u00f6dinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat), who is indeterminately alive and dead at the same time until there is a measurement of its state, in quantum physics.\n\nA person with an unmarried non\\-citizen mother and a citizen father is both a U.S. citizen from birth and always has been, and has never been a citizen of the U.S., until the situation is resolved with an actual determination of the question in accordance with the requirements of the statute.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A child is born in France to an unmarried U.S. citizen father and a French mother.

The following is from a US perspective.\n\nIn short, you can't say \" a developer is bad\" (which a reasonable person would interpret as referring to the developer's skills, professionalism or character), and not risk a lawsuit.\n\nMerely labeling something as your opinion, does not make it statement of opinion. The difference between fact and opinion is that a statement of fact is falsifiable according, while an statement of opinion is not. This is especially relevant because under US law, proving falseness of the offending statement is a required portion of the plaintiff's case.\n\nNote that the above statement is not only potentially defamatory, but (in my non\\-lawyer opinion) seems likely defamation *per se* (which means that the plaintiff does not need to prove actual damage from the statement).\n\nFor example, in TRONFELD v.

Option B is the correct answer because it focuses on providing specific, verifiable facts about the developer's performance, such as missed deadlines and unmet project requirements. The documentation states that mentioning \"easier to verify true statements\" is legally safer than making broad negative claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as the documentation explains, merely labeling something as an opinion does not protect it from being considered a statement of fact in a legal context. The term \"bad\" could be interpreted as defamatory per se, similar to the example given about lawyers.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while \"unsatisfactory\" might seem more subjective than \"bad,\" it still carries a negative connotation about the developer's skills or professionalism. The documentation emphasizes that context matters, and there are no \"magic words\" that automatically protect against defamation claims.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially the most dangerous option.

In addition to showcasing its state\\-of\\-the\\-art hardware components, Apple claimed the machine is built for the future. It's key selling point is upgradability and expansion through swappable hardware modules residing inside an easily accessible chassis. Consequently, Apple charges a hefty $50K for this privilege.\n\nWithin less than a year after its debut, however, the Mac Pro's status as the most powerful Macintosh is nearly coming to an end. Apple just introduced several low to mid range models featuring its incredibly fast M1 processor.

The correct answer, B, is the strongest factor supporting a potential lawsuit because specific promises about future upgrades would create a contractual obligation that the company must fulfill. \n\nOption A, while relevant, is not the strongest factor because rapid obsolescence is a known risk in the tech industry and doesn't necessarily imply misleading marketing. \n\nOption C, the price difference, might contribute to customer dissatisfaction but doesn't directly relate to any legal obligation or misleading claims. \n\nOption D represents a general consumer expectation, but without specific promises, it's not a strong legal argument. \n\nThe key legal issue here is whether the company made specific, actionable promises rather than general marketing claims.

This approach allows the company to challenge the court's authority to hear the case without fully submitting to its jurisdiction. It's a crucial first step in international legal disputes, as it addresses the fundamental question of whether the US court has the right to adjudicate the matter involving a foreign entity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ignoring the lawsuit could lead to a default judgment against the company, which could have serious consequences, including potential enforcement in Germany through international agreements. Option B is flawed because filing a counter-suit in German courts doesn't directly address or resolve the US lawsuit. Option D is inadvisable as it essentially admits guilt and liability without attempting to defend the company's interests.\n\nBy making a special appearance through a US lawyer, the German company can argue that the US court lacks personal jurisdiction over them, potentially due to insufficient contacts with the US or other legal grounds.

Here, you have no right: the fruit's owner has every right to the fruit he owns. You have no right just to come along and take it. A right to deprive the other of something would be relevant where he had misappropriated it from you.\n\n*Appropriation* is any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner. Here, you are assuming the rights of the owner by taking the fruit.\n\n*Property* is fairly self\\-explanatory. Everything except land is property.\n\n*Belonging to another:* \"Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest.\" Here, the owner of the tree has possession and control and a proprietary right and interest.\n\n*Permanently depriving* means that you treat the thing \\[fruit in this case] as your own to dispose of regardless of the other\u2019s rights.\n\nAll of these apply in your case of taking fruit from a tree owned and grown by someone else.\n\nThere is an exception, which may be relevant to the \"by hook or by crook\" quote:\n\n> A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.\n\nBut this doesn't apply where the tree is not growing wild.\n\nIt is generally held that you can cut off foliage or whatever which is overhanging your land \u2014 I can't find a reference specifically, but I expect it's to do with nuisance and free enjoyment of your own land \u2014 but the severed parts and any fruit on them are **still the property of their owner,** and you can't deprive him of them permanently. Public land isn't **yours,** so **you** can't cut off branches overhanging it: the public authority can. Even there, they must give them back to the owner.\n\nThe 1968 Act repeals a number of prior Acts (all the way back to the First Statute of Westminster in 1265\\), but I can't see anything relevant to the restriction of common law. If what you quote as common law still applied in 1968, it was that Act which restricted it to **wild** fruit (as opposed to fruit overhanging public land).

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The Theft Act 1968 clearly defines taking fruit from trees owned by others as theft, unless the fruit is growing wild.\n2. The Royal Horticultural Society advice explicitly states that picking fruit from overhanging branches without permission is not allowed.\n3. The BBC's investigation concluded that there is no legal right to pick fruit from overhanging branches, even for passersby on public property.\n4. While option C might seem appealing due to the exception for wild plants in the Theft Act, the question specifies a suburban area, making it unlikely that the trees are truly \"wild\" in a legal sense.\n5. Option D is incorrect because the historical common law right, if it ever existed, has been superseded by current legislation.\n6. Option B avoids the legal issues but doesn't fulfill the event's purpose of fruit picking.\n\nTherefore, obtaining explicit permission from property owners is the most legally sound and ethical approach, addressing both the letter of the law and the spirit of community engagement.

Given that, if someone confessed a crime (major or minor) the priest could not report that individual to the police (i.e. act on his own will). \n\nI understand that a defendant's attorney could not be forced by a judge to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was exchanged between the defendant and even if the attorney accidentally revealed that the defendant did commit the crime, it would have to be removed from record because that is privileged information. \n\nMy question is: Are priests held to the same standard? Can a judge (federal, state, etc.) order a priest to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was said in confession? And if the judge did and the priest refused, would the priest be held in contempt? Does this apply to all states in the US? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Confidential statements made in confession to a religious advisor are privileged in every U.S. state and in federal court. \n\nThere is a body of law that surrounds each kind of privilege (attorney\\-client, psychotherapist\\-patient, doctor\\-patient, priest\\-parishioner, accountant\\-client, husband\\-wife) that covers exceptions to the general rule. At least a couple of privileges (attorney\\-client and husband\\-wife) actually involve more than one distinct privilege: attorney\\-client privilege has a confidential communications component and a work product component that have different rules; a husband\\-wife privilege has a confidential communications component and a 5th Amendment like component that allows one spouse to refuse to permit the other current spouse to testify against him or her.\n\nThe privilege for confessions made to priests is generally speaking, broader than the attorney\\-client privilege. Both attorney\\-client privileges have crime\\-fraud and prevention of imminent harm exceptions that do not apply to priests. The work product component of the attorney\\-client privilege also has an exception when work product is the sole available source of critical information available by no other means (e.g. due to the fact that destructive testing was conducted on evidence).\n\nA judge cannot order a priest to disclose to a grand jury or any other tribunal or official, what was said in confession, and the priest could not be held in contempt for not testifying in this manner. Indeed, even if, for example, a secret microphone had been placed on a suspect and captured his confession to a priest, the recording of that conversation would not be admissible as evidence in any legal forum due to the privilege.\n\nOften, as in the case of a seal of confessional for a Roman Catholic priest, a privilege is also accompanied by a duty on the part of the person receiving the confidential information to keep the information disclosed confidential. But, the duty to keep privileged communications confidential does not always exactly match the scope of the privilege. \n\nFor example, a Mormon minister's religious obligation to keep confessions confidential might not be precisely the same as those of a Roman Catholic priest, even though confessions to either one would be privileged from compulsory disclosure in a court or other tribunal. Similarly, confidential communications to an attorney can be disclosed by an attorney in furtherance of the representation in a way that a confidential communication to a priest usually could not be disclosed.\n\nIn at least some jurisdictions, the priest could probably be compelled to testify regarding whether an individual came to a place at a given time to confess (which would establish alibi or lack thereof, and proximity to the time scene at a particular time) since that itself wouldn't be a confidential matter shared with the priest and could have been witnesses by anyone else in the church building who was not a part of the confession whether it not it actually was witnessed by anyone else. In such a jurisdiction, if the priest refused to testify regarding that matter, the priest could be held in contempt of court just like any other witness under a subpoena who refused to testify.\n\nThe law is not entirely clear over the extent that the priest\\-parishioner privilege is mandated solely by a statute, common law rule, or court rule (as the case may be from state to state, this varies considerably), and to which extent the statute, common law rule, or court rule providing for the privilege is constitutionally mandated by the free exercise clause of the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution (incorporated to apply to the states through the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution), and by parallel state constitutional provisions.\n\nThe question of whether the priest\\-parishioner privilege is constitutionally mandated matters because some states, in the wake of scandals involving sexual abuse of children by clergy, have sought to extend the requirement that a designated person knowing of instances of child abuse must report their suspicions to authorities, that applies to many kinds of licensed professionals who deal with children in most states, to religious officials who deal with children and their supervisors and colleagues in their churches or denominations.\n\nIf the question is constitutional, it might be the case that these laws would be unconstitutional. Middle ground might find that there might be a duty of someone taking a confession from a priest to report child abuse (because this is an abuse by the priest of the privilege of receiving privileged confessions), but not a duty to report child abuse disclosed in confession by anyone else. Of course, if there is no constitutional dimension to the privilege, the legislature is free to modify it with legislation as they see fit.\n\nThere is also an issue in every particular privilege regarding whom the privilege belongs to, and hence, who has a right to legally waive a privilege and allow testimony concerning the confidential communications to be provided. It might belong to the person making the confession, it might belong to the priest, or it might belong to both (hence requiring mutual consent for a waiver of privilege and not just consent by one individual who holds the privilege).

It is not really a textbook, however, so much as a resource used by both law students and practicing lawyers and judges.\n\nThe editor of all editions of it since 1996 is Bryan A. Garner, who is also the leading authority on what constitutes good modern legal writing (which in some cases violate outdated elementary school usage rules like never starting a sentence with a conjunction).\n\nLaw textbooks are subject\\-matter specific, and there is no one class in which legal terms are taught. In contacts class, law students learn contracts related terms. In property class, law students learn property related terms. In torts class, law students learn torts related terms.\n\n> I am sure in law classes, legal terms are defined.\n\nNot really. Your assumption is more false than true.\n\nU.S. legal instruction is typically conducted using the Socratic method and with a review of the leading appellate court cases and the key statutory language in each subject.\n\nRather than having the textbook define a term, it is far more common for students in a class to read four appellate court cases addressing a subject, none of which define a term, and for the professor to ask a student chosen at random what that term means, often probing the student with follow up questions for fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\nUsually, the final conclusion is not stated outright either by the professor or the textbook in textbook author provided text, although the cases referenced and statutes referenced will often provide one or more than one definition for a term, not necessarily consistent ones.\n\nLaw professors in the U.S., collectively, take the attitude that there is no absolute meaning for anything and that it is a waste of time to teach specific legal rules or doctrines which may change over the course of a student's career. Instead, they focus on teaching how to argue over close call gray areas in the law and how to identify legal issues, with the idea that the clear black and white rules of law are easy to learn after you graduate from law school when and if you need to do so.\n\nThere are books called \"legal outlines\" and \"treatises\" which are more direct than law professors and textbooks in providing answers in a particular subject, as are bar exam review materials. But, again, it is important to understand the nature of the beast before you use them.\n\n> I am a mathematician who likes terms to be defined precisely. I am\n> sure in law classes, legal terms are defined. If it turns out that\n> pretty much every law textbook defines terms precisely, then I will\n> simply check Google.\n\nThis is a fool's errand (I was an undergraduate math major myself before becoming a lawyer).\n\nThis is because legal terms don't have a single consistent meaning. The same word or phrase can and often does mean different things in different contexts.\n\nMany legal terms defined in Black's Law dictionary have multiple meanings stated and it is not at all uncommon for a statute or contract to define a word in a new and unconventional way.\n\nI probably draft contacts with novel definitions for words at least a few times every year. There are a million or so U.S. lawyers, and tens of thousands of federal, state and local legislators out there further complicating affairs each year, in addition to thousands of judges whose decisions may coin new legal terms or new meanings for existing legal terms. This is why these resources need to be updated regularly.\n\nFor example, there is no one consistent definition of the word \"person\" which is widely used in a variety of statutes and regulations and contracts.\n\nAs another example, the term \"security\" means something very different in the law of securities regulation, where it refers to investments made by passive investors and traded in secondary markets, than it does in the law of secured transactions, where it means collateral for an obligation. Likewise, in bankruptcy law, national defense law, criminal law or tort law, the term security means something entirely different in each separate context.\n\nAs a third example, the term \"equity\" can have very different meanings depending upon context. It can mean the value of something net of debt to which it is subject. It can refer the the jurisprudence of courts of chancery before equity jurisprudence and law jurisprudence were merged in the 19th century which is relevant to the constitutional right to a jury trial in federal court and to the kinds of defenses that can be asserted in response to a claim. Or, it can refer to ownership interests in entities as distinct from debt interests in entities, as a third and not comprehensive list of meanings.\n\nCommon law countries, in particular (i.e. those countries with legal systems derived from those of England) are notorious for their inconsistent use of terminology, which is rather more consistent in civil law countries due to the way that civil codes are drafted.\n\nAlso keep in mind the famous quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.:\n\n> The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\n\nIn law, the fact that A implies B and that B implies C does not necessarily mean that A implies C. The law simply isn't that consistent and logical. You can't follow long chains of logical reasoning in the law with any confidence. Generally, only fact specific applications of the law that involve fact patterns similar to your own are reliable, and the law is also sometimes just plain inconsistent even when applied to the same set of facts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about legal terminology and resources, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A law student is preparing for a class discussion on contract law and comes across the term \"consideration\" in multiple contexts.

The correct answer, B, aligns with the documentation's description of the Socratic method and case-based learning in U.S. law schools.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while Black's Law Dictionary is a valuable resource, the documentation emphasizes that legal terms often have multiple meanings and can vary by context. Memorizing a single definition would not provide the depth of understanding required.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as the documentation states, law professors in the U.S. generally \"take the attitude that there is no absolute meaning for anything\" and focus on teaching how to argue over gray areas rather than providing definitive answers.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, according to the documentation, law textbooks typically don't provide direct definitions. Instead, they present cases and statutes for students to analyze.\n\nThe correct answer, B, reflects the approach described in the documentation where students read multiple appellate court cases to understand how a term is applied in different contexts. This method acknowledges the complexity and context-dependent nature of legal terminology, and develops the critical thinking skills emphasized in law school education.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies to a real-world scenario (preparing for a law school class), and tests critical thinking about how legal concepts are best understood, rather than simple memorization."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56354/how-do-uk-pranksters-trollstation-get-away-with-repeatedly-impersonating-polic", "docs_id": 56354, "title": "How do UK pranksters &quot;trollstation&quot; get away with repeatedly impersonating police officers?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This video is one of many in which the YouTube prank posse known as \"trollstation\" impersonate police officers and run around the streets of London generally causing mischief.

They also seem to commit the separate crime of wasting police time, for example by approaching cops in the street and falsely confessing to crimes.\n\nMy question is, is impersonating a police officer only illegal in some circumstances? (They notably aren't using the costume to get any kind of benefit or con anyone) Are they just lucky not to get arrested? Or is it simply that the police don't charge them because the negative PR of arresting beloved YouTube personalities who are very popular with young people wouldn't be worth it?\n\nI guess I'm just amazed this is legal.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=yL8WUHewGM0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL8WUHewGM0)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's illegal *if* the intent is to deceive. Under [S50(1\\) of the Police Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/90):\n\n> Any person who with intent to deceive impersonates a member of a police force or special constable, or makes any statement or does any act calculated falsely to suggest that he is such a member or constable, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.\n\nTheir intent would need to be proven. It will be fact\\-specific; in some cases far easier to prove than in others. The criminal justice system is overburdened and underfunded so it is no surprise that these trolling videos are given no priority whatsoever.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the need to correctly identify the individual to prosecute. Doing so would require a fair amount of police time, time that could perhaps be spent on more urgent priorities given the relative lack of harm these videos are doing compared to more serious crimes.\n\nHowever, in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-OA9sXzLQ) (Would You Help a Police Officer Having An Asthma Attack?) an S50(2\\) offence would seem to have been committed by the actor wearing the police clothing:\n\n> Any person who, not being a constable, wears any article of police uniform in circumstances where it gives him an appearance so nearly resembling that of a member of a police force as to be calculated to deceive shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.\n\nIt does appear that both offences are being committed in these various videos, and the only reason people aren't being prosecuted is practical: there are more serious crimes to focus on, and the police would need to identify who exactly committed this crime\\-\\-given these all happened at least two years ago, it would be challenging to say the least.\n\n> They also seem to commit the separate crime of wasting police time, for example by approaching cops in the street and falsely confessing to crimes.\n\nUnder [S5(2\\) of the Criminal Law Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/5), wasting police time is a criminal offence. Bringing proceedings in court requires the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) since those proceedings could have a chilling effect on the propensity of the public to report genuine matters to the police in the future.\n\nIt is likely that while \"wasteful employment\" of police time was caused by these people, so committing the offence, it is likely viewed simply as \"part and parcel\" of the job and the officer likely didn't spend any time at all investigating the confessions (depending on their nature).\n\nOf course, even if the officer *did* spend time investigating the false confessions, the DPP would need to give their consent so unless the person has a demonstrated history of doing this (that would stand up in court) *or* the time wasted was of a particularly serious nature (e.g. the man who falsely claimed to be the Yorkshire Ripper), it seems unlikely consent would be granted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular YouTube prank channel regularly posts videos where they impersonate police officers in London, causing mischief but not directly harming or defrauding anyone.

If the new PP now contains a section that allows third parties to use my data I might notice that too late.\n\nFor simplicity, this question concerns data that was already stored when a privacy policy changed, not newly acquired data afterwards.\n\n**Is a change of a privacy policy without explicit consent valid under the GDPR?** If I understand [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) (1\\) a) correctly, the PP must not add change the purposes a data subject has given consent to, unless at least one of Article 6 (1\\) b)\\-f) holds.\n\n(This is related to terms\\-of\\-service changes without notice, which, at least in Germany, are only allowed if the possible causes where explicitly listed, as far as I know).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The consent presented in the question is a text\\-book example on how to *not* secure consent under the GDPR. The GDPR requires concent to be explicit, specific, freely given, and informed. This particular privacy policy does not measure up to *any* of these requirements.\n\nThe GDPR goes to great lengths to regulate consent. For instance, in Article 7 (2\\) is says:\n\n> Any part of such a declaration \\[of consent] which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.\n\nSo if the consent obtained is *not* explicit, specific, freely given, and informed, and the company relies on *consent* to ensure lawfulness of processing, it is breaking the law (and may be fined under the GDPR).\n\nThe big problem with this privacy policy is this sentence:\n\n> Your continued access to or use of any of the Services shall be deemed your acceptance of the Privacy Policy.\n\nAs you've noted, the GDPR requires consent to be *explicit*. What \"explicit\" means is spelled out in Recital 32, which (among other things) says:\n\n> Silence, pre\\-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.\n\nAnd Recital 32 goes on state that consent must be *specific*:\n\n> When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.\n\nThe full privacy policy lists 16 different purposes for which personal data is collected, but do not seek specific consent for *any* of them.\n\nConsent under GDPR must also be *freely given*. Recital 42 says (among other things):\n\n> Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n\nHere the company states that continued use of the service \"shall be deemed your acceptance\". The only way the data subject can refuse consent is to *not* use the service, which is to the detriment of the data subject. This also makes the consent invalid.\n\nFinally, the GDPR also requires consent to be *informed*. What this means is spelled out in Recital 42, which (among other things say):\n\n> For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least \\[...] the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.\n\nHere the data subject is supposed to consent to some unknown, future change which may be to allow different purposes of the processing.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications under GDPR?\n\nA) The company's approach is compliant because they posted the changes on their website\nB) The user's continued account existence constitutes implicit consent to the new policy\nC) The company is likely in violation of GDPR due to lack of explicit, informed consent\nD) The company is compliant as long as they allow users to opt-out after discovering the changes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario violates several key GDPR principles regarding consent. The company's approach fails to meet the GDPR requirements for consent to be explicit, specific, freely given, and informed:\n\n1. Explicit: The company relies on passive acceptance (\"continued use\") rather than active, explicit consent. GDPR Recital 32 specifically states that \"silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not constitute consent.\"\n\n2. Specific: The new purposes for data processing weren't specifically consented to. GDPR requires consent for each purpose of data processing.\n\n3. Freely given: The user has no genuine choice to refuse consent without detriment (losing service access), which violates GDPR principles as per Recital 42.\n\n4. Informed: The user wasn't properly informed of the changes, especially given the long period of inactivity.

The most effective strategy is B, demonstrating that the company has already paid taxes on the same income to Utah. This leverages the safe harbor principle mentioned in the documentation, which states that \"For every dollar of taxable income, you can only be taxed by one state.\" This was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the location of servers doesn't necessarily determine nexus, especially given Wisconsin's broad interpretation of \"doing business\" in the state. Option C is flawed because Wisconsin's statute specifically mentions services received in Wisconsin, which could include cloud-based services. Option D is risky and likely ineffective, as challenging the constitutionality of a state's tax law is a complex and often unsuccessful approach, especially given that the documentation doesn't suggest any clear constitutional issues with the statute.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the examinee to consider the legal principles, practical implications, and most strategic approach to resolving a complex tax issue, rather than simply recalling facts from the documentation."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67499/is-it-possible-to-create-a-non-profit-business-on-f-2-visa-status", "docs_id": 67499, "title": "Is it possible to create a non-profit business on F-2 visa status?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider a person comes to the US with an F\\-2 visa status and has a plan to get his/her green card in the next year, but at the moment he/she likes to start a commercial website or mobile app but for free, up to he/she could get his/her green card.\n\nIs it legal for him/her and won't cause a problem for him/his green card in the future?\n\nPS: By a free commercial website/mobile app I mean something like websites/applications those offer a free access for a period of time(Free trial), or offer a free access to some basic utilities(and charge users for money for premium access).

The correct answer is C because it combines a third-party tip (the family member's call) with additional evidence (the drug-sniffing dog's indication), which could constitute probable cause for a search without a warrant under exigent circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a mere accusation without additional evidence is typically insufficient for probable cause. \n\nOption B is not the best answer because while a warrant would allow a search, the question specifies \"without your consent,\" and the scenario includes an inaccurate detail about a past record that contradicts the given information.\n\nOption D could potentially justify a search under the \"plain view\" doctrine or exigent circumstances, but it relies on the police directly observing illegal activity, which is not mentioned in the original scenario.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of probable cause as outlined in Illinois v.

In Virginia, most of these requirements are laid out in judicial decisions, not statutes. However, the one requirement [set by statute](https://vacode.org/8.01-236/) is that the possessor has to have \"possessed\" the land **for 15 years.**\n\nAs for the rest of the requirements, they are the usual ones. Ten years ago, the [Supreme Court of Virginia](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1058407/helms-v-manspile/) gave a nice, concise summary. It said that to \"establish title...by adverse possession,\" your neighbor would have to prove that their possession was:\n\n1. actual,\n2. hostile,\n3. exclusive,\n4. visible, and\n5. continuous...\n\nHere is what the Court said each element requires:\n\n> Use and occupation of property...constitutes proof of actual possession. One is in hostile possession if his possession is under a claim of right and adverse to the right of the true owner. One's possession is exclusive when it is not in common with others. Possession is visible when it is *so obvious that the true owner **may be presumed** to know about it.* Possession is continuous only if it exists without interruption for the statutory period.\n\n**Two things to notice:**\n\n1. Because your neighbor's possession must be *adverse,* you can stop the 15 year possession \"*clock*\" by simply *giving them your permission* to mow the lawn.\n2. It does not matter that your neighbors are mowing \"in secret and without letting us know it.\" That you are here asking about it shows the mowing so \"visible\" that you know what is going on.\n\n**For more information**\n\nWhether your neighbors can claim your land depends on how Virginia courts have interpreted the law. Luckily for you, several Virginia lawyers have gone online to explain those details.

Option C represents the most significant concession among the choices provided. By reducing the interest rate and extending the loan term, the bank is making substantial changes to the original agreement to accommodate the debtor's financial struggles. This aligns with the explanation in the documentation that concessions can include \"a creditor's agreement to be paid a lower amount\" (in this case, lower interest) and \"an extension of the payment deadline\" (extending the loan term).\n\nOption A, while a minor concession, is likely too limited in scope to qualify as a distressed restructuring. Option B involves action by the debtor, not a concession from the creditor. Option D is merely a suggestion and doesn't involve any actual concessions from the bank.\n\nThis question requires the integration of the legal concept with a real-world scenario, testing the ability to apply the principle of \"concessions\" in the context of financial difficulties, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of analysis and application."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15976/the-condition-of-amendment-in-us-constitution-article-v-does-it-have-any-practi", "docs_id": 15976, "title": "The condition of amendment in US constitution article V: Does it have any practical effect?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Article V rules how the constitution can be amended, provided that\n\n> ... no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\n\nGiven these texts, it seems that the content of an amendment has some restrictions.

I am renting this property and do not own it.\n\nLong story short I had a NEMA 14\\-50 EV charger installed in my rental house in Seattle, with the permission of the owner. This was roughly a year ago. The electrician lied to me and told me I did not need an inspection. His company then called me saying that I did, and they went ahead and had charged me for it. It then failed inspection because he hadn't installed a GFI. On an exterior circuit... So they came back and fixed it (for free) but completely botched my panel and disconnected my water heater. I then didn't have hot water for 3 days. I tried to let them fix it (again) and they promised to send out an emergency dispatch that day. I called 4 times and was told they were coming, and sat around all day waiting; they never showed up. The next day I called a different company who came out on an emergency call and fixed it. The new electrician made many comments about things they'd done incorrectly and fixed some of their minor mistakes for me, free of charge. Since this was an emergency call on Labor day they charged me their holiday \\+ emergency rate of $500\\. No cheap, but I wanted to take warm showers again and the other company did not seem inclined to fix their mistakes.\n\nI was understandably angry and called them, demanding them to reimburse me for the emergency service after I tried repeatedly to allow them to fix the mistake and they failed to. I received a verbal agreement from the site manager that he would. Nothing happened, of course, and then they started ignoring or not returning my calls. Eventually I gave up as the frustration was not worth it.\n\nNow I actually do not recall if an inspector came by a second time to approve the fix. Over the past week they have been calling and emailing me saying that they failed to document that the GFI was installed and that another inspection is required, or I could photograph the panel for them. I am inclined to tell them to go pound sand and to stop contacting me. I may also tell them I will send a picture of the updated panel, if they reimburse me the $500 as agreed upon last year.\n\nShould they be unwilling and I just continue to ignore them, is there anything negative that can happen to me? Or is this something that is now entirely their problem?\n\nSummary:\n\nA year ago a private electrician incorrectly installed an external 220V outlet on the side of a house I am renting (no GFI). The owner was consulted before the work was done. They \"fixed\" it and in the process disconnected my water heater. I attempted to allow them to correct this but they no\\-showed, so I had a 3rd party fix the panel. Now they are asking me for a picture of the panel to confirm they did install the GFI but after so much consternation and money spent fixing the issue, I am disinclined to work with them unless failing to do so can cause me issues.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some consequences for you, under the [Seattle Residential Code](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/SeattleResidentialCode/2015SRCChapter1.pdf). Per R103\\.5\n\n> Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this\n> code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not\n> to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation\n> occurs or begins until compliance is achieved.\n\n$182,500 per year.\n\nAlso under R103\\.4,\n\n> Whenever any building or structure is being occupied contrary to the\n> provisions of this code, the building official may order such\n> occupancy discontinued and the building or structure, or portion\n> thereof, vacated by notice.\n\nThere *should* be a notation on your panel indicating permit number and approval, but if you have the permit number, you can check if the inspection was done and the work was approved (I think [this](https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/portal/welcome.aspx) will report status). The legal burden of assuring that the work was done correctly and paperwork is in order ultimately falls on the owner, though the city at least initially talks to the contractor.\n\nInsofar as a customer taking a picture doesn't count as an actual final inspection, I suspect that some cost\\- and time\\-saving short\\-cuts were taken.\n\nFollowing up on the new information about being a tenant, the primary legal question is whether you have a duty of care towards the landlord, since in engaging this company, the landlord's interest may be put at risk. The landlord may have protected his interest via a clause in the lease saying \"you must get written permission to modify the property, and you assume full liability for resulting damages\", so first thing to check is what the lease says (perhaps look for a \"Tenant's duty of care\" clause). In lieu of clear evidence that you caused damage to the owner (economic damage, by negligence w.r.t. his need to have proper permits and the whopping fines that follow), I don't see what the risk to you would be in just washing your hands of the problem.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Seattle installed an EV charger in their rental property with the landlord's permission, but the installation process was fraught with issues.

It addresses the potential legal consequences mentioned in the Seattle Residential Code, which could result in significant fines (up to $500 per day) or even forced vacation of the property.\n\n2.

Detaining someone against their will for longer than necessary to answer a few questions on the spot (which is a lesser imposition on your freedom called a \"Terry stop\") is what it means to be arrested. Legally, the police are only allowed to arrest you if they have probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime.\n\nI believe that you are confusing arrested (being detained by law enforcement against your will for more than a Terry stop), with being booked, or being charged with a crime. Generally speaking people are arrested first, and then booked next, and then charged with a crime after that, although this isn't always the order in which this happens.\n\nIn much the same way, if the police observe someone committing a crime, they will first handcuff them which places them under arrest, and then book them sometime not too long later when they arrive at the police station, and then formally charge them sometime after that after a conversation with the prosecuting attorney to see if the prosecuting attorney is willing to pursue the case. Booking generally involves bringing someone to a police station, getting identifying information, taking a mug shot, taking finger prints, and depending upon what the police want to do, searching your person and inventorying your possessions prior to putting you in a jail cell in jail garb.\n\nUsually, however, the grand jury or the prosecuting attorney (it varies by jurisdiction) does have subpoena power to compel you to provide information under oath prior to trial as a witness, following the service of a subpoena upon you a reasonable time in advance as set forth in the relevant court rules, unless you invoke your 5th Amendment right against self\\-incrimination and are not granted immunity from prosecution based upon your testimony in exchange, or you invoke some other legal privilege against having to testify.\n\nThey can, of course, simply ask you to come to an interrogation room and answer questions, and merely imply that it is mandatory without actually saying that you must and without clarifying the situation. **In that case, which is extremely common, their legal right to interrogate you flows from your own consent.** If you answer their questions, your answers could provide the police with probable cause to arrest you that they didn't have when they started asking questions.\n\nIndeed, often, when police interrogate you before booking you, they are doing so because they need your statements to establish the probable cause needed to legally arrest you. This is why criminal defense attorneys counsel people to immediate ask for a lawyer and refuse to answer any questions other than those needed to establish your identity.\n\nYou can also ask if you are under arrest and if you are free to leave (which are mutually exclusive).\n\n**If they say you are not under arrest, you are free to leave,** unless you are appearing pursuant to a subpoena.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A detective asks a suspect to come to the police station for questioning about a recent crime. The suspect agrees and is led to an interrogation room where the detective instructs them to sit down. After 30 minutes of questioning, the suspect asks if they can leave. Which of the following best describes the legal status of this situation?\n\nA) The suspect is under arrest because they were instructed to sit in the interrogation room\nB) The suspect is free to leave because they haven't been formally charged with a crime\nC) The suspect's legal status depends on whether the detective allows them to leave when asked\nD) The suspect is experiencing a Terry stop, which allows for brief questioning without arrest\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of arrest, consent, and detention in a law enforcement context. The correct answer is C because the suspect's legal status hinges on whether they are allowed to leave when they ask.\n\nKey points from the documentation:\n1. If a person is not permitted to leave an interrogation, they are, by definition, under arrest.\n2. Police can only arrest someone if they have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.\n3. When police imply that questioning is mandatory without actually saying so, their legal right to interrogate comes from the suspect's own consent.\n4. A person can ask if they are under arrest and if they are free to leave.\n\nIn this scenario, the suspect initially came voluntarily, which implies consent. However, the length of questioning (30 minutes) exceeds a brief Terry stop. The crucial moment is when the suspect asks to leave. If the detective allows them to leave, it confirms that the entire interaction was consensual. If the detective refuses, it transforms the situation into an arrest, which would require probable cause.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the transition points between consensual interaction, Terry stops, and arrests. The distractors represent common misconceptions: A is incorrect because the instruction to sit alone doesn't constitute arrest; B is incorrect because formal charges are not required for arrest; D is incorrect because the duration exceeds a typical Terry stop."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37053/sexual-assault-intoxication-consent", "docs_id": 37053, "title": "sexual assault, intoxication, consent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [This question/answer did not quite satisfy my curiosity](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17646/if-two-individuals-who-are-too-drunk-to-give-consent-have-sex-are-both-guilty-of).\n\nLet's assume this is about heterosexual sex. In a society with law that does not discriminate with respect to gender, if both a woman and man are intoxicated and both apparently give consent to sex, does the law hold either accountable for criminal culpability for sexual assault?\n\nI understand that an intoxicated adult's consent to sex is not considered legally sufficient for responsible consent. If one person was not intoxicated and the other was, consent was given, sex occurred, and then later the previously intoxicated person had regrets, I can sorta see the basis for a criminal prosecution of the non\\-intoxicated person for manipulating this drunk person into a sex act when they would not otherwise consent.\n\nAlso, in most criminal acts, for the perpetrator to be drunk when they commit a crime *might* **mitigate** culpability, but intoxication of the perp does not **eliminate** culpability.

The correct answer, C, reflects the need for a nuanced approach that doesn't make assumptions based on gender or who reported the incident first.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes gender-based culpability, which goes against the principle of gender-neutral laws mentioned in the documentation. This approach would be discriminatory and legally unsound.\n\nOption B, while tempting due to the mutual intoxication, oversimplifies the issue. It fails to account for potential differences in levels of intoxication or other factors that might influence consent or capacity.\n\nOption D, charging both parties, is an extreme interpretation that doesn't align with typical legal approaches to these situations. It fails to recognize that even in cases of mutual intoxication, one party may still be more capable of consent than the other.\n\nThe correct approach, C, acknowledges the complexity of these situations. It requires law enforcement to investigate thoroughly, considering factors such as:\n1. Relative levels of intoxication\n2. Decision-making capacity of each individual\n3. Any evidence of coercion or manipulation\n4. Consistency of accounts and witness statements\n\nThis approach aligns with the documentation's emphasis on the nuanced nature of consent in intoxicated states and the need to consider multiple factors beyond just the presence of alcohol or drugs.

So, if you think that the defendant might not answer and the original complaint was wrong, you need to not seek a default on the original complaint, amend the complaint and reserve the amended complaint.\n\nThe idea behind this rule is that the defendant should be able to make a rational decision about whether or not to fight a lawsuit based upon what is at stake in the lawsuit and not be surprised if the defendant decides to default to avoid litigation costs.\n\nBut, if a party answers the Complaint, then damages are determined based upon the evidence provided at trial and may ultimately be determined at trial to be either higher or lower than the amount claimed in the Complaint.\n\nThe idea behind this rule is that if the defendant had decided to litigate that the ultimate outcome should prefer reality to procedure since each party has input into how the decision is made by the court.\n\nIt also isn't uncommon for events that take place after the filing of the Complaint to change the amount of damages that are owed. Sometimes the damages go down, for example, if it is possible to mitigate damages in some way such as by selling defective goods that were delivered at a discount.

I already have a basis of claim in my actual case. But the case prompted a question mark over an apparent loophole in UK consumer protection/product liability law, and I'm wondering if it's covered in some consumer law I don't know about.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nI bought an expensive computer networking product, some years ago. The firmware hadn't been updated since, so I decided to do so. The manufacturer puts new firmware on their website, together with \"release notes\" (guidance and instructions concerning the update, and procedures to follow in updating). The instructions state simply, to upload the firmware to the device, and restart the device. No warnings or caveats are stated.\n\nOn following these instructions, the product was rendered inoperable \\- \"bricked\". I found numerous threads on the manufacturers support website where many people had exoerienced this exact same issue, often with this exact same model, over a period of months or years. The manufacturers staff members' response was invariably that this update, applied as in the release notes, can irreparably break the product in some circumstances. Specifically, if the product still had old/original firmware, then the procedure in the release notes would render the product irreparable. A completely different procedure, not in the notes or mentioned by them, should be followed instead. If the broken product was in warranty, it would be replaced, but otherwise nothing could be done except pay the very high price for out\\-of\\-warranty replacement/repair.\n\nI'm happy to rely on tort in my own actual claim (see below), but it never hurts to know your law fully. I am trying to understand whether any specific product safety laws apply as well, since the Consumer Rights Act 2015 seems to exclude this (it falls in various loopholes?):\n\n* CRA2015 for the update and release notes as \"digital content\". But s.33 says it is only covered if a price was paid (1\\), it was supplied free \"with\" other paid items (2\\), or it is not generally available unless some paid item was purchased (2\\). The update was free, it was supplied separately and independently from any paid product, and it is available freely to all, so this doesn't seem applicable.\n* CRA 2015 for the update and release notes as a \"service\". But s.48 seems to require a contract, and no explicit contract was required to be clicked for download or installation. Would a court impute a contract, sufficient to meet this requirement, regardless? If not, this doesn't seem applicable either.\n\nNegligence seems clear (duty of care, reliance, defective software usage instructions known for years to cause serious damage, defective instructions continue to be provided with no warning, predictable damage resulted), so I'm happy about my own actual case, but I'm really surprised not to find any UK consumer protection for harm\\-causing product updates if they are made freely available after and separate from purchase, by a manufacturer, as this is such a common situation.\n\nAre there any UK consumer laws or product safety/quality laws that might be applicable to free but defective software update?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It might be a lot late now yet I suggest that relying solely on your interpretation, the manufacturer appears to have negligently offered goods or services without warning you of known potential consequences.\n\nThat you had no contract with the manufacturer should not matter any more than if I rocked up on your doorstep and offered to clean your car, with or without mentioning that I proposed to use Agent Yellow, which then wrecked your paintwork.\n\nIf you really had no contract then how could the manufacturer make any conditions about what you did with the update you downloaded, including any conditions restricting liability?\n\nBeyond that I cannot go and you should consult a lawyer.\n\nIt seems fairly clear what happened in your case should be actionable but let's remember, whether it's *worth* taking action over is a very different Question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software company releases a free firmware update for a networking product they sold years ago.

I rent an apartment with far too few spots for the amount of people in my building. This is remedied by there being excess spots in front of other apartment buildings within the same property (same company, same apartments, different buildings). However, people are just too lazy to walk the extra 100 feet so rather than parking in one of the open spots elsewhere, they park in the fire lane in front of the building. The lanes are very narrow to drive in as it is so I\u2019ve been trapped and unable to leave for work some days because those cars block me off. I call the management office, they don\u2019t open until 8 but I have to leave for work at 6 to get there. So nothing gets done in time. By the time management returns my call at 9, the vehicles are gone. I take pictures and send emails. By the time management sees the email, the cars gone and they say they\u2019ll \u201cgive them a warning\u201d but nothing changes.\n\nCan I have cars towed that are illegally parked in the fire lane overnight in front of my apartment? I\u2019m tired of relying on management who does nothing and having to miss or be incredibly late to work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Had a similar situation in a home I lived in. We lived on the street closest to a High School's footbal stadium and the inadequate parking would cause fans to park in a manner that took a street that could handle bi\\-direction traffic to an unsigned one\\-way road. The school did make frequent announcements that fans parked there could be towed (it helped that I was one of many alums that lived there). The police informed me that unless there was some signage, they actually couldn't do anything. So you have the benefit of signage that says people cannot park there.\n\nI would recommend calling the fire marshal. In Washington State (I assume your not in DC) the Fire Marshal is a division of the Washington State Patrol, the state police organization. Giving them a call in the evening when the parking is observably bad, will likely get the ball rolling. I would not expect towing, but I would expect to see tickets under offending vehicles if they come out.\n\nIf they fail too, I would start taking pictures of offending vehicles and present it to the local branch of WSP. I would minimize the inconvenience to your commute and the safety hazard of blocking space allocated for use by Emergency Service Vehicles. Try to get a name of someone who you can personally work with to assist you in the manner and who you can contact to report further issues. If they won't provide, ask if there is a way you can submit complaints to them.\n\nI would, after contacting the WSP, notify your building's staff in person and through e\\-mail, that you have made them aware of the situation and that they have taken no action on previous attempts and that you have gone to the WSP over this matter. This serves two purposes, first you are notifying the building managment of a potential violation of law (the fire code is a law and is there because it's easier to fight deadly fires by removing hazards that make fires deadly in the first place. If a fire truck is blocked from the fire lanes, the fire fighters are going to have to deal with that before they can get to doing their real job.). The other benefit is to create a paper trail, which you can present to the WSP to show the building is compliant in fire code violations despite being made aware of the problem. Your building is likely not doing anything because there's no documentation that they are aware of the problem, so they can claim they didn't know anything about this if it goes to court.\n\nFinally, I would recommend you seek an attorney that specializes in teneat or real estate matters and ask for a consultation. You do not have to employ their services, but most law offices will have a \"client intake\" process where you can explain your case and they can offer you some advice or other avenues. Even if you don't intend to sue your landlord(s), and even if you are reporting a crime to police, having a lawyer when dealing with the police and landlords can only help as they will be able to better advise you so you can do this safely without exposing yourself to civil or criminal liability. You can bet they have lawyers that will be more than willing to screw you for their clients.

[This 2020 ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/a-tennessee-law-requires-doctors-to-lie-to-their-patients-were-suing) summarizes several examples.\n\n> In four states, doctors have to tell their patients that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer, even though that is factually wrong. Eight states insist that physicians include \u201cnegative emotional response\u201d among the lists of risks associated with the procedure, even though mainstream medical associations have uniformly determined that this is false. Four states require doctors to lie to their patients about the risk having an abortion could have on their future fertility.\n\nThese are clearly established as lies by actual medical research, e.g. obtaining an abortion objectively does not increase one's risk of breast cancer.\n\nAs Martin points out in the comments, if doctors are permitted to explain that the information is false they can avoid actually lying. \"I am required by law to tell you that if you get an abortion you are more likely to die by suicide or breast cancer, but that is not actually true.\"\n\nI am unfortunately unfamiliar with the best way to find the actual text of each state's laws, so I am unable to determine if any of the abortion laws in question forbid doctors from revealing that false information is false. Consequently, I will broaden the scope to either being required to lie or being required to provide false information with the option of revealing it as such.\n\nAre there other examples of laws in US states that require one person to lie to or mislead another? If some narrowing of scope is needed, I am mostly wondering about examples which are similar in the sense of a professional being required to lie to someone obtaining some service or good from them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A law requiring you to explicitly lie to someone would be a form of compelled speech, which is a violation of the 1st Amendment's free speech clause. However, a \"lie\" in the legal sense would be a statement of fact that is objectively and demonstrably false. There are lots of disclosure laws that require lots of people in different professions to do and say all kinds of things to and for their clients that might even be widely regarded as stupid, but that does not make them lies.\n\nTaking the ACLU's claims at face value (I'm sure these laws exist but I'm not going to take the time to look them up), requiring doctors to disclose potential negative side effects of a drug or surgical procedure to a patient is clearly within the legislature's authority to do if they've determined that there is sufficient evidence to warrant it. It's ultimately up to the courts to decide, but courts generally give wide latitude to legislatures and administrative agencies in this regard unless the statute is egregiously unreasonable.\n\nEither way, the doctor does not have to assert the disclosures as statements of fact, and they are free to tell their patients that they do not believe them to be true, so there is no compelled speech involved.\n\n---\n\nI'm not trying to express support or opposition to abortion here, so please don't start a dumpster fire in the comments. But the ACLU article you linked is a straight\\-up opinion piece. The ACLU believes that the statements are lies. There are a lot of weasel words just in the paragraph you quoted. Out of curiosity, I did a search on their claims.\n\nThe top search result for \"abortion and breast cancer\" is [this article from the American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), which contains this statement:\n\n> The results of studies looking at the possible link between breast cancer and induced abortion often differ depending on how the study was done. Cohort studies and studies that used records to determine the history of abortions have not found an increased risk. Some case\\-control studies, however, have found an increase in risk.\n\nIn other words, we don't really know for sure. So it's not as \"factually wrong\" as the ACLU says.\n\nA search for \"abortion effects on future fertility\" yields [this study from the U.S. National Institute of Health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2225607/)\n\n> ... Women whose pregnancy is terminated by dilatation and evacuation may have an increased risk of subsequent premature delivery and a low birthweight baby. Very little has been published and no conclusions can be made regarding the effects of instillation procedures and repeat abortions on future reproduction.\n\nSo there's definitely a risk from a *particular kind* of abortion (a D\\&E, which are performed usually for mid\\-late term pregnancies), but no significant risk from an instillation abortion (a vacuum catheter in early pregancy). This study is from 1990, so medication\\-induced abortions were not available then. It was just the first search result that wasn't a news article.\n\nAnd then there's the \"negative emotional response\" risk. I'm not even going to tackle that one it's so weaselly. What does that even mean exactly? \"...Mainstream medical associations have uniformly determined that this is false.\" Which medical associations? And what constitutes \"mainstream?\" I highly doubt there is uniformity of opinion.\n\n---\n\nBottom line is, no, a law cannot require you to lie.

The question is not whether the policy have an *abstract* \"civil\" duty to enforce the law, but whether they have a *specific* \"constitutional\" duty to do so. If they do have such a specific duty, then, as they OP says, they could \"be sued for not doing their job.\"\n\nAs ohwilleke explains thoroughly, the answer to this question is \"no.\" The Supreme Court has consistently held there is no constitutional right to police enforcement of the law. In particular, the SCt has held that police aren't violating the 14th Amendment when they don't \"do their job.\" According to the Court, someone who is hurt when the police don't enforce the law, is *not* deprived of \"life, liberty or property *without due process of law.*\" This in turn means that the people who are hurt can't sue the police under [\u00a71983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983), which allows people to sue state or local officials who violate their constitutional rights.\n\nAs you point out, the [Nevada statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) clearly requires officers to make an arrest in some cases. However, this requirement is *not absolute;* the statute also creates an exception to the requirement:\n\n> a peace officer *shall,* **unless mitigating circumstances exist,** arrest a person when the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has...committed a battery upon his or her spouse..\n\nThe statute goes on to explicitly exempt the officer and her department from liability if she decides not to make an arrest:\n\n> *Nothing in this section* shall be construed to *impose liability* upon a peace officer or his or her employer for a determination made in good faith by the peace officer *not to arrest a person* pursuant to this section.\n\nThus, the statute sends mixed signals to police officers. On the one hand, it requires them to make arrests in some domestic violence cases; on the other hand, it says they are not liable if they ignore this requirement.\n\nTaken together, the Nevada statute and the SCt's decisions mean people who are hurt if police don't make an arrest under 171\\.137 cannot sue the police under either state or federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A domestic violence victim in Nevada is severely injured after police respond to her 911 call but leave without making an arrest, despite clear evidence of battery.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Federal law: The Supreme Court has consistently held that there is no constitutional right to police enforcement of the law. This means the victim cannot sue under federal law (e.g., \u00a71983) for a 14th Amendment violation, eliminating option A.\n\n2. State law: While Nevada has a statute (NRS 171.137) that seems to require arrests in domestic violence cases, it also includes provisions that significantly limit police liability:\n   - It allows for \"mitigating circumstances\" as an exception to the arrest requirement.\n   - It explicitly states that the statute should not be construed to impose liability on officers or their employers for good-faith decisions not to arrest.\n\n3.

The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The Freedom of Panorama exception in the Copyright Act (section 32.2(1)(b)) does not apply to paintings, only to architectural works, sculptures, or works of artistic craftsmanship in public places.\n\n2. Taking the photo itself may not be illegal for private purposes, but posting it on social media could be considered public dissemination and potentially infringing.\n\n3. Section 29.21 of the Copyright Act allows for non-commercial user-generated content that incorporates existing works, provided certain conditions are met. By applying significant artistic filters and transformations, the photographer is more likely creating a new work that incorporates the existing painting, rather than simply reproducing it.\n\n4. This transformation helps fulfill the condition of not having a \"substantial adverse impact on the artist's ability to gain benefits from their works\" as it's less likely to be a substitute for viewing the original painting.\n\n5. The presence of the visitor in the foreground adds an additional layer of originality to the photograph, further distancing it from a mere reproduction of the painting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because posting the unmodified image could be considered reproduction without transformation.

I was asked if we had a way to track how many users have declined analytics in case we needed that information for an audit.\n\nWe are, of course, storing a strictly necessary cookie to remember a decline decision on the user's browser (client side only). However, wouldn't collecting server side analytics about a user declining analytics (even if anonymous) be an inherit violation of GDPR.\n\nThe more I think about this the more I'm getting a headache. Would a GDPR audit ever ask for this information or would we shoot ourselves in the foot by collecting this information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you could *count* decline\\-events, but not *track* users who declined tracking. But I also think such information isn't useful for demonstrating compliance. Therefore, you should avoid storing extra data about people who do not give consent.\n\nWhen consent is required for analytics.\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR provides a general framework for processing personal data. The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) overrides this general framework when it comes to cookies and similar technologies related to accessing information on the end user's device. Per ePD, such access is only allowed when it is strictly necessary to provide the service explicitly requested by a user, otherwise consent is required. Thus, analytics cookies require consent and setting an analytics\\-declined cookie is strictly necessary.\n\nBut this consent requirement relates specifically to storage cookies, not to collecting analytics data. Thus, you might have a legitimate interest in collecting data with cookie\\-less analytics, which could involve counting cookie\\-consent decline events. Unfortunately, most analytics systems collect very broad categories of data and cannot be limited to a necessary subset. Even such limited analytics (unless they are truly strictly necessary for operating the site) should support an opt\\-out. I don't think you could legitimately gather analytics about such opt\\-out events.\n\nGDPR audits.\n------------\n\nYour motivation for collecting statistics about consent\\-decline events is to be prepared for a GDPR audit. This is probably not necessary, but it depends.\n\nIt might be useful to distinguish between internal/voluntary audits and data protection audits by the supervisory authority.\n\n* You might voluntarily review your compliance to convince stakeholders that you're compliant, and such voluntary audits might be part of the *appropriate technical and organizational measures* a data controller has implemented in accordance with Art 24, Art 25, and Art 32 GDPR.\n\nYou should collect any statistics you need for this purpose, e.g. to ensure that the opt\\-in rate looks realistic. But since you can set the parameters of this audit, it makes no sense to collect data \u201cjust in case\u201d.\n* Under Art 58(1\\), your supervisory authority can audit your data processing and can compel you to provide any information it requires. This is similar to how a tax authority can compel you to produce business records for auditing purposes.\n\nThis is closely related with your general obligation to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR (Art 5(2\\)). More specifically, the controller is required per Art 7(1\\) to be able to demonstrate that the data subjects have given valid consent, but does not prescribe how to demonstrate this.\n\nHow to demonstrate that valid consent was given.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor demonstrating that consent was given, there are no clear best practices. However, this topic is briefly discussed in [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). They recommend that you retain records about the following:\n\n* that a data subject in a given case has consented\n* how consent was obtained\n* when consent was obtained\n* information provided to data subject at the time\n* that the controller's workflow meets all relevant criteria for valid consent\n\nSome of these are process\\-level concerns about how you ask for consent. For example, you might record video walkthroughs of your consent management solution to demonstrate how consent can be declined, given, and revoked. You should definitely keep a version history of the text and information that was displayed to users when they were asked for consent. I think you should also be able to explain in your front\\-end code how the result from your consent management solution is used to load relevant features (and that they aren't loaded before consent is given). If a feature or service is made conditional on consent, it might be good to have a short written analysis that consent is still freely given under the requirements of Art 7(4\\).\n\nBut other aspects relate to the individual data subject and the individual consent\\-giving event. Some consent management solutions send a small record about the consent to a backend server where it is stored with a timestamp, so that it can be later traced that and when consent was given. I've also seen consent management tools that show a timeline of events to the user (when consent was requested, and when consent for which purpose was given and revoked). I think such detailed insight into an pseudonymous individual's consent status is a very powerful way to demonstrate compliance.\n\nWhat is not relevant here is information about data subjects who declined consent in the first place. Consent means opt\\-in. The default is that no consent is given. To demonstrate that consent was obtained in a valid manner, information about data subjects who didn't consent isn't necessary or useful.\n\nSo I expect that you would be fine in an audit without collecting such data. In fact, the lack of a clear purpose and necessity for collecting this data could be argued to be without legal basis and violate the GDPR's data minimization principle. And even when recording information about those data subjects who did consent, the EDPB guidelines remind us that this \u201cshould not in itself lead to excessive amounts of additional data processing\u201d.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A company is implementing a new website with analytics and a GDPR-compliant cookie banner.

But from what I read online it seems that a processor is anyone that deals with any personal data, even partial data, as part of a service provided to the controller. So it sounds like *everyone* that deal with personal data as part of their job is a processor, except the end users of the service. But since processors must be bound by a specific contract to deal with the needs of the controller (article 28 says \"processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller), then I'm afraid it will soon become a huge mess with a gazillion contracts to sign.\n\nFor example, John Doe has a website with a contact form. The contact form collects data, and the end user should accept the privacy policy written by John Doe. John Doe is the controller. However, John Doe's website is managed by a web agency! Is this web agency a processor? I guess so. So John doe needs to write a contract and have the web agency sign it. If every website owner does this, the web agency will have to read and sign hundreds of contracts. But the web agency hosts the sites on a web hosting provider, which in turn becomes another processor! And they use Gmail, provided by Google, which in turn is yet another processor that will have to sign millions of contracts. And so on, in an potentially endless cycle, just thinking that if you read your work email from your iPhone you might have to send a contract to Apple too. \n\nIt seems a huge mess to me, but I'm not sure I get it right. It looks like everyone is a processor except the end user, but the confusing thing is that the the law seems to say that it's the controller the one who decides the contractual terms, so it's not just a matter of accepting a privacy policy like we have been doing so far. So far, Google has provided a service to you, and you agreed to their privacy policy. Now it seems it's you, if you are a controller or a processor, that have to come up with a contract and Google has to accept it (if they want to). Like it's the other way around compared to the usual privacy policies. Of course this will probably never happen, and Google will probably come up with predefined contracts that both parties can agree on, but at that point what difference would there be between the contract required by GDPR and the usual privacy policies everyone has been using so far?\n\nI hope the question is clear enough.

Yes, the GDPR says that a contract between the controller and processor must exist, but [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the GDPR does not say anything about *how* the controller shall document these instructions. Basically, in cases like the one you describe where John Doe relies on a web agency for having a contact form on the web, there will be a standardized (by the web agency) service agreement between the John Doe (controller) and the web agency (processor). There is nothing stopping the parties from agreeing that this service agreement that John Doe accepted as part of the onboarding procedure is *also* the DPA as required by the GDPR.\n\nPutting something like the following in the service agreement would do it:\n\n> The parties agree that this Service Agreement between You (controller) and Us (processor) set out Your *complete and final instructions* to Us in relation to the processing of Personal Data and that processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between You and Us.

In the context of GDPR compliance, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's responsibilities and the roles of her service providers?\n\nA) Sarah is only responsible for data collected directly through her website, while her service providers are independent controllers for the data they process.\n\nB) Sarah needs to draft unique, detailed contracts for each service provider, specifying every possible data processing activity they might perform.\n\nC) Sarah is the controller for all customer data, and her service providers are processors who can use standardized agreements incorporating GDPR requirements.\n\nD) Sarah and her service providers are joint controllers, sharing equal responsibility for all data processing activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of controller-processor relationships and contractual obligations under GDPR. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Sarah, as the business owner determining the purposes and means of processing customer data, is the controller.\n2. The third-party services (payment processor, cloud hosting, CRM) are processors, as they handle data on Sarah's behalf.\n3. The documentation states that processors don't need separate, unique contracts for each controller. Instead, standardized service agreements can incorporate GDPR requirements.\n4.

The Supreme Court in Miranda didn't just decide that people had to be told their rights, for all rights in all contexts. Miranda applies just to 5th and 6th Amendment rights, in case a person is being held coercively. If you are free to go, you need not be apprised of your rights: so, if the police are just asking questions when you are not being held, they are not required to give a rights warning. Likewise, they are allowed to request permission to conduct a search. It is true than many people do not understand that a request is distinct from an order. A useful phrase to remember is \"Am I free to go?\". If the answer is no, you are busted and they can search you.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Unlike Miranda rights, which must be read to individuals in custody, there is no equivalent requirement for police to inform individuals of their right to refuse a warrantless search.\n\n2.

Silence does not imply consent, and it's actually recommended to explicitly refuse permission if that's the individual's intent.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because probable cause alone does not allow for a warrantless search of a home.

That would also be consistent with the Wikipedia article about U.S. Passports, which [explicitly states](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_passport&oldid=1113291722#Restrictions) (emphasis mine)\n\n> The lack of a valid passport *(for whatever reason, **including revocation**)* does not render the U.S. citizen either unable to leave the United States, or inadmissible into the United States.\n\nwhich would be a rather useless statement if all holders of a revoked passport were no longer citizens. Nonetheless, news media seem to often conflate these two things and I didn't yet find a clear *direct* statement that they are distinct.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: People often use \"passport\" as a [metonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy) of \"citizenship,\" but that should not lead one to mistake the two. Notably, many US citizens live their entire lives without having a passport.\n\nA fairly brief search didn't turn up an explicit statement from an official government source that passport revocation does not affect US citizenship, but that is quite clearly the case if one reads between the lines of the fairly sizeable statutory and regulatory provisions governing both. Nationality law is codified at [8 USC 1401 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III), with the sections governing loss of nationality beginning at [8 USC 1481](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-III). The regulations concerning nationality generally are found at [8 CFR 301 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/chapter-I/subchapter-C), but there are not many regulations concerning loss of nationality.\n\nPassport law is found in an entirely different title of the US Code, and titles are the highest level of division in the code. It is in [22 USC 411 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-4). There are provisions that restrict eligibility for a passport scattered around in there without any section applying specifically to passport revocation. That is found in the related regulations.\n\nPassport regulations are codified at [22 CFR Part 51](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51), with revocation being the subject of [Subpart E, which is 51\\.60 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51/subpart-E).\n\nThere may be an explicit statement in the regulations that passport revocation does not affect citizenship. I did not look very thoroughly. But a bit of logical reasoning shows why it must be so:\n\n1. The conditions for loss of US nationality are very well defined. They are also fairly tightly circumscribed by several decisions of the US supreme court in the decades following the second world war.\n2. The conditions for revocation of a passport are much less strict; as an example, a passport may be revoked under 22 CFR 51\\.62 and 51\\.60 if the bearer \"is the subject of an outstanding Federal warrant of arrest for a felony, including a warrant issued under the Federal Fugitive Felon Act (18 U.S.C. 1073\\).\"\n3. US nationality is required to hold a US passport, but US nationals do not need to have a US passport.\n4. Therefore, a US passport may be revoked for a reason that cannot lead to loss of US nationality, and, when that happens, US nationality is retained.\n5. The condition mentioned in point 2 is clearly insufficient for depriving someone of US nationality, not least because the subject of an arrest warrant is only suspected of having committed a crime. Depriving a suspect of their liberty is acceptable to the extent necessary to bring that person to trial, but further deprivations beyond that end would violate the constitution's guarantee of due process.\n\n---\n\nA word on \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" in US law is in order, lest the use of the two terms seem inconsistent or arbitrary. US nationality is broader than US citizenship. All US citizens are US nationals, so loss of US nationality implies loss of US citizenship. However, there are some people who are US nationals without being US citizens, so it is more precise to speak of \"loss of nationality\" than \"loss of citizenship,\" and indeed that is the term used in US nationality law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A US citizen, John Doe, is suspected of committing espionage and fleeing the country.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Passport revocation and loss of citizenship are distinct legal processes governed by different sections of US law. Passport matters are covered under Title 22 of the US Code, while nationality laws are in Title 8.\n\n2. The documentation explicitly states that \"The lack of a valid passport (for whatever reason, including revocation) does not render the U.S. citizen either unable to leave the United States, or inadmissible into the United States.\" This directly supports that citizenship rights are maintained even after passport revocation.\n\n3. The conditions for loss of US nationality are well-defined and more restrictive than those for passport revocation. Passport revocation can occur for reasons that do not warrant loss of citizenship, such as being subject to an arrest warrant.\n\n4. US nationals are not required to have a passport, indicating that passport status does not determine citizenship.\n\nOption A is incorrect because passport revocation does not automatically revoke citizenship. Option B is a common misconception but contradicts the statement about admissibility in the documentation.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The statute specifies that prosecution for an offense punishable by imprisonment for 8 years or more shall be commenced within 6 years after commission of the offense.\n2. The offense committed 6.5 years ago carries a potential 8-year sentence, making it eligible for the 6-year statute of limitations.\n3.

The second offense in option B, while committed more recently, does not affect the statute of limitations for the first offense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because none of the individual offenses meet the 8-year threshold, and their sentences cannot be combined to meet this requirement. Option C is incorrect because the offense committed 7 years ago is beyond the 6-year limitation, even though it carries a 5-year sentence. Option D is incorrect because misdemeanors typically have shorter statutes of limitations, and the total potential sentence is irrelevant for determining the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThis question challenges test-takers to understand that the statute of limitations applies to individual offenses based on their potential sentences, not cumulative sentences or multiple offenses, and to apply this understanding to a complex scenario involving multiple offenses committed at different times."}, "72": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/62335/is-forced-cunnilingus-or-analingus-rape", "docs_id": 62335, "title": "Is forced cunnilingus or analingus rape?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is forced cunnlingus or analingus, \"legally\" considered rape or is it sexual assault?\n\nAny case would involve the\n\n1.

Many States view rape and sexual assault to be of \"equal severity\", but they are punishable under different laws.\n\nFor example, Kentucky defines rape as any non\\-consensual intercourse and includes anal sex and object penetration in the definition of intercourse. Alaska does not define rape in its criminal code but all forms of unwanted sexual penetration (by object or other) under sexual assault charges. New York defines rape as sexual intercourse without consent and all other unwanted contact under sexual assault.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JGSyR.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JGSyR.jpg)\nSource: [takepart.com](http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/06/29/state-rape-laws)\n\nAs you can see, the definition of rape and sexual assault is either combined or broken out into separate laws.

Court cases take us [a bit further in understanding criminal negligence](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CriminalNegligence.aspx). The wisdom of the courts is distilled to ts essence in jury instructions, which say\n\n> The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's\n>  conduct showed a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonable\n>  person in the circumstances; and that a reasonable person in the same\n>  circumstances would have foreseen that this conduct posed a risk of\n>  bodily harm.\n\n[R. v.

I cannot imagine a scenario where shoving a person realistically could lead to them falling into traffic and getting killed but there the shoving was ordinary horseplay.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Under Canadian law, causing the death of a human being is homicide. If the homicide is \"culpable,\" it becomes a criminal offense.\n\n2. For this to be culpable homicide, Alex's actions would need to constitute \"criminal negligence,\" which is defined as showing \"wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\"\n\n3. The key consideration is whether Alex's conduct showed a marked departure from that of a reasonable person in the circumstances, and whether a reasonable person would have foreseen that this conduct posed a risk of bodily harm.\n\n4. Pushing someone near busy traffic could potentially be seen as showing disregard for safety, but this depends on the specific circumstances and how the court interprets the action.\n\n5. It's not murder (option A) because there's no intent to cause death, which is required for murder under \u00a7229.\n\n6. It's not automatically manslaughter (option B) as this depends on the court's interpretation of the level of negligence involved.\n\n7.

I know with 100% certainty that it is coming from an employee friend at the bank, because my mom told me about it directly. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, if a business, like a bank, is legally required to keep information confidential, and an employee breeches confidentiality, then your recourse is to sue the business for damages. See for example [ch. 35 of Title 12](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/chapter-35). The bank cannot claim \"It's not our fault, an employee did it\" (the Latin for this is \"[respondeat superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respondeat_superior)\", whereby a part is also responsible for the acts of their agents). As far as I know, there is no law against asking for information that can't be given. This does assume, however, that your mother does not have a legal right to the information (which could arise from some form of co\\-signing). Also, would assume that they have a normal privacy policy, and not one where they say \"We will tell your mother if she asks\" (they would have [informed you of that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6801), so read the privacy policy).

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"if a business, like a bank, is legally required to keep information confidential, and an employee breeches confidentiality, then your recourse is to sue the business for damages.\"\n\n2. The principle of \"respondeat superior\" is mentioned, which means the bank is responsible for the actions of its employees. This rules out option B, which targets the individual employee.\n\n3. There's no indication that the mother's actions are criminal, making option A inappropriate.\n\n4. While closing the account (option C) might stop future breaches, it doesn't address the violations that have already occurred and is described as a \"major inconvenience\" for the customer.\n\n5. The documentation references specific laws (Chapter 35 of Title 12) related to financial privacy, supporting the idea of a civil lawsuit against the bank.\n\n6.

This approach is supported by the documentation and offers several advantages:\n\n1. It's a legally recognized process: The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides this mechanism for consumers to dispute potentially inaccurate information.\n\n2. It initiates an investigation: When Sarah issues a dispute, the CRA is required to ask the supplier to confirm the validity of the debt.\n\n3.

It preserves legal options: If the dispute doesn't resolve the issue, Sarah still has the option to bring legal action against the supplier for false reporting.\n\nOption A (filing a lawsuit) is premature and could be costly and time-consuming.

One might have the opinion that judicial review is just the unelected branch of government overriding decisions of the executive (or their officials). If so, that's rather undemocratic. If you believe that judges are merely applying their preconceived opinions in coming to a ruling, then there is no point studying it in detail (hence lazy).\n\nFalsifiability is a useful property in a theory. If I believe that there is no point studying the rulings because judges are just pulling answers out of the air, then there isn't any evidence you can provide to convince me otherwise. I might be correct in my belief but it isn't one based on evidence.\n\nWhat the author is arguing is that, if you're a student of the law, you need to study rulings in detail and look at the statutes, authorities and precedents quoted.

The correct answer is C, based on several key points:\n\n1. Federal law (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3596 (b)) explicitly prohibits carrying out a death sentence on a pregnant woman.\n2.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which most countries adhere to, also prohibits executing pregnant women.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't distinguish based on fetal viability; the prohibition applies throughout pregnancy. Option B goes beyond what the law requires; there's no provision for delaying execution until after weaning. Option D is incorrect because pregnancy doesn't automatically commute the sentence to life imprisonment; it only delays the execution.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of federal, state, and international legal principles.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the top answer's guidance to \"Check the website's terms of service.\" The legality of the script depends on whether it violates or enables users to violate the website's terms. This reflects the nuanced nature of web scraping and content reformatting laws.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the legal landscape, ignoring potential restrictions in terms of service. Option B is too absolute, as not all websites prohibit such scripts.

For a federal case, that prosecutor would be a [United States Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney) or [Assistant United States Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney) (AUSA). For a state case, they'd be a [District Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney), Deputy District Attorney, or Assistant District Attorney.\n\n### In civil cases\n\nGenerally, the Federal government would be represented in civil cases by lawyers with no special title. In many cases, these would be lawyers working for the [Civil Division of the Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/civil/about), but other agencies also have lawyers to represent them in more specialized litigation\u2014for example, the [IRS Chief Counsel's Office](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/chief-counsel).\n\nA state government would be represented in civil cases by lawyers from the [state Attorney General](https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general)'s office ([here](https://oag.ca.gov/office) is California's, for instance).\n\n### Before the Supreme Court\n\nWhen the Federal government is before the Supreme Court, they are represented by lawyers from the [Office of the Solicitor General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States). That could be the Solicitor General themself, a Deputy Solicitor General, or an Assistant to the Solicitor General. In cases where the government is *not* a party, the office may be asked for its input on a case by the Supreme Court via a [Call for the Views of the Solicitor General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States#Call_for_the_Views_of_the_Solicitor_General).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about government lawyers, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A complex federal case involving allegations of corporate tax fraud, environmental violations, and securities law breaches is being brought against a multinational corporation.

The correct answer, C, reflects the complex nature of the case and the government's multifaceted approach to legal representation:\n\n1. The criminal aspects (tax fraud) would likely be prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys, as mentioned in the documentation for federal criminal cases.\n\n2. The civil aspects (environmental violations, securities law breaches) would involve lawyers from the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, as stated in the documentation for federal civil cases.\n\n3.

This section does not apply to an adult who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age for use only in target practice under the adult's supervision or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the adult's supervision.  \n> \n> (b) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon in the line of duty. This section does not apply to an adult who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age in the line of duty.  \n> \n> (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941\\.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593\\. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941\\.28\\.\n\n2 things to note:\n\n* (1\\) takes care to include, in the list of dangerous weapons: nunchaku, shuriken and manrikigusari. While the first 2 are more or less familiar to everyone knows anything about Japanese martial arts, the last one had to be looked up by everyone following the case to discover that it's the \"secret weapon of the Ninja\"(even more than the shuriken).\n* (3\\.c) says that the whole of this entire section applies\\[adding the brackets to make following the formal logic easier] **only** if (the person under 18 is in violation of 941\\.28\\[barrel length under 16 inches]) **or** (is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304\\[Restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age] **and** 29\\.593\\[Requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval]).\n\nIn programming terms(for those so inclined), 3\\.C could be written as:\n\n```\nIF ((barrelLengthInches < 16) OR (huntingUnder16Applies AND huntingCertificateApplies))\nTHEN statute948.60Applies\nELSE statute948.60DoesNotApply\n\n```\n\nSince the barrel length is over 16'' and Rittenhouse is over 16 and no hunting permit was required for his activities, the whole section of the law did not apply. Assistant District Attorney James Kraus [argued](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/explainer-judge-drop-rittenhouse-gun-charge-81285031) that the exception renders the state\u2019s prohibition on minors possessing dangerous weapons meaningless. In essence, that the legislators drafting that law spent too much time watching cheesy early 90's action movies and thinking of how to save Wisconsinites from the Ninja threat, to draft the law properly, so it should be read according to its intent from the title of the section.\n\nHowever, there is a binding Common Law precedent, dating back from the 16th century called the \"Rule of Lenity\", also called \"Strict Constructionism\" in the US, whereby if the legislature screws up, it's the legislature's problem. In the original case, the law in England forbade \"felonious stealing of **Horses**, Geldings or Mares\". A thief was caught, but argued that since he only stole **one** horse and the law specified horses, the law didn't apply to him. He was let off and the law hastily rectified. Pre\\-revolutionary Common Law precedent is binding in the US and it was re\\-affirmed multiple times, e.g. United States v. Wiltberger, where a US sailor got off with killing another US sailor in a Chinese estuary, because the law only applied on the \"high seas\". So, the charge was tossed and the defense didn't press the issue further.\n\n**However**, the really interesting bit is that even though it didn't get to be argued since Rittenhouse was 17, the way the law is actually written, this section **only** applies if (huntingUnder16Applies **AND** huntingCertificateApplies). That means that there is literally **nothing** in Wisconsin barring a **12** year old(under 12 is separately forbidden in the 29\\.304/huntingUnder16Applies section) from possessing and using an AR\\-15(or AK\\-47\\), as long as the barrel is \\>16'' and a hunting license isn't required for the activity.\n\nI think that the legislature will amend the law with haste, before it can be tested on 12 year olds.\n\nP.S. the other guy who gave him the gun will get off with this precedent too, since the statute for his charge is:\n\n> This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941\\.28\\.\n\ni.e. the same 3 sub\\-sections as for Rittenhouse.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the Rittenhouse case and Wisconsin law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A 15-year-old in Wisconsin is found carrying an AR-15 rifle with an 18-inch barrel during a protest. No hunting activities are involved. Based on the interpretation of Wisconsin statute 948.60, what is the most accurate legal assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The teenager is in clear violation of the law and should be charged with a Class A misdemeanor.\nB) The statute does not apply due to the rifle's barrel length, despite the individual's age.\nC) The teenager can only be charged if they lack a hunting safety certificate.\nD) The law applies, but the charge should be reduced due to the Rule of Lenity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of Wisconsin statute 948.60 and its interpretation. The correct answer is B because the statute, as written, has a peculiar loophole. Section 3(c) of the statute states that it only applies to a person under 18 who possesses a rifle or shotgun if they are in violation of s. 941.28 (barrel length under 16 inches) or not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 (hunting-related restrictions for those under 16).\n\nIn this scenario, the 15-year-old's rifle has an 18-inch barrel (over the 16-inch limit), and no hunting activities are involved, so ss. 29.304 and 29.593 don't apply. Therefore, paradoxically, the statute does not apply to this situation, despite the individual's young age.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, counter-intuitively, the statute doesn't apply due to the specific conditions outlined in 3(c). \n\nOption C is incorrect because the hunting safety certificate is only relevant when hunting activities are involved, which they are not in this scenario.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the Rule of Lenity (strict constructionism) supports interpreting the law as written, it's not about reducing charges but about interpreting ambiguous criminal laws in favor of the defendant.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the complex interplay between different sections of the law, the unintended consequences of legislative drafting, and the application of legal principles to real-world scenarios."}, "88": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80414/is-the-scarborough-fair-melody-really-in-the-public-domain", "docs_id": 80414, "title": "Is the Scarborough Fair Melody Really in the Public Domain?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to Wikimedia Commons:\n\n[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scarborough\\-Fair\\-Melody.png](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scarborough-Fair-Melody.png)\n\nthe melody to the tune Scarborough Fair (which had been popularized in the 1960s by Simon and Garfunkel) is in the public domain.\n\nIs this claim correct; and if so, can someone today write a new set of lyrics to accompany the basis of the said melody, and publish it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes**\n\nBoth melody and lyrics source back to the middle ages, as for instance described [here](https://www.liveabout.com/scarborough-fair-traditional-simon-and-garfunkel-1322515).

If the copyright holder stops offering the work under BSD terms, that does not lessen the fact that you *already did* receive the work under BSD terms. The copyright holder may choose to stop distributing new copies to other people under the old license, but the old license grant offered to you in the past will persist, unless either\n\n1. the license expires, or\n2. the licencor explicitly revokes your license grant.\n\nThe BSD license (and any OSI\\-approved license) does not have an expiration date, so we do not need to worry about the first possibility.\n\nA license can be revoked only if either\n\n1. the terms of the license explicitly allow the licencor to do so, or\n2. the license was granted in such a way that the licencor received no economic consideration for the license grant.\n\nThe BSD license is silent on revocability, so we must see whether there is economic consideration involved. According to [*Jacobsen v. Katzer*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17776182574171214893), a public open\\-source license grant may have economic consideration, even absent any exchange of money:\n\n> Traditionally, copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money. The lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration, however. There are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties. For example, program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge. Similarly, a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects. Improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder.\n\n(See also [Are licenses irrevocable by default?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/q/4012/50) on OpenSource.SE.)\n\nThus, there is a strong possibility that there is consideration involved in your case, and the licencor may not be able to revoke the license already granted to you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software company is considering using an open-source project with a BSD license in their commercial product.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1.

The BSD license does not have an expiration date, and it doesn't explicitly allow for revocation.\n\n3.

Suppose a new business wants to use it in a business slogan as \"The stripe of Bitcoin\". Could Stripe successfully sue the new company for using such a slogan?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A slogan such as \"The Stripe of Bitcoin\" might well be taken to indicate that the seller of a product or service is trading on the good reputation associates with the mark \"stripe\". If so, that would probably be a form of trademark infringement, assuming thst \"Stripe\" is protected as a trademark, unless the permission of the holder of the trademark \"Stripe\" was obtained. Payment processing and cryptocurrency handling are sufficiently closely related that customer confusion is possible.\n\nNote that **competitive** use is generally permitted. One can, for example market a soft drink with the tag \"*The cola that's better than Coke*\" without permission from Coca\\-cola (which i doubt anyone would ever get). This is because when a marketer says \"X is better than Y\" no one reasonably thinks X is sponsored or approved by Y, nor will anyone be lead by this tag into thinking that X and Y are the same.\n\nOther forms of ***nominative use*** are also allowed without permission from the trademark holder. For example, a computer component might have been advertised as: \"*compatible with Intel Pentium*\", as this is just using a trademark to name a related product, and does not imply affiliation or sponsorship.\n\nBut a tag such as \"*The Rolls\\-Royce of pencils*\" might be ruled to be infringing, even though Rolls does not, as far as I know, make pencils.\n\nNote that the details of trademark law vary significantly from one country to another.

Any content on YT is protected by copyright. Transcribing a movie would be creating a derivative work, which requires permission from the copyright owner. The same goes for transcribing a half of a movie. The minimal individual components of a text, the words and phrases, are not protected by copyright. A sentence, or two, or ten, get you into the realm of fair use analysis. There are 4 core factors and a \"tie\\-breaker\" about transformativeness, where e.g. if you only take a tiny bit that's consistent with fair use, if it's taken for an educational / research purpose that's pro fair use, if it's for a non\\-profit reason that's a vote for fair use, and a transcription is highly transformative. Of course, it's impossible to tell if your plan is *actually* fair use, because what happens is that you get sued for infringement, then you can use fair use as a defense. So it is legally more involved than the case where you actually did not copy or transcribe anything (they got the wrong guy, or, you are actually the original author).\n\nDictionary sentences are relevant because dictionaries generally copy sentences from existing literature, though often they are out of copyright at this point.

Option D is the best strategy because:\n\n1. It aligns with fair use principles by using a limited amount of content (\"selectively transcribe a limited number of sentences\"), which addresses the \"amount and substantiality\" factor of fair use.\n\n2. It transforms the use of the content for educational purposes, which is a key consideration in fair use analysis and aligns with the \"purpose and character of use\" factor.\n\n3.

It was not the currency of an EU member state, and even if it was it would've been permitted for personal use...\n\nbut I feel uncomfortable having inadvertently brushed so close to the boundary between what's permitted and what's outlawed.\n\nWith the flurry of new regulations introduced since the Russian invasion, I suspect that there might be a lot more that I'm not aware of. The concerns of (new) laws that affect us personally without us knowing about them it's a generic one, and I know that \"Ignorance of the Law is No Excuse\".\n\nUsually the concern is about [new emergency regulations which affect large swaths of the population](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/54905/is-ignorance-of-the-law-a-valid-excuse-for-not-following-emergency-laws-with-no), but here I think that the issue is for laws (or interpretation thereof) that affects some [obscure circumstances](https://www.layroots.com/lobster-law-101/). Due to the relatively small population of Russian citizens in the European Union (EU), and due to the extremely small amount of travellers visiting Russia from the EU, I understand that regulations that affects only those in these circumstances are not be advertised as much as for other laws, but this does not answer the question... how to mitigate risks in accidentally breaching recently introduced new regulations? How to be aware of all of them?\n\nI'm interested in answers relevant for any place in the world, but especially EU/EEA and neighboring countries (UK, Switzerland, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that, as a practical matter, you can't be aware of every change in the law that could conceivably affect you. Even lawyers don't have enough time to keep up with every change in the law until after a specific legal issue presents itself. Firms selling legal research products have scores and hundreds of employees working full time every day to keep track of every change in the law, to the exclusion of all other working time in their lives.\n\nYou can read the mainstream media and trade publications in fields in which you are engaged which often address these questions. You can take continuing education courses in your occupation or profession. You can confer with a lawyer before taking action in areas where you aren't familiar with the law. You can proceed with caution when you do something that everyone else you know of who is similarly situated is not doing. You can pay special attention to the news and government provided information during periods of major emergencies.\n\nBut, the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse is sometimes simply harsh and unfair. Nonetheless, this rule is the law with respect to most kinds of laws in most legal systems.\n\nAs a practical matter, law enforcement authorities and courts will often show leniency towards someone who innocently violates a new law of which they were unaware, at least the first time, sometimes letting them off with a warning or a minimal penalty.

In other words, it governs using personal property as collateral for loans.\n\nUnder the UCC, there are two important steps: attachment and perfection. A security interest is effective against the party granting it when it \"attaches\" usually immediately upon the signing of the security agreement. But, a security interest is not effective in bankruptcy or against third parties until it is \"perfected\".\n\nHow is a security interest perfected?\n\nYou have to look at Sections 301\\-324 of Article 9 of the current version of the Uniform Commercial Code, or, in states that haven't adopted the most recent version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 301 et seq. of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe way a security interest is perfected varies by the type of property involved. \n\nSecurity interests in some property can only be perfected by possession (i.e. a pawn transaction) or control. \n\nPerfection of some kinds of property (e.g. automobiles, airplanes, copyrights) are governed by specific laws outside the UCC: security interests in automobiles must be shown on the certificate of title, security interests in airplanes and copyrights are perfected in special national registries.\n\nWhen there is no special rule that applies, security interests are perfected by filing with a state level official, usually the state government's Secretary of State for the state where the debtor resides or is organized if the debtor is an entity.\n\nHistorically, under the 1998 version of the UCC adopted in all U.S. states, in addition to the state filing, it was also necessary to make a filing in the real estate records of the county where the property was located for certain kinds of personal property with a connection to real estate, the most common of which were \"fixtures\" which are items of tangible personal property that are attached to real estate, and for security interests in growing crops which are by their very nature attached to the land upon which they grow. Counties have never shared their filings with the state, so a state level search is not sufficient to determine if fixtures or agricultural property are lien free in states where there a valid filings made under the 1998 version of the law that are still in force.\n\nThe requirements to perfect an agricultural lien or a lien in fixtures in the modern version of Article 9 of the UCC (finalized for adoption by states in 2010\\) are found at Section 310 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which dispenses with the county level filing requirement of the 1998 Act. \n\nThe [2010 version of Article 9 has currently been adopted by every U.S. state](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=UCC%20Article%209%20Amendments%20(2010)). There was a strong push for all states to adopt the 2010 amendments with a uniform effective date of July 1, 2013, so as to allow states to adopt the amendments uniformly and have them become operative simultaneously (thereby avoiding unnecessary conflicts and confusion with respect to interstate transactions). Mostly this was successful, but there may have been isolated exceptions.\n\nFor the most part, the grandfathered filings have now expired.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. Under the current (2010) version of UCC Article 9, which has been adopted by all U.S. states, the general rule is to file with the state's Secretary of State where the debtor (TechGrow) is organized or resides.\n\n2. While the equipment has a connection to agriculture, it's not a growing crop or a traditional fixture. The 2010 UCC amendments eliminated the need for county-level filings for agricultural liens and fixtures, making option A incorrect.\n\n3. Although the equipment involves drones, it's not primarily an aircraft requiring FAA registration. The drones are part of a larger system attached to tractors, so option C is not appropriate.\n\n4. Physical possession (as in option D) is not necessary or practical for this type of equipment, and it wouldn't be the primary method of perfection for a business loan collateral.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of current UCC filing requirements, the changes from previous versions, and the ability to apply these rules to a novel technology situation. It also requires distinguishing between different types of collateral (general equipment vs. fixtures or specialized items like aircraft) and understanding the concept of perfection in secured transactions."}, "98": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44738/do-firefighters-contitute-a-legislative-power", "docs_id": 44738, "title": "Do firefighters contitute a legislative power?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to this article [ref here](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/new-york-fire-commissioners-call-for-new-9-11-investigation/), [ref here](https://www.globalresearch.ca/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-new-911-investigation/5684982), [ref here](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-demand-new-911-investigation) and [ref here:](https://www.ae911truth.org/news/540-new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-for-new-9-11-investigation) \n\n> ...History has just been made, as the first legislative body in the\n>  country officially announces their support for reopening the 9/11\n>  investigation.

They are elected officials who vote on policy, but it's a stretch to refer to them as a \"legislative body.\" Most fire departments in the United States are divisions of other government agencies and do not have their own elected officials. Here's a more detailed explanation of the Franklin Square and Munson Fire District from a [New York state government report](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/audits/firedists/2017/franklinsquare-munson.pdf) (PDF):\n\n> The Franklin Square and Munson Fire District (District) is a district\n>  corporation of the State, distinct and separate from the hamlet of\n>  Franklin Square, Nassau County, in which it is located. The District\n>  covers an area of about three square miles consisting of Franklin\n>  Square, Garden City South and parts of West Hempstead, and serves\n>  about 30,000 residents. It has approximately 110 active volunteer\n>  members. The Board of Fire Commissioners (Board) is composed of five\n>  elected members and is responsible for the District\u2019s overall\n>  financial management and safeguarding its resources. The Board\n>  appoints a Treasurer and a Secretary. The Treasurer acts as the\n>  District\u2019s chief fiscal officer and is responsible for the receipt and\n>  custody of District funds, disbursing and accounting for those funds\n>  and meeting any other reporting requirements. The Secretary is\n>  responsible for keeping a complete and accurate record of the\n>  proceedings of each Board meeting and all Board\\-adopted rules and\n>  regulations. The District\u2019s 2016 general fund budget appropriations\n>  totaled $2,520,280, which were funded primarily by real property\n>  taxes.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A local activist group cites the Franklin Square and Munson Fire District's call for a new 9/11 investigation as precedent for their own campaign. Which of the following best describes the legal and practical implications of this fire district's resolution?\n\nA) It creates a binding legal mandate for federal agencies to reopen the 9/11 investigation\nB) It establishes a new legislative precedent that other fire districts nationwide must follow\nC) It carries symbolic weight but has limited direct authority to compel a new investigation\nD) It grants the fire district jurisdiction to conduct its own official 9/11 investigation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the fire district's authority and the broader context of 9/11 investigations. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Franklin Square and Munson Fire District, while having elected commissioners, is not a major legislative body. It oversees a local volunteer fire department and manages a modest $2.5 million budget.\n\n2. The fire district's resolution carries symbolic significance as the first of its kind, but it does not have the legal authority to mandate a federal investigation. This addresses the misconception in option A.\n\n3. Fire districts are local entities and do not set binding precedents for each other nationally, contrary to what option B suggests.\n\n4. The fire district lacks the jurisdiction and resources to conduct an official 9/11 investigation on its own, making option D incorrect.\n\n5. The question requires integrating knowledge about local government structures, the limits of fire district authority, and the process for initiating federal investigations.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the real-world implications of local government actions and their relationship to broader national issues, going beyond simple recall of facts from the documentation."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73793/what-can-i-do-to-protect-myself-if-someone-gets-injured-on-my-property", "docs_id": 73793, "title": "What can I do to protect myself if someone gets injured on my property?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've got a large walnut tree in my backyard that I would like removed.

Given the situation described, which of the following approaches would best limit the homeowner's liability?\n\nA) Offer the wood for free but require the taker to sign a waiver of liability\nB) Charge a nominal fee for the wood to invoke recreational use protections\nC) Hire a professional tree removal service and sell the wood separately\nD) Allow anyone to take the wood, but post warning signs about the power lines\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application of legal concepts. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Hiring professionals addresses the primary liability concern. Professional tree removal services are trained, insured, and equipped to handle complex removals safely, including those near power lines.\n\n2. The Utah Code cited in the documentation doesn't apply here because this isn't a recreational use scenario. Charging a fee (option B) wouldn't invoke these protections and might actually increase liability.\n\n3. Offering the wood for free (options A and D) doesn't address the core safety issues and could still leave the homeowner liable. Waivers (A) may not be fully enforceable, especially if there's negligence involved.\n\n4. Warning signs (D) are insufficient protection given the known hazards.\n\n5. Selling the wood separately after professional removal (C) allows the homeowner to still benefit from the wood's value without compromising on safety.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of legal concepts (liability, recreational use laws) with practical considerations (safety, value of the wood, presence of power lines). It also presents a real-world scenario that goes beyond simple recall of the provided information."}}
