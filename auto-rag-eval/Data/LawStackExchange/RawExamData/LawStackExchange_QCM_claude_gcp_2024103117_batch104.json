But why are you doing this? You might be money laundering for example, which would be illegal. You might for some reason gain advantages if you fake being employed, and that might be fraud. \n\nFor example, if my will says \"my lazy son (and not my daughter) will inherit my millions, but only if he can hold a job for one year\", then using what you describe in order to cheat the daughter out of her inheritance would be fraud. \n\nOne case where it would be illegal tax evasion: I have a company that makes good profits every year and has to pay tax for it. We sign a deal where you pretend to work for me, I pay you a salary which is just below the limits where you would have to pay income tax, and you pay 90% of that salary back to me. Free money in your pocket. My company profits go down, and my tax on company profits go down; the 90% that you returned I put in my own pocket. And that would be tax evasion and produce LOTS of trouble for both of us if caught. \n\nAdding MSalters' comment: Let's say I want to employ but not pay you the minimum wage. Let's say I want to pay \u00a38 an hour instead of \u00a310 an hour minimum wage (I'm making up the numbers). So I pay you officially \u00a310 an hour and you return \u00a32 per hour to me.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this arrangement?\n\nA) This arrangement is completely legal as long as John reports the full salary on his tax returns.\n\nB) This is likely a form of tax evasion, as it artificially reduces the company's taxable profits.\n\nC) The arrangement is legal if John keeps the full salary and doesn't return any money to the company.\n\nD) This setup is legal as long as the company properly reports John as an employee to relevant authorities.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario closely matches the tax evasion example provided in the documentation. By paying John a salary and having him return most of it, the company is artificially reducing its taxable profits. This arrangement allows the company owner to convert business income into personal income while evading taxes. Even if John reports the full salary on his personal taxes, the scheme is designed to unlawfully reduce the company's tax liability, making it a form of tax evasion. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't address the core issue of tax evasion through manipulated business expenses."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/20029/police-reporting-the-crimes-of-police", "docs_id": 20029, "title": "Police reporting the crimes of police", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A supreme court decision says police do not owe a personal duty to individuals. \n\nHowever, police do have an oath of office and duty to the laws of the state.\n\nIf a police make an unlawful arrest: In Texas it is known as 'unlawful restraint'. Unlawful restraint is a class A misdemeanor unless the victim is recklessly exposed to substantial risk of injury which then makes the crime a third degree felony.

Failure to Report Felony\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statute in question (which is unusual and not part of the law in most U.S. states) is as follows:\n\n> (a)\u2002A person commits an offense if the person:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002observes the commission of a felony under circumstances in which a\n>  reasonable person would believe that an offense had been committed in\n>  which serious bodily injury or death may have resulted; \u2009and\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002fails to immediately report the commission of the offense to a\n>  peace officer or law enforcement agency under circumstances in which:\n> \n> \n> (A)\u2002a reasonable person would believe that the commission of the\n>  offense had not been reported; \u2009and\n> \n> \n> (B)\u2002the person could immediately report the commission of the offense\n>  without placing himself or herself in danger of suffering serious\n>  bodily injury or death.\n> \n> \n> (b)\u2002An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nThere is no indication that violation of this section gives rise to civil liability. Notably, the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of [*Castle Rock v. Gonzalez*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales) came to its conclusion that there was no civil liability of a police department or police officers for failure to enforce a restraining order in the face of language in a state statute whose plain language fairly clearly created a mandatory duty to that effect.\n\nThe offense of unlawful restraint Texas Penal Code \u00a7 20\\.02 is as follows:\n\n> (a)\u2002A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly\n>  restrains another person.\n> \n> \n> (b)\u2002It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section\n>  that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002the person restrained was a child younger than 14 years of age;\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002the actor was a relative of the child; \u2009and\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002the actor's sole intent was to assume lawful control of the child.\n> \n> \n> (c)\u2002An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor, except\n>  that the offense is:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002a state jail felony if the person restrained was a child younger\n>  than 17 years of age; \u2009or\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002a felony of the third degree if:\n> \n> \n> (A)\u2002the actor recklessly exposes the victim to a substantial risk of\n>  serious bodily injury;\n> \n> \n> (B)\u2002the actor restrains an individual the actor knows is a public\n>  servant while the public servant is lawfully discharging an official\n>  duty or in retaliation or on account of an exercise of official power\n>  or performance of an official duty as a public servant; \u2009or\n> \n> \n> (C)\u2002the actor while in custody restrains any other person.\n> \n> \n> **(d)\u2002It is no offense to detain or move another under this section when\n>  it is for the purpose of effecting a lawful arrest or detaining an\n>  individual lawfully arrested.**\n> \n> \n> (e)\u2002It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section\n>  that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\u2002the person restrained was a child who is 14 years of age or older\n>  and younger than 17 years of age;\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002the actor does not restrain the child by force, intimidation, or\n>  deception; \u2009and\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002the actor is not more than three years older than the child.\n\nIn practice, almost any restraint by a police officer would not obviously be outside the immunity for a lawful arrest sufficient to give rise to the duty to report a felony. Also, the person who decides whether to press charges is the prosecuting attorney who has a strong long term strategic interest in maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement and who often subjectively views law enforcement as his client even though this is the correct as a matter of legal doctrine.\n\n> Question 1: Are any police on the scene responsible for reporting the\n>  crime of unlawful restraint which has become a felony in their\n>  presence?\n\nIn general law enforcement may have a duty under department policy as a matter of employment law, but there is no general legal duty for a police officer to report a crime committed in their presence. Law enforcement officers, like prosecutors have wide discretion over whether they will choose to enforce crimes in the U.S.\n\nBut, since Texas has a mandatory reporting law, this comes down more to a matter of interpretation and a restraint by an officer would almost never never give rise to a felony due to the privilege for an arrest. Also, it isn't at all obvious that a law enforcement officer has to report the crime to anyone but him or herself to satisfy the requirements of the law, and there is no duty for a law enforcement officer to act upon a report of a felony.\n\n> Question 2: Would the police in not reporting the crime be implicating\n>  more involvement than mere presence and thereby threaten their\n>  immunity stance?\n\nGenerally not. To have liability personally, the law enforcement officer would have to be a co\\-conspirator. Usually conspiracy liability would require an affirmative action in support of the illegal action and not merely inaction in the form of failing to report a crime.\n\nPolice have qualified immunity from civil liability for any act that is not a clearly established violation of a constitutional right. \n\n> If the police do not owe a duty to protect the person being unlawfully\n>  restrained, it would seem they still owe a duty to uphold the laws of\n>  the state like they would for the crimes of jaywalking, driving\n>  without a seat belt, or rape.\n\nThis is mistaken. Law enforcement officers have no legally enforceable duty to uphold any laws. They may have a moral duty to do so, and they may have a strong employment relationship pressure to do so, but a law enforcement officer faces neither civil nor criminal liability for merely failing to enforce a criminal law when they know a crime has been committed.\n\n> If the police do not owe a duty to the citizen to arrest another\n>  officer for violating the law do they at least owe a duty to the law\n>  to make a criminal complaint regarding the violation they witnessed?\n\nArguably, there is a criminal law duty to report a clear felony, but since the duty is only to report the matter to a law enforcement officer and they are a law enforcement officer, it isn't clear that this statute applies at all. A report of a suspected felony is not a criminal complaint.\n\n> And if so, and if they do not, would they be more accountable than the\n>  populace who are required by law to report felonies?\n\nNo. As noted above, they are arguably less accountable than members of the general public.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Officer Smith observes his partner, Officer Jones, make an arrest that Smith believes to be unlawful.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Officer Smith's legal obligations in this situation?\n\nA) Officer Smith has a clear legal duty to immediately report Officer Jones for committing a felony, or he risks losing his qualified immunity.\n\nB) Officer Smith has no legal obligation to report the incident, as police officers have complete discretion in enforcing laws and reporting crimes.\n\nC) Officer Smith may have a department policy obligation to report the incident, but likely has no enforceable legal duty to report it as a crime.\n\nD) Officer Smith must arrest Officer Jones on the spot for committing a felony in his presence, or he becomes an accomplice to the crime.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While Texas has an unusual law requiring the reporting of felonies, it's not clear that this would apply to a police officer reporting another officer, especially in a situation that could be argued as a lawful arrest. Police officers generally have wide discretion in enforcing laws and reporting crimes. There may be department policies requiring reporting of misconduct, but these are employment matters rather than legal duties. Option A is incorrect because failing to report would not necessarily affect qualified immunity. Option B overstates the discretion officers have, ignoring potential department policies. Option D is incorrect as officers are not required to make arrests in all circumstances, even for witnessed felonies."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6396/what-if-any-position-is-the-highest-office-in-the-line-of-succession-that-some", "docs_id": 6396, "title": "What (if any) position is the highest office in the line of succession that someone ineligible to be president could hold?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \"[Can a young US Vice President follow in the line of succession?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/6389/1122)\" was a question that sparked my interest.\n\nThe answer to that questions is that a VP must actually be legally able to be President, as well. Okay, so VP is out \\- but if there was a [Tom Clancy's Debt of Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_of_Honor)\\-style situation where most of the government officials were killed, is there any position in the U.S. Government that could legally assume presidency, even though under normal circumstances due to age, birth, or other restriction they would normally be ineligible to hold the office? And if so, what is that office?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several possible ways to get there, but the answer is \"there is no such position.\"\n\nActing President vs. President\n==============================\n\nUnder the Constitution:\n\n> In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, **the same** shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then **act** as President, and such officer shall **act** accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.\n\nWhen William Henry Harrison died, there was some question as to what \"the same\" that devolved on Tyler (his VP) meant. Some thought it meant that Tyler was Acting President; others thought the office itself went to Tyler. Tyler was in the latter group, and set a precedent that the VP *became* the President (finishing out the President's term) if the President died; the VP wasn't just acting. The 25th Amendment later clarified that presidential death, removal, or resignation made the VP the President; if the President was unable to exercise the powers and duties of the office, the VP was Acting President.\n\nFurther down the line, the Constitution explicitly says Congress decides \"who shall act as President.\" Congress only talks about succession further down the line in terms of the Acting President and the officer acting as President. So, if that interpretation is correct, the answer is \"the VP is the only officer who can assume the office of President in the event of the President's death.\" Of course, a new precedent could potentially be set if this situation ever arises; if someone will definitely act as President until the end of the term, then it makes a certain amount of sense to say they just assume the office itself. \n\nEligibility for office\n======================\n\nThe Constitution doesn't say \"you can't be *elected* President unless over 35, natural\\-born citizen, and 14 years a resident.\" It says you are not eligible for the office unless you meet those requirements. That would include any way of assuming the office, including succession. You can't become President if you are not eligible to hold the office, period (that's what eligibility for an office *means*); the only requirements you'd get around are those covering eligibility to be elected.\n\nSuccession\n==========\n\nIt's unclear whether the Constitution's eligibility requirements apply to a person acting as President who does not assume the office. However, Congress has decided that they should. [3 USC \u00a719](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19), which sets out who acts as President if both President and VP are unable to, says:\n\n> (e) Subsections (a), (b), and (d) of this section \\[i.e. the ones listing people who can act as President] shall apply only to such officers as are eligible to the office of President under the Constitution.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where both the President and Vice President are unable to serve, which of the following statements is true regarding presidential succession and eligibility?\n\nA) An individual who is 34 years old can assume the role of Acting President if they are next in the line of succession.\n\nB) The Speaker of the House automatically becomes President, regardless of their eligibility under the Constitution.\n\nC) Congress can designate any government official to become President, bypassing constitutional eligibility requirements in an emergency.\n\nD) Only individuals who meet all constitutional eligibility requirements for the presidency can serve as Acting President.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the Constitution states that an individual must be eligible for the office of President to assume it, which includes being at least 35 years old, a natural-born citizen, and a resident for 14 years. Furthermore, 3 USC \u00a719, which governs presidential succession, explicitly states that only officers eligible for the presidency under the Constitution can act as President. This eliminates options A, B, and C, as they all suggest ways to bypass constitutional eligibility requirements. Option D correctly reflects that even in a succession scenario, constitutional eligibility requirements must be met for an individual to serve as Acting President."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30324/peter-strzoks-text-messages", "docs_id": 30324, "title": "Peter Strzok&#39;s Text Messages", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Strzok indicated in testimony that he did not think that his text messages would become public.

This case happened in the UK (England to be specific, should that make a difference).\n\nAbout two weeks ago, a colleague of mine told me that while getting their mortgage application sorted through a mortgage broker, the mortgage broker offered some insurances to protect him and his family for the duration of the mortgage (life insurance and income protection), as he seemingly was working together with some insurance companies to offer that as part of the mortgage application. My colleague was hesitant to sign any deal on the spot, as he wanted to review all of the policies / quotes before signing anything, as insurances were never covered before in any of the appointments. He then felt pressured by the broker who seemingly was using typical sales techniques (\"only I can offer these quotes\", etc.) to which he then just replied that he will not make a decision on that during their meeting and insisted on review the policies / quotes, which makes sense to me.\n\nThey agreed to have a follow\\-up meeting to discuss this, but the mortgage broker never called again. Much to their surprise, they later received a letter from one of the policies who confirmed they have set up the direct debit for their insurance and that payment would be taken once the mortgage payments would start. They had, however, since looked for alternative policies and decided to go with a different policy and so basically had now two life insurances, one of which they didn't need and which was arranged by their mortgage broker without explicit consent (email, telephone, signature, etc.). In\\-fact, they wanted to inform the mortgage broker in the follow\\-up meeting that they had gone with a different insurance company but figured that since the mortgage broker never showed up again they do not need to inform him then (they did not assume the mortgage broker would take out insurance in their name without getting permission beforehand to do so).\n\nThey were able to get out of that by talking to the insurance company but were quite upset with their mortgage broker (understandably). However, here is the part that I do not understand, I have not studied law but I would bet that there must be laws in place (in the UK (England)) that prohibits third parties from taking out insurance on someone else's behalf without their explicit consent.

The method is explicit in that tenants are to be charged \"*\\[t]he provider's bills*\".\n\nLandlord's evasion of tenant's scrutiny causes reasonable suspicion of *breach of contract* and/or *breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing*. That covenant is implied in every contract.\n\nDuring court proceedings, the tenant will be entitled to conduct discovery on the defendant landlord, the non\\-party provider, and other non\\-parties who might be relevant to the claim(s).\n\nSince the clause is valid, relief in the form of striking that clause from the lease seems unlikely to be granted. In case of overcharge, the relief for breach of contract will be primarily in the form of reimbursements plus interest (see sections [3300](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=4.&title=2.&part=1.&chapter=2.&article=1.) *et seq* of CA Civil Code), or the corresponding deductions on subsequent bills.

But storing this consent, requires us to store user identifiable information about the consent: user (IP), date, consent version etc.\n\nSo, to have non\\-personal data cookie, we need to create privacy policy for recording information about user who agreed to that non\\-personal cookie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cookies are information stored on the end users device and require consent\u00b9 per the ePrivacy directive, even if the cookies or similar technologies don't contain personal data. Conditions for consent are defined by the GDPR. This was also confirmed by the \"Planet49\" case.\n\n1\\. consent is required unless the storage of or access to information on the end users device is either strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user, or necessary for technical reasons. E.g. functional cookies like a shopping cart feature in a web shop are fine, as are cookies used solely for security purposes or technical features like TLS session resumption.\n\nIt is however likely that this cookie does qualify as personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The cookie contains an ID that lets you single out/distinguish this user from all other users, even though that ID doesn't link the user to a real\\-world identity. It is also possible to argue that the cookie is entirely anonymous, but the safer approach is to treat it as personal data. Similarly, other features of the website necessarily involve the processing of personal data, such as processing the user's IP address, if only for the purpose of responding to their HTTP requests.\n\nThe GDPR's criteria for valid consent are mainly about ensuring that the consent is a freely given unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. For example, consent can never be the default, it needs to be an opt\\-in. However, Art 7(1\\) GDPR says that the data controller has the burden of proof of showing that valid consent was given. The GDPR itself does not provide further guidance on what this means specifically. I would argue that it can be decomposed into two aspects:\n\n* Showing that *valid* consent was given. The manner in which you ask for consent must enable a free choice, and must respect that \"no consent\" is the default. For example, you could archive screenshots of the cookie management flow to show that there is a free choice. You could archive the frontend software so that it can be demonstrated that the cookie is not set until consent is given.\n* Showing that *this user* gave consent. There is a wide variety of opinions on how to do that.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the existence of a cookie paired with a valid consent flow to set that cookie demonstrates that the cookie can only have been set in a valid manner.\n\nHowever, there are consent management solutions that provide additional insight, such as the user's entire history of giving and revoking consent. For example, the user's browser might generate a pseudonymous ID enabling that user's consent history to be stored on some server. Indeed, that would be personal data, and this would have to be disclosed transparently. It would not be valid to use the consent management information for other purposes, for example by using the consent management ID for analytics purposes.\n\nStoring the user's consent history is definitely appropriate if you have a concept of identity, such as for signed\\-in users. I have doubts whether this is also helpful on websites that don't have user accounts, and I have not heard of a case where the existence of such records made a difference. After all, such records can only be relevant if the user gave consent but later disputes this in a complaint with a DPA or in a lawsuit.\n\nWhich approach to choose will depend on more specific guidance provided by your country's data protection authority, and on the risk balance appropriate for your business. After all, the purpose of such compliance work is not to be 100% safe from lawsuits, but to reduce risks from enforcement/litigation to acceptable levels. What is acceptable is ultimately a business decision. E.g. the only 100% safe way to do web analytics is to have no analytics at all, but that is not acceptable for most businesses.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR and ePrivacy directive regulations, which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of an analytics cookie on a website that doesn't process other personal data?\n\nA) Consent is not required for analytics cookies as they don't contain personal data.\nB) Consent is required, but there's no need to store proof of consent as the presence of the cookie implies consent was given.\nC) Consent is required, and the safest approach is to treat the analytics cookie as personal data, potentially necessitating a privacy policy and consent storage system.\nD) Consent is only required if the website has user accounts or processes other forms of personal data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, even if a website only uses an analytics cookie and doesn't process other personal data, consent is still required under the ePrivacy directive. Furthermore, it's safer to treat the analytics cookie as personal data under GDPR, as it contains an ID that can single out users.

There are also [hit\\-and\\-run charges](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.52.020), which is a class B felony (10 years and $20,000\\). A person can be found guilty of both charges, and the judge can apply the prison sentences consecutively, meaning you add them up, rather than serve the jail time at the same time (in this case, essentially dispensing with the hit\\-and\\-run term). The law is written so that a killing is a crime, and if you kill two people that could be two charges (the question is whether there is a single act or two \u2013 most likely there was a single act in this particular case). There is no state where recklessly killing a person while driving is legal.\n\nFirst degree murder could be considered under [9A.32\\.030](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.32&full=true) if a person \"Under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life, he or she engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to any person, and thereby causes the death of a person\".

And it was mentioned in the top\\-voted answer here how this could be considered as actually a crime \\- not just a civil infringement but an outright crime since it's copying being done for commercial gain.\n\nThe question I'd have, then, is that under this, what happens if we propose the following modification, because it didn't seem to come up and yet also seems worth considering as a separate question in its own right: suppose that the freelance developer has *already signed a contract* to develop, and thus are now legally bound to deliver the product on time. Suppose that also, the contract explicitly states that they are not going to have to pay for any additional software that will be required in the course of construction. Now, the hirer, during the course of development, asks the person to download a necessary component illegally. The developer is aware of this law and points out to them, as mentioned in the answers, that to do so is to commit a crime. The hirer responds with \"I don't want to pay for it, here you go, now download it\" and also that sie will not accept software developed with another tool. You tell them again, point blank, it's a crime. They repeat the demand. Then, in response, with no further warning, not feeling up to doing the job anymore, you, the developer, simply walk away and abscond from the contract of your own volition and agency as a free human being, never delivering anything and just letting it go.\n\nThe question is:\n\n* how serious is what you have done, legally? If the contractor tries to take you to court for a breach and you argue you didn't do nuffin because it said explicitly that you would not incur any fees and the hirer was demanding a criminal act on your part, would you be able to be absolved of any liability? If you are not, what sort of consequences as in damages could you expect?\n* from a moral point of view, since I like to have both, to how rightfully an extent should this or not prejudice your reputation many years in the future by other assessing your trust?

Anyway, I\u2019m not requiring you to buy it, just make sure you deliver on time.\u201d\n\nThe contractor is wedged \\- if they don\u2019t deliver on time they get sued and they have to hope the court agrees that the delay is the principal\u2019s fault.

I know that there is some debate about the constitutionality of a wealth tax, but for the purpose of this question, I would either assume that the wealth tax is constitutional or that the states were enacting this law to test its constitutionality.\n\n[*U.S. News \\& World Report* states](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/states-with-the-most-billionaires) that 40% of billionaires in the United States live in either New York or California, where Silicon Valley and Wall Street bind many of the extremely rich to the businesses that made them so wealthy.\n\nObviously, the biggest problem for a state like California trying to extract revenue from its uber\\-wealthy populace would be that they would simply move their residence and use any other possible legal loophole to avoid having to pay.\n\nAt the same time, many of these billionaires built their wealth out of business empires that are firmly established in those states, like Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook. The process of moving a business of that size and cultural significance would be immeasurably expensive because those firms rely on an elite talent pool that is very locale\\-centric for their recruiting, and they have employees that could choose to leave the company rather than relocate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Validity of State Wealth Taxes\n==================================\n\nYes. States can impose wealth taxes, although this doesn't clarify the validity of a federal wealth tax. States have broader taxing power than the federal government in terms of kinds of taxes that they may constitutionally impose.\n\nA state may impose any tax (1\\) that does not unduly discriminate against a federally protected constitutional civil liberty (like freedom of the press), (2\\) that does not purport to tax the federal government (arguably any other sovereign) without its consent, (3\\) that does not unduly discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4\\) that has some rational basis.\n\nApart from these specific limitations and (5\\) any found in state law or the state's constitution, (6\\) a state's taxing power is plenary as to conduct or activity or property that has a sufficient connection to the state to provide it with jurisdiction. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case repealed some clear rules of the road regarding what states do not have the jurisdiction to tax, effectively increasing state tax jurisdiction considerably, for example, to impose sales taxes on Internet retailers.\n\n> the biggest problem for a state like California trying to extract\n> revenue from its uber\\-wealthy populace would be that they would simply\n> move their residence and use any other possible legal loophole to\n> avoid having to pay.\n\nThis is true. The primary question regarding the validity of a state wealth tax would not be whether a state could impose a wealth tax, but what assets could a state make subject to its state wealth tax. This might be easy to answer in the case of real property, but hard in the case of intangible property or property held via entities. Federal statutes may, however, establish which states have jurisdiction to tax which assets with a state wealth tax as part of the power to regulate interstate commerce, or by ratifying a compact reached between multiple states which have state wealth taxes.\n\nStill the facts that many countries in the European Union impose or have historically imposed wealth taxes that generate significant tax revenue, despite the easy ability to the affluent to relocated to other countries in the E.U. that is closely analogous to that of U.S. states seeking to do the same thing, suggest that this is not an insurmountable task, even if there might be some leakage of untaxed wealth at the margins.\n\nThe Validity of Federal Wealth Taxes\n====================================\n\nIn contrast, Congress may only impose taxes expressly authorized by some provision of the U.S. Constitution as amended. The applicable case law on the issue of the constitutionality of a federal wealth tax is not entirely settled.\n\nThe gift, estate and generation skipping transfer tax system has been held to be constitutional, but since this is a tax imposed on transfers of wealth, it is arguably a tax in lieu of an income tax treated separately for ease of administration (since gifts and inheritances are within the core definition of income in the Internal Revenue Code at Section 63, but then specifically exempted from income taxation in lieu of donative transfer taxes like the gift and estate tax, in a separate statutory Section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code.).\n\nFederal property taxes in areas not in exclusively federal jurisdiction (e.g. Virginia rather than the U.S. Virgin Islands) were briefly in force in the 1700s, but were repealed before they could be subject to a constitutional challenge.\n\nIncome taxes, even at 90% marginal tax rates, have been upheld as valid.\n\nThe analysis and doctrines involved are rather involved for a short answer in this forum, and I am fairly certain that there is published legal scholarship arguing both sides of this question of first impression.\n\nIn a nutshell, a federal tax must either be an income tax; tax imposed on states rather than individuals on a per capita basis; or an excise tax or duty or tariff. The first two types of taxes are comparatively well defined. The third is the subject of thin, mushy and somewhat inconsistent or indeterminate case law.\n\nOne could argue, for example, that a wealth tax is really a form of income tax on imputed income from assets that could generate additional value to the owner even if the value that arises from this ownership is not monetized or realized. This argument would be particularly strong if wealth taxes paid with respect to an asset were allowed as a tax credit against taxes imposed on income generated by that same asset, in a manner similar to the foreign tax credit today.\n\nA wealth tax clearly isn't a per capita tax on a state government. No such tax has ever been imposed for any meaningful amount of time and has never been a more than nominal source of federal revenues if it has ever generated any federal revenues.\n\nThere is also a credible argument that a wealth tax is a constitutionally valid excise tax or duty or tariff, focusing on the excise tax component, which is quite ill defined, because the courts have tended to side with the government on issues of the scope of the federal power to tax except in the clearest and most blatant cases of violations of the federal power to tax.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about wealth taxes in the United States is most accurate?\n\nA) Federal wealth taxes are clearly constitutional and have been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nB) State wealth taxes are unconstitutional due to their potential to discriminate against interstate commerce.\n\nC) States have broader authority to impose wealth taxes than the federal government, but face practical challenges in implementation.\n\nD) Both federal and state governments have equal constitutional authority to impose wealth taxes without restrictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

So warrant needed or not? and if so, what legal action can be taken for trespass, rights violations under color of law etc. if any?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that a warrant is required to enter private property (absent constitutional case law exceptions to the warrant requirement such as exigent circumstances and consent), and that a warrant is available only when there is probable cause that a crime has been committed.\n\nWhether the neglect or abuse of an animal constitutes a crime within the meaning of this 4th Amendment requirement could potentially be seen as a gray area, since historically, in the absence of statutory authority in early common law, an owner of an animal had absolute authority to deal with his or her property (the animal) as the owner of the animal saw fit.\n\nThe purpose of the statute is to clarify that this conduct by an animal owner constitutes a crime for 4th Amendment search and seizure purposes by making a state law determination that it is a crime, which states can do, even though they can't change the constitutional requirement under the 4th Amendment.\n\nAlso, just because a state can authorize law enforcement to get a warrant for any search authorized by the U.S. Constitution, that doesn't mean it has to allow law enforcement to do so in every case where it is constitutional for the state to do so.\n\nThe duty to get a warrant for law enforcement to enter onto private property at all arises not only from other state statutes, but also from the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (as incorporated to apply against state and local governments though the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution).\n\nBut, the constitutional requirement has case law exceptions, so it isn't required in all circumstances. In particular, exigent circumstances, and the consent to entry exceptions, which are allowed by constitutional criminal procedure case law, could apply to the requirement to get a warrant in the first place.\n\nBut, law enforcement needs to have the authority to search at all with a warrant under state law, for an exception to the warrant requirement to be relevant. This statute appears to carry out that purpose by authorizing searches for this particular purpose. For what it is worth, it is not the best drafted possible statute to achieve this objective, and it could have been written to be more clear, but it still gets the job done.\n\nSo, in answer to the top\\-line question, no, I wouldn't read this statute as requiring a warrant in every possible circumstance in order to go onto private property to check on an animal, although a warrant would be required in every case where an exception to the warrant requirement under 4th Amendment case law does not apply.\n\n> Section 578\\. Is an animal related statute rather than people.\n\nThe people involved are the property owners. The property owner's rights in their real property are potentially infringed if there is a warrantless entry.\n\nThe human beings owning the animals are potentially violating a law which the State of Missouri wants law enforcement officers to be able to enforce (the relevant laws are [the state animal cruelty and agricultural laws expressly referenced in the statute](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneChapterRng.aspx?tb1=578.005%20to%20578.023), so, it is irrelevant that \"Barry County Missouri has no animal control laws or leash laws\").\n\nAmong other things these statutes make it a crime if a person \"Has custody or ownership of an animal and fails to provide adequate care\\[.]\" As the question claims that: \"The definition \"Adequate care\" is vague as well.\" But the question also notes that: \"The 578 statute has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary which was overruled but that was serious abuse case.\"\n\nThe state has a right to decide what is and is not illegal. It is not prohibited from banning treatment of animals that is not serious abuse. The state has every right to make it a crime to fail to provide adequate care for an animal, even if that failure to provide adequate car does not constitute severe abuse.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that a lawful search requires only probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and a good faith belief that an exception to the warrant requirement is present.\n\nIf the law enforcement officer has a good faith belief that the animal will die or seriously suffer or be hidden by the owner in the time that the law enforcement officer reasonably thinks that it will take to get a warrant, the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applies.\n\nThe fact that the lawful search later reveals that a crime was no committed does not mean that the search was improper. A mere belief that an animal was abused or neglected and that exigent circumstance were present with a reasonable factual basis (e.g. a tip from a neighbor who seems credible and claims to have personal knowledge of the facts) will usually suffice to establish probable cause.\n\n> So warrant needed or not? and if so, what legal action can be taken\n> for trespass, rights violations under color of law etc. if any?\n\nIf there is a search without a warrant or probable cause was not present, and an exception to the warrant requirement does not apply, and the property owner believes that their 4th Amendment rights were intentionally violated by law enforcement in the warrantless search in violation of clearly established law to the contrary, a civil lawsuit against the law enforcement officer under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 can be brought in state or federal court.\n\nThe employer of the law enforcement officer can be sued as well, under the same statute, if the warrantless search in violation of the clearly established constitutional right was made pursuant to an express policy of the law enforcement officer's employer. But the fact that the law enforcement officer violated someone's rights does not automatically make the law enforcement officer's employer civilly liable for the wrong.\n\nIn most U.S. states, law enforcement officers are protected by state law governmental immunity from common law trespass lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their official duties, but I haven't checked specifically to see if that is the case in Missouri.\n\nA claim of a 4th Amendment violation can also be a ground for suppressing evidence obtained with an unlawful search when defending a prosecution under some ordinance or statute that relies upon that evidence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Missouri, under what circumstances can a law enforcement officer enter private property to check on an animal's welfare without a warrant?\n\nA) Only when they have a signed warrant from a judge\nB) Anytime they receive a complaint about animal neglect\nC) When there are exigent circumstances or they have consent from the property owner\nD) Never, as animal welfare laws don't override property rights\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While Missouri Revised Statute 578.018 allows law enforcement to seek a warrant to enter private property for animal welfare checks, it doesn't always require one. Constitutional case law provides exceptions to the warrant requirement, primarily exigent circumstances and consent.\n\nExigent circumstances could apply if an officer has a good faith belief that an animal is in immediate danger of death or serious suffering, or that evidence of a crime (animal abuse) might be destroyed before a warrant could be obtained. Consent from the property owner would also allow entry without a warrant.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while a warrant is generally required, there are exceptions.\n\nAnswer B is overly broad. A mere complaint doesn't automatically grant the right to enter private property without a warrant or an applicable exception.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because animal welfare laws can provide grounds for entering private property under certain circumstances, especially when there's probable cause to believe a crime (animal abuse or neglect) is being committed.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the interplay between state animal welfare laws, property rights, and Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88224/do-anti-discrimination-provisions-apply-to-online-as-well-as-brick-and-mortar-re", "docs_id": 88224, "title": "Do anti discrimination provisions apply to online as well as brick and mortar retail vendors?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a shop commits unlawful discrimination by selling products to only one race or only one sex, and a court rules that this constitutes direct unlawful discrimination.

And, the accuser's telephone data, together with the accuser's testimony, is admissible evidence which is sufficient to bring charges.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nTo bring charges, all that the prosecutor must show to proceed to trial and to comply with the professional ethics standards that apply to lawyers is to show \"probable cause\" which is a much lower standard than the proof beyond a reasonable doubt that is necessary to obtain a conviction.\n\nThe testimony of the accuser alone is almost always going to be sufficient to charge someone with a crime that would involve a \"conversation\" of some kind, and to convict someone of that crime.\n\nThe evidence from the phone would usually be admissible and would corroborate the accusers testimony, which might increase the likelihood that a jury would find that the evidence taken as a whole constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt, even though the phone alone, without the accuser's testimony, probably wouldn't suffice to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt unless the content of the conversation was sufficient to identify the defendant (e.g. because it mentioned things that only the defendant could have known).\n\nIt is not at all uncommon to use an accuser's phone as evidence in a criminal prosecution where that kind of communication has something to do with the crime that the defendant is charged with (of course, most crimes are far less articulate like physically trespassing, punching somebody, shoplifting, burglary, etc.). The side of the conservation that allegedly involved the defendant would normally not be subject to the hearsay rule, for example, because it would be the alleged statement of a party\\-opponent.\n\nIf the accuser was involved in the conversation, the testimony of the accuser is also sufficient in most cases to authenticate evidence from a phone that sets forth the conversation because the testimony of the accuser corroborates the evidence from the phone.\n\nBasically, all the accuser has to do is testify credibly that the phone was not tampered with and that the data on the phone is not fake to the best of the accuser's knowledge and that the accuser believed that the conservation was related to the crime.\n\nThe evidence should be at least admissible for the purpose of showing that a conversation took place with someone at the times indicated at the IP addresses indicated (assuming that the jury believes that accuser's testimony that it is authentic) even if it doesn't, by itself, prove that the defendant was the other person involved in the conversation. The existence of the conservation and nature of the conservation is one of the things that the prosecution needs to prove in your hypothetical case, and if proves that, even if this evidence doesn't by itself prove the defendant's identity, it is still relevant to proving part of the case, which reduces the amount of the case that has to be established with other kinds of evidence.\n\nThe fact that the conversation alleged by the accuser actually happened and is corroborated by digital evidence makes it more likely that the accuser is telling the truth and that the defendant is guilty, even if this single piece of evidence by itself doesn't prove the entire case.\n\nThe defense can certainly urge the jury consider the fact that the phone evidence isn't very rigorously linked to the defendant as they make the argument that there isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, but the jury, considering the totality of the evidence in which the phone evidence and the testimony of the accuser corroborate each other, find that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard has been met.\n\n**There Will Almost Always Be Some Other Evidence**\n\nAlso, usually, in any prosecution based in part upon a \"conservation\" by telephone or text message, there will be other evidence from context, timing, the defendant's motive, etc. that provides further circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime that may also be considered, even if it doesn't \"feel\" like other evidence in the sense that it is testimony from someone else or additional physical evidence.\n\nIn many cases, even though a defendant has a right to remain silent and not present any witnesses and not have that held against him, a defendant that fails to present some kind of evidence to overcome latent circumstantial evidence that tends to point to his guilt is usually going to be found guilty by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nFor example, the fact that the defendant was in a place where he could have used the IP address in question, rather than having an alibi is probably not, by itself, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but is circumstantial evidence that can remove one source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if he does have an alibi or subpoenas records to show that the IP address in question was available at the location where he was six months earlier, the case against him becomes much weaker.)\n\nThe fact that the defendant lived at the same location six months earlier is relevant and corroborates the testimony, even if one doesn't definitively establish that the ISP address was the same six months earlier. This removes some doubt that the other evidence might have left hanging.\n\nThe fact that the conversation is something that the defendant could have said, while probably not proof beyond a reasonable doubt by itself, is circumstantial evidence that can remove a source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if the conversation is, for example, in Farsi, and the defendant doesn't know how to speak Farsi and doesn't even have access to a Farsi dictionary or translation program, in contrast, proof of a case against him beyond a reasonable doubt may be impossible.)\n\nSimilarly, if the defendant can't offer any plausible narrative in which someone else could plausibly have been using the IP address at the times in question and could have said the things that were said in the conversation, that too, while probably not proof beyond a reasonable doubt by itself, is circumstantial evidence that can remove a source of doubt from the other evidence. (Obviously, if there was someone else who could have done it instead of the defendant, this weakens the prosecution's case.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal case, the prosecutor has evidence from an anonymous app conversation on the accuser's device, along with the accuser's testimony.

The evidence from the accuser's device, along with the accuser's testimony, is admissible in court. The accuser can authenticate the conversation data, and the alleged statements of the accused would not be subject to hearsay rules as they would be considered statements of a party-opponent. This evidence, combined with the accuser's testimony, is sufficient to establish probable cause and bring charges against the accused. However, this evidence alone may not be enough to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction. While it provides circumstantial evidence and corroborates the accuser's testimony, additional evidence or context would likely be needed to secure a conviction. The prosecutor would need to present a compelling case that links the accused to the conversation and the crime, possibly using additional circumstantial evidence or expert testimony about the IP address usage."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44840/how-far-does-the-derivative-work-copyright-go-for-3d-printed-objects", "docs_id": 44840, "title": "How far does the derivative work copyright go for 3D printed objects?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Though similar questions have been asked before, I could not find one that answers this exact premise.\n\nSay, there is a 3D printable file distributed under e.g. the CC BY\\-NC 4\\.0 license.

([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First\\-sale\\_doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine))\n\nThe First Sale Doctrine says, that the copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute a particular copy ends once they make it's first sale. So e.g. a copyright owner cannot stop a buyer of a book of theirs from reselling this particular copy of the book, while still retaining the right to stop the buyer from copying the book.\n\nNow, one could argue that distributing the file and allowing others to make physical copies from that file would be similar to a first sale and thus allow the owner of the physical copy of the object to resell it.\n\nIf that's not the case, what else can the copyright owner restrict the license taker restrict from doing? Would it be possible to restrict the license taker to only print the file e.g. using a specific brand of filament? Can the copyright owner dictate terms of use for 3D printed objects derived from their file?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The First Sale doctrine only applies when a person lawfully acquires ownership of an authorized copy of a protected work, that is, a copy authorized by or on behalf of the copyright owner. But with most (almost all) computer programs and other digital content no one acquires **ownership** of a copy, as people do get ownership of, say a book, which is a physical copy of a work. Instead people get a license to use a copy, along with possession of a copy. So the First Sale doctrine does snot apply.\n\nA CC\\-BY\\-NC 4\\.0 license already gives permission to reproduce and distribute copies of the work, but not on a commercial basis. Unless the ND clause is also included, it also grants permission to create and distribute derivative works (such as the printed object), again not on a commercial basis. \n\nThe First Sale doctrine would not authorize someone who got a printable file under a CC\\-BY\\-NC 4\\.0 license to print and sell the specified output object.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 3D printable file is distributed under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

The CC BY-NC 4.0 license explicitly prohibits commercial use of the work, including any derivatives. The printed object is considered a derivative work of the original 3D file. The First Sale doctrine does not apply in this case because John does not acquire ownership of an authorized copy, but rather receives a license to use the file under specific conditions. Digital content like 3D printable files typically fall under license agreements rather than outright ownership, which limits the applicability of the First Sale doctrine. Therefore, John cannot sell the printed object without violating the terms of the CC BY-NC 4.0 license."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29528/dirty-apartment-3-day-notice-to-cure-breach-or-quit-san-diego-ca", "docs_id": 29528, "title": "Dirty Apartment 3 day notice to cure breach or quit San Diego, CA", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I received a \"Three Day notice to cure breach or quit\" for a dirty apartment.

If a tenant violates these obligations, the landlord may recover any actual damages that result from the violation. The $750 citation is considered actual damage caused by the tenant's improper trash disposal.

Jurisdictions generally have laws designed to resolve / prevent \"conflict of interest\". There is a [big section of Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.52&full=true) that regulates ethics in public service. Therefore, the Chief of the Washington State Patrol cannot award a contract for new vehicles to himself, because \"No state officer or state employee may have an interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in a business or transaction or professional activity, or incur an obligation of any nature, that is in conflict with the proper discharge of the state officer's or state employee's official duties\". The Attorney General could not unload his real estate holdings in area X, knowing that his office was initiating a legal proceeding that would make such land worthless (using confidential knowledge), but once fact is made public, he can act on that knowledge.\n\nYour specific hypotheticals do not involve SEC regulations or public officials. You may sell all of your diamonds if you think the bottom will fall out on the diamond market, indeed people do this all the time (and are often wrong about the future).

Most trials turn on the facts, not precedent\\-setting points of law \\- usually, there is no dispute about the law at all.\n\nEven then, most appeal decisions don't set a precedent either and sink into obscurity until at some point in the far future when a lawyer doing research on a particularly tricky case has an \"ah\\-ha\" moment and says \"Look at what Justice Bozo said in paragraph 365 of this 56 page judgement about a tangentially related issue between different people at a different time in a different place \\- I need to spin this as dicta.\" Meanwhile, the lawyer on the opposite side has a different precedent from a different case that contradicts this one \\- one of them must be wrong.\n\nSo a trial judge faced with this paradox has to resolve it; they don't get to say \"this is too hard\". Basically they have 2 methods of doing so:\n\n1. The decide that one (or both) are obiter and make the decision based on the precedent that remains.\n2. They decide that both are ratio and write a judgement that they know **has** to be appealed because they have to follow both precedents and they can't.

Hence a legal dispute between the US and Saudi Arabia would be decided by principles of international law and if adjudicated would be handled by e.g. the International Criminal Court. A business, on the other hand, would be subject to national law, and possibly national law of more than one nation.\n\nThe case you cite is somewhat exceptional since a case under US law has to be decided by reference to the \"international law definition\" of aiding and abetting liability for human rights violations. This is because of [28 USC 1350](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350):\n\n> The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil\n> action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law\n> of nations or a treaty of the United States.\n\nThe allegation in the lawsuit was that this was a violation of \"the law of nations\". So, if a person or business with a connection to the US violates \"the law of nations\", they might be sued under the Alien Tort Claims Act.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under what circumstances could a corporation be subject to international law according to the information provided?\n\nA) Corporations are always directly subject to international law in the same way nations are.\n\nB) Corporations can never be subject to international law as they are only bound by national laws.\n\nC) Corporations can be indirectly subject to international law through national laws that reference international standards, such as the US Alien Tort Claims Act.\n\nD) Corporations are only subject to international law if they operate in more than one country.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The information provided indicates that corporations are not directly subject to international law in the same way nations are. However, they can be indirectly subject to international law through national laws that reference international standards. The example given is the US Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows US courts to hear cases involving violations of \"the law of nations\" by persons or businesses with a connection to the US. This demonstrates how a corporation could be held accountable for violating international law principles, but through the mechanism of national law. Options A and B are incorrect as they present extreme positions not supported by the information. Option D is incorrect because while operating in multiple countries may increase the likelihood of being subject to various national laws, it doesn't necessarily mean the corporation is subject to international law directly."}}
