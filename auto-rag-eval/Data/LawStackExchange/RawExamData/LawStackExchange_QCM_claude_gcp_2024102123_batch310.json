            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've print disability, and my university in England sorted my requested books into 3 kinds: Core, Recommended, and Not on Reading List. Like [the quote beneath](http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/library/usingthelibrary/disabledusers/alternativeformats.aspx), it'll furnish me Alternative Format (hencefoth AF) for only core books because of \"legal requirements and operational limitations\", but this I don't believe as the process looks as easy and quick as requesting PDFs from publishers like [OUP](https://global.oup.com/academic/rights/permissions/accessibility/?cc=us&lang=en&), which doesn't constrain AF to core books.\n\nHow can I challenge this, for free without lawyers? It discriminates against students with print disability, who should be granted a reasonable quota of AF for any book in the library.\n\n> What does the service do?\n> \n> \n> We provide alternative formats for disabled students who can't access printed materials. We can reformat anything held by the library that is on the **core reading list** for your course. You can find out more about reading lists in this short video: readinglists.uwe.ac.uk \\- an overview for students.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This [gov link](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/what-you-can-do) sort of fleshes out the process. Their starting position is \"complain directly to the person or organisation; use someone else to help you sort it out (called \u2018mediation\u2019 or \u2018alternative dispute resolution\u2019); make a claim in a court or tribunal\". So for example you can complain to the director of the library. This may result in the reply \"we're sorry, we can't\", so you seek mediation (presumably a university ombudsman). If that doesn't work in your favor (and if you still believe you can compel the university to create some alternative medium), then you take it to the courts. [EASS](https://www.gov.uk/equality-advisory-support-service) is happy to help.\n\nThe court will then try to determine if you're suing the right person (it could be the publisher). Under the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/2/crossheading/adjustments-for-disabled-persons) Chapter 2 Section 20, there is a duty to make adjustments: \n\n> Where this Act imposes a duty to make **reasonable** adjustments on a\n>  person, this section, sections 21 and 22 and the applicable Schedule\n>  apply; and for those purposes, a person on whom the duty is imposed is\n>  referred to as A\n\nOne of the central questions would be whether it is reasonable to require a library to create a particular alternative format of a given book. Let's say that you are taking a class on history of science and one of the required texts in Bacon's *Novum Organon*, and you require an audio version of the text. If you cannot comprehend written words but can comprehend spoken words, you are at a substantial disadvantage relative to others, so the university has a duty to eliminate that disadvantage. Then it is simply a matter of determining what actions could eliminate the disadvantage. (In this instance, it is trivial: direct the student to one of the free audio versions, but in some instances, it is an actually hard thing to do).\n\nYou should presume that your university is aware of the law, so you can inquire about their methods for complying with this act. If, by \"challenge (the policy)\" you mean that they have refused to make accommodations, then you probably need to initiate a legal challenge, whereas if you mean \"how do I get what I want\", you start by asking the director of the library how the library will comply with the act, given your specific circumstances.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A student with a print disability at a university in England is denied access to alternative formats for recommended and non-reading list books. The university claims this is due to \"legal requirements and operational limitations.\" What is the most appropriate first step for the student to challenge this policy?\n\nA) Immediately file a lawsuit against the university for discrimination\nB) Contact the Equality Advisory Support Service (EASS) to initiate legal proceedings\nC) Complain directly to the director of the library and request an explanation of how they comply with the Equality Act 2010\nD) Demand that the university create alternative formats for all books in the library\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate first step is to complain directly to the director of the library and request an explanation of how they comply with the Equality Act 2010. This approach follows the recommended process outlined in the government link, which suggests starting by complaining directly to the organization. It also allows the student to inquire about the university's methods for complying with the Equality Act 2010, which requires reasonable adjustments for disabled persons. This step may resolve the issue without needing to escalate to legal action and provides an opportunity for the university to explain or potentially revise their policy. Options A and B are premature as legal action should be a last resort after other attempts to resolve the issue have failed. Option D is unreasonable and doesn't follow the proper channels for addressing the concern."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a Youtube series I watch called LegalEagle where an attorney provides legal input on a variety of things from pop culture. In [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr9ZdBwCjwk), he reviewed an episode of Always Sunny where the gang employs an arbitrator to settle a dispute for them.\n\nNear the [end of the video](https://youtu.be/mr9ZdBwCjwk?t=1127), he makes the assertion that an arbitrator can make any decision that they want, but their decision has to be based in law.\n\nThis was confusing to me because throughout the course of the video he makes a point to indicate that arbitration is not subject to the [same rules of court](https://youtu.be/mr9ZdBwCjwk?t=167) and thus the participants can agree to whatever rules they want for the purposes of the [arbitration as it proceeds based on mutual consent](https://youtu.be/mr9ZdBwCjwk?t=260).\n\nGiven that the rules of arbitration are somewhat arbitrary (see what I did there), what is meant exactly by the arbitrator's decision must be based in law? Does he mean that the arbitrator's decision have to be based in the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred? Or could the decision be based on the rules that the litigants have agreed to for the arbitration?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> he makes the assertion that an arbitrator can make any decision that\n> they want, but their decision has to be based in law.\n\nThe question isn't entirely settled.\n\nWhile an arbitrator may have a moral obligation to make a decision based in law, there is usually no legally enforceable way to enforce that obligation, and even when there is a legal obligation it is so deferential that it is almost impossible to enforce in practice.\n\nFor all practical purposes, in the usual case where a contract establishes that certain kinds of disputes are subject to arbitration and someone subject to the contract takes a case to arbitration, the arbitrator can completely disregard the law and is not subject to judicial review for doing so.\\<1\\>\n\nHistorically, the U.S. Supreme Court noted in dictum that \u201cthe\ninterpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard, are not subject, in federal courts, to judicial review for\nerror in interpretation,\" *Wilko v. Swan*, 346 U.S. 427, 436\\-437 (1953\\). This led all U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal to recognize a manifest disregard of the law ground for invalidating an arbitration award.\n\nBut, some lower courts concluded that the U.S. Supreme Court implicitly eliminated this ground for review of arbitration awards when it decided *Hall Street Assoc., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.*, 128 S. Ct. 1396 (2008\\) (holding that the grounds set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) at 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10(a) (1\\)\\-(4\\) and 11 are the exclusive grounds upon which an arbitral award may be vacated or modified.)\n\nSince then, the U.S. Supreme Court has, at a minimum, strongly disfavored the manifest disregard of the law ground for invalidating an arbitration award, but hasn't stated whether this historically recognized ground for setting aside an arbitration award is available at all or not under the Federal Arbitration Act as a clearly as it might. *See, e.g., Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter*, 569 U.S. 564, 572\\-573 (2013\\) (\u201cThe potential for . . . mistakes \\[by the arbitrator] is the price for agreeing to arbitration.\u201d).\n\nAs a result, there is now a circuit split between U.S. Court of Appeals circuits over the ultimate issue of whether even \"manifest disregard for the law\", which was once widely accepted as a ground for setting aside an arbitration award, is still a basis for invalidating an arbitration award under the Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA). *Compare, e.g., Weiss v. Sallie Mae, Inc.*, 939 F.3d 105 (2d Cir. 2019\\) (reversing a lower federal trial court\u2019s decision to vacate that award on grounds that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law), to *Wachovia Securities, LLC v. Brand*, 671 F.3d 472, 483 (4th Cir. 2012\\) (recognizing that \"manifest disregard\" of the law also exists as either an independent ground for overturning arbitral awards or as a judicial gloss on the grounds for vacatur set forth in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\\). *See also* Liz Kramer and Bri\u2019An Davis, \"Manifest Disregard: The Circuit Split Persists\", American Bar Ass\u2019n. (Jul. 6, 2015\\) (the Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuits have held that manifest disregard did not survive *Hall Street Assoc., LLC*, while the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits continue to allow manifest disregard challenges) (with the 2nd Circuit subsequently changing sides in the circuit split in *Weiss* in 2019 leaving four circuits on each side of the split and five circuits with no binding precedents addressing the issue since 2008\\).\n\nIn circuits where manifest disregard for the law is a ground for setting aside an arbitration award the standard to do so is as follows:\n\n> \\[A] court's belief that an arbitrator misapplied the law will not\n> justify vacation of an arbitral award. Rather, appellant is required\n> to show that the arbitrators were aware of the law, understood it\n> correctly, found it applicable to the case before them, and yet chose\n> to ignore it in propounding their decision.\n\n*Remmey v. PaineWebber, Inc.*, 32 F.3d 143, 149 (4th Cir. 1994\\).\n\nGenerally, conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court have disfavored allowing arbitration awards to be vacated on the ground of manifest disregard for the law, while liberals have favored allowing these challenges, although the issue is not entirely partisan. So, given the current very conservative 6\\-3 majority on the current U.S. Supreme Court, if it resolved the split, it would probably be most likely to resolve it in favor of not allowing arbitration awards to be challenged on the ground of manifest disregard for the law.\n\n> Does he mean that the arbitrator's decision have to be based in the\n> laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred?\n\nNo. Choice of law is a question that has been solely in the arbiters discretion for a long time (certainly since 1953\\), at least if there is any colorable reason for applying the law of a jurisdiction other than where the incident occurred even if it is not supported on the merits by applicable law made by courts or is contrary to enacted statutes that should be controlling.\n\n> Or could the decision be based on the rules that the litigants have\n> agreed to for the arbitration?\n\nThis would be permissible, but failure to do so is only rarely enforceable as discussed above.\n\n\\<1\\> One can imagine a very atypically drafted arbitration agreement that somehow changes this predominant rule, but it almost never happens that way. Likewise, in theory, an arbitration agreement could specifically provide that a decision be made on some basis other than the applicable law (e.g. by a coin toss).",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An arbitration agreement between two parties states that any disputes will be settled by an arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding. During the arbitration process, the arbitrator completely disregards applicable state law and instead bases their decision on their personal sense of fairness. The losing party wants to challenge the arbitrator's decision in federal court. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential for overturning the arbitrator's decision?\n\nA) The arbitrator's decision can easily be overturned because it wasn't based on applicable law.\nB) The decision can be challenged on the grounds of \"manifest disregard of the law\" in all federal circuits.\nC) The ability to challenge the decision depends on which federal circuit has jurisdiction over the case.\nD) The arbitrator's decision is final and cannot be challenged in any federal court under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The ability to challenge an arbitrator's decision based on \"manifest disregard of the law\" varies depending on the federal circuit. There is currently a circuit split on this issue following the Supreme Court's decision in Hall Street Assoc., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc. Some circuits (like the Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh) have held that manifest disregard is no longer a valid ground for challenging an arbitration award, while others (like the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth) still allow such challenges. Therefore, the ability to challenge the decision would depend on which federal circuit has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because arbitrators generally have wide latitude in their decision-making, and courts are typically very deferential to arbitration awards. \n\nOption B is incorrect because not all federal circuits recognize \"manifest disregard of the law\" as a valid ground for challenging arbitration awards.\n\nOption D is too absolute. While arbitration decisions are generally final and binding, there are still some limited grounds for challenge in federal courts, even if \"manifest disregard of the law\" is not universally accepted."

My credit was good, I was making good income, and my loan was approved.\nI need to stress that last point. My loan was **approved**, not just superficially, or that things \"seemed good\", I was approved. I have emails saying that, specifically:\n\n> Congratulations Sean,\n> \n> \n> Your loan request has been approved!\n> \n> \n> **Log in now** to review the terms of your offer and sign your loan agreement.\n\nSo, I was approved, and just needed to sign electronically. Great! Except, in order to sign, I had to verify my identity through a credit bureau questionnaire.\n\nI kept failing this questionnaire, because it was giving multiple choice questions where no answer was possibly correct. For example, it asked how much how much I owed in student loans listing 4 non\\-zero amounts to choose from, and I've never had a student loan so there was no correct answer.\n\nThis wasn't a case of identity theft or anything like that. There are no student loans on my report with any bureau. Another similar question asked me to name a street I used to live on, but again none of the choices were correct. About half the questions were using my information, and I was able to answer them correctly, but it was not enough.\n\nI made numerous calls to the credit bureau and the loan agency to try and resolve this, but no one was able to help me. The loan agency was unable to consider any alternative method for me to sign for my loan, and the credit bureau was even more unhelpful, having no idea why it was happening and no solutions to offer.\n\nIf I had been able to sign for the loan I was approved for, I would not have suffered damages that I did after soon after losing my job and apartment.\n\nDo I have standing to sue the loan agency for failing to provide an alternate method of identity verification after approving me for a loan?

Or both?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do I have standing to sue a credit bureau or lender after being approved for a loan but being prevented from signing due to their error?\n\nUnfortunately, no. The email you got from the loan agency reflects that no contract was formed yet. The email merely is the loan agency's expression of *interest* to proceed toward the formation of that contract.\n\nAbsent that formation of the contract, even if for reasons beyond your control, you are not entitled to the benefits or consideration(s) the contract would provide. Nor would the lender be entitled to your compliance with the terms of that contract, terms which might not even be informed \\-\\-let alone known\\-\\- to you. There is no legal obligation from one party to the other.\n\nLastly, the agency's or bureau's faulty process/questionnaire is not actionable either.

The email from the loan agency indicating approval is not a binding contract, but rather an expression of interest to proceed towards forming a contract. Without a formal contract in place, there are no legal obligations between the parties.\n\nB) While the individual did fail to answer some questions correctly, this alone does not prevent them from having grounds to sue. The issue is more fundamental - there was no binding agreement in place.\n\nC) While it's true that the loan agency is not obligated to provide alternative verification methods, this is not the primary reason why the individual lacks grounds to sue. The core issue is the absence of a binding contract.\n\nD) Although the credit bureau's system may have malfunctioned, this does not necessarily create a legal liability, especially in the absence of a formal agreement between the individual and the loan agency.\n\nThe key point is that without a finalized contract, neither party has legal obligations to the other, regardless of the difficulties in the verification process."

The suspension of law and rights under martial law is not absolute. The Posse Comitatus Act [18 USC 1385](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385) prohibits using the US Army to enforce domestic policies (this does not excluding using the national guard for such purposes) \\-\\- if law and rights were completely suspended, this act would not have any meaning. \n\nIn the case of [Ex parte Milligan 71 U.S. 2 (1866\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html) which is about Lincoln's suspension of *habeas corpus* during the Civil War, the Supreme Court said\n\n> If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed,\n>  and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law,\n>  then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really\n>  prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil\n>  authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and\n>  society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to\n>  govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course. As\n>  necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this\n>  government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross\n>  usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are\n>  open, and in proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.\n>  It is also confined to the locality of actual war.\n\nThe point is that martial law does not equal a complete military dictatorship.\n\nMartial law can be declared by a governor, and we can look to the statutes to determine is there are any limits on such a declaration. In Washington, [RCW 38\\.08\\.030](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=38.08.030) allows imposition of martial law, which in the strongest case \"is the subordination of all civil authority to the military\" (which again is a far cry from \"the suspension of all law and rights\"). It is hard to know what the limits would be, but it is unlikely that a complete suspension of the Due Process clause or the First Amendment would be tolerated.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following best describes the legal concept of martial law and its limitations?\n\nA) Martial law involves the complete suspension of all civil rights and laws, with the military having unlimited authority to govern as they see fit.\n\nB) Martial law can only be declared by the President and results in the permanent closure of all civil courts until the crisis is resolved.\n\nC) Martial law typically involves the suspension of habeas corpus, is limited to areas where courts cannot function, and does not equate to absolute military rule.\n\nD) Martial law automatically overrides the Posse Comitatus Act, allowing unrestricted use of the U.S. Army for domestic law enforcement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the nuanced understanding of martial law as described in the documentation. The suspension of habeas corpus is a key indicator of martial law, as mentioned in the Constitution. The Supreme Court case Ex parte Milligan (1866) established that martial law is limited to areas where courts cannot function and is not meant to be a permanent or absolute military rule. \n\nOption A is incorrect because martial law does not involve a complete suspension of all civil rights and laws. The documentation explicitly states that \"The suspension of law and rights under martial law is not absolute.\"\n\nOption B is incorrect on two counts. First, governors can also declare martial law, not just the President. Second, martial law is not meant to permanently close civil courts; in fact, it should end once courts can function normally again.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits using the U.S. Army for domestic law enforcement, remains in effect even under martial law. The documentation notes that if martial law suspended all laws, this act would have no meaning."

Would he have had to register all these combinations individually?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n==\n\nYou can only apply for a trademark that you actually use in commerce.\n\nThen, the trademark office will decide if your name is ok. Let's say \"Bob's Cars\" is applied to. That is not trademarkable as it is too generic! Anyone with the name Bob who owns a car sales floor can accurately call that Bob's Cars. Dog Cake is just as generic and thus not trademarkable. USPTO has in or around 2007, using this vein, denied registering hotels.com, [a lawsuit in the federal circuit of appeals was a loss in July 2009](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1155088.html): even with .com, it was **generic** and not allowed as a trademark, it was not distinguishing itself. Similarly, [in the appeal of matress.com](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-1800mattresscom) the court did decide that:\n\n> Any term that the relevant public understands to refer to the genus of \u2018online retail store services in the field of mattresses, beds and bedding\u2019 is generic.\n\nAs such, a company named Bob's Cars is generally owned by Bob and selling cars. That is generic and is understood as Bob selling cars by the public. It can't be specific. Cakes for dogs are Dog Cakes. Any cake for a dog is a Dog Cake. It is just as generic as Bob selling cars.\n\nHowever, if a brand has managed *without* protection to become non\\-generic before applying, then it can apply for a trademark with the whole name, as [Booking.com managed to do in 2020](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-46_8n59.pdf) \\- **however** that verdict hinges on the fact that the site booking.com managed to become distinct from being 'just a generic retail store service in the field of' booking travel to be its own thing:\n\n> A term styled \u201cgeneric.com\u201d is a generic name for a class of goods\n> or services only if the term has that meaning to consumers.",

He gets \u00a3300 (\u00a32,500 \\- \u00a32,200\\) keeps the car and Phillipa keeps the balance of the money.\n\n**Misrepresentation restores you to the position you would have been in if the contract had not happened**\n\n**Breach of contract**\n\nIf Alex can prove that the misrepresentation was more than a pre\\-contractural statement that induced him to enter the contract, that is, he can show that the year of the car is actually a term of the contract, then he can sue for breach of contract.

Sally flatly says no at the time, and no pictures are sent or received, with Bobby being 16 and Sally being 17 at the time. Let's say they both lived in New York when this took place.\n\nLet's now say, 4 years later, Sally is flipping through her phone and sees the messages he sent asking her for explicit pictures of herself. If Sally decides she wants to charge Bob, in the state of New York, what can happen to Bob?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, Sally can't **charge** Bob, or anyone else. She can file a complaint with the police, or with the District Attorney. It may or may not be investigated, and if it is, charges may or may not be brought, and she has no control over any of that, although she may be able to use persuasion or political pressure to influence the decision.\n\nIn New York, persuading a child to make pornography is a class C felony. Possessing child pornography is a class E felony. Promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child is a class D felony. Disseminating obscene material to a minor is a class E felony, unless the defendant solicits the child to engage in sexual activity, in which case it's a class D felony. All of these have 5\\-year statutes of limitation. (N.Y. Pen. Law \u00a7 \u00a7 70\\.00, 80\\.00, 235\\.21, 235\\.22, 263\\.05, 263\\.10, 263\\.11, 263\\.16\\.)\n\nI can't find any NY law that makes it a crime to ask for a naked image of a child and be refused, although there may well be one. \n\nNote that it is not a crime in NY to posses sexual or nude pictures of a person 16 or older, although it is a crime to create them. \n\nThere are also federal laws against child pornography, but federal policy is not to bring federal cases where the accused are under 18 and a state case could be brought. In fact, the federal authorities generally do not bring cases except against major producers when a state case can be brought instead. But that is a matter of policy, not law.\n\nNY has a pre\\-trial diversion program for teen\\-ages involved in \"sexting\". They can agree to take special classes, and avoid a criminal conviction or any jail time. The court must approve candidates individually for this program, but it is widely used. \n\nIn the given scenario, the statute of limitations would not have expired (if the law I couldn't find makes this a felony, misdemeanor SoL is 2 years). In theory bob could be charged and tried for his solicitation. If charges were levied, the prosecution would need to prove at trial that Bob had made the request, and that it was serious, not a joke. It would also need to persuade a jury to convict when no sexual image had ever been transmitted. \n\nIn practice I doubt that a case would be pursued after several years. That would depend entirely on the DA, or the relevant assistant DA who handled the case. Nothing would legally prevent such a case that I know of.",

Sally refused and no images were exchanged. Four years later, Sally finds the messages and reports it to authorities. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences for Bobby?\n\nA) Bobby can be immediately charged with a Class C felony for attempting to produce child pornography.\nB) The statute of limitations has expired, so no charges can be brought against Bobby.\nC) Sally can directly press charges against Bobby for solicitation of a minor.\nD) Bobby could potentially face charges, but prosecution is unlikely due to the circumstances and time elapsed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because asking for images without receiving them doesn't constitute production of child pornography. Also, the documentation doesn't specify a law making it explicitly illegal to ask for such images and be refused.\n\nB) is incorrect because the statute of limitations for relevant felonies in New York is 5 years, which hasn't expired in this scenario.\n\nC) is incorrect because private citizens cannot press charges directly. Only the District Attorney can decide to bring charges after a complaint is filed.\n\nD) is correct because while charges could theoretically be brought (as the statute of limitations hasn't expired), several factors make prosecution unlikely: no images were actually exchanged, both parties were minors at the time, significant time has elapsed, and there might be difficulties in proving the seriousness of the request. The documentation suggests that in practice, such a case is unlikely to be pursued after several years, though it's not legally impossible."

This answer accurately reflects both the Supreme Court's interpretation in Cohens v. Virginia and the action taken by Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Supreme Court clarified that its original jurisdiction in cases where a state is a party is not necessarily exclusive. Congress then acted to make the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction exclusive only in suits between two or more states, while leaving it concurrent with lower federal courts in other cases involving states. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate the exclusivity of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.

Her house was untouched, but it destroyed the fence that stood between her backyard and the backyard of a neighbor.  \n\nInsurance has already approved the construction of a replacement fence; however, the neighbor is refusing to sign off on the construction. The neighbor works in construction, and is claiming that he and his friends in the industry will replace the fence themselves. My mom suspects that he is trying to drag his feet until my mom pays the full price for the fence, so that he can pocket the insurance pay out that was designated for the fence.   \n\nHe pulled a similar scheme when my mom moved in the house, so that he did not have to contribute to paying for a fence between the two properties.  \n\nWhat can we do to make him pay his half for the replacement fence? I have considered reporting him for insurance fraud.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a context where you need to lawyer up. There are two issues, his share of the costs, and his permission to construct in part on his property. You mother has the same rights, so she likewise can refuse to sign off on his scheme (the lawyers negotiate a resolution). Assuming both parties are insured and (to make it more complex) have different insurance companies, the companies limit how much they will contribute for their part of the damage. Normally, you find a contractor who will do it for a given price, let's say $10,000, and the parties split the cost. Both parties have an interest in the choice of contractor because of cost issues, and quality of product and service (though the insurance company cares about the cost). If one of the parties is a contractor, they too can legitimately submit a bid, and then the parties can decide which is the best bid.\n\nIt is not fraud if a contractor, who is an insured, submits a bid and makes a profit on the job. It would be fraud if that party withheld material facts from an insurance company. In the context of massive disaster insurance claims, the insurance companies may not perform a rigorous investigation (e.g. may not ask for multiple bids). It would then be a material fact that one of the insureds stood to profit from this arrangement, so the insurance companies would likely wish to see evidence that the costs were not unreasonably inflated. If the neighbors bid is in line with industry standard (and the insurance companies know who the contractor is), there is nothing fishy about the arrangement.\n\nThis assumes that both parties are being cooperative with each other. When that is not the case, lawyers are good at getting cooperation (not letting the other party push their client around).",

According to the documentation, it is not considered fraud if a contractor who is an insured party submits a bid and makes a profit on the job. However, it's crucial that the bid is in line with industry standards and that all material facts, including the fact that one of the insured parties stands to profit from the arrangement, are disclosed to the insurance companies.

Shady.\n\n> **The government has already classified encryption technology as a weapons system. Wouldn't this mean that use of encryption technology by US citizens is protected under the 2nd Amendment?** (This isn't a serious argument, but it does make you wonder)\n\n> I still remember when the Department of Homeland Security got its name. I laughed my ass off. My buddy who was a Russian linguist for the military laughed even harder because it DIRECTLY translates to KGB. The soviets had Committees for everything instead of departments, and they used \"the state\" instead of \"the homeland\" in colloquial conversation.\n\n> Goldir\n\n*(emphasis mine)*\n\nIndeed, it's been well known in the technical communities that crypto has long been classified as **munition** by the US government. *Bernstein v. United States.* <http://export.cr.yp.to/>\n\nDoesn't it indeed make it protected under the 2nd Amendment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not all weapons are protected by the Second Amendment. There is a \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" exclusionary clause established by the Supreme Court in [District of Columbia v. Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller), which excludes pretty much anything that's incredibly dangerous (obviously we wouldn't want our people to have the right to keep bombs in their house) or not considered a normal weapon (encryption/cryptography would probably fall under this).\n\nOne case currently being considered under this exclusion is the [stun gun](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/11/are-stun-guns-protected-by-the-second-amendment/), which is going to the Supreme Court to determine whether it qualifies as an unusual weapon and whether it is protected by the Second Amendment.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Second Amendment in District of Columbia v. Heller, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the protection of encryption technology as a weapon?\n\nA) Encryption technology is definitely protected under the Second Amendment because it is classified as a munition by the US government.\n\nB) Encryption technology is likely not protected under the Second Amendment due to the \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" exclusionary clause.\n\nC) The Second Amendment unequivocally protects all forms of weapons, including encryption technology.\n\nD) The protection of encryption technology under the Second Amendment is explicitly stated in the Bernstein v. United States case.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, the Supreme Court established a \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" exclusionary clause in District of Columbia v. Heller. This clause excludes weapons that are either incredibly dangerous or not considered normal weapons from Second Amendment protections. Encryption technology, while classified as a munition, would likely fall under the category of unusual weapons and thus not be protected under the Second Amendment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because classification as a munition does not guarantee Second Amendment protection. Option C is false because the Second Amendment does not protect all forms of weapons, as evidenced by the exclusionary clause. Option D is incorrect because the Bernstein v. United States case does not explicitly state that encryption is protected under the Second Amendment; it primarily dealt with export regulations on cryptographic materials."

The ditch is steep and I'm concerned he may tip over the mower and get hurt.\n\nI have 2 questions:\n\n1. If this does happen, am I liable, particularly since they didn't ask permission to do this and\n2. What can I do to limit liability if this were to happen?\n\nI'm certain state laws differ. FWIW, I live in KS.\n\n**Edit** : The ditch is next to a road, which was added later. It is part of an road, utility and drainage easement that I can't change, or would be difficult (and likely pricey) to do.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Kansas evaluates these kinds of cases, known as premises liability cases, under the general law of negligence (which is a common law claim governed by case law in Kansas, rather than a statute, except as modified by specific statutes in some respect or other).\n\nWhen you own or control a piece of property, you are responsible for making reasonable efforts to ensure that visitors are safe. If you fail to identify safety risks that you should have reasonably known about, or if you fail to correct potentially hazardous conditions, you could be held liable for any injuries that result. The law is just that vague and is interpreted by judges and juries on a case by case basis.\n\nWhen that happens Kansas uses a [comparative negligence system](http://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch60/060_002_0058a.html) that evaluates the percentage of the fault attributable to everyone who is alleged to have been negligent including the person injured. Damages are allocated based upon those percentages (unless the person injured is more than 50% at fault, in which case the person injured recovers nothing in the lawsuit).\n\nKansas is not among the states that make a formalistic distinction between the duties owed to \"invitees\", \"licensees\" and \"trespassers\" as the common law historically did. If a risk is foreseeable and you could have taken affordable precautions (relative to the value of the activity the not taking the precaution made possible) to address it, and you didn't, you could be held liable. Trespassing is just one of an infinite number of factors that the jury considers in assigning comparative fault.\n\nThe main pro\\-active actions that you can take are to purchase homeowner's insurance with reasonable liability policy limits and ideally umbrella insurance as well (which increases your policy limits at a modest additional cost), and to communicate in writing to the neighbor (in a way that you can prove if anything happens later) warning your neighbor of the risks that you foresee and urging your neighbor to take care to avoid those risks.\n\nThe statute of limitations in these cases in Kansas is [usually two years](http://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch60/060_005_0013.html) although exceptions apply.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Kansas, a homeowner is concerned about potential liability if their neighbor gets injured while mowing a steep ditch on the homeowner's property without permission. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's liability in this situation?\n\nA) The homeowner cannot be held liable because the neighbor is trespassing by mowing without permission.\n\nB) The homeowner is automatically liable for any injuries that occur on their property, regardless of circumstances.\n\nC) The homeowner may be held liable based on the principles of negligence and premises liability, but comparative negligence rules would apply.\n\nD) The homeowner is only liable if they specifically invited the neighbor to mow the ditch.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Kansas, premises liability cases are evaluated under general negligence law. Homeowners have a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to ensure visitors' safety, even for those who may be on the property without explicit permission. The state uses a comparative negligence system, which means that fault can be attributed to multiple parties, including the injured person. The homeowner could be held liable if they failed to address foreseeable risks, but the neighbor's actions would also be considered in determining fault. Trespassing is just one factor considered in assigning comparative fault, not an automatic exemption from liability. Options A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the situation, while B is incorrect because it overstates the homeowner's liability without considering other factors."

As discussed in the book 'Starship Troopers', you can't expect a person to improve their behaviour if they are not shown how. Some simple examples in practice include violent offenders being sent to anger management classes, or bad drivers being sentenced to remedial training.\n\nWhy aren't all offenders put into rehabilitation programs? Some reasons include:\n\n* Cost. It would be very expensive to offer all the rehabilitation which would help all offenders.\n* Often this kind of thing is court\\-ordered, so if the judge does not know about relevant programs or does not assess the offender's needs correctly, then the offender will not be sent to them.\n* The offender is unwilling to participate in programs that are available, and there are limits to how much coercion a given society is comfortable applying.\n\nThere is no 'one size fits all' rehabilitation. Some people need to talk about what makes them use drugs, others need to talk through their childhood issues, others need training so they can get a job and not fall back into bad habits when they are released from prison. Perhaps North Korea has a great curriculum for putting lots of people in a camp and they come out model citizens, but I'm not aware of the details.\n\nCan a person really be forced to do anything? Even the army can't do that. The army might put you in prison, but that's redundant for a person who is already a prisoner. You can always threaten to kill them, I suppose, whip them, or brainwash them with electrodes perhaps, but that depends on your principles as a society. \n\nI think it's fair to say that, these days, the trend is towards what the question suggests, which is putting as many offenders as possible into rehabilitation. In 2014 it was [reported](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30275026) that Texas took the money it would have spent on building a new prison and used it on rehabilitation instead, and there were suggestions that that worked well.",

However, it emphasizes that there is no \"one size fits all\" approach to rehabilitation. Instead, different offenders may need different types of programs based on their specific circumstances and needs. The example of Texas redirecting funds from prison construction to rehabilitation programs supports this trend. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage suggests rehabilitation is becoming more prevalent, not being phased out. \nOption B is wrong because the text explicitly states that rehabilitation is not \"one size fits all\". \nOption D contradicts the described trend towards increased rehabilitation efforts.\nOption C correctly captures the idea of tailored rehabilitation programs becoming more common in modern criminal justice systems."

Twenty years later, the father realizes the inheritances are unequal and wants to change his plan. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of the father's promises?\n\nA) The father's verbal promises constitute a legally binding contract that cannot be altered without the children's consent.\n\nB) The father can change his will freely, but must compensate the younger child for any financial losses incurred based on the original promise.\n\nC) The father's promises are presumed to be non-binding family agreements, and he can generally change his will as he sees fit.\n\nD) The older child's receipt of a house creates an automatic legal obligation for the father to provide an equal inheritance to the younger child.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, there is a rebuttable presumption that agreements between family members are not intended to create legally binding contracts. In the absence of formal documentation stating otherwise, the father's verbal promises to his children regarding inheritance are generally not considered legally binding. This means the father typically has the freedom to change his will and alter his plans for distributing his assets. \n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal promises within families are not automatically considered binding contracts. Option B is incorrect because there is no automatic legal requirement for compensation in this scenario. Option D is incorrect because receiving a gift does not create a legal obligation for equal treatment in inheritance matters.\n\nIt's worth noting that if either child had acted to their detriment based on the father's promises (such as making significant financial decisions), there might be grounds for estoppel, but this would need to be proven in court and is not automatically assumed."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a [paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679419) on the legal inspiration of Francis Bacon's philosophical terms, it is argued that Bacon was more likely inspired by\n\n> civil law rather than the common law, reflecting the fact that in his desire to \u201creduce and perfect\u201d English law into a \u201cDigest\u201d\u2014to be a Tribonian to James I\u2019s Justinian\u2014Bacon similarly drew his inspiration from the rule\\-governed civil law rather than the comparatively formless common law.\n\nIs this claim that common law was \"comparatively formless\" (i.e. much less rules\\-governed than civil law) in Bacon's time in accord with other legal historians' view of the \\[relative] law situation at the time? (Or was it just Bacon's own view? The paper is not exactly clear on that.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Bacon's time, common law countries had a greater proportion of legal rules articulated in case law precedents, and a small proportion of legal rules articulated in statutes passed by the legislature than it does today.\n\nFurther, meaningful access to case law resources for litigants was much more difficult in Bacon's time than it is today. There were fewer secondary sources, few of those were comprehensive and organized at the top level by subject matter, you couldn't do word searches or key note searches, and even primary sources, consisting of statute books and case reporters, were limited in number, expensive, and hard to use.\n\nThe private sector working together with civil society institutions would subsequently produce in American law, the digests and the \"restatements\" of the common law rules that Bacon sought (neither of which are themselves binding precedent).\n\nCharacterizing the distinction as between a \"rule based\" system and a \"formless\" one is in my opinion not a description that furthers understanding. In many respects, the common law of Bacon's era has more black and white \"rules of law\" that could be applied umpire\\-like by judges arising out of an already substantial collection of case law precedents, than civil law countries whose statutory laws often stated \"standards\" that set for vague general principles without little guidance regarding how they are applied in particular circumstances (as opposed to more specific and unambiguous \"rules\"). Precedents provided clear guidance in common law systems in a lot of specific fact patterns (e.g. the working of the \"mailbox rule\" for contact formation), but civil codes lacked the same level of nitty gritty detail. In Europe, in contrast, lawyers had whatever late Roman Empire legal digests had considered, in summary form, but there was no elaboration or development of this in fact patterns present at the time the court was making decisions but not in Roman times.\n\nThe Napoleonic Code and other major civil codes of Continental Europe hadn't been drafted at the time that Bacon lived. But what it did have what a subject\\-matter organized digest of the holdings of legal cases decided in the Roman Empire during Emperor Justinian's reign which were functionally treated as binding statutory authorities by the Latin speaking educated elite starting in the Renaissance and \"early modern\" period in European history which is known in legal circles as the process of the [\"reception\" of Roman law](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Roman+Law%2C+Reception+of#:%7E:text=the%20assimilation%20of%20Roman%20law,countries%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages.&text=The%20reception%20of%20Roman%20law,the%2015th%20and%2016th%20centuries.) after it had been dormant for centuries, a process that Britain did not participate in itself.\n\nThe issue was not that the common law system of Bacon's time lacked legal rules, or that it was formless in the sense that there was not a clear, albeit, somewhat latent structure to those rules, although few people had access to the whole of the relevant authorities.\n\nInstead, what was missing in Bacon's time was a compact, comprehensive, statute\\-like, widely available authoritative statement of private law (the law governing the interaction of non\\-governmental parties) and criminal law, that could fit easily in a hefty volume or three (written in Latin) on a library bookshelf.\n\nThis meant, in practice, in common law systems, that it was much harder to deal with legal questions (both transactional and litigation issues) without the assistance of a highly trained specialist lawyer who had spent years learning the system, while in civil law countries, an educated individual who was literate in Latin without other formal legal training had much more of a fighting chance of figuring out what the law required and said, reducing (but not eliminating by any means) the benefits associated with having highly trained legal counsel.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that the USA has a \"common law\" system and that ambiguous written legislation is turned into unambiguous law by courts, such as has happened in many famous Supreme Court rulings. My understanding is that there is an alternative system (\"statute law\"?) in which ambiguous legislation stands until courts produce outcomes which are bad or inconsistent enough to force legislators (via the democratic process) to rewrite bad laws or write new ones. If I've misunderstood please correct me.\n\nAnyway let's say the people favored switching to statute law (or however it is known). Could this be done?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are confusing a few concepts.\n\nOne is the distinction between what are known as \"common law\" jurisdictions derived from the English legal system, and \"civil law\" jurisdictions derived from one of the continental European legal systems that is ultimately derived from Roman law.\n\nAnother is the distinction between determining the meaning of ambiguous legislation, which all courts do by definition, and the power of judicial review, which overturns legislation which is invalid for some reason rather than merely trying to interpret an ambiguous provision.\n\nAmbiguous means \"unclear\" or \"capable of being interpreted in more than one way\" and every time every court encounters unclear legislation it must decide what it means, even if it is not invalidated.\n\nIn contrast, some judiciaries that have the power of judicial review and those that do not. Judiciaries that can declare a law to be invalid have the power of judicial review. Judiciaries that cannot declare a law to be invalid do not have the power of judicial review. Every state and federal U.S. Court at every level (not just the U.S. Supreme Court) has the power and obligation to declare that a law violated the U.S. Constitution. In many countries, no court, or only a \"constitutional court\" has the power to make declare legislation to be invalid by exercising judicial review.\n\nEvery time that a legislature passes a statute on a subject covered by common law (i.e. judge\\-made law derived from case decisions that serve as precedents), it shrinks the scope of common law relative to statutes. And, in principle, almost all of the common law could be replaced by statutes without all that much difficulty. But, in civil law countries, statutes are frequently comprehensive and are the sole source of legal authority about their subject matter superseding all case law, while in common law countries, statutes are often piecemeal tweaks to a common law background that is assumed by the statute.\n\nFor example, every civil law country would have a comprehensive statute setting forth the principles of contract law, while a typical common law jurisdiction might have a statute that declares that certain contracts must be in writing but does not comprehensively set forth the law of contracts in all circumstances.\n\nThere are some features of civil law countries, such as the absence of jury trials, which cannot be constitutionally changed to the civil law system, even in jurisdictions such a Puerto Rico and Louisiana in the United States which have civil law roots prior to joining the U.S. (at least in criminal cases and in the federal courts).\n\nThe power of judicial review (i.e. the power of courts to declare a statute unconstitutional and void) is also inherent in the U.S. Constitutional system of government and could not be removed without a constitutional amendment. There are common law countries, e.g., England, which did not historically have the power of judicial review, which was an innovation for a common law countries such as the United States when it was first invoked. (For what it is worth, India goes one step further; its Supreme Court asserts and exercises the right to declare portions of its own constitution to be unconstitutional.)\n\nThere are other aspects of civil law legal systems which would probably also be declared unconstitutional in the United States as well, such as the lack of a prohibition on the introduction of hearsay evidence in criminal trials which violates a provision of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights known as the \"confrontation clause.\"\n\nIt is unclear to me whether the principle that case law precedents have binding legal effect in future cases, which is part of the common law system that is absent in the civil law system, has a constitutional dimension or could be displaced by law.\n\nBut, most aspects of a civil law legal system could be adopted in the United States if the relevant legislatures so desired. Indeed, many aspects of the U.S. legal system have moved in that direction. For example, only a handful of U.S. states now recognize the concept of a \"common law crime\". Almost all states now only allow criminal sanctions for crimes codified by statute, which was not the case at the time of the American Revolution, when few crimes were codified.\n\nObviously, with a constitutional amendment, almost any change to the U.S. legal system is possible.",

I am NOT going to name it because it is more powerful without the name. Let's say that in 2024, this party has lost the midterms. They want to send poll watchers out to heavily populated areas in competitive/battleground states that vote heavily against them in order to swing the Electoral College in their candidate's favor. Would abusing these poll watchers in order to manipulate electoral outcomes be illegal?\n\nNote: I am NOT speculating on anything. This is just a hypothetical. This is a political and legal question about the legality of trying to restrict voting. This does not just involve voter ID laws. It is many things together.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Each state has its own election laws, so you will get 50 different answers depending on what state you are interested in (perhaps 49, since Washington doesn't have polling places \\- depends on what you mean by \"poll watcher\"). [This page](https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/poll-watchers) is a starter list of legal resources. [This page](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/policies-for-election-observers.aspx) starts you on deconstructing this notion of \"poll watcher\". Colorado is one state that explicitly allows partisan observers, [here are the rules](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule8.pdf).\n\nNo person is compelled to be an observer, so I don't understand who you think might be abusing a poll watcher. Perhaps you are referring to the possibility that an election official will prevent an observer from doing their job. Or perhaps you are thinking that being a poll watcher abuses the intent of some law. Whatever you have in mind, there are laws in each state that say what is allowed and what is forbidden, so you have to address this at a local level.\n\nNo state has a requirement that observers must come from or swear allegiance to the majority party of that polling jurisdiction (e.g. county, or precinct). Any attempt by election officials, or anyone else, to block observers from the minority party would be rebuffed by the courts. The courts will not attempt to divine inner motivations for sending an observer. Most states allow partisan observers. [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf) distinguishes \"challengers\" and \"poll watchers\", and there are distinct rules and powers for the two sets. A crucial difference is that a watcher cannot legally challenge a claimed right to vote or a precinct board action, but a challenger can. There are rules of conduct imposed on both kinds of observers, one of them being that you cannot challenge a voter for the purpose of annoying or delaying the voter. This is a misdemeanor (a crime) under [MCL 168\\.727](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-168-727.pdf), and as a criminal prohibition, the state would have to prove intent beyond reasonable doubt.

Most states do allow partisan observers, but there are indeed strict rules governing their conduct and limitations on their actions. This is evidenced by the information provided about various state laws, such as Michigan's distinction between \"challengers\" and \"poll watchers\" and the specific rules for each.

Total sentence was 70 years.\n\nThe prosecution of the time solely used the evidence deriving out of the 7 charges to additionally, but falsely create a rape charge, which was not dismissed, in spite no whatsoever physical evidence existed.\n\nConsidering the age of the toddler at the time, the toddler was exempt from testifying in court. The toddler also allegedly claimed 2 other persons as perpetrators to officials, according to court documents. This information wa however completely suppressed by the judicial entities of the time, so as to shield the judicial wrongdoing. Prosecution and court relied solely upon hearsay of 2 individuals, who both had motive to perjury.\n\nAs explained above. Initially 8 charges were sought, 8 charges were prosecuted. 7 were dismissed within 7 years of litigation. 1 charge remains.\n\nHowever, the alleged evidence of the 7 charges which were dissmissed was carried over to uphold the 8th charge. That charge by itself has absolutely no physical evidence whatsoever.\n\nHow can this be legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not clear what you are asking (\"How can this be legal?\"), so I suppose it may mean that you don't understand the relationship between dismissal of a charge and admissibility of evidence. Or you think that physical evidence is required by law. You might try clarifying the question.\n\nA prosecution can be dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice. Dismissal with prejudice means that the charge cannot be pursued again, whereas dismissal without prejudice allows re\\-filing the charges, and is basically a temporary delay. Dismissal with prejudice can occur especially when the defendants fundamental rights were violated, for instance with illegally\\-obtained evidence. Dismissal without prejudice may arise because the prosecution needs to gather more evidence. The fact that a prosecution had started with an intent to use certain evidence does not mean that the evidence is itself now inaccessible. So in principle, any evidence that would have been used in an earlier prosecution can still be used. In the case of a felony, it does not legally matter how much time has elapsed since the alleged crime and the prosecution. So on the face of it, there is still a viable prosecution.\n\nPhysical (forensic) evidence is not required to obtain a criminal conviction, all that is required is testimony that \"fully satisfies or entirely convinces \\[the jury] of the defendant's guilt\". That can be the testimony of two witnesses. While \"hearsay\" evidence is excluded, the definition of \"hearsay\" is complicated, since hearsay is what people generally think is hearsay *but* certain things are excluded from the definition of hearsay (therefore are admissible). [FRE 803](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803) spells out the exceptions: 803(4\\) is widely used to allow testimony by the in the case of sexual assault of children. [This article](https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1751&context=mulr) surveys a number of relevant cases, and see also [this article](https://scholarworks.law.ubalt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1609&context=lf) \u2013 the point is that testimony from a psychologist, social worker, parent or other person as to what the child said can be admissible.",

Testimony from professionals like psychologists or social workers about what the child said can be admissible under these exceptions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because physical evidence, while helpful, is not always required for a conviction. Testimony can be sufficient if it convinces the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nOption B is incorrect because dismissal of some charges does not automatically make evidence related to those charges inadmissible for remaining charges. Evidence can still be used if it's relevant and admissible.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while hearsay is generally not admissible, there are important exceptions, especially in cases involving child victims of sexual assault."

They are around registering or 'paying and displaying' a valid car parking permit. **The only evidence given of this alleged breach are two photos, one each of my entry and exit**. \n\n\\[I had bought and displayed a ticket/parking permit completely covering the length of time parked, but this is a separate issue which I am not exploring in this present query]\n\nWhat I would like to ask is specifically whether this an adequate/correct/valid charge? I would've thought they'd need to 1\\) show in a photo that I have no valid parking permit displayed and then 2\\) state that they have no record of an online or telephone registration of my parking permit. These would then show evidence of breaching their terms and conditions. \n\nI don't think showing photos of entry and exit alone proves that the terms and conditions have been breached. If I had registered, or paid and displayed a valid parking permit, I would still have a photo of entry and exiting too. So such photos **cannot distinguish** between someone who has or has not breached the terms and conditions.\n\nI'd think that 'entry and exit photos' as evidence in a PCN only works at a 'pay before exit' type of parking, as it can distinguish those who have or not paid before exiting.\n\nIf the entry and exit photos are legally adequate, I would be grateful if this can be explained: on what basis is this adequate?\n\nI would be grateful for any responses.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnote:\nThe terms and conditions :\n\n\"parking and payment terms\n\n\\*where you are in possession of a valid permit you agree to park in accordance with the terms set out in the permit.

This is something they need to prove so the photos may only be for that.\n\nTheir statement that you didn\u2019t display a valid ticket/permit is, at present an unevidenced assertion. If you contest this, they will provide evidence that you didn\u2019t (e.g. the actual records they refer to) and you would provide evidence that you did and, if it goes to court, the judge will decide what evidence they prefer. As this is not a criminal matter, they need to prove the offence on the balance of probabilities.\n\nHowever, there are almost certainly administrative remedies which will allow you to contest the fine without going to court. This would involve you sending them a copy of the permit and them assessing whether their belief that you didn\u2019t display it is justified or not.",

To prove a violation, the parking company would need to provide additional evidence, such as photos showing no valid permit was displayed or records indicating no payment was made. The burden of proof is on the parking company to demonstrate the alleged breach on the balance of probabilities, as this is not a criminal matter. The driver can contest the PCN by providing evidence of a valid permit or payment, and the parking company would need to justify their belief that a violation occurred.

When I got to my new apartment and unpacked my boxes, I found several boxes full of stuff that I had never seen before. Among the items that I found in these boxes were:\n\n* A vacuum cleaner that makes noise, but doesn't have any suction\n* A Rubik's cube with half of the stickers missing\n* An old CRT monitor with an image partially burned in\n* Shelves from a refrigerator\n* Lots of magnets, mostly dull but a few good ones\n* Instructions on how to install a door bell\n* 4 copies of the DVD Battleship\n\nThis was very strange to find this box. I'm guessing this came in my truck for 2 possible reasons:\n\n1. Somebody was also moving at the same time and mistakenly put it in\n2. Somebody was trying to throw away an old box of junk and just put it in my open truck and ran away\n\nConsidering how my now former neighbors would terrorize me (blasting loud music, setting loose a possum through my window, taking a dump in my mailbox), I'm guessing it's the 2nd reason, although I'm not positive.\n\nMy question is: am I under any legal obligation to try to return this box? I don't want to see my former neighbors again, but can I get in trouble if I keep this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In California (where lost\\+found laws have been discussed quite a lot), this would be either \"lost property\" or \"abandoned property\". With abandoned property, you can do what you want. With lost property, it is legal to *ignore* it. \n\nIf you take it, you have the obligation to try to return it to the owner. If you don't do that, it's theft. If you don't take it, you have no obligation whatsoever. Put it somewhere where the loser (the person who lost it) is more likely to find it, for example on the street. Don't take anything. \n\nClarification for comments: There is a box. And the owner of the box is nowhere to be seen. That box is by definition lost or abandoned \\- it is abandoned if the owner got rid of it intentionally, it is lost if the owner is looking for it. We don't know. We can make guesses depending on the situation. \n\nNo matter whether lost or abandoned, you are legally absolutely fine if you just ignore it. You have no reason to try to return it to its owner. If you don't make it your business, it's not your business. \n\nBut if you decide you want the box, or bits of it, and it isn't abandoned (which is hard to know for sure), then you have to try to find the owner first, and if you don't find them, then you can keep it.",

However, if he decides to take or keep any items from the box, and it's not clearly abandoned (which is difficult to determine), he is legally obligated to attempt to find the owner first.

According to the documentation, the defendant is generally allowed to discuss their own thought process about what made their actions seem reasonable, which can include awareness of other incidents. However, the admissibility of specific external incidents as evidence is subject to the judge's discretion.

Therefore, the principle of double jeopardy applies: the person has already been tried on the facts and all the charges that were or *should have been* brought have been determined. This, of course, doesn't prevent charges from being laid for other crimes allegedly committed at other times over different events.\n\nIn the case where a person is pardoned more broadly, as in the Michael Flynn example, in addition to the double jeopardy limitation, a prosecutor is prevented from charging anything that falls within the scope of the pardon.\n\n**Pardons do not constrain civil suits**\n\nIf you are pardoned of say, murder, that does not prevent the victim's dependants from bringing a wrongful death suit, just as being found not guilty wouldn't. These are different cases with different parties and the pardon has no effect.\n\nSimilarly, a Federal pardon does not prevent a State (or another country) from laying charges over the same matter and vice\\-versa.",

A presidential pardon typically only covers the specific crimes mentioned and does not prevent civil lawsuits. The pardon does not extend to crimes not explicitly stated (unless broadly worded like in Michael Flynn's case), so Y could potentially face state prosecution for crimes C and D. However, regardless of the pardon, Y can be sued in civil court for damages related to all the crimes, as pardons do not constrain civil suits. Option A is incorrect because state-level prosecutions are not affected by federal pardons. Option B is partially correct about state prosecutions but incorrect about federal prosecutions for the pardoned crimes.

Rather than try to kick out the problem kids many managers will attempt to avoid the problem in the first place.\n\nAlso, a sign like this might help the manager be less discriminatory. For example, let's say he lets all kids in and only kicks out the ones who are causing problems. If those problem kids are all in one protected class and it's different from the kids who don't get kicked out, the manager looks like he's discriminating based on that protected class.\n\nDiscrimination by proxy can be hard to prove and I am not sure of the burden of proof in Canada.

This is because student status often correlates with other protected characteristics such as age, race, or potentially even religion (if there are nearby religious schools). The policy may disproportionately affect these protected groups, which could be seen as indirect discrimination.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overlooks the possibility of proxy discrimination.

Employees are generally expected to follow all written policies, regardless of how they've been applied previously. Sudden enforcement of previously overlooked rules could indeed lead to disciplinary action, including termination, for employees who don't comply. This situation underscores the importance of following all official policies, even if they seem to be loosely enforced in practice."

Admittedly shocked, he spoke to the manager of that restobar to find out why, and was informed that due to other peace\\-disturbing, presumably single males (who caused fights and such), they had to implement such a rule.\n\nThis restobar is privately owned, but is open to the public without restriction (i.e. doesn't require membership like a club, and such).\n\nI understand that almost every place of entertainment across the globe displays this \"Rights to admission reserved\" disclaimer. However, the second clause of [Article 15 of the Constitution of India](http://india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf) says:\n\n> No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place\n>  of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability,\n>  restriction or condition with regard to \\-\n> \n> \n> 1. access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or\n> 2. the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or\n>  dedicated to the use of general public.\n\nAnd then clause three of the same article goes on to say:\n\n> Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any\n>  special provision for women and children.\n\nThus, by my understanding, the above\\-mentioned restobar's rule of not allowing single males in is illegal according to the Constitution of India.\n\nAm I correct to arrive at this conclusion? Or are there any additional relevant laws that I may have overlooked?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article 15(2\\) of the Indian Constitution prohibits restriction to any citizen of India on entry to a public hotel, restaurant or place of entertainment on the grounds \"only of religion, race, caste, sex \\[and/or] place of birth\". It is a fundamental right guaranteed to all citizens of India.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has held a \"public place\" to mean any place which is open to the public and to also include private places functioning to serve a non\\-exclusive group of people. Hence, a club or premise opened only to serve its affiliates or members shall not be considered a public place for the purpose of this provision of law.\n\nHence, if a citizen of India is not denied admission purely on the basis of his/her religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, his admission to a restaurant or a hotel owned and operated by the government or private concerns may be prohibited as the rights of admission may be reserved with the management of the premises. \n\nJust to conclude you can sue the hotel for denying entry",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal status of this policy under the Indian Constitution?\n\nA) The policy is legal because private businesses have the right to refuse service to anyone.\n\nB) The policy is illegal because it violates Article 15(2) of the Indian Constitution, which prohibits discrimination based on sex for access to public places of entertainment.\n\nC) The policy is legal because Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution allows for special provisions for women and children.\n\nD) The policy may be illegal, but only if it can be proven that sex is the sole basis for denial of entry, with no other factors considered.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While Article 15(2) of the Indian Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex (among other factors) for access to public places, including restaurants and places of entertainment, the key phrase is \"on grounds only of.\" If the restaurant can demonstrate that their policy is based on factors beyond just sex (such as past behavior of certain groups, safety concerns, etc.), it may not be in direct violation of Article 15(2). Additionally, the Supreme Court of India has held that rights of admission can be reserved by management, as long as denial is not purely based on the protected grounds listed in Article 15(2). Therefore, the legality of the policy hinges on whether sex is the sole basis for denial of entry or if other factors are considered, making option D the most accurate reflection of the legal complexity surrounding this issue."

My landlord has announced that the doors of all apartments will shortly be converted to electronic \"smart locks\". The smart\\-lock maker's website says that any use of their product constitutes agreement to their terms of service.\n\nIs the landlord allowed to install this new type of lock? How does responsibility divide among myself, the landlord, and the smart\\-lock maker? My concerns are:\n\n1. Smart locks raise new reliability, security, and privacy risks versus mechanical locks. When I agreed to rent the apartment, mechanical locks were in use and no indication was given that they would be replaced. See [this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/02/03/smart-lock-for-your-home-has-pros-and-cons/4454848002/) on tenants who have objected to installation of smart locks.\n2. When the smart lock is installed, I will have no choice but to use it in order to access my apartment for the remainder of my lease. It seems unfair for me to be bound by the smart\\-lock maker's terms of service when my use of their product is non\\-consensual. If the terms of service are viewed as a contract, I see a few possible arguments:\n\nA. There is no meeting of the minds because I have no desire to use their product.\n\nB. The obligations imposed on me (and limitations on their liability) in the terms of service are void for lack of consideration because the ability to access my apartment, which the lock provides, is something I am *already entitled to* by my lease, i.e., it is being used to fulfill an *existing* obligation of the landlord.\n\nC. The landlord cannot require me to take on additional obligations to a third party in order to continue the enjoyment of the apartment promised by my already\\-signed lease, so the landlord must indemnify me from any such obligations.\n\nWhat are my rights and how can I assert them? If I cannot prevent the smart\\-lock installation, can I somehow establish that I am *not* bound by the terms of service despite what the smart\\-lock maker's website says? Would I simply wait until such time (if ever) that I have a dispute with the smart\\-lock maker, and then use my non\\-consent to argue that the terms neither protect them nor bind me? How strong would that argument be, and what if anything should I do now to document that non\\-consent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your lease states what your rights and obligations are: you cannot unilaterally change those terms, nor can the landlord. Providing a functioning lock on the door is a statutory obligation of the landlord, and the landlord gets to say what kind of lock is installed as long as the device functions, and isn't impossible for the tenant to operate. If the landlord replaces the lock with a no\\-security $10 entry door knob that yields to a screwdriver, they probably failed in their obligation to provide entry security. Failing such a concern, you don't have a legal right to refuse the landlord's choice of lock. You also do not take on the obligation to acquire the tools needed for installation, and so on. In short, you don't have a choice.\n\nSince you have no choice and you are not a party in this transaction (the landlord is not acting as your agent, he is satisfying a legal obligation that *he* has), the question of \"agreeing\" to someone else's transaction and contract is irrelevant. The landlord, as purchaser, must comply with the terms of the contract since he is a party to the contract. The seller might impose an obligation on the buyer and the landlord might hope to pass those terms on to the tenant via a lease term, but that can't be done unilaterally in the middle of a lease.",

The tenant cannot refuse this change as long as the new lock functions properly. However, the tenant is not a party to the transaction between the landlord and the smart-lock maker, and therefore is not bound by the smart-lock maker's terms of service. The landlord must comply with these terms as the purchaser, but cannot unilaterally impose new obligations on the tenant mid-lease. The tenant's use of the lock is necessary to access their apartment and does not constitute voluntary agreement to the smart-lock maker's terms."

Some MP3 technologies may still be under patent protection, especially in the United States.\n2. The legality of using MP3 technology without paying licensing fees depends on various factors, including the specific features implemented and whether the developer writes their own code or uses third-party software.\n3.

It is a form of attestation which is done for the countries that are a part of the **Hague Convention**. While embassy attestation is a process which is carried out for the countries that do not identify as apostille.\n\nLegalization of educational documents is needed for the cause of pursuing higher studies in abroad, even Europe. The kind of document legalization required is dependant on which European country you are trying to apply for. The procedures for apostille of documents may differ from country to country. The procedure for apostille in India for educational documents is as follows:\n\n* **For in\\-state documents**\n\n1. Notary\n2. Home department/SDM\n3. MEA\n\n* **For out of state documents**\n\n1. Notary\n2. SDM\n3. MEA\n\n* **As per the country\u2019s requirement**\n\n1. Board/University Verification\n2. HRD\n3. MEA\n\nIn case you are getting apostille of documents for Italy, the third kind of procedure is mandatory. The process of the apostille in India is done with the application of apostille sticker and stamp from the **Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)**. On the other hand, certificate attestation is completed by obtaining a stamp from the embassy. However, in the process, you may also require the apostille of personal documents. The procedure for personal documents is listed below:\n\n**1\\. Notary:** The initial step to begin with the authentication of documents for apostille countries is the notary. It is based at the regional level and legalization can be obtained from the notary official available at the office.\n\n**2\\. State Level:** After the notary, the concerned department of the state attests the documents and provides a stamp on them. It is done by the State Home Department (SHD) or the Sub\\-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) depending on the issuance of the document.\n\n**3\\. MEA:** The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is the central government department that deals with the foreign matters of the country. It is the final step of apostille. The MEA then provides an apostille sticker and stamp on the document.\n\nThere basically are three types of documents \\- personal, educational and commercial. The documents that require apostille for educational purposes include a combination of educational and personal documents.

Using Kyle's height as a reference point (162cm / 5ft 4\"), as this is what was listed on his arrest warrant. I roughly measured his rifle to be 80cm (31\\.4\") long from the very end of the stock to the very tip of the barrel. So it is definitely longer than 26\" overall as per the second clause in user6726's citation of Wisconsin law. The barrel measures in at 16\\.8\" from breech face to the tip of the barrel.\n\nDespite the possible margin of error that can be made in measuring objects in this manner, I think that the length of the rifle is not an issue in the law debate surrounding Kyle as far as I'm concerned as it seems to be a legal \"long barrel rifle\"\n\n**Edit**: To those who know more about rifles/guns and where exactly the breechface starts on the rifle in the photo pictured below, please let me know if the measurement is too short or too long.\n\n[![Kyle Rittenhouse Rifle and barrel relative measurements](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zodgy.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zodgy.jpg)",

Option B is correct because:\n\n1. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing \"short-barreled\" rifles.\n2. The law defines a \"short-barreled\" rifle as one with an overall length under 26 inches or a barrel length under 16 inches.\n3. The information provided states that Rittenhouse's rifle was measured to be approximately 31.4 inches overall, with a barrel length of about 16.8 inches.\n4. These measurements exceed the minimum requirements, making it a \"long barrel rifle\" which is not prohibited for minors under this specific statute.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they overgeneralize the prohibition. Option C is partially correct but incomplete, as it only considers barrel length and not overall length."

Also are these two clauses contradicting each other? \n\n> NON\\-EXCLUSIVITY\n> \n> \n> 1. Non\\-Exclusivity.

Once a year has elapsed since the termination of the Agreement between consultant and company, that restriction disappears. Thereafter, the consultant will be free to offer the *competing product* to those customers as well (effectively becoming the company's competitor).\n\nFor instance, suppose the company is in the business of car sales, and its clients are X, Y, and Z. The consultant may continue his side business of car sales, but he is not allowed to make a \\[car] sales pitch to X, Y, and Z except in his capacity of the company's personnel. The same applies if the company is trying to close a sale with W (since W is the company's prospective client).\n\nItem (b) of Clause 2 implies that the consultant may still engage the company's personnel to join the consultant's side business as long as (1\\) the engagement does not prompt that personnel to leave the company; and (2\\) the side business to which that personnel is invited does not result in competition against the company. That prohibition also disappears a year after the relation between the consultant and the company has ended.\n\n> it never defines \"Competing Product\" so could this in theory be extremely wide?\n\nOftentimes the context renders it unnecessary to define \"*Competing Product*\". A company that is focused on selling cars cannot reasonably object to the consultant's side business of selling boats or motorcycles. Using the above example, the consultant may at all times approach X, Y, Z, and W for the purpose of selling boats or motorcycles, since these goods would hardly qualify as substitute or *competing products* for cars.",

I'm looking at the disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nFirst, what happens if two [Exclusive Economic Zones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone) (EEZ) overlap? How do you determine rights if, for example, the 220 mile EEZ of Vietnam overlaps the EEZ of China?\n\nSecond, can a sovereign be wholly territory inside another country's EEZ? Since an island generate its own EEZ, you would have question \\#1 above where the EEZs overlapped if your island was inside the EEZ of another country. For example, if the People's Republic of China assert its authority over an island in the Philippines's EEZ, what respective rights do the parties have for resource extraction, fishing, etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As pointed out in a comment, exclusive zones cannot overlap by definition, given the meaning of \"exclusive.\"\n\nYour question is answered in the Wikipedia article you link to:\n\n> Generally, a state's exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance of no more than 200 nmi (370 km) out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when exclusive economic zones would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nmi (740 km) apart. **When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual maritime boundary.

There is no automatic rule giving precedence to the discovering country, the country with a longer coastline, or transferring control to the UN.

Kills him by crushing into his body.\n\nCan she be accused with involuntary manslaughter? Why/why not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The crime often called \"involuntary manslaughter\", or simply [manslaughter in the second degree](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.32.070), is\n\n> when, with **criminal negligence**, he or she causes the death of another\n>  person\n\nThe standards for \"criminal negligence\" as well as \"recklessness\" are spelled out [here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.08.010). The first term is defined as:\n\n> A person is criminally negligent or acts with criminal negligence when\n>  he or she fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act\n>  may occur and his or her *failure to be aware of such substantial risk\n>  constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a\n>  reasonable person would exercise in the same situation*.\n\nYou can elaborate the above scenario with some details to make this be a criminally negligent act, but I assume the intent is to have this be a tragic accident. So for example, I assume that she did not see the fireman.\nThe law does not require you to die in a fire in case there is a remote possibility that you could injure another person in the course of saving yourself. Unless you add some evil intent on the girl's part (\"I don't care if I land on that fireman, that's his job\"), a reasonable person would act likewise and save their own life.",

For the girl to be charged with involuntary manslaughter, her actions would need to meet the standard of criminal negligence, which requires that her failure to be aware of a substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation. In this scenario, unless there are additional details suggesting the girl acted with gross negligence or recklessness, her actions to save her own life would likely be considered reasonable given the circumstances.

The seller is always responsible for providing a valid smog certificate that was issued within 90 days prior to the sale, regardless of the \"as-is\" condition.
