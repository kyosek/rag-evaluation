The father can indeed be charged with assault, and self-defense is unlikely to be a successful argument in this scenario. Here's why:\n\n1. The act of beating someone up, regardless of provocation, is generally considered assault and is illegal in all jurisdictions, including Florida.\n\n2. Self-defense typically requires an immediate threat of physical harm. In this case, while the perpetrator's actions were highly inappropriate and likely criminal, they did not pose an immediate physical threat to the father or his children at the time of the assault.\n\n3. The verbal altercation that occurred after the exposure incident does not justify physical violence under self-defense laws.\n\n4. While the father's anger is understandable, the law does not allow for vigilante justice or \"street justice.\" The appropriate action would have been to report the incident to law enforcement.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because self-defense laws do not provide blanket protection for retaliatory violence.\n\n6. Option B is incorrect because there was no imminent physical harm at the time of the assault.\n\n7. Option D is incorrect because Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law typically applies to situations where there is a reasonable fear of death or great bodily harm, which doesn't apply in this scenario.\n\nThis question tests understanding of self-defense laws, assault charges, and the limits of justifiable use of force in response to non-violent (though criminal) provocations."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11519/legal-to-post-picture-of-a-trespasser", "docs_id": 11519, "title": "Legal to post picture of a trespasser?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can I legally post a pic of a trespasser on (Facebook for instance) who came onto my property while I was on vacation without my permission?

Words are not required, so a humiliating picture could count. An opinion or insult can't be the basis of a defamation suit, since such a statement isn't considered by the law to make a true or false statement.

In particular:\n\n* Would, say, Shakespeare's works (published before the introduction of copyright) leave the public domain?\n* Would works previously under copyright whose original copyright term had already expired gain renewed copyright?\n* If the answer to the second question is yes, what would happen to derivative works of those works?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: See *[Golan v. Holder](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-545.pdf)* 565 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2012\\).\n\nThe question was whether Congress could pass a law that caused works in the public domain to regain copyright.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that:\n\n> The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Historical practice corroborates the Court\u2019s reading of the Copyright Clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected works.\n\nSo, yes, works can come out of public domain and into Copyright protection.\n\nWhat about people who had been relying on the works not having copyright (i.e. people who had created derivative works, etc.)? That depends on how Congress intends the hypothetical law to apply to them. In the law in question in *Golan v. Holder*, Congress planned ahead for this, and included provisions for it in the law (quoting from *Golan v. Holder*):\n\n> Reliance parties may continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of the restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce\u2014either by filing with the U. S. Copyright Office within two years of restoration, or by actually notifying the reliance party. After that, reliance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a grace period of one year. Finally, anyone who, before the URAA\u2019s enactment, created a \u201cderivative work\u201d based on a restored work may indefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the copyright holder of \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d to be set by a district judge if the parties cannot agree.\n\nLast, could Congress extend copyright for 10,000 years? In principle, the Supreme Court has not said anything against this, but they have indicated that there is some line beyond which a copyright term would no longer be considered a \"limited time\" as required by the Constitution.\n\nIn *Golan v. Holder* they mention in passing hypothetical successive re\\-applications of Copyright to a work after it expires, calling it \"legislative misbehavior\":\n\n> the hypothetical legislative misbehavior petitioners posit is far afield from the case before us.\n\nAnd in *Eldred v. Ashcroft*, they mention in passing hypothetical unlimited successive extensions of copyright, each of limited time, again calling that \"legislative misbehavior\":\n\n> Concerning petitioners' assertion that Congress could evade the limitation on its authority by stringing together an unlimited number of \"limited Times,\" the court stated that such legislative misbehavior clearly was not before it.\n\nI could imagine a court holding that the \"limited times\" clause in the Constitution does not permit Congress to extend copyright for 10,000 years, which is longer than the existence of the U.S. or any countries or even civilizations that the founders were aware of at the time of the Constitution's writing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the Supreme Court's rulings in Golan v.

They also state that \"Religious discrimination also includes discrimination against someone because s/he is an atheist\".

Her 1 year fixed term lease expires at the end of February, leaving her about 4 days to move out after her quarantine period. Prior to leaving the country, she had planned to renew her lease, until the landlord indicated the rent would be increasing $100 per month.\n\nThe Landlord has made it clear that they have the right to show the premises at any time, and no intention of relinquishing that right, and therefore my daughter must find someplace else to reside during her 14 day quarantine. This would seem to meet the definition of a Frustrated Contract.\n\n\u201cA frustrated contract is a contract that, subsequent to its formation, and without fault of either party, is incapable of being performed due to an unforeseen event (or events), resulting in the obligations under the contract being radically different from those contemplated by the parties to the contract.\u201d Cut and pasted from Google.\n\nRealizing that my daughter would not be allowed to quarantine in her rented premises, we moved all her belongings into storage, cleaned the suite and turned in the keys a week ago.\n\nWe have also noticed a very strange clause in her lease:\n\n2\\.(c ) The Terms and Conditions and all Schedules of this Lease continue with the Occupancy of the Owner\u2019s property by the Tenant until the Tenant either signs a new lease with the Owner or vacates the premises, which ever occurs first.\n\nThis seems very strange to me, but it appears that the Terms and Conditions of the lease have no effect after the Tenant vacates the premises.\n\nSo the question is, do we file a claim for Frustration or simply that the Tenant has vacated the premises and rent is no longer payable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is not frustrated\n------------------------------\n\nThe fact that your daughter cannot reside in the premises for a period or that the landlord cannot show the premises does not amount to frustration. If the property had burned down \\- that might be frustration (if the lease didn\u2019t contemplate that \\- most do).\n\nUnfortunately, your daughter is obliged to comply with her obligations under the lease or she will be in breach. This includes paying rent until it ends and allowing the landlord to show the property as the lease permits.\n\nShe has correctly identified that if she quarantines in the property she will be preventing the landlord from showing it. She has two options:\n\n1. Quarantine elsewhere and comply with the lease,\n2. Quarantine at home, break the lease and pay damages to the landlord. The landlord would need to demonstrate that the breach had caused damage. That is, they would need to prove that being unable to show the property during the 2 week period had caused them to not be able to relet it and, probably, the maximum damage would be two weeks at the new rent \\- this would be full compensation for the two week delay in their ability to show the property.\n\nYour daughter chose 1\\., possibly without being aware that 2\\. was an option.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, parties must comply with their contractural obligations even if extraneous factors (like government regulations) make that more difficult. Civil law jurisdictions have the doctrine in law of [force majeure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure) but in common law jurisdictions, that concept is a creature of contract. That is, a party is only released from an obligation hindered by an external factor if the contract deals with it. For example, if a government mandate shuts down a construction site, the builder must still complete by the date for completion notwithstanding. Or, remember the ship stuck in the Suez Canal? Other ships delayed by that event would still be required to pay if they were late unless the contract released them (common law), but could claim force majeure if the contract was under civil law.\n\nThe narrower doctrine of [frustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration_of_purpose) requires that the *principal purpose* of the contract be impossible or radically altered by the extraneous event. The principal purpose of a residential lease is for the landlord to provide the dwelling and the tenant to pay rent: neither of these are affected so there is no frustration.

The tenant has two viable options: they can choose to quarantine elsewhere to fully comply with the lease terms, including allowing property showings, or they can quarantine at the property, potentially breaking the lease terms. If they choose the latter, they may face limited damages related to the landlord's inability to show the property during that time.

If by \"across the state\" you mean some distance away but in the same state then the exact law will depend on which state you are in, but as a rule any \"conversion\" of property to the use of another counts as theft. In this case your aunt has \"converted\" the property to the use of your Nan (funny legal phrase). The fact that the people doing this are your relatives makes no difference.\n\n(When asking about the law here you should always say which state you are in.)\n\nAlthough theft is a crime, you could also start a civil case to get your property back without involving the police. The details depend on where you are, but try googling \"(your state) small claims court\". Many states have a process for collecting low\\-value debts or other property without needing lawyers.\n\nYou need to have a firm conversation with your aunt about this. Tell her that you want your property back, and don't back down. Also call your Nan and explain this to her as well; she may not have realised that she is in possession of stolen property, which is usually a separate crime.\n\nIf you want more advice on how to get your property back without starting a family row then you might ask on the Interpersonal Skills SE, but it might be better to start with \"When are you planning to return my property?\" and leave \"You are a thief\" as a last resort.\n\n**Edit:** As Eric Nolan points out in the comments, you may be a minor.

This is termed as \"conversion\" of property, which counts as theft. The fact that it's within the family doesn't make it legal. The location (whether it's across the state or not) doesn't determine its legality, as long as it's without the owner's consent.

It isn't terribly common but it certainly happens to those that get relatively prominent.\n* Many of the folks doing the copyright infringement are judgement proof. It makes little sense for Disney, for example, to sue some guy living in his parents' basement for uploading a clip of their movie when that guy has no assets. Financially, it wouldn't be worth the cost of a lawyer.\n* Many of the folks doing the copyright infringement are in jurisdictions that look the other way. If you're a Russian citizen pirating content owned by American companies, the Russian authorities aren't going to cooperate and arrest you and the American companies likely can't recover any judgement they'd get because you don't have any assets in America.\n* There is a whack\\-a\\-mole problem. If there are hundreds of people posting pirated content to Facebook and each one is running hundreds of pages, that's tens of thousands of pages posting content. By the time you identify and close all of them, the pirates will have created tens of thousands of new pages.\n* There is a cat\\-and\\-mouse problem. Copyright owners have automated tools to scan for their IP to issue takedown notices. Piraters know this so they modify the video (posting it as a mirror image or adding some additional video elements) in order to evade the automated tools. If copyright owners have to manually identify pirated content, it's realistically not cost effective to do so. The humans finding that content would cost more than the business loses in revenue to pirates.\n* Tracking down the actual human/ business behind the copyright infringement is often a fair amount of work and may involve motions in courts in multiple countries.

Who inherits Charlie's estate?\n\nI'm interested in the answer for Canada, but other countries would also be of interest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you have stated, Alice was born two hours prior to Bob. In a will, \"eldest\" or \"oldest\" typically is equated with \"first\\-born\" (see Daniel N. Mattarlin, \"[A Simple Legacy: 'To My Children'](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1967CanLIIDocs112)\" (1967\\) 12:3 McGill L.J. 240; Frederick Read, \"[The Legal Position of the Child of Unmarried Parents](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1931CanLIIDocs20)\" (1931\\) 9:9 Can. Bar Rev. 609; *An Act Relating to Wills, Legacies and Executors, and for the Distribution of the Estates of Intestates*, S.N.S. 1758, c. 11, s. XII). It often is a reflection of an intention to borrow from the ancient law of primogeniture (which is all about literal order of birth), rather than to refer to a person's legal age as defined by statutes and anniversaries. Between Alice and Bob, Alice is the first\\-born and therefore the oldest under that understanding.\n\nBut the question of *who inherits* depends on much more than the interpretation of this one word. For example, most (or all) provincial succession statutes give courts the power to rectify a will if the court determines that the will fails to carry out the will\\-maker's intentions. Evidence could be presented **about how the birthdays of the two were celebrated in relation to each other, who the will\\-maker understood to be the oldest (if they both existed when the will was made), etc**.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Charlie's will leaves his estate to his \"oldest living grandchild.\" At the time of Charlie's death, he has four grandchildren:\n\n1.

The documentation suggests that \"oldest\" in wills typically refers to \"first-born\" rather than legal age or calendar date. Alice was born at 1:00 AM Atlantic Time, which is 9:00 PM Pacific Time on March 7th. This makes her the first-born among the grandchildren in absolute time, even though Bob's birth date appears earlier on the calendar. The interpretation focuses on the actual order of birth rather than time zones or calendar dates.

The guarantee company insisted a second, computer generated full promissory note be signed. I assumed they would void the first. The list of banks representing the loans to be consolidated on the second note are in conflict with the list on the first note. I am not sure which list is accurate.\n\nIs either note valid and/or enforceable? The information is in conflict. Also, my signature is crossed out on the second, initialed and signed differently. I don't remember doing that and it's not on the copy I have. And lastly, both notes were printed years before the 1992 amendments so not all options for repayment are listed and the disclosure \"this is a loan which must be repaid\" is not present anywhere. I had read in the Colorado Student Loan Training Manual that duplicate notes are not enforceable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without reading the exact language of the documents it is hard to tell. Two possible interpretations of these documents are most plausible.\n\nOne interpretation is that the first note is the true promissory note and the second note is a written reaffirmation of the original promissory note which would extend the statute of limitations for enforcing it if there had not been regular payments, but does not create a new obligation or supersede the original note. But, it probably could be enforced if push came to shove, on some legal theory if the original first note was unavailable.\n\nA second interpretation is that the second note is a novation of the original note that replaces and supersedes the original note. Given the differences in the parties to the second note, I would be inclined to give this interpretation a greatly likelihood of being correct, but again, it would come down to the exact language of the documents.\n\nPromissory notes are tricky because they are \"negotiable instruments\" which means that the right to receive payment and enforce the note can be transferred to a new \"Note Holder\" by transferring the physical original note and endorsing the back.\n\nThe concern in the case of a promissory note is that someone with a photocopy could claim to be the Note Holder when in fact, the physical original has been negotiated to another person who is the true Note Holder to whom the obligation is now currently owed. If judgment were entered against the former Note Holder that might not prevent the true Note Holder from also getting a judgment against you, leaving you to try to vacate the judgment in favor of the former Note Holder and to seek restitution of any funds paid to the former Note Holder.\n\nThis could be prevented by insisting on an original note or by requiring the party bringing suit without an original note to post a bond to protect you in the event that the note was actually physically negotiated to someone else. The risk could be mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, if you were sued in a collection action, by joining all of the note holders listed on either note and their successors in interest, as third\\-party defendants.\n\nWhile I'm not aware of any significant litigation concerning who the Note Holder is in the case of student loans, there was quite a bit of litigation concerning the true Note Holder in the subprime mortgage loan context around the time of the Financial Crisis of 2008\\.\n\nThe modification of the signature, apparently without your authorization, is deeply problematic and might amount to fraud, but could be found by a court to be harmless because you admit to signing the original. Fraud in a matter that is immaterial is usually not actionable, although it could still constitute grounds to disbar an attorney if this action was authorized by an attorney.\n\nThe fact that neither of the notes complies with subsequently enacted legislation is irrelevant as you can't have an *ex post facto* law that *impairs obligations of contracts* under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn the meantime, don't throw out anything related to this loan or delete any files related to it.

The information provided suggests that when there are two promissory notes with differences in the parties involved, the second note is more likely to be interpreted as a novation that replaces and supersedes the original note.

While B-1 visas typically do not allow for compensation for work performed in the U.S., there is a specific exception for board members. According to the information provided, attending board meetings and performing functions of board membership, including receiving compensation, is a permissible activity under B-1 status.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA) H-1B visas are for specialized occupations and typically require full-time employment, which is not applicable for board members who attend periodic meetings.\n\nC) E-2 visas are for investors from treaty countries who are coming to the U.S. to develop and direct their own businesses, which doesn't apply to serving on an existing U.S. company's board.\n\nD) L-1 visas are for intracompany transferees and require the individual to have been employed by a related foreign company, which is not necessarily the case for board members.\n\nThe B-1 visa offers the flexibility needed for periodic visits to attend board meetings while allowing for the receipt of compensation, making it the most suitable option for this scenario."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58263/timing-of-the-death-of-a-president-elect", "docs_id": 58263, "title": "Timing of the death of a president-elect", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Section 3 of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States begins with this:\n\n> If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President.\n\nI am presuming at this point that no one is \"the President elect\" in the eyes of the Constitution until the electoral college votes in December. What would happen if Biden dies between now and the convening of the electoral college? If no states had laws against faithless electors, I would presume the electors could then freely decide. But there are such laws.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I am presuming at this point that no one is \"the President elect\" in the eyes of the Constitution until the electoral college votes in December.\n\nIn the [20th amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-20/), the beginning of the sentence is :\n\n> If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died...\n\nSo, that means January 20th, according to section 1 of the same amendment. At that time, not only have the electors already voted since at least a month, but Congress supposedly has certified the election of the dead guy and his running mate 14 days prior. That's the time when someone is or isn't president\\-elect in regards to this amendment.\n\nThat's for your first sentence. Now for the rest, and taking your example of the 2020 election, if Biden had died between November and December, the options available to the Electors in each state are different. Some will be able to vote for someone else than Biden for president, possibly someone named by the DCCC, but many Electors in different states will not have that option.\n\nThe way I see it, there's two options. Either there are no (or almost no) faithless Electors, then the Biden/Harris ticket gets certified on January 6th (what could possibly go wrong \ud83d\udc40), then pursuant to the 20th amendment Harris gets sworn in as the President on January 20th.\nOr, a lot of the Electors who can legally be faithless, get faithless, then the democratic electoral votes are split, no ticket gets to 270, which triggers a [contingent election](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/section-1/clause-3/) by the House of Reps (and the Senate selects the VP).

This is because:\n\n1. Many states have laws against faithless electors, which would prevent electors from voting for someone else.\n2. Voting for the deceased candidate would be the \"safest scenario for their party\" as it would allow the constitutional process to continue as planned.\n3.

May a company complain to the FCC that their business phone provider won't give them the information needed to port a number or they're overcharged for internet?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no legal significance to their use of the word \"consumer\" rather than \"customer\" or \"purchaser\", and nothing on [their website](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us) suggests a limit on who can file a complaint. Indeed, the [complaint form](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/article_attachments/360090262251/complaint_form.pdf) asks for \"Company Name (if applicable)\". There are no subject\\-matter restrictions on complaints though it is pointless to complain about something that isn't about a violation of FCC regulations. It *is* pointless to complain about internet service rates, because the FCC does not regulate those rates. I cannot determine if there is any FCC requirement that a provider must tell you how to port your number from one provider to another. However, you could file a complains, which the provider must reply to, and they would tell you something like \"We don't provide that information\". You could then escalate the matter to the status of a formal complaint (which costs money), and eventually you might get a full formal explanation that they are not required to tell you how to do it (unless they *are* required to, then they presumably will have told you before you got to this stage). The [FCC guide on porting numbers](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/porting-keeping-your-phone-number-when-you-change-providers) does not indicate whether the provider has to explain to you how to do it, but their guide is a good starting point.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner is dissatisfied with their current phone service provider due to high rates and difficulties in porting their business number.

The documentation clearly states that there is no restriction on who can file a complaint with the FCC, including businesses. The complaint form even has a field for \"Company Name\". However, it also mentions that complaining about internet service rates would be pointless as the FCC does not regulate these rates. The number porting issue, on the other hand, falls under FCC regulations, making it a valid complaint. Options A and C are incorrect because they wrongly assume businesses cannot file complaints.

Or is this basically a lost cause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Did you get a copy of the accident report from an officer on scene (the one time I've been a crash, I was given a slip of paper similar to a ticket with some basic info and the full report was available for request a few days later when in the system). For the insurance company it was enough just to get the case number on the ticket and they did the leg work. Consider yourself lucky it was only cosmetic. You can also reach out to the officer in the report OR the prosecutor's office. Although they might reach out to you, don't expect it, as they only need you to testify in court if a plea agreement isn't struck (90% of all criminal cases in the U.S. end in a plea bargin of some sorts.).\n\nEither way, it's prudent for your own records to get copies of the reports as well as the estimation for the repairs. As you said, it is cosmetic, so it's not like the repairs are necessary to the safe operation of the car (However, if you can clarify what the truck is used for, it might make a difference. It's one thing if it's your own pickup truck used for hauling stuff for weekend projects you have to fix up the house... it's another thing if it's a pickup truck you use to carry your equipment for your landscaping company, as the \"cosmetic\" damage impacts your proffessional image in that people will be less likely to contract with you, in addition to any custom paint job with contact information needing specialty repairs.\n\nSuing for damages will likely put this in small claims court, which is helpful as it's more friendly to pro se litigants and if you have all your above information in order, it should be sufficient to win (Civil courts do not need to meet \"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\" standards of evidence, but Preponderance of evidence (i.e. it's more likely that it happened one way vs. the other) which this should cover.). The down side is a lot of people who drink and drive are often not financially well off... and a lot of people who don't have insurance do so because they can't afford it... I'm not saying this is 100% of the case, but if she can't afford auto insurance, well, she's not likely to afford a $1800 repair job, oh, and she's likely going to do some jail time, as DUI with a collision normally carries jail time, and that's before the fact that she was driving without insurance (usually a fine). So she's going to be out a good chunk of cash from criminal cases. You don't have to wait for criminal proceedings to occur, but having the conviction as evidence helps a lot... but this means you have to wait for her to get out of jail to really begin to start the legal process of trying to collect.\n\nSure you can sue, but you still can't get blood from a stone (As Lawyers say, there may be a case, but it's not worth it if they can't even pay).\n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what you do, try and keep some perspective. As unlucky as it is that this happened to you, there are lots of DUI victims out there who would gladly give their first born son (or any child of your choosing, it's 2020\\) to come out of their experiene with only cosmetic damage that did not total a 14 year old vehicle.

Under laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US, platforms can operate legally if they:\n1. Respond promptly to takedown notices for infringing content\n2. Implement systems to prevent repeated infringement\n3. Make good faith efforts to prevent copyright violations\n\nThis approach, known as \"safe harbor,\" allows platforms to operate without being held directly liable for user-uploaded content, as long as they meet these conditions. It strikes a balance between enabling innovative business models and protecting copyright holders."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77737/is-mailchimp-compliant-with-gdpr", "docs_id": 77737, "title": "Is MailChimp compliant with GDPR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In light of recent news of Facebook not being compliant with GDPR because it processes data in USA and not in europe, would a website using MailChimp for newsletter be GDPR compliant since it is based in USA and holds the data there?\n\nTheir website claims that they are compliant with GDPR, but just looking at their cookie notice that has the full cookies preselected (and the selection is hidden) shows that isn't completely correct. But their website not being completely correct doesn't mean their service isn't, that's why I'm asking the question\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mailchimp as a company is probably mostly GDPR\\-compliant. But this doesn't mean that *using* the Mailchimp service would be compliant as well.\n\nThis is because the GDPR has different compliance obligations for \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cdata processors\u201d. The data controller is responsible for the compliance of all processing activities they determine the purposes and means for, regardless of whether those activities are actually outsourced. In contrast, the primary responsibility of a data processor is to only use the data as instructed by the controller, but not for the processor's own purposes.\n\nSo Mailchimp probably doesn't abuse its customer's data, and offers an Art 28 GDPR conformant data processing agreement as part of its contracts. Mailchimp also offers features that assist with related privacy laws, such as collecting proper consent as required by the EU ePrivacy Directive.\n\nAnd Mailchimp has a page about [European data transfers](https://mailchimp.com/help/mailchimp-european-data-transfers/). This is where it gets tricky. Not the Mailchimp service, but the customer is the data exporter / data controller and is responsible for compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR. The data controller must decide *themselves* whether the international transfer into the US is legal. Briefly, the GDPR allows the following grounds for an international transfer of personal data:\n\n* target country has an adequacy decision from the EU \u2013 no, because the EU\u2013US Privacy Shield was invalidated in the *Schrems II* ruling\n* Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) \u2013 maybe, see below discussion\n* Binding Corporate Rules \u2013 not applicable\n* exceptions, including explicit consent or only occasional transfers \u2013 not applicable\n\nThe Mailchimp guide about EU data transfers correctly states that the *Schrems II* decision only invalidated the Privacy Shield, and did not invalidate the concept of SCCs. That means it is still legal to use SCCs as a basis to transfer personal data in non\\-EU countries. But this doesn't imply that SCCs can serve as a basis for transferring personal data specifically to Mailchimp in the US \u2013 a case by case analysis is necessary that determines whether security of processing is guaranteed and whether data subjects would have effective legal remedies if their rights were breached.\n\nIt now happens that exactly the same reasons that caused the Privacy Shield to be invalid must also make us doubt whether SCCs can be valid in their place. The problem with transfers to the US never was the risk that the recipient would sell the personal data to the highest bidder, but that the US\\-based company is subject to US spy laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333 that do not provide effective legal remedies for foreign affected persons. (Mailchimp explicitly confirms that it is subject to those spy laws as an \u201celectronic communication service\u201d.)\n\nIn the wake of the *Schrems II* ruling the EDPB has published a document with recommendations for supplemental safeguards that could make SCCs permissible, but these recommendations (like end to end encryption, or only transferring pseudoymized data) cannot work for US\\-based cloud services such as Mailchimp. Some (such as the US government) have argued that *Schrems II* was based on outdated information, but this standpoint is not shared by European regulators.\n\nSo, the data controller \u2013 the Mailchimp customer \u2013 has to make their own judgement about this international transfer.\n\n* If SCCs combined with Mailchimp's supplemental measures provide sufficient safeguards, then the international transfer is legal and GDPR\\-compliant. Mailchimp offers all the necessary paperwork such as DPAs, SCCs, and so on.\n* If there are no sufficient safeguards, then the transfer is clearly illegal.\n\nMy personal opinion is that Mailchimp's supplemental measure fall far short of what would be required per the EDPB recommendations. Lower courts in the EU now routinely consider all transfers to the US as illegal. A company using Mailchimp was also an early target of a post\\-*Schrems II* enforcement action, though it wasn't fined since it immediately stopped using the service.\n\nSo while it's not possible to *definitely* say that using Mailchimp would be a GDPR\\-violation, it's very difficult to argue that such use could be compliant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A European company is considering using Mailchimp, a US-based email marketing service, for its newsletter. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the GDPR compliance situation?\n\nA) Using Mailchimp is automatically GDPR compliant because Mailchimp claims to be GDPR compliant on their website.\n\nB) The European company can use Mailchimp without any concerns as long as they sign Mailchimp's standard Data Processing Agreement.\n\nC) Using Mailchimp is likely not GDPR compliant due to concerns about data transfers to the US, despite Mailchimp's compliance efforts.\n\nD) The European company can ensure GDPR compliance by getting explicit consent from all newsletter subscribers to transfer their data to the US.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While Mailchimp has made efforts to be GDPR compliant, including offering Data Processing Agreements and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), the core issue lies with transferring data to the US. The Schrems II decision invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield, and the same concerns apply to SCCs. US companies like Mailchimp are subject to surveillance laws (e.g., FISA 702) that conflict with GDPR principles. The European company, as the data controller, must assess whether sufficient safeguards exist for the international transfer. Given current interpretations by EU regulators and courts, it's very difficult to argue that using a US-based service like Mailchimp could be fully GDPR compliant. Option A is incorrect because a company's claims don't guarantee compliance. Option B overlooks the international transfer issue. Option D is incorrect because explicit consent is generally not considered a valid basis for systematic transfers to the US under GDPR."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78442/what-is-considered-a-derivative-work", "docs_id": 78442, "title": "What is considered a derivative work?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: US Copyright law defines \"derivative work\":\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.

I'm not a native English speaker, and thought 'derivative' means 'inspired or motivated by something'...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Derivative Works under US law and the Berne Convention\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nUS Copyright law defines \"derivative work\" in [17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101) as:\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nArticle 2 of the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) reads, in relevant part:\n\n> (3\\) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.\n\nUnder [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) one of the things that a copyright owner has the exclusive right to do or authorize is:\n\n> (2\\) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\nNote that under the US definition, a derivative work is one **based on** an earlier work, not one that merely **refers to** a derivative work. Merely mentioning or citing a previous work is not enough to make the later work derivative. It must, in some substantial way, **use** and be developed out of the previous work.\n\nThe classic examples of a derivative work are: a translation into another language; an adaptation into another medium or form (such as making a novel into a play or film); and making a sequel. But derivative works can be derivative in various other ways.\n\nExamples from the Question\n--------------------------\n\nLet us look at the examples mentioned in the question:\n\n> * an academic paper that cites or refers to other papers\n\nThis is a mere reference and is not at all derivative. However a paper that contained little or no original content, but consisted almost entirely of such citations might be considered derivative.\n\n> * a discussion thread on Internet (or each comment or reply on it) about a work\n\nDiscussion or criticism of a work, or a reply to it, is not normally considered derivative. Such comments are not derivative of the work under discussion, nor of the previous comments. Quotations of either are likely to be permitted fair use, and so not infringing, although that will depend on the exact details of each case.\n\n> * a fanart or a fanfiction\n\nThis is likely to be a derivative work, depending on how much of the source work is used, and whether distinctive details are reproduced. Note that **ideas** cannot be protected by copyright. (See 17 USC 102(b) for this.) So the idea of a person who turns into an animal of a particular type, or has some special power or ability or characteristic is not protected by copyright. But the details expressed in the source work, such as the mannerisms or appearance of a character, or the specific nature of a setting, can be protected, and to draw on them may be infringement, unless fair use applies.\n\n> * metadata\n\n\"Metadata\" is a very general idea. Typically the kind of information included in metadata is not protected by copyright, but in some cases it may be.\n\n> * a review or a criticism\n\nA review, criticism of, or comment on an existing work is not normally considered a derivative work. Quotes used in a review or criticism are often protected by fair use under US law, but if the quotation is excessive, and particularly if it allows the review to serve as a replacement for the original and to harm the market for the original, it may be infringement.\n\n> * a work inspired by other works\n\nAgain, this depends. If only the general idea is imitated, then the later work is not derivative If detailed, distinctive, and specific characters, settings or plot lines are imitated, then the later work may be considered derivative, and infringing if permission is not obtained.\n\nThe *Nichols* Case\n------------------\n\nIn the case [*Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation*, 45 F. 2d 119 \\- Circuit Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit (1930\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064&q=Nichols+v.+Universal+Pictures+Corp.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) Judge Learned Hand, a famous judge, wrote a very influential and often cited opinion describing when two similar plays are, and when they are not, infringements of one another. It is worth reading to better understand this issue, even though it is over 90 years old.\n\nWhat makes a Work Derivative\n----------------------------\n\nSo in general a work is derivative when it uses significant, distinctive, and detailed elements of a previous work, or is a revised or altered version of the previous work.\n\nCopyright in a Derivative Work\n------------------------------\n\nIf a derivative work is made with proper permission, or the source work is out of copyright, the author of the derivative work has copyright in all the original parts of the derivative work. However if the derivative work is infringing, and was created without permission, the author has no valid copyright in it at all.\n\nFair Use and True Parody\n------------------------\n\nIf a work is held to be a ***fair use*** of the original, it is not infringing even if it is a derivative work, this is an ***exception to copyright*** in US law. It may still be important to note that the work is derivative, because the author has copyright only in the original aspects.\n\nIf a work is a ***parody***, it is likely to be held to be a fair use. Note that in copyright law a **true** parody is a work that comments on the source work by imitating or mocking it. A work that imitates a source work merely to be funny, or to comment on general social conditions, or to make some other point, but **not** to comment on the original, is not a parody in US copyright law. Courts often refer to such a work as a \"satire\", even though this is not the standard literary definition of \"satire\". A Satire will usually not be a fair use of the source, or if it is, it will be for other reasons.\n\n**Addition** (in response to an addition to the question)\n\n> * original work : poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\" by Alexander Pope(1688\\-1744\\)\n> * (potential) derivative work : film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" directed by Michel Gondry\n> \n> \n> The film's title is a quotation from the poem, and the quoted part is cited within the film. Does it make the film a \"derivative work\" of the poem?\n\nNo. First of all, any copyright on the poem has long expired, it is in the public domain.\n\nSecondly, merely referring to a previous work in the title and citing it in the body does not make the later work derivative, it is merely a ***literary reference***. A significant part of the earlier work would need to be used to make the film derivative. Unless much more was used than is mentioned above, this would not qualify even if the poem were still in copyright.\n\n### Meaning of \"Derivative\"\n\nLike many other words of the English language, the word \"derivative\" has several different senses. The sense leading to the definitions:\n\n> * imitative of the work of another person\n> * inspired or motivated by something\n\nis mostly used in the context of criticism and review of works of art or literature. In copyright law, \"derivative\" is a technical term, defined by the definition section of the law, and by previous court cases. It is not unrelated to the meaning from literary or art criticism, but it is specific and by no means the same. The word \"derivative\" also has other specialized meanings, for example in chemistry, and in mathematics.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered a derivative work under U.S. copyright law?\n\nA) A movie review that quotes several lines from the film being critiqued\nB) A sequel novel using characters and settings from an original book, written without the original author's permission\nC) An academic paper that cites and discusses theories from previously published research\nD) A comedy sketch that makes fun of current political events using a format similar to a popular TV show\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nB is the correct answer because a sequel novel using characters and settings from an original book, without permission, is a clear example of a derivative work as defined by U.S. copyright law.
