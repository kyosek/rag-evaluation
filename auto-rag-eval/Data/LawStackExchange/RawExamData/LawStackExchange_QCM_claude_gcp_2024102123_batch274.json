I perform contract programming work for companies overseas and access their IP to perform my services (bug fixes, feature adds, etc).\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% clear on the interpretation of a the following section.\n\n> **Purpose**. In furtherance of the purpose or purposes stated below, the Company may disclose its Confidential Information to Recipient.\n>  This Agreement is intended to bind Recipient and prevent it from\n>  disclosing the Confidential Information as herein provided or from\n>  using the Confidential Information for purposes other than considering\n>  whether to enter into a contractual business relationship, including\n>  but not limited to a potential investment transaction (the \u201cPermitted\n>  Purpose\u201d).\n\nUsually, the purpose is much wider than this. It'll include things like offering my services, or performing designated tasks. From my interpretation above, I'm only allowed to use their IP for \"considering whether to enter into a contractual business relationship\", which doesn't seem to fit the end goal of my services at all. If I sign this, I still don't have access to their IP to offer my services.\n\nThe \"including but not limited to a potential investment transaction\" doesn't seem to apply to me, because I'm not an investor. It seems like this NDA is more likely designed to be signed by potential investors than contractors.\n\nEspecially since later on in the contract,\n\n> Recipient further agrees not to use the Confidential Information\n>  provided to it by the Company for any purposes other than the\n>  Permitted Purpose.\n\nNaturally, I'm going to bring this up with the client before I sign, but I thought I'd also enquire here. My question is as follows:\n\nIs my interpretation of this wording correct, or is there scope within this wording that does allow for my services within the Permitted Purpose?\n\nIf it's relevant, this contract was supplied by a company based in California, USA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That wording is designed for the case where Recipient (potential contractor) considers but *does not* thereafter sign contract for the actual work.\n\nIf you decide to work for them, the contract for services will have its own non\\-disclosure provisions and the NDA will be superseded / not relevant anymore.",

The clause is restrictive and does not cover the actual performance of services. While the wording may be more appropriate for potential investors, it can still apply to contractors in the initial stages of engagement. However, if the contractor decides to work with the company, a separate contract for services with its own non-disclosure provisions would typically supersede this initial NDA."

The \"normal\" type of proof is the Bill of Sale. But most of the time, the Bill of Sale references a Purchase Agreement which most debt buyers don't want to show (because it usually contains numerous disclaimers that may hurt its case).\n\nBut if the Bill of Sale references a Purchase Agreement, then it is not complete without it, right? Is it true that if the defendant asks, the debt buyer has to produce the Purchase Agreement as a matter of law, because of this fact, or else lose the probative value of the Bill of Sale?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A document does not have to include every document that it incorporates by reference to be used in court. The lack of a complete set of documents goes to the weight of the evidence, and not to admissibility of the evidence or its ability to establish a *prima facie* case of liability.\n\nBut, a party to a lawsuit has means that a very straightforward and routinely used to obtain these documents and to use them in their own case, though mandatory disclosures of documents, through \"discovery\", or through subpoenas of documents. If the party sued has a copy of the document incorporated by reference, that can also be used.\n\nIndeed, a document incorporated by reference in a document that forms the basis for a lawsuit can usually be submitted in a \"motion to dismiss\" a claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, even though the usual rule is that only materials provided in the original legal complaint can be considered in this \"so what?\" motion which asks, \"if everything alleged in the complaint is true, is there still no basis to hold me liable?\"\n\nFor what it is worth, the Purchase and Sale agreement would normally create the debt and the Bill of Sale would merely evidence performance of the contract, in most cases. But that doesn't detract from the general nature of the question.\n\nIndeed, except for a handful of cases where the physical document is the evidence of the debt (like a \"live\" negotiable promissory note), the claim can be proven with sworn testimony in the absence of any documents at all, sometimes with evidence that there was a signed writing establishing the existence of the obligation even if it is no longer physically available.",

The debt buyer presents a Bill of Sale as evidence of ownership, which references a Purchase Agreement. The defendant requests to see the Purchase Agreement, but the debt buyer refuses to produce it. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The Bill of Sale is inadmissible as evidence without the accompanying Purchase Agreement.\n\nB) The debt buyer must produce the Purchase Agreement or automatically lose the case.\n\nC) The Bill of Sale remains admissible, but its probative value may be reduced without the Purchase Agreement.\n\nD) The defendant has no right to request the Purchase Agreement if it's not explicitly mentioned in the complaint.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, a document (in this case, the Bill of Sale) does not have to include every document it references to be used in court. The absence of the Purchase Agreement does not make the Bill of Sale inadmissible, but it may affect the weight of the evidence. This aligns with the statement that \"The lack of a complete set of documents goes to the weight of the evidence, and not to admissibility of the evidence or its ability to establish a prima facie case of liability.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Bill of Sale can still be admissible without the Purchase Agreement.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the defendant can request the Purchase Agreement through various legal means (like discovery or subpoenas), the debt buyer's refusal to produce it doesn't automatically result in losing the case.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the defendant has the right to request relevant documents through proper legal channels, regardless of whether they're explicitly mentioned in the complaint."

A snapshot of the website 2 weeks ago on waybackmachine.com shows no copyright logo or Terms of Service anywhere on the page saying it's copyrighted. The developer of the game found out about my mod and tweeted that he would get it shut down. The developer has since put up a Terms of Service on the game's website that says all works are copyrighted and modifying the game is illegal. He then contacted google and got my mod taken down and I received a copyright strike on the chrome extensions store. \n\nI don't really care about the mod anymore but can I get into legal trouble for this?\n\nEdit: I should also add that the mod I made was free and the game is also free to play.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The web\\-browser game was copyrighted the moment it was created by the individual. It did not need a copyright notice to be copyrighted, or a TOS to inform you of copyright. The individual was fully within the law to claim infringement and demand you stop disturbing your mod as an unauthorized change to their game. They should have had a TOS up when they started distributing the game, but that's their choice.\n\nThe developer could \\- or have their attorney \\- send their own legal \"takedown notice\" of infringement directly to you rather than Tweet about it or approach Google.\n\nGoogle's takedown and your \"copyright strike\" is different than your original copyright violation and involves Google's TOS \\- [Google Chrome Web Store Developer Agreement \\| Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/terms) \\- regarding copyright violations of apps and code under distribution. By your use of the store, Google reserves the right to remove your extensions when there are\n\n> ...violations of intellectual property rights, including patent,\n>  copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right of any\n>  party,...\n\nAnd, the original game being free and your mod being free rarely matters in copyright law and in cases of infringement. That's something a court would decide on the case and in looking at precedent(s).\n\n> *...can I get into legal trouble for this?*\n\nYou could be sued by the maker of the game in civil court; that's up to them. Google's recourse is to simply remove the mod from the store and possibly restrict your use of their service(s), according to their TOS.\n\nFor more background, see the Law SE Meta post [I have a question about copyright.

Copyright protection exists from the moment a work is created, regardless of whether there is a visible copyright notice or Terms of Service. The game developer owns the copyright to their game and has the right to pursue legal action against unauthorized modifications, even if both the original game and the mod were free. The absence of a copyright notice or Terms of Service at the time of mod creation does not negate the developer's rights. While the mod creator did receive a copyright strike on the Chrome Web Store, this is separate from potential legal action the game developer could take for copyright infringement. The fact that both the game and mod were free does not exempt the mod creator from copyright laws."

As a hobby, and in my free time, I began learning software development.\n\nTo learn, I began creating a small tool that I could use at work to assist with my duties there. However, its usefulness soon caught the eye of coworkers who also wanted to use it.\n\nLong story short, my application is now being used in multiple departments, with myself still as the sole developer. It has continued to grow and I now have leadership making specific requests for additional changes to be made to the software.\n\nThe majority of the early work on the software was done at home, on my own time.

I am now working on it nearly full time at the request of my managers.\n\nMy question is this: What are my legal rights to this software? Would I be able to sell it? Or deny its use to my company? There have been no contracts signed at all, no change in my salary, and no offers to pay for the work I've done on it (and no, I do not make a developer's salary; I actually make a relatively low salary\\-grade).\n\nDid I lose all of my legal rights or bargaining power the moment I brought it to work and used company time to work on it?\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll assume you are salaried full time exempt in the U.S. in an at\\-will, right\\-to\\-work state and are covered by a standard \"employee handbook\".\n\nThis has been developed by you, employee, to assist in doing your job, employment, for your company, employer, using time, materials and information belonging at least partially to your employer.

Your best bet is to support it like crazy, make it a big deal and ride it as high as it will take you in the company. Ask for a raise, ask for a promotion, get references and put it as an accomplishment on your resume.\n\nBut you can't sell it or take it away from your employer. That ship has sailed.

Once the employee brought the software to work, used company time and resources to develop it further, and accepted management directives to work on it as part of their job, the software became company property. Even though the initial development was done on personal time, the subsequent integration into the workplace, use of company resources, and continued development under company direction effectively transfers ownership to the employer.

Would the assassinations be considered a violation of Geneva Convention and/or other international laws due to targeting non\\-combatant civilians, or are assassinations in that context considered a normal/expected part of a civil war? What factors go into determining whether or not killing targeted non\\-combatants is considered a war crime?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **What factors go into determining whether or not killing targeted non\\-combatants is considered a war crime?** The cynical answer is \"it depends on who wins and who judges\".\n\nThere are various definitions of what constitutes a civilian, all of which are \"negative definitions\" (i.e. Not a member of an armed force(e.g. an army, navy, etc; actually wielding arms is not required) or \"involved in hostilities\", meaning not a partisan, insurgent, or other form of \"belligerent\"). Civilians should not be targeted by military actions under international law.\n\nOn the other hand, **spies**, especially those who's activities cause death, are explicitly not soldiers entitled to Prisoner\\-of\\-War status, and can be executed. There are some protections provided for spies, but those generally seem to be geared towards soldiers captured during \"non spy\" activities with regards to past actions as spies, as opposed to \"in the field\" spies...and it is unclear to me what that means for an \"informant\" who presumably gathers intelligence in their day\\-to\\-day activities.\n\nTo what extent an informant is a \"spy\" is unclear. Espionage consists of the access, generally on behalf of a state (or belligerent party), to information that is held by another and considered as confidential or strategic, in the military, security, or economic field. Identities of personnel is very much confidential and strategic information, so passing that information to the government seems to qualify as espionage. Whether or not this equates to being \"involved in hostilities\" is unclear.\n\nThe case could certainly be made that an informant, especially one who does not go out of their way to gather intelligence or receive compensation is a civilian. Likewise, the case could certainly be made that they are a *de facto* belligerent, being no different in their effective activities than a formal intelligence operative or artillery coordinates finder.

While civilians are generally protected from targeting, informants who pass strategic information (such as identities of personnel) to a belligerent party may be engaging in activities that could be considered espionage. However, unlike formal military spies, their status is less clear-cut, especially if they don't receive compensation or go out of their way to gather intelligence. The answer reflects this ambiguity, noting that their status could be interpreted differently based on specific circumstances and how laws are applied. Options A and D are too absolute in their claims, while B incorrectly equates civilian informants with formal military spies, which is not necessarily accurate in all cases."

Bob will comply with the (DMCA) takedown request.\n\nPS Define \"safe enough\": The goal is the avoid any legal issues after complying with the (DMCA) takedown request.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nAs a practical matter, the strategy you suggest is widely used, and the vast majority of the time, it does not result in copyright disputes. It isn't 100% risk free, however.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nAll of the questions in this answer are governed entirely by federal law. Both basic copyright law, found in Title 17 of the United States Code, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (which amended Title 17 of the United States Code in part, and also added 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001 related to movie licensing) are federal statutes that do not have parallel state law counterparts.\n\nCopyright cases are in the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts when they arise in the United States. *See* 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (\"\\[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to ... copyrights .... Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in ... copyright cases.\").\n\n### This isn't a DMCA case\n\nThis strategy doesn't really utilize Section 230 of the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) (DMCA), however, which protects online hosts of sites from liability for user generated content, if the host honors DMCA takedown notices (subject to an exception for human trafficking content). DMCA takedown notices aren't strictly speaking applicable in this fact pattern.\n\nWhen Bob is the website's author, his content isn't user generated content from which he is protected from liability by Section 230\\. His Internet Service Provider is protected from liability for his content, but Bob isn't protected from liability for his content, because he isn't a third\\-party user of his own website.\n\n### The Basic Copyright Law Analysis\n\nOnce you understand that nuance that this isn't a DMCA question, the question collapses into a simple copyright infringement issue.\n\nThe bottom line in this copyright analysis is that if you take a snipper of material from a copyrighted source and link to the source copyrighted material, are you not likely to face copyright liability.\n\n**Links Are Basically Liability Risk Free**\n\nThe link itself, pretty much categorically, and without lots of additional relevant facts (basically some sort of conspiracy behind the scenes that can't be discerned from looking at the work itself), [will never give rise to copyright infringement liability](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/linking-copyrighted-materials).\n\n**Snippets Are Copyright Infringements That Fair Use Usually Excuses**\n\nSo, the remaining issue is whether a snippet of a copyrighted work flagged for educational purposes, creates risk of copyright infringement liability.\n\nThere is always some risk any time you publish a copy, no matter how small, of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nThe snippet is undeniably a publication of a copy of copyrighted work (by virtue of the premise of the question). This is a prima facie case of copyright infringement and your inclusion of a link to the source makes it fairly likely that your publication of this copy will be discovered by the copyright owner. So, this is a copyright infringement that gives rise to copyright liability unless this liability for copyright infringement can be overcome or excused by [the affirmative defense to copyright liability of fair use](https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use).\n\nThe risk that the snippet will not be considered fair use, and therefore will be found to be a copyright infringement giving rise to copyright liability is relatively higher if the snippet is a photograph or a sound recording than it is if it is merely quoted words from the source.\n\nBut, usually, a reasonably small snippet of a copyrighted work published for educational purposes will come within the fair use defense, even though that really needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\n### Practical Context And Analysis\n\nThe fact that this mode of expression, with a snipped and a link on a blog for educational purposes is pervasive on the Internet, as a practical matter, means that generally speaking, this will be considered fair use.\n\nUsually, this strategy will prevent someone who uses it from facing litigation for copyright infringement, even though, in theory, the determination is highly fact and context specific.\n\nIt isn't a guarantee of no liability, but it is low risk.\n\nMost marginal cases where someone arguably slightly exceeds fair use are resolved with a cease and desist letter (with which Bob should comply even if he thinks his use is fair use), rather than litigation.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of Bob's actions?\n\nA) Bob is fully protected by Section 230 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and cannot be held liable for copyright infringement.\n\nB) Bob's use of snippets and links is completely risk-free and can never be considered copyright infringement.\n\nC) Bob's actions carry some risk of copyright infringement, but are likely to be considered fair use in most cases.\n\nD) Bob will definitely face copyright infringement charges for using any portion of copyrighted material without explicit permission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because Section 230 of the DMCA protects online hosts from liability for user-generated content, not content created by the website owner themselves. \n\nOption B is overly optimistic. While linking itself is generally safe, using snippets of copyrighted material does carry some risk, even if it's usually low.\n\nOption C is correct. Bob's use of small snippets for educational purposes on a blog, along with links to the original source, carries some risk of copyright infringement. However, such use is likely to be considered fair use in most cases, especially given how common this practice is on the internet. It's not entirely risk-free, but it's generally low-risk.\n\nOption D is too extreme. While there is always some risk when using copyrighted material without permission, Bob's use of small snippets for educational purposes is unlikely to result in definite copyright infringement charges, especially if he complies with any takedown requests."

I have found some research that suggests it may be ok:\n\n* The NMPA [National Music Publishers Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Music_Publishers_Association) seem to enforce artist copyright rights.\n* It appears Youtube have an agreement with NPMA to royalty share [link](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/17/idUS115394738920110817)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to answer your question we have to parse out an exact meaning for the individual fragments of the question: \"Teach someone to play a copyrighted song\"\n\n* What do we mean by \"teach someone\" here?\n\nYouTube is a public medium unless you're using some unlisted videos or have some kind of external website where you are using YouTube strictly as a video hosting service. There is no one\\-on\\-one teacher\\-to\\-student interaction here outside of the possibility of some post\\-facto comments about the video.\n\nIs it more apt to say \"publish an educational demonstration for ad revenue\" for this part of your question?\n\n* Now we can evaluate the second part of your question, \"\\[Teach someone] to play a copyrighted song on guitar?\"\n\nAre you teaching guitarists what the notes of the song (the score) are or are you teaching them specific guitar techniques?\n\nIn complaints responsible for taking guitar tablature sites offline NMPA President David Israelite asserted that \"\\[u]nauthorised use of lyrics and tablature deprives the songwriter of the ability to make a living and is no different than stealing.\" [(Song sites face legal crackdown, BBC News)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4508158.stm)\n\nWhile you are adding your own educational value by demonstrating specific instructional techniques you are also putting the songwriter's score out in a published and public format outside of their control and earning ad revenue in the process.\n\n---\n\nThe 2011 NMPA royalty sharing agreement you linked to was just one settlement as part of ongoing litigation between the groups\u2014with the most recent being a large settlement related to revenues related to \"cover songs\". In no way does the existence of such a settlement mean that you aren't still expected to obtain permission or seek agreeable revenue sharing terms for use of any material.\n\nGuitar instructors have been getting paid to teach their students to play copyrighted songs on guitar for decades but the difference here is that you are seeking to publish videos of yourself playing the artists' content and getting paid for people to watch them.\n\n*Opinion:* While I've learned a lot from these types of instructional videos myself and would love to make a \"fair use\" argument for you here I think it would still require you to make an effort in good faith to seek permission to use an artist's content. For artists within the mainstream music industry this may be practically impossible for you as an individual to negotiate but you could have luck with more progressive artists who are working on the digital frontiers outside of the industry.",

The documentation suggests that while instructional videos may add educational value, they still involve publishing the songwriter's score in a public format and earning revenue from it. This likely requires permission or a revenue-sharing agreement with the copyright holder. The information provided indicates that the NMPA has taken action against unauthorized use of lyrics and tablature, considering it equivalent to stealing. The 2011 agreement mentioned doesn't provide blanket protection for all content creators. Additionally, the documentation distinguishes between in-person instruction and publishing videos online for revenue, suggesting they are treated differently under copyright law."

See [*Housen v. Nikolaisen*, 2002 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1972/index.do):\n\n> On a pure question of law, the basic rule with respect to the review of a trial judge\u2019s findings is that an appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the trial judge with its own. Thus the standard of review on a question of law is that of correctness ...\n> \n> \n> There are at least two underlying reasons for employing a correctness standard to matters of law. First, the principle of universality requires appellate courts to ensure that the same legal rules are applied in similar situations. ...\n\nIt is not open to the lower court to come to a conclusion that is different from that which the appellate court declares to be the correct one on a question of law. Even if lower court's interpretation would be one \"open to a reasonable person,\" it will be overturned if it does not match that of the appellate court.\n\n### Questions of law are reviewed on a lower standard (*reasonableness*) in judicial reviews of administrative decisions\n\nThe alternative standard, *reasonableness*, is applicable in the judicial review many administrative tribunals and agencies, even on questions of law. That is unless the statutory scheme invites more strict review by courts or if it is a constitutional question or a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or relate to jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies, in which case, the administrative decision\\-maker's interpretation of law *will* still be reviewed on a *correctness* standard. See [*Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov*, 2019 SCC 65](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18078/index.do).\n\nBut even in this regime of judicial review, a decision will not be upheld simply because it was *open to a reasonable person* to come to the decision. The review looks like this:\n\n> A reviewing court must develop an understanding of the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process in order to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. To make this determination, the reviewing court asks **whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision**\n\nThis is significantly more robust that merely inquiring whether the outcome was open to a reasonable person.\n\n> a court conducting a reasonableness review properly considers both the outcome of the decision and the reasoning process that led to that outcome was recently reaffirmed in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, \\[2018] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 12\\. In that case, although the outcome of the decision at issue may not have been unreasonable in the circumstances, the decision was set aside because the outcome had been arrived at on the basis of an unreasonable chain of analysis.",

This means the appellate court is free to replace the lower court's opinion with its own. The reasonableness standard (A) is incorrect as it applies mainly to judicial reviews of administrative decisions, not to court appeals on questions of law.

State of Virginia, the Supreme Court struck down state laws forbidding interracial marriage (I think there may have been 22 states with such laws). The couple had married in the District of Columbia.\n\nWould the state have refrained from prosecuting them if they had married in a state whose laws allowed interracial marriage, because of the full\\-faith\\-and\\-credit clause in the Constitution? Generally, what degree of \"faith and credit\" does D.C. get? And did that bear upon the Loving case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the Wikipedia article [Full Faith and Credit Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Faith_and_Credit_Clause) in specific regard to marriage, it is said that:\n\n> Until the Supreme Court struck down all laws banning interracial marriage in 1967, a number of states banned interracial marriage and did not recognize marriage certificates issued in other states for interracial couples. The full faith and credit clause was never used to force a state to recognize a marriage it did not wish to recognize.\\[16] However, the existence of a common\\-law marriage in a sister state (still available in nine states and the District of Columbia) has been recognized in divorce or dissolution of marriage cases.\n\nThis seems to imply that DC was treated as if it was a state, but FF\\&C was not used to restrict Virginia and other states with similar laws.\n\nIn regard to the public policy limitations of the FF\\&C clause, the same article, quoting *Pacific Employers Insurance v. Industrial Accident* says: \n\n> \\[T]here are some limitations upon the extent to which a state may be required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce even the judgment of another state in contravention of its own statutes or policy. See *Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co*., 127 U.S. 265; *Huntington v. Attrill*, 146 U.S. 657; *Finney v. Guy*, 189 U.S. 335; see also *Clarke v. Clarke*, 178 U.S. 186; *Olmsted v. Olmsted*, 216 U.S. 386; *Hood v. McGehee*, 237 U.S. 611; cf. *Gasquet v. Fenner*, 247 U.S. 16\\. And in the case of statutes...the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events\n\nI have not been able to find a reported case where the FF\\&C clause was used to give effect to a DC judgment or law, but I did find [*Rollins v. Rollins* 602 A.2d 1121 (1992\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/district-of-columbia/court-of-appeals/1992/91-41-4.html) where DC was required to extend FF\\&C to a Maryland judgment, although in this case the decision was that the judgment was not final and so did not apply.\n\nBased on all this, I do not think the *Loving* case would have been substantially different had the marring occurred in another state, say New York, that permitted such marriages at the time. The Virginia statute at issue in the case certainly seemed aimed at such situations.",

Virginia decision.\n\nB) If the Lovings had married in a state that allowed interracial marriage instead of D.C., Virginia would have been constitutionally obligated to recognize their marriage under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n\nC) The Full Faith and Credit Clause generally requires states to give equal treatment to D.C. laws and judgments as they would to those of other states, without exception.\n\nD) The Supreme Court's ruling in Pacific Employers Insurance v. Industrial Accident suggests that states have some discretion in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause when it conflicts with their own public policy or statutes.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because the Pacific Employers Insurance v. Industrial Accident case, as cited in the passage, explicitly states that there are limitations to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, especially when it conflicts with a state's own statutes or policy. This aligns with the historical treatment of interracial marriage laws prior to Loving v. Virginia.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage clearly states that the Full Faith and Credit Clause was never used to force states to recognize interracial marriages they didn't wish to recognize.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the information provided suggests that Virginia and other states with similar laws did not recognize interracial marriages performed in other jurisdictions, regardless of where they were performed.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while D.C. is often treated similarly to a state in many legal contexts, the passage does not support the idea that the Full Faith and Credit Clause applies without exception, especially in cases of conflicting public policies."

The IRC service provider/operator would be the data controller and would be held ultimately responsible for the data stored/processed through the IRC service, including backups and logs kept etc, and this would mean any sub\\-processors they select (such as hosting provider) would also have to be GDPR compliant. Due to the nature of IRC chats being entirely public in the same way forum board posts and comments are public, the contract terms between the IRC service provider and the IRC users would need to be very clear that this is the case, and the IRC users would need to give consent for this processing (this is more complicated for children, see Article 8 regarding consent from the holder of parental responsibility).\n\n**For IRC users (personal use):** If you wish to keep the chat records for personal use only (i.e. not in connection with a business or your employment at a business), then an exemption applies:\n\n> 2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data: ...\n> \n> \n> (c) by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity; ...\n> \n> \n> ([GDPR](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679), Article 2: Material Scope, Paragraph 2(c), p.32\\)\n\n**For IRC users (commercial/business use):** In this case I don't think you would have any legal basis to store/process these chats/logs if they contain personal data without a legal agreement with the data controller which would require you to put in place the same protections they have to under GDPR but then allow your business to access the data for specific purposes. While the information may be published or considered to be in the 'public domain', for you to take a copy of it without permission and use it for a purpose they haven't consented to would not be allowed under GDPR. Additionally, to go through the process of removing personal data from the chats/logs would in itself be considered 'processing' under GDPR and therefore would be unauthorised without a legal agreement with the data controller. Practically therefore, your best options under this circumstance would be if:\n\n1. The IRC service provider implemented a 'favourites' feature to save within their own system the chat conversations you wish to retain and refer back to in future. Since they hold the data and you already have a user agreement with them there is no further complications (this is probably the best option);\n2. The IRC service provider implemented a feature to download an *anonymized* copy of a chat conversation (not ideal as there are no guaruntees a user will not include personal data in their messages, though the user agreement could state that message content will be considered to exclude personal data, in a similar way to how StackExchange do for this website, see the paragraph titled \"Information You Choose to Display Publicly on the Network\" on the [StackExchange Privacy Policy](https://stackexchange.com/legal/privacy-policy)).\n3. Your business considered an alternative communications solution, such as hosting its own real\\-time chat system or forum boards system, in which case your business would be the data controller, and while subject to GDPR you could then define the purposes for which the data will be used in your own user agreement.",

Which of the following approaches would be most compliant with GDPR regulations?\n\nA) Download and store all chat logs, including usernames, as they are publicly available.\nB) Download chat logs but remove all usernames before storing them.\nC) Only store chat logs if Twitch implements a feature to download anonymized versions.\nD) Keep personal notes of important points from chats without storing full logs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is not GDPR compliant as it involves storing personal data (usernames) without proper consent or legal basis.\nOption B still involves processing personal data without authorization, which is not allowed under GDPR.\nOption C could be compliant if implemented by Twitch, but it's not currently available and may still pose risks if personal information is shared in message content.\nOption D is the most GDPR-compliant approach. By keeping personal notes for business use without storing full logs or personal data, the business owner avoids unauthorized processing of personal data while still being able to reference important information. This falls under the \"personal use\" exemption of GDPR, as long as the notes don't include identifiable personal data of other users."

The poll has a 100% coverage (every american is interviewed and every american responds). The poll asks the intervieweds \"is a red squirrel an endangered species?\". Everybody responds \"no\". I hope that, by this expedient, I have fixed the *original* public meaning of the statute.\n\nThe 2nd of January 2020 (20 years later), another poll is conducted. Same question, 100% coverage, everybody now responds \"yes\". The public meaning has changed (right?).\n\nIn fact, there are now very few red squirrels: in the past 20 years, the meat of the red squirrel was found to be very tasty, or the fur very fashion, and so on. In particular, there are 2 red squirrels in all the USA, one male and one female, so we are still in time to save the species.\n\n1. The 3rd of January 2020 I kill one of the two red squirrels remaining. Will I go to jail for 20 years?\n\nIf the answer to (1\\) is \"no\", I am satisfied. Thank you.\n\nIf the answer to (1\\) is \"yes\" (I will go to jail), I have a follow\\-up question.\n\n2. a. Suppose, for the sake of the argument, that on the 15th of December 1791 (the day the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted), nobody thought the death penalty was cruel and unusual. This is what [Justice Scalia thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvttIukZEtM) (at 14:27\\).\n\nb. In the law enacted the 2nd of January 2000 (the one about the endangered species), the punishment for killing an endangered species is death.\n\nc. In the 2nd of January 2020 poll (20 years later), after the question \"Is a red squirrel an endangered species?\" (which everybody answer with a \"yes\"), there is the question \"is the death penalty cruel and unusual?\" to which everybody responds \"yes\".\n\nd. The 3rd of January 2020 I kill a red squirrel. Will I be subject to the death penalty?\n\nWith an originalist perspective, you should answer 2d with a \"yes\". It doesn't matter that the public meaning has changed, you need a formal amendment to the Constitution. Then, why you answered \"yes\" to question 1? Why it did matter in question 1 that the public meaning has changed?\n\nSorry if I make confusion.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What is an \"endangered species\"?\n--------------------------------\n\nNormally, this would be defined in the law. In fact, the *actual* [Endangered Species Act](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-4.html) does exactly that:\n\n> DEFINITIONS\n> \n> \n> SEC. 4\\. (a) GENERAL.\n> \n> \n> (1\\) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of ...\n\nSo, it's very clear for the purposes of this Act what an \"endangered species\" is. Red squirrels are an endangered species and you are going to jail if at the time you killed one the secretary of the Environment Department had determined they were and had promulgated that decision as required by the act.\n\nHowever, that just begs the question ...\n----------------------------------------\n\nLet's assume the Act did not define \"endangered species\". It doesn't have to. So what happens?\n\nWhen you go to trial, the judge will determine what \"endangered species\" means and whether red squirrels fit within the definition.\n\nIf you are not the first person tried under the act, then there will be a precedent that the judge will either be required to follow (if it's from a court higher in the hierarchy) or is likely to follow (if it's at the same level or lower in the hierarchy or in a parallel hierarchy).\n\nIf you are the first person, then they will probably start with a dictionary. Merriam Webster is a solid US based dictionary and it [says](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endangered%20species):\n\n> a species threatened with extinction\n\nThe lawyers for both sides will introduce evidence as to what that means and if it does or doesn't include red squirrels. The polls will be inadmissible because opinions aren't allowed as evidence unless they come from an expert. So your trial is likely to see a bunch of zoologists, ecologists, climatologists, etc. giving their opinion on what endangered species are and if red squirrels are one.\n\nIt is possible that on a case decided at a given time, red squirrels are no endangered under the accepted definition and that another time, they are endangered.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My name was missed in several patents issued by a Company with whom I was in the past. I contacted a very experienced Attorney in Employer\\-Employee Relations for an advice. His belief was that I cannot do anything if the Company does not want to add my name as an Author of a patent owned by The Company. However, this is a matter of Authorship but not a matter of Ownership. In Authorship it is only the Person (the Author) who matter. A Company may own the Patent but they do not own the persons names. \n\nI gave the Attorney the following example: I own a Mercedes car and in my garage I replaced all the car signs of Mercedes with those of GM. I can do that because I own the car, but I cannot drive such a car on the street \\- It is illegal to change the Authorship (in that case Mercedes). He said \"Very interesting example \\- I have not thought about such situation\" but he remained firm on the belief that I cannot do anything to protect my name as an Author if the patent is owned by a Company, and the Company does not want to include my name regardless that the key idea of the patent is mine. \n\nIn other words, I think it is illegal to ignore an Author of a patent, and it is a personal care of the missing Author in the list this to be corrected. It is not a Company care. I believe that a Person do not need an agreement by the Company to file a claim for Patent Authorship and support his claim with enough evidences.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You will want to speak with a patent attorney, not a labor attorney. Some of the facts you are presenting are entirely wrong.\n\nPatents have inventors, copyrights have authors. Inventorship has strict rules.\n\nInventorship cannot be denied without consequence in almost any jurisdiction, but you'll need to get local legal advice. In the US, \"A patent is invalid unless it lists the first and true inventor or inventors of the claimed invention.\" (See Stark v. Advanced Magnetics, 119 F.3d 1551, 1553, 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1997\\); 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(f) (\u201cA person shall be entitled to a\npatent unless . . . he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be patented). See also 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111, 115\\-16, 256\\.) \n\n*Assignment*\\-\\-the \"ownership\" of the patent\\-\\-is different. It's very common to have you sign an agreement as a condition of your employment that you grant full assignment to your company for any patentable material created under their employ. If you did not, it is possible that the company would need to give you consideration for the right to assignment, e.g., they would have to pay you something to own the patent. If you are no longer there, that \"something\" can be substantial, because the patent is invalid without it, and they have little leverage over you.\n\nBring all written records, emails, etc. to a licensed attorney who specializes in patent litigation.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employee's rights and potential recourse?\n\nA) The employee has no legal recourse if the company owns the patent and refuses to add their name as an inventor.\n\nB) The employee should consult with an attorney specializing in employer-employee relations to resolve the issue.\n\nC) The employee can unilaterally add their name to the patent without the company's permission, as authorship is separate from ownership.\n\nD) The employee should consult with a patent attorney, as omitting a true inventor can potentially invalidate the patent.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation clearly states that patents have inventors, not authors, and inventorship has strict rules. Omitting a true inventor can potentially invalidate a patent, as stated in the US legal precedent cited. The employee should consult with a patent attorney, not a labor attorney, to address this issue. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the company cannot legally deny inventorship without consequences. Option B is incorrect because an employer-employee relations attorney may not have the specific expertise needed for patent disputes.

One then receives the documentation and there is an additional clause that was not mentioned that invalidates the insurance. Is this clause valid?\n\nThe story that prompts this question is real, but I am not asking for advice as I have solved the problem with communication. I just wonder what would have happened had I said nothing.\n\nI just phoned my insurance company to arrange my car insurance for next year. We went through all the details and I was about to accept the offer when I mentioned that my brother was visiting from the US. At that point the salesperson informed me that the insurance would not cover my brother, as they must be resident in the UK. At no point prior to this had they mentioned such a requirement. I therefore declined their offer. I have done this many times before an it has not been an issue. However had I not mentioned this I would have accepted the offer. They may well have sent me a verbose contract with that term in there, but I may not have read it and my brother would have driven the car assuming they were insured.\n\nIf this had occurred would my brother have been insured?\n\nFrom answers it seems it may be relevant how frequent such a clause is. I have two old car insurance contracts and neither mention such a residence requirement. I have found many more \"Certificate of Insurance\" with my brother as a named driver and they make no mention of the requirement. It is those that must be shown to the police on request to prove one has insurance. [I have found a policy document online that does not appear to mention such a requirement](https://assets.wearemarmalade.co.uk/shared/assets/files/privatecar/Classic-PolicyWording.pdf).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In any sane jurisdiction, the clause would hold.\n\nBy and large, the legal fiction is that one has read and agreed to execute the entirety of the contracts they signed. If it was otherwise, no contract of substantial length would ever be enforceable upon individuals; yet such contracts are routinely offered and enforced (look at the terms\\&conditions of any internet website that sells stuff).\n\nIt is absolutely normal that a phone sale would gloss other minor details of the contract, and implicitly refer to the written text for the finer points. If the specific point had been raised in the phone call, and the salesperson erroneously told you X when in fact the contract read Y, you might have a case, but even then it is not necessarily a strong one (you signed the contract *after* having called; you might have changed your mind when reading the actual text, and you paying the insurance monthly bill is evidence that you agreed with the contract as\\-formed).\n\nThere are some exceptions to that general principle:\n\n1. **General conditions of validity of a contract.** For instance, in [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), a contract must have a [\"definite and legitimate content\"](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032040911). If we sign a contract for \"a few apples against a few euros\", and then I give you five apples, you owe me zero euros because the contract was not specific enough to be enforceable. If the whole contract is unenforceable, the clause falls with it.\n2. **General conditions of a validity of a clause.** Specific clauses can be invalidated without bringing down the whole contract (for instance, \"in case X fails to perform their obligations under clause 70Z, Y is allowed to take a pound of flesh from X\").\n3. **Specific conditions on certain clauses.** Consumer laws in some jurisdictions make certain clauses of certain contracts either invalid entirely, or only valid if they were read aloud to the prospective buyer, or only valid in certain forms. (For instance, in France, a sale of real estate between individuals must be notarized.)\n\nI would be extremely surprised if the rule in the OP\u2019s example (residence condition to bring another driver on the insurance policy) would fail under any of those.",

Later, they receive the written contract containing a clause not mentioned during the phone call that invalidates coverage for non-UK resident drivers. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true regarding the legal validity of this clause?\n\nA) The clause is invalid because it wasn't explicitly mentioned during the phone call.\nB) The clause is valid only if it's a common industry standard for car insurance policies.\nC) The clause is likely valid and enforceable, assuming it doesn't violate any specific consumer protection laws.\nD) The clause is only valid if it was read aloud to the customer during the phone call.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In most jurisdictions, clauses in written contracts are generally considered valid and enforceable, even if not explicitly discussed during a phone sale. The legal principle assumes that individuals have read and agreed to the entire contract they sign. While there are some exceptions (such as clauses that violate consumer protection laws or general contract validity conditions), a residency requirement for additional drivers is likely to be considered a valid clause. Options A and D are incorrect because verbal discussions typically don't override written contracts, and there's usually no requirement to read every clause aloud. Option B is incorrect because the validity of a clause doesn't necessarily depend on how common it is in the industry."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Rep. [Tulsi Gabbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) is a Hawaii Army National Guard major. She is also a serving member of the House of Representatives. \n\nOn the face of it, it seems to be a violation of the separation of powers for any person to retain an officer commission while also being a legislator. She may, after all, (at least in theory) have to take orders from the commander\\-in\\-chief, who is in a different branch of the government.\n\nI do not think that her situation is unique. I am sure there have been many other legislators who were either in reserve or on active duty.\n\nWas there a SCOTUS case which provided guidance on why this is allowed? Or does this arrangement rely on a good faith belief that (a) a President would not interfere with the legislature by issuing orders which may interfere with an enlisted legislator's Congressional duties or that (b) such a legislator would not use her position to influence the armed services?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, this issue doesn't come up for people on active duty. [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 973](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/973) forbids active\\-duty military officers from holding or exercising the functions of an elective federal office; [DoDD 1344\\.10](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/134410p.pdf) extends that to all active\\-duty personnel. Both the law and the directive also apply to reservists or retirees on long\\-term active duty (more than 270 days).\n\nSecond, for status reasons, this is much less likely to come up with enlisted personnel. The sort of people who serve in Congress are generally also the sort of people who'd be officers. Many of the relevant restrictions apply to people holding *office* in the executive branch, and enlisted personnel do not hold office (only commissioned and warrant officers do).\n\nThird, an interesting quirk that makes this even more significant: Retired military personnel do not technically leave the military. They're no longer in active service, but they are still military personnel, bound by the UCMJ, and subject to both voluntary and involuntary recall. In fact, people retired from active\\-duty components are bound by the UCMJ at all times, whereas non\\-retired reservists are only bound by it when called up. If this is an issue for reservists because they might be called up, it's also an issue for retirees.\n\n---\n\nNow that we've handled preliminaries, the central issue comes from the Incompatibility Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n> \\[N]o person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House \\[of Congress] during his continuance in office.\n\nThe question is whether reservists count as holding an \"office under the United States.\" If it does, you have to resign from the reserves before entering Congress. However, *Congress* decides whether or not someone is qualified to be a member, and Congress has generally refused to explicitly decide if reservists are allowed (implicitly meaning that yes, they are).\n\n[6 Cannon's Precedents \u00a7\u00a7 60\\-\\-62](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/pdf/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-11.pdf) covers the situation as of World War I: the House Judiciary Committee recommended that members of Congress who had accepted National Guard commissions be considered to have forfeit their seats in Congress, but the full House didn't act on the recommendation. After the war, the House decided to pay members who had been on military service the difference between their congressional pay and military pay. In the second debate, the House considered the difference between temporary and permanent office. It was pointed out that in past wars, members had served as officers in short\\-term volunteer units and then returned to their seats at the end of their service. It was also pointed out that an \"office\" is an inherently permanent thing: a temporary commission for the duration of a war might not necessarily be an office.\n\n[2 Deschler's Precedents \u00a7 14](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2-1-4-6.pdf) discusses how things played out in World War II and beyond. Here, the US involvement was much longer, and there was more consideration given to the problems with holding both offices. The *executive* branch was the one that complained; they decided that serving in Congress was more important than serving overseas, and that military personnel who were also in Congress would be told to pick one (either go back to Congress and serve there, or resign from Congress and be in the military). In 1965, the Defense Department issued an order (currently found in [DoDD 1200\\.7](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/120007p.pdf)) which provides for the involuntary transfer of people in key positions (including all members of Congress) from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve. Congress did not like that, and they (finally) struck back in the 2016 NDAA: they amended [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 10149](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/10149) to ban transfers to the Standby Reserve based on service in Congress. This certainly seems to promote the idea that Congress thinks reserve service is allowable, but when Barry Goldwater tried to get a resolution to that effect in 1963, Congress didn't act on it.\n\nSo in summary: Congress (which enforces the Incompatibility Clause) hasn't explicitly said simultaneous reserve service is allowable, but has essentially let it happen. The executive branch has tried to discourage it, but Congress has opposed that (personally, my guess is that members of Congress want the political benefit of saying \"I'm currently in the military,\" while the military would prefer not to have them).\n\n---\n\nI've discussed how Congress handles it, and Congress does have the final authority to judge the qualifications of its members. There was one Supreme Court case (cited in Deschler's Precedents) where a group tried to get the two positions ruled incompatible, but it was dismissed on standing grounds (the group could not establish that *they* were particularly harmed by the alleged violation). A lower court had held that the offices were incompatible, but that ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, there was another opinion issued in 2006 where the courts couldn't duck the question. Sen. Lindsey Graham was also an Air Force lawyer (he's since retired), and while a Senator he was tapped to be a military judge on the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. An airman was convicted at court martial and appealed to a panel that included Graham, then appealed again to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. There's no question that a criminal defendant has standing to challenge whether his judge can legally be a judge, and Congress does *not* have the final say over whether someone's qualified to be a military judge. In *US v. Lane*, the CAAF held that Graham's office in the Senate was incompatible with service as a military judge. However, the CAAF cannot tell Congress \"you can't be an active reservist and a sitting member of Congress.\" Even the Supreme Court is limited in its ability to interfere with Congress's decisions on the qualifications of its members: the Court did hold that Congress can't add qualifications, but this is a question of \"does this provision apply to this person,\" which Congress has final authority over.",

The issue of legislators serving in the military reserves remains in a legal grey area. Congress, which has the authority to enforce the Incompatibility Clause, has not explicitly ruled on the matter. However, it has implicitly allowed the practice by not taking action against members who serve in both capacities. The executive branch, particularly the Department of Defense, has attempted to discourage the practice, but Congress has resisted these efforts, even passing legislation to prevent involuntary transfer of legislators to the Standby Reserve. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Supreme Court has not made a definitive ruling on this issue. In fact, a case challenging the practice was dismissed on standing grounds.\n\nOption B is false because Congress has not passed explicit legislation permitting the practice. While they have passed laws preventing certain actions against legislators in the reserves, they have not directly addressed the constitutionality of the dual service.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while there are restrictions on active-duty personnel holding elected office, there is no blanket prohibition on reserve service for legislators. In fact, the practice continues to occur, as evidenced by cases like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's."

When I read the licenses, however, it seems to me that the scope *has* narrowed, which makes me suspect that my concept of what the scope is for either 3\\.0 or 4\\.0 is wrong. \n\nIn this question, consider an example where someone uses several illustrations released together under a CC BY\\-SA license to create a book.

Unwin.\n\nThe book was published in 1934 and the author died in 1936, so it is public domain in the UK and most other countries. According to the [Hirtle Chart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Hirtle_chart) it is in the public domain in the US if its copyright wasn't renewed, which it wasn't explicitly. However, I stumbled upon some information that might mean that it was renewed implicitly if all of the following are true:\n\n* At least one author was a citizen or resident of a foreign country (outside the US) that's a party to the applicable copyright agreements. (Almost all countries are parties to these agreements.)\n* The work was still under copyright in at least one author's \"home country\" at the time the GATT copyright agreement went into effect for that country (1 January 1996 for most countries).\n* The work was first published abroad, and not published in the United States until at least 30 days after its first publication abroad.\n\nSource: <http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/renewals.html>\n\nIn my case, it appears that all of above are true:\n\n* J. D. Unwin was a British citizen, which is a party to the agreements.\n* In, 1996, UK copyright term was author's year \\+ 70 years, which means the book was under copyright at that time.\n* The book was never published in the US.\n\nIs my understanding correct here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From what little I understand of this, if the work qualifies as a \"restored\" work, under 17 USC \u00a7 104A, then it would technically have a US copyright (95 years from publication), as if they had actually complied with the US formalities that were superseded in later years. However, as you point out, under \u00a7 107 (h)(6\\) that US statute only applies where the native country's copyright had not expired as of 1996\\.\n\nI would run it by an actual copyright attorney in your bailiwick, to be certain.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A publisher is considering releasing an e-book version of \"Sex & Culture\" by J.D. Unwin, originally published in 1934. The author died in 1936. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the copyright status of this work in the United States as of 2023?\n\nA) The work is definitively in the public domain in the US because it was published before 1978 and the author died more than 70 years ago.\n\nB) The work is still under copyright protection in the US until 2029 (95 years after publication) due to copyright restoration under GATT.\n\nC) The copyright status is unclear and requires further investigation, potentially involving consultation with a copyright attorney.\n\nD) The work is automatically in the public domain in the US because it was never published in the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The copyright status of \"Sex & Culture\" by J.D. Unwin is complex and unclear based on the information provided. While the work would typically be in the public domain due to its age, there are factors that complicate its status:\n\n1. The work meets the criteria for potential copyright restoration under GATT:\n   - The author was a British citizen\n   - The work was likely still under copyright in the UK in 1996\n   - It was not published in the US within 30 days of its foreign publication\n\n2. However, the restoration of copyright under 17 USC \u00a7 104A is subject to various conditions and exceptions.\n\n3. The lack of explicit copyright renewal in the US adds another layer of complexity.\n\nGiven these factors, the safest approach is to consider the copyright status unclear and requiring further investigation. Consulting with a copyright attorney who can examine all the details would be advisable before proceeding with publication. This uncertainty makes option C the most accurate response."

The question tests understanding of the Supreme Court's approach to its original jurisdiction in cases between states, and the contrasting views within the Court.\n\nOption C correctly captures the core issue: The majority of the Court treats its original jurisdiction as discretionary, choosing whether to hear cases between states. This is evidenced by their practice of requiring and sometimes denying \"leave to file\" for such complaints. In contrast, Justices Thomas and Alito argue that the Constitution's use of \"shall\" instead of \"may\" regarding the Court's jurisdiction in state vs. state cases makes this jurisdiction mandatory, not discretionary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the dissent of Thomas and Alito. Option B mischaracterizes the nature of the disagreement, which is about constitutional interpretation, not mere procedure. Option D is incorrect because it suggests unanimous agreement on the need for leave to file, which is precisely what Thomas and Alito dispute.\n\nThis question requires synthesizing information about Court practices, constitutional interpretation, and internal disagreements within the Court, making it a challenging test of understanding of Supreme Court dynamics in state vs. state cases."

I mean it's one of the claims of one US presidential candidate.\n\nI suppose that the reason is because IT company can shift their profit to offshore companies.\n\nWhy can't normal companies do the same?\n\nWhy can't all restaurants set up corporation in Seychelles and pay \"royalty\" to their Seyschelles company?\n\nWhat is so special about tech companies that allows them to avoid taxes?\n\nSome source:\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=nzPoDCmYmwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzPoDCmYmwI) he claims here that tech companies are hard to tax\n\nI also know that Microsoft, Google, and Apple pay very little taxes.\n\nI also know that tech companies do not need infrastructure as much as non tech companies. However, that would make sense if government tax land, or gasoline for example. If government tax income, I do not see why normal companies have a harder time avoiding tax.\n\nWe also need to take into account tax evasion. While normal companies often deal with many other companies around, tech companies often deal globally with people around the world. However, I am not seeing that tech companies are evading tax illegally. It seems that they legally avoid paying taxes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A substantial part of the value of the goods and services provided by tech companies is in intangibles. \n\nFor example, [this](https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/20/649-iphone-7-estimated-to-cost-apple-220-heres-the-component-breakdown/) analysis suggests that approximately 1/3 of the price of an iPhone is in materials and labour and the rest is in the patents, copyrights and brand value that the names \"Apple\" and \"iPhone\" provide. If these intangibles are owned by, say, Aplle (Ireland) then Apple (USA) will have to pay them to use them \\- whatever amount those two companies agree on will reduce Apple (USA)'s profit and raise Apple (Ireland)'s profit \\- the tax rates in each of these countries is [not the same](https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2016/).\n\nNow, tax law says that such transfers have to be at fair market value. So, what is the fair market value of all the IP needed to build an iPhone? Or the value of the names \"Apple\" and \"iPhone\"? You don't know, I don't know, Apple doesn't know and the tax authorities don't know. Whatever figure they pick is defensible as \"fair market value\" because there isn't actually a market \\- fair or otherwise.\n\nResteraunts *can* do this too \\- McDonald's (Australia) pays a licence fee to use the name \"McDonalds\" but this is the only intangible McDonalds have \\- there is no patent on how to make a hamburger \\- so the scope for them to take advantge of this is less than for tech companies.",

Tech companies can more easily shift profits through intangible assets like intellectual property. This is because a substantial part of their value comes from intangibles such as patents, copyrights, and brand value. These intangibles can be owned by subsidiaries in low-tax countries, allowing the company to shift profits by paying for the use of these assets. The fair market value of such intangibles is often difficult to determine, giving tech companies more flexibility in their tax strategies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text specifically states that tech companies are not evading taxes illegally, but rather avoiding them legally.\n\nOption B, while true to some extent, is not the primary reason for their ability to pay lower taxes. The text mentions that this would be more relevant if taxes were primarily on land or gasoline, not income.\n\nOption D is not supported by the information provided.

I often see the usage of 'Jedi' word in the life, but I am also not sure if it's ok to use it for commercial purposes?\n\nI mean without referring to any images/authors/any context, supposing everybody already knows what is it or will guess if not.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is probably a word that can be used, but not definitively.\n\nMany words of general applicability coined by authors enter into the general lexicon.\n\nThe process is similar, but not precisely identical, to the dilution of a trademarked term to become a generic descriptive term for anything in the category of items so trademarked. Early examples of originally trademarked words that entered the general lexicon are \"elevator\" and \"escalator\".\n\nFor example, the word \"grok\" coined by Robert Heinlein, is now part of the general lexicon, as is the word \"quark\" coined by James Joyce (although its current meaning has shifted). The word \"robot\" from K. \u010capek's play R.U.R. \u2018Rossum's Universal Robots\u2019 (1920\\), would be another example of a word coined in fiction that has entered general use.\n\nThe scene a faire doctrine also authorized public domain use of tropes and terms that have achieved wide use in a genre. As a rule of thumb, if three different authors have used a term to mean the same thing, or an author who is no longer in copyright has done so, it can be used freely.\n\nFor example, regardless of who originally used it, the term \"mecha\" would not be protected by the doctrine due to its used by multiple authors and commentators in a particular science fiction sub\\-genre.\n\n\"Mentat\" is a close case, because it is overwhelmingly used in a specific series of books written by Frank Herbert and his son with licensing from his estate, and because the series has produced so many published properties, not only in books, but in TV and movies, it has been close to maximally protected from an IP perspective by the Herbert Estate, his publishers, and his audio\\-visual licensees.\n\nThere is at least a colorable argument that use of the term in a fictional setting would be a derivative work, intended to evoke and be derived from the extended series of creative properties.\n\nThe best counterargument that the term has entered the general lexicon, or in any case is not a protected derivative work, would comes from use of the term in a non\\-fiction sense which is not negligible, even though it isn't terribly common.\n\n[Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat_(disambiguation)) two (probably unlicensed) commercial uses, one as a trademark and the other as an IT company name, in addition to two minor fictional uses, one with a similar meaning and one with a somewhat shifted meaning.\n\nFurther, to the extent that the non\\-fiction use was great enough to show that it entered the general lexicon, at that point, fictional use would no longer be a derivative work because the work could be derived from many sources in which the Herbert estate does not have copyrights.\n\nA Google N\\-gram search could be used to evaluate that argument empirically. The use of the word in the early 19th century (before Herbert was born) is particularly promising, although the senses in which it was used pre\\-Herbert would have to be evaluated, and the context in which it was used post\\-Dune would also have to be evaluated (if all the uses are in his licensed books, it hurts the cause).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)\n\nA quick scan suggests that in the early 19th century that it was often used as a Latin or French word used untranslated for foreign flavor in English language works, so there is an argument that it is really a loan word not specific to Herbert. Much of the modern use is in fair use commentary expressly referencing Herbert's works and in obvious misspellings of the word \"mental\".\n\nParticularly encouraging in the N\\-gram search are the uses of the word in independent science fiction novels including \"The Search for Snout\" (2014\\) by Bruce Coville, \"Dorsai!\" (2013\\) by Gordon R. Dickson, \"Eye of the Storm\" (2009\\) by John Ringo, and \"The Ghost Brigades\" (2007\\) by John Scalzi. Also, particularly notable is the use of the word in an independent non\\-Dune novel in \"Clockwork Lives\" (2015\\) by Kevin J. Anderson and Neil Peart, since Kevin J. Anderson was a co\\-author of some of the Dune novels and would have contractual obligations to the Herbert Estate as well as copyright obligations; signifying a concession of non\\-ownership of the term by the estate. This use in five independent fictional cases in the same genre in works published long enough ago for the statute of limitations for infringement to have lapsed (with late filed suits used to muddy the waters). This strongly advances the scene a faire doctrine validation of the word.\n\nThe term is also used in a scientific journal article in 2008 in the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, but in a related but not identical sense of the word.\n\nAnother litmus test regarding whether a word is part of the general lexicon is whether it appears in more complete dictionaries, such as the OED, or Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, or in a notable published thesaurus, None of the dictionaries and no thesaurus that I have in hard copy have that word, but this could be because mine are dated. An updated dictionary and thesaurus search would be probative evidence of this question. A thesaurus search for \"genius\" or \"prodigy\" that came up with \"mentat\" listed would be a good thing to look for.\n\nA third issue for general lexicon v. derivative work analysis would be whether the word can be derived by obvious use of affixes and suffixes and retroflex letters from words that are in dictionaries. For example, a word plus \\-ology (for the study of), or \\-itis (for medical conditions) would not generally be beyond the scope of legally permissible public domain use. This again is a close call in the case of \"mentat\".\n\nSingle words are also harder (but not impossible) to protect as derivative works, if not trademarked as well, than extended passages either verbatim or paraphrased or translated, which would weaken the derivative work claim, although it wouldn't be entirely without merit just because it was a single word.",

The documentation provides several points that support this:\n\n1. While \"Mentat\" is strongly associated with Frank Herbert's Dune series, there are arguments for it entering the general lexicon.\n2. The scene a faire doctrine may apply, as the term has been used by multiple authors in science fiction.\n3. There are some non-fiction and commercial uses of the term, suggesting potential public domain status.\n4. However, the strong association with Dune and the extensive IP protection by the Herbert Estate creates a counterargument for potential copyright infringement.\n5. The term's presence (or absence) in major dictionaries and its etymological derivation are additional factors to consider.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it's too absolute; the documentation doesn't support a definitive illegal status. Answer B is also incorrect for being too permissive, as there are potential legal concerns. Answer D is incorrect because the documentation doesn't confirm the term's presence in all major dictionaries or its unrestricted use."

I asked them what this is used for, and why it's required by the regulations (ie, what is the rationale and principle of the said regulation), and they couldn't tell me.\n\nI was hoping someone here could shed some light on this question instead. I am quite interested in the princple and rationale behind the requirement (and, why can advice not be dispensed simply on a hypothetical basis?), however, more significant is where it gets sent, what its collection's purpose is, and what it's used for.\n\nEdit: It would also be great if you could supply a citation of the specific regulation that imposes this requirement.\n\nNote: a bit new here, but don't really know necessarily what the most suitable tags to be used are, so if any others have suggestions for more applicable and relevant ones, please don't hesitate to suggest!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The purpose is to avoid the possibility that the solicitor will inadvertently end up providing advice to more than one side of the same dispute or transaction, putting the solicitor in a conflict of interest situation.\n\nIn the simplest case, the solicitor might already represent the landlord that the tenant is seeking to discuss legal rights vis\\-a\\-vis.\n\nEven if the advice is merely hypothetical, this is not O.K. A solicitor has a very high duty of loyalty to the solicitor's clients. Providing aid of any kind to someone adverse to the solicitor's clients that benefits that person, even if another solicitor would probably say the same thing, is a serious breach of that duty and is forbidden and sanctionable. It could get the solicitor kicked out of the profession in a worst case scenario. The duty of loyalty includes a duty to take reasonable care not to inadvertently or negligently act disloyally.\n\nThere is also a risk of a more subtle sort of conflict that has to be evaluated since many disputes and transactions are not just two sided.\n\nFor example, perhaps a solicitor a big commercial tenant client on the brink of a settlement with a particular landlord after lengthy and extensive negotiations (perhaps in a business lease renewal deal), and another prospective tenant client might, for example, have an interest in leasing the same property as your existing client at a higher rate. Representing both tenants/prospective tenants could creating a conflict between your two tenant clients. Screening clients based upon their landlord relationships helps solicitors to identify these conflicts and to prevent them from arising.\n\nMore generally, the best practice is for a solicitor to make sufficient inquiry prior to providing any legal advice to a prospective new client, to avoid having clients that have a conflict of interest with each other. This regulation (to the extent that it is really as specific as suggested) is simply a codification of this general rule in a specific, commonly recurring situation.\n\nIn large law firms, every single legal professional in the firm typically spends the first half hour or so of every day reviewing lists of new prospective clients and parties related to them in order to screen for potential conflicts of interest. (I used to have to do that when I worked in a large, international law firm for a while.) There would typically be one or more paralegals or administrators in the firm who do nothing but manage that conflicts of interest screening process.\n\nObviously, however, this requirement is a lot less burdensome if you are solo practicing solicitor who almost entirely represents individual human being and family tenants with isolated residential leases, and works in a large city where few clients have any connections to each other.",

This practice allows the solicitor to check if they already represent the landlord or any other parties involved in the same or related disputes. It helps prevent situations where the solicitor might inadvertently provide advice to multiple sides of the same issue, which would be a breach of their duty of loyalty to existing clients.

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: \n> \n> \n> (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nBecause you say it are pharmaceutical products, there might also be a legal obligation because prescribing a wrong product is dangerous. But I don't know if that is the case.\n\nAlso note that in many EU countries, consent would not even be possible because there is a imbalanced relationship between an employer and an employee, see for example the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/when-is-consent-appropriate/) or [this page](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/how-my-personal-data-protected/can-my-employer-require-me-give-my-consent-use-my-personal-data_en) from the European Commission:\n\n> The employer\\-employee situation is generally considered as an imbalanced relationship in which the employer wields more power than the employee. Since consent has to be freely given, and in light of the imbalanced relationship, your employer in most cases can\u2019t rely on your consent to use your data.\n\n---\n\nBut besides that, the GDPR also requires data minimisation. See [Article 5(1\\)(c)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/):\n\n> 1. Personal data shall be: \n> \n> \n> (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019);\n\nPossibly, instead of the employee's name, a pseudonym could be used to reach the same goal. But there might also be reasons a pseudonym could not be used, for example if at the end of the course a certificate is received which lists the employee's name. \n\nHowever, it might be unlawful if a personal email address is used instead of a company email address. In particular because that email address was not collected for that purpose.",

A pharmacy (Company B) wants its employees to use this platform for training. Under GDPR, what is likely the most appropriate legal basis for Company B to add its employees' information to this platform without explicit consent?\n\nA) Vital interests of the data subject\nB) Legitimate interests pursued by the controller\nC) Consent of the data subject\nD) Performance of a contract\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate legal basis in this scenario is likely \"legitimate interests pursued by the controller\" (Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR). Company B has a legitimate interest in ensuring its employees are properly trained on the pharmaceutical products they handle. Consent (option C) is not ideal in employer-employee relationships due to the power imbalance. Vital interests (option A) typically apply to life-or-death situations. Performance of a contract (option D) might apply if training was explicitly part of the employment contract, but this isn't specified in the scenario. Option B best fits the given situation, allowing Company B to process employee data for training purposes without explicit consent, provided it doesn't override the employees' rights and freedoms."

Sarah's roommate, Mike, arrives and gives the officer permission to enter. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences for Sarah?\n\nA) Sarah cannot be arrested or charged because she wasn't present at the time of the discovery.\nB) The evidence is inadmissible because Sarah didn't personally consent to the search.\nC) Sarah can be arrested and charged based on the evidence, as it was in plain view and a co-occupant consented to entry.\nD) The officer must obtain a warrant before the evidence can be used against Sarah, despite Mike's consent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the co-occupant consent rule established in United States v. Matlock, if a co-occupant (in this case, Mike) consents to a search, any evidence in plain view from common areas can be used as probable cause for arrest and is admissible as evidence in court. The fact that Sarah wasn't present doesn't negate the legality of the search or the admissibility of the evidence. Option A is incorrect because presence isn't required for arrest if there's probable cause. Option B is wrong because personal consent isn't necessary if a co-occupant consents. Option D is incorrect because no warrant is needed given the consent and plain view doctrine."

The term \"solicitors\" is used to refer to the law firm as a whole, even when a single individual is managing the case. This practice stems from historical traditions where solicitors operated as sole traders or in partnerships, collectively referred to as a firm. Even though many jurisdictions now allow different operational structures, the plural form \"solicitors\" is still commonly used to represent the firm as an entity. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not a grammatical error, but an intentional usage. \nOption C is incorrect because while it does refer to a collective, it specifically relates to the firm, not all legal professionals involved. \nOption D is incorrect because this term is still widely used and recognized in legal contexts, not being phased out."

But what if the protectee is discovered to be a bad guy? Can they insist on the detail to guard them from legitimate arrest? Or would the detail have to let the cops bust him/her? (I guess the detail would stay at the detention facility to watch over their charge.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most secret service details are protection for heads of government/state and thus their details would be afforded Sovereign Immunity (Such as POTUS, VPOTUS, and First and Second Families) OR Diplomatic Immunity (visiting dignitaries and leaders of other nations). Typically there are more diplomatic ways to handle the cases in the latter.\n\nIn the former case, thus far, it has not been handled. During visits, the traditional Executives and Families are usually closely guarded by the Service with additional law enforcement form local jurisdictions called in to aid in the protection, usually to secure routes the Motorcade will take to a designation (I speak from personal experience, POTUS coming to town is a nightmare on traffic). If they are speeding, they are typically doing so down a completely empty highway with police escort.\n\nFrom this point, most under of the Service would be monitored and controlled so closely, at least one Agent would notice if any protected was committing a crime and would have to write it up in a report. There is also considerable debate in legal circles if the President and Vice President could be arrested for a crime while in office, with the general acceptance being that they could not and would need to be impeached by congress. Secret Service will continue to protect former Presidents and Vice Presidents for life, along with their spouses and children up to a certain age.\n\nWith all that in mind, it would not so much be that the Secret Service would prevent arrest of an individual under their protection so much as the Secret Service would be the arresting authority. As they are law enforcement agents under the Federal Government, they can legally arrest people and then hand them to the proper law enforcement agency to effect the arrest. This would mostly happen with candidates for office OR former presidents OR family at any point in time as the scenario described is a bit harder to make a legitimate arrest.\n\nIn fact, the Secret Service does have arrest authority with one of the highest conviction rates of any Law Enforcement Agency in the Country. It's just most crimes they arrest have nothing to do with threats to those under their protection. The Secret Service is also charged with investigation of counterfeiting of US currency and they are very good at it. This was actually their original sole function in the U.S. government and they still exist under the Treasury Department to this day. At this point, if you're wondering how they got the job of protecting important people in the executive branch from that, well, it's simple. At the time of his assasination, the legislation to create the USSS was on Licoln's desk. At the time of their creation, the only other Federal Police services were the U.S. Park Police, the Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Marshals. The first two had specific jurisdictions and the Marshals were undermanned so the USSS was tasked with investigating all sorts of financial crimes and quickly became the most successful U.S. Law Enforcement Service. They were also the first U.S. Intelligence and Counterintelligence agency (though they no longer are part of the Intelligence Community) until the FBI took on those duties. So following the Assassination of William McKinley in 1901, Congress authorized them to take up full time Presidential Protection because at the time, they were pretty much doing everything else.",

But it's not against the law, and you can't be sued for doing it.\n\nCopyright violation *is* against the law\n----------------------------------------\n\nYou violate copyright when you copy or make a derivative work from the copyrighted work of another without permission or without an exemption under the law.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, authors and artists have moral copyright, which operates alongside proprietary copyright and gives certain rights, including the right of attribution and the right for their work to be treated respectfully. In those jurisdictions, even if you have the copyright holder's permission, you must still respect the moral rights.\n\nLet's make some things explicit by considering a particular artwork. Say, this one:\n\n[![Leonardo's Mona Lisa](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)\n\nThis particular piece is not subject to copyright because a) it was created before there was such a concept, and b) da Vinci died in 1519, so if there had been a copyright law, copyright in this work would have long expired. So, you can make as many copies of this as you like.\n\nNow, let's consider what the situation would be if Leonardo's alchemical pursuits had been more successful and instead of dying in 1519, he died last Tuesday.\n\nIf you want to make a copy of this image, you must have Leonardo's heir(s) permission or be operating under an exemption under copyright law in your jurisdiction.\n\nWhen you train your AI, you will need to make a copy of the image. Do you have permission? Do you have a relevant exemption?\n\nIf you obtained your images by scraping websites then the answers are no and (probably) no.\n\nWhether the image has metadata identifying the author is irrelevant to answering the questions. Whether there is any way of identifying the artist is also irrelevant \\- you still need their permission even if you don't know who to ask.\n\nIf your AI, when prompted, generates an image that is [strikingly similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_replicas_and_reinterpretations) to a copyrighted image it was trained on, that is a derivative work and you need permission for that.

The GPL likely forms a contract due to mutual intention (demonstrated by the developer offering the license and users acting on it) and consideration (users agreeing to redistribute under the same terms).\nD is incorrect as there is no provision in the GPL for revocation with notice."

It means the seller must have the documents ready and accessible for the buyer to obtain, but the seller is not necessarily required to actively transfer or deliver the documents to the buyer. This interpretation aligns with the explanation that \"make available\" means more than just preparing (where the seller has the documents but the buyer can't take them), but less than delivering (where the seller would directly hand over the documents). Option C correctly captures this nuanced meaning, reflecting the legal expectation that the documents are ready and accessible, but the onus may be on the buyer to take possession of them."

The requirement\n> to offer such service is limited to work commensurate with the grade and competencies\n> of the doctor rather than work at a lower grade than the doctor is currently employed to\n> work at. Additional work, such as; event and expedition medicine, work for medical\n> charities, non\\-profits, humanitarian and similar organisations, or sports and exercise\n> medicine do not fall under the scope of additional work as a locum.\n\n(note that 'locum' has a standard definition of 'a person who stands in temporarily for someone else of the same profession, especially a cleric or doctor' but is not defined in the contract itself \\- its a well known term that does not require further definition, but it plays an important part in your question)\n\nSo, a few things from that section:\n\n> Where a doctor intends to undertake hours of paid work ***as a locum***\n\nThis immediately sets limits on what the clause means \\- the intention is to limit locum work, not general work.\n\n> The requirement to offer such service is limited to work commensurate with the grade and competencies of the doctor rather than work at a lower grade than the doctor is currently employed to work at\n\nA FY2 or later junior doctor can go elsewhere to work as a house officer if they cannot find work as a senior house officer, again restricting the clause to similar working conditions and not general work.\n\nThis is very very similar to any company putting a non\\-compete in their contract for, say, a software developer \\- you need the companies permission to go do contract work for another software company for example.\n\nTo specifically talk to your point about being a gardener, this clause does not cover that because the employee is not acting as a locum in their professional capacity at that point.\n\nThe intention of this clause is to fill the gaps in the NHS staffing plan caused by 11 years of mismanagement and underfunding \\- no longer can an in\\-contract doctor or nurse work their 38 hour rota and then go fill a lucrative shift with a private hospital, they must offer any hours under 48 to the NHS via the employee bank \\- this means the bank can pay minimal wages to cover shifts it had to pay locums a lot more to cover before 2016\\.",

This requirement is limited to work commensurate with the doctor's grade and competencies. The clause does not prohibit all additional work (option A is incorrect), nor does it apply to all types of work (option B is incorrect). It specifically targets locum work within the medical field, not other professions or charitable work. Option D is incorrect because the contract explicitly aims to prevent doctors from freely taking lucrative shifts at private hospitals without first offering those hours to the NHS. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it accurately reflects the contract's stipulation regarding additional locum work."

He destroyed many things, smokes inside, always listens to loud music, has loud fights with his girlfriend very frequently and at all times of the day (and night), is very aggressive, etc. The landlord terminated his contract after the tenant destroyed the entrance door and the same day terminated his contract immediately (\"Au\u00dferordentliche K\u00fcndigung\") after he physically attacked me. But by then I had already terminated my contract. It ends at the 30th of June.\n\nI found a different place to live. Now I want to rent my two rooms to someone else for the remaining two months so I don't have to pay double (for my old place and for my new place).\n\nI can't really find a next tenant because the landlord wants to renovate the place after I moved out. There is a 3rd tenant but he too terminated his contract (ending at the same day as mine). However, people are potentially interested in living there for 2 months. \n\nI asked him whether I am allowed to rent my rooms to someone else for those two months but he declined. He also does not want to let me stop paying rent earlier.\n\nI read that you can rent your rooms to someone else because the landlord basically always has to allow it. But I'm not sure. \n\nIs there a way for me to get what I want? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is called \"subletting\". \n\nIn Germany, subletting is allowed by [\u00a7\u00a7 540](http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/540.html) and [553](http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/553.html), however you do need to have the consent of the landlord/property manager. \n\nSo in your case, since your landlord declined to allow you to sublet, you cannot. The only other way to \"get what you want\" would be to move out and not pay, then hope the landlord doesn't sue you for the remaining rent.

Given just this, you may, but are not required to.\n\nThe [Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (23\\)(1\\)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c34#BK22) says:\n\n> In a conveyance made on or after the 1st day of July, 1886, there\n>  shall, in the cases in this section mentioned, be deemed to be\n>  included, and there shall in those cases be implied, covenants to the\n>  effect in this section stated, by the person or by each person who\n>  conveys, as far as regards the subject\\-matter or share thereof\n>  expressed to be conveyed by him, with the person, if one, to whom the\n>  conveyance is made, or with the persons jointly, if more than one, to\n>  whom the conveyance is made as joint tenants, or with each of the\n>  persons, if more than one, to whom the conveyance is made as tenants\n>  in common:\n>  In a conveyance for valuable consideration, other than a mortgage, the\n>  following covenants by the person who conveys, and is expressed to\n>  convey as beneficial owner, namely, covenants for...ii. quiet\n>  enjoyment...according to the forms of covenants for such purposes set\n>  forth in Schedule B to the Short Forms of Conveyances Act, being\n>  chapter 472 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980, and therein\n>  numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5, subject to that Act.\n\nIn other words, if the lease doesn't say anything about quiet enjoyment, there is an implied covenant whereby \"the landlord, by letting the premises confers on the tenant the right of possession during the term and impliedly promises not to interfere with the tenant\u2019s exercise and use of that right to possession during the term\". The implied covenant pertains to interference by the landlord, not to interference by other tenants (see [this analysis](https://renx.ca/the-tenants-right-to-quiet-enjoyment-how-far-does-it-go/)). Again, you would have a right to evict a noisy tenant, but not an obligation.\n\nHowever, the [Canadian Human Rights Act(6\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html#h-3) states that:\n\n> It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of commercial\n>  premises or residential accommodation (a) to deny occupancy of such\n>  premises or accommodation to any individual, or (b) to differentiate\n>  adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of\n>  discrimination.\n\nwhere 3(1\\) states:\n\n> For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination\n>  are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex,\n>  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status,\n>  family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for\n>  an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which\n>  a record suspension has been ordered.\n\nThe [Canadian Supremacy Clause](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (52(1\\) of the Constitution Act, 1982\\) says that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law\n>  that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to\n>  the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nand furthermore:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada includes (a) the Canada Act 1982, including\n>  this Act\n\nThe Constitution act (15\\)(1\\) [also states](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html):\n\n> Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right\n>  to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without\n>  discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on\n>  race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental\n>  or physical disability.\n\nSo under the Canadian Constitution, the national anti\\-discrimination requirement is superior to the provincial RTA. Since no provincial law actually requires eviction of a tenant with a noisy guest, there is no conflict.\n\nOntario also has an [anti\\-discrimination law](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h19#BK3) (The Human Rights Code):\n\n> 1. Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of\n>  race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship,\n>  creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,\n>  age, marital status, family status or disability.\n> 2. (1\\) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to the occupancy of accommodation, without discrimination because of race,\n>  ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed,\n>  sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age,\n>  marital status, family status, disability or the receipt of public\n>  assistance.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Every person who occupies accommodation has a right to freedom\n>  from harassment by the landlord or agent of the landlord *or by an\n>  occupant of the same building* because of race, ancestry, place of\n>  origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation,\n>  gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family\n>  status, disability or the receipt of public assistance.\n\nRight must therefore refrain from hassling Left.\n\nA problem could arise if there is a lease clause whereby you guarantee tenants a noise\\-free environment and promise to remove noisy neighbors. In that case, Right could sue you, and you would have to defend yourself by reference to the fact that Canadian and provincial law prohibits you from pursuing eviction in this case.\n\nAn alternative would be to ask Left to not have the noisy individual over. But that would not be a wise choice. The anti\\-discrimination laws are not stated as protections against tenants who have the protected characteristics, indeed all tenants have some sex, religion, race etc. You can't start eviction proceedings because the tenant is white, black, Catholic, or atheist, and you likewise can't evict a person for having a guest who is white, black, Catholic, or atheist. You also can't \"have a talk\" with a tenant \u2013 creating a \"poisoned environment\" \u2013 because they or their guest are white, black, Catholic, or atheist. Having a mental disability is included in this set.\n\nAll that said, this is clearly a case that needs to be looked at by an Ontario landlord lawyer.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Ontario is facing a situation where one tenant (Tenant A) frequently has a guest with Tourette's syndrome, causing noise disturbances. Another tenant (Tenant B) is complaining about the noise and threatening to go to the tenant board. What is the landlord's best course of action according to Ontario and Canadian law?\n\nA) Evict Tenant A for causing noise disturbances that interfere with other tenants' enjoyment of the property.\nB) Ask Tenant A to stop inviting the guest with Tourette's syndrome to avoid noise complaints.\nC) Inform Tenant B that they must tolerate the noise as it is caused by a protected disability and cannot be discriminated against.\nD) Take no action and allow Tenant B to proceed with their complaint to the tenant board.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code, discrimination based on disability is prohibited in housing. The landlord cannot evict Tenant A or ask them to stop inviting their guest with Tourette's syndrome, as this would be considered discrimination. Additionally, the landlord should inform Tenant B that they must refrain from harassing Tenant A or their guest due to the disability, as this is also protected under anti-discrimination laws. While the Residential Tenancies Act allows for eviction in cases of substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment, this is superseded by federal and provincial anti-discrimination laws in this case. The landlord's best course of action is to explain the situation to Tenant B and emphasize that the noise is caused by a protected disability that cannot be discriminated against."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What protections does Netherlands provide to users of online platforms incorporated in their country? Currently, the United States treats online platforms as private property and so the users are granted no rights of freedom of speech on those platforms. Does the Netherlands provide any additional rights over the United States?\n\nI know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights. If so, are these rights extended only to citizens of the Netherlands, or are these rights universal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Freedom of speech in the constitution\n-------------------------------------\n\nI think this is a very broad question, but I'll attempt an answer. To my knowledge, there is no specific Dutch law that considers freedom of speech *on the internet*. Instead, there is one article in the Dutch constitution that considers freedom of speech and a prohibition on censorship. That's [article 7 of the Dutch constitution](https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/id/via0istdaus2/artikel_7_vrijheid_van_meningsuiting) (link in Dutch).\n\nIt consists of 4 sections. The first deals with freedom of speech in print, the second deals with radio and television, the third deals with (translated by me) *revealing thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* and the fourth states that the aforementioned sections don't apply to commercial advertisements.\n\nSince you are asking about freedom of speech online, the third section applies. The section states that no permission is needed to *reveal those thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* but it adds two conditions:\n\n1. In Dutch: *\"behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet\"*. This means that the freedom is subject to one's responsibilities under the law. In other words, other laws may curtail one's freedom under this section. This phrase is also included in the first two sections.\n2. The second condition which is specific to this section is that the law may restrict access to *performances* (*vertoningen* in Dutch; not sure if it translates well) to people under the age of 16 to protect good moral (*goede zeden* in Dutch; again not sure if it translates well).\n\nRestrictions under the law\n--------------------------\n\nSo the above about constitutional freedom of speech doesn't tell you a lot, it's very general. To answer your question you'd need to know what specific exceptions there are. These exceptions don't need to be specific to statements made online, if it's not allowed in public then the same rule would apply online.\n\nTo give these exceptions I'll summarize the information on [this page from the Dutch Amnesty International site on freedom of speech in the Netherlands](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland).\n\nHate speech and calling for criminal acts\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Amnesty article starts with some information on articles of criminal law:\n\n* [Article 137](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel137d/) forbids hate against or discrimination of people based on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, or mental handicap.\n\nAccording to [the Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) this covers holocaust denial (considered unlawful discrimination) but not homophobia (when it expresses fear of or aversion to someone's sexual orientation).\n\n* [Article 131](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel131) and [article 132](http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/Wetboek%20van%20Strafrecht/132.html): calling for a criminal act or violent action against public order.\n\nSome interesting jurisprudence regarding your question and articles 131 and 132 is this case: [ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232). It's a Dutch Supreme Court case that considers calls for 'participation in the armed jihad' in the context of the war in Syria. The calls were made in Facebook posts (containing photos of dead victims, photos of ISIS flags, and statements in Dutch supporting jihad). The linked ruling confirms that these posts were in violation of articles 131 and 132 and that the posts were not protected under religious freedom nor as freedom of speech.\n\n* Libel [article 261](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel261) and slander [article 262](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel262) are also limitations on freedom of speech, even online.\n\nPreventing publication of military secrets\n------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the [Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) censorship (as in ruling some statement against the law before publication) is not something Dutch courts may normally do. It names one exception: when military secrets may be revealed. Then a court may prevent publication, unless the military secrets are such gross violations of human rights that publication would be warranted.\n\nRights on a platform\n--------------------\n\n> I know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights.\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to here but I don't think it refers to freedom speech. In any case, after some googling I found a case that is about this: [someone filed summary proceedings](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2020:4966) in the Netherlands because they disagreed with Facebook removing pages on its platform that didn't conform with Facebook's policy on Covid\\-19\\. As far as I can see from skimming the court ruling, the ruling holds that freedom of speech does not extend to companies like Facebook having to host your posts. I think it's basically a long ruling that boils down to [the well\\-know XKCD on free speech](https://xkcd.com/1357/).\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling also points to the service agreement between Facebook and the user. Part of those terms and conditions are entered as facts in the proceedings. Since it's a civil case, I assume users might derive some rights from that if the agreement touches on that.\n\nAnother thing that sounds familiar (based on that quote from your question) is [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality). Like in the US, that's mostly about network providers having different rules for different content, which isn't allowed in most cases under net neutrality. I don't think there's a freedom of speech angle to that.",

Dutch criminal law (Article 137) prohibits hate speech and discrimination, including online. However, the provided information specifically states that while this covers things like Holocaust denial, it does not automatically make all homophobic content unlawful if it merely expresses fear or aversion to sexual orientation without rising to the level of hate speech or discrimination."

This can literally be until they choose to disperse at some point after midnight, so you can imagine how hard it is to sleep with this going on.\n\nThe exit to the car park is pretty much outside our property, and they use the road our property is on as a race way \\- they exit the car park, do a high speed circuit of the block and return to the car park.\n\n6 months ago I raised this issue with the city council through their noise nuisance complaints website, but I received a reply that the council only deals with noise nuisance issues caused by council or private tenants or property owners \\- any noise nuisance issues on council land is not their responsibility, and instead directed me to the local wardens or the police.\n\nThe local wardens only patrol up to 8pm, so they have already said they cannot do anything.\n\nI have thus far lodged more than 40 complaints with the police non\\-emergency number, and not once has anyone been sent out, even when the report has been after midnight.\n\nI have ample video and audio evidence of the nuisance (one of the first things suggested online is to keep a diary of the nuisance, so I set up a Raspberry Pi to record raw audio and the decibel level a few months back), and my neighbours have similar issues and are backing us. \n\nLegal action is the next recourse, and the only people I can take action against are the council as its their property \\- but they are saying its not their problem...\n\n*So my question is thus \\- can the city council actually absolve themselves of legal responsibility for actions on their property? Private property owners cannot do this, they are responsible for the noise on their property, so why can the council?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Actually, neither the council nor a private owner are responsible for illegal actions by unauthorised people on their property. This is obvious: if an intruder enters your property and, while there, shoots someone you cannot be held responsible.\n\nHowever ...\n\nSince you have made them aware that there are intruders on their property acting illegally and causing a nuisance to the neighbours and they have done nothing they are quite likely negligent, even recklessly negligent.\n\nRather than sue them, consult a lawyer and get them to write a letter that if they do not take action by X date you are *going* to sue them.",

While the council is not automatically responsible for unauthorized actions on their property (ruling out option A), they cannot completely absolve themselves of responsibility once they've been made aware of the ongoing issue (ruling out options B and D). The documentation states that since the council has been informed of the recurring nuisance and has done nothing to address it, they are \"quite likely negligent, even recklessly negligent.\" This suggests that the council has a duty to take reasonable action to prevent or mitigate the nuisance once they are aware of it, even if the initial acts are by unauthorized individuals. Failing to do so could potentially lead to legal liability."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought a house 3 weeks ago, and after moving in, I found there's smoke smell in the house, like tobaccos, although I didn't notice that during the home inspection or the final walk through.\n\nI cleaned vents, walls, ceilings, everything I can think of, but the smoke smell still persists. I even called the fire department, but they couldn't find out the source either.\n\nThen I found many odor eliminators and air fresheners in several concealed places in the house, which I believe were used to cover the smoke smell, such that it's hard to notice the smoke smell during a half\\-an\\-hour walk through or inspection.\n\nI also found a lot of smoke soot and dust when I was cleaning vents, and I even found a cigar in the fridge! So I'm pretty sure the seller (and/or his agent) covered up the smoke smell and didn't disclose it to me, which may have violated the disclosure law.\n\nSo what do you think I should do now? Can this be resolved in a civil manner or a legal action is needed?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I live in Massachusetts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Disclosures are prescribed by state law. Fair housing, which is a federal concept, pertains to issues such as using prohibited personal facts to determine whether to accept an offer. (Hazardous materials disclosures are also mandated at the federal level, but are are included in state requirements which can get pretty broad). \n\nIf you are buying in Washington state, [RCW 64\\.06\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.06.020) says what and how you must disclose. The list of disclosures is very detailed, covering title and covenants, water, sewer, structure, systems and fixtures, environment, and mobile home related. The only one of the 86 questions about smoke is whether smoke alarms are present. Thus smell of smoke is not a legally material fact that must be disclosed, in this state. The California disclosures, even longer, are [here](http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/re6.pdf), and there is likewise no \"smells bad\" disclosure.\n\nIt is unlikely that any state in the US mandates such a disclosure, since it is somewhere between a subjective evaluation and a self\\-evident fact. Some people are very sensitive to certain smells while others do not care. The burden is on the buyer to pursue matters of personal concern (in writing!), such as whether any dog has been present in the house in the past 5 years (some people care). You have to look carefully at the response. \"Don't know\" is usually a safe bet, unless you actually have factual knowledge.\n\nFrom what I can determine, Massachussetts is on the opposite end of the spectrum from California. There are some requirements imposed on real estate agents, and there is the federal lead paint disclosure, but otherwise it appears that nothing is mandated by law. [This form](http://startpoint.com/DocLibrary/SellerDisclosure.pdf) seems to be used by the real estate association, and there is a question about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure\". The reasonable interpretation of that is \"has the house caught fire and suffered damage\", so \"no\" from a cigar\\-smoker would not be fraudulent. If the intent of the question were to reveal if someone has smoked frequently in the house, that would he the question they'd ask. You can check whether you have this form and see what it says, but \"smoke damage\" would not normally be interpreted as meaning \"smells a bit funny\".",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the disclosure of smoke smell in a house sale in Massachusetts?\n\nA) The seller is legally required to disclose any smoke smell in the house.\nB) The seller must only disclose smoke smell if it resulted from fire damage.\nC) The seller is not legally obligated to disclose smoke smell, as it's not considered a material fact.\nD) The seller must disclose smoke smell if asked specifically about it by the buyer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that Massachusetts has minimal disclosure requirements compared to other states. There is no specific mandate to disclose smoke smell. The form mentioned asks about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure,\" which is interpreted as actual fire damage, not lingering smoke odor from smoking. Smoke smell is considered more of a subjective issue or self-evident fact that buyers are expected to notice themselves, rather than a material fact requiring disclosure. The burden is on the buyer to inquire about specific concerns not covered by mandatory disclosures."

Could stock markets or the authorized distributors of their data bring about any consequences legally to someone who republishes the data without permission?\n\n*Assuming financial market quotes can't be copyrighted,* can the distributors of the information (exchanges or their authorized distributors) use a contract (terms of service) to prevent someone from redistributing the data that they don't own (the copyright to) in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe that it varies by country. The law provides protection for databases and data sets, where sufficient creativity/choice/curatorship has gone into its creation. It's separate from but similar to copyright law. So far it exists in several countries including the EU but I'm hazy whether it exists in the US (from memory it doesn't) and the exact criteria. \n\nIn any case such a website may not meet the criterion for copyright \\- although the original data creator (the stock exchange whose data is being used/reused) may have. \n\nI don't know about IP law \\- is the fact of a current price (or dataset of such facts at different times) protectable as IP instead? Are facts generally? Can I declare facts such as my street address, or a number, as IP? Clearly commercial effort goes into it, and clearly it can be protected by contract but copyright/IP law is less clear to me. The question of copyright protection for a commercially valuable *number* **has** been [tried in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy), however, as has the question of [a commercially valuable number which is constructed into a number that is notable for noncommercial reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).\n\n(As a possibly similar thought\\-question that might shed light on it \\- suppose a website is hosted using stock settings of some \"off the shelf\" website software, can they sue for copyright/look and feel over the appearance of their site? Probably not since they didn't put creative/novel/original effort into it. But the original software creator probably could.)\n\nHope this partial answer helps.\n\n**Updated to answer follow\\-up comment**\n\nFirst off, you can't force a person to do something based on a contract with someone else. Only the websites contract with the end user (terms of use etc) can do that. So the supplier's contract with the stock price website cannot in any way force an end user to do or not do anything. It can however require the vendor to set specific terms and enforce them. It can require the vendor to sue an abuser of the website terms (or allow the supplier to do so in their place and at their risk) if the supplier says to do so. Or it can allow for anything else agreed between the data supplier and the stocks website.\n\nThe flip side is that this would be a contract case for damages. Unless there are statutory damages (which don't exist in most countries and exist but might not apply in the US), the supplier would have to prove the harm and loss forseeably and directly suffered and would only be compensated for that alone. A lot of breach of contract cases just aren't worth taking to court for that reason \\- because you could prove the contract was breached but not that you lost anything, much less that your loss was a direct result and foreseeable by the end user.\n\n(In the EU, you'd also have to be able to show that the terms were not unreasonable as the law protects consumers from gross disparity if ability to set contract terms, and fixed terms deemed unfair, but that probably wouldn't be an issue here).\n\nThe latter part of the followup is essentially discussing nondisclosure agreements. You don't have to own the data for that \\- there is legal consideration by each party and that's enough (each has given something to the other: \"I will show you some information if you agree to these conditions\"). But that's contractual too, and the same applies, if the user shared the data anyway or disclosed it, your damages would quite likely be limited to the loss you could prove, whatever the contract says.\n\nLast the law on databases/data sets isn't something I know huge amounts about. Where such a law existed, a supplier would probably argue that sufficient original effort went into the collation and organisation of the data and the user would probably counterargue that this was mere storage of data and no original work was involved, or that any damage (if any) was negligible and would have to be proven. As databases have their own law and not pure copyright law, they might be right or wrong, depending on the jurisdiction and wording of the law.\n\nWikipedia articles of relevance to databases/datasets:\n\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_generis_database_right> (global information)\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive> (EU specific and more detail what's covered)",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The website is definitely violating copyright law and can be sued for damages.\n\nB) The website cannot be held liable as stock market quotes are facts and cannot be copyrighted.\n\nC) The website may face legal consequences, but the outcome depends on various factors including jurisdiction, database protection laws, and contractual agreements.\n\nD) The website is only liable if they signed an explicit contract with the original data provider.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legal status of republishing stock market quotes without permission is complex and varies by jurisdiction. While raw facts like stock prices generally cannot be copyrighted, some countries have specific laws protecting databases and datasets. The EU, for example, has the Database Directive which may offer protection if sufficient effort went into creating the dataset. \n\nAdditionally, even if copyright doesn't apply, the original data provider may have contractual agreements with their direct customers (like websites) that require them to enforce certain terms of use. These terms could prohibit redistribution of the data.\n\nHowever, enforcing such restrictions can be challenging. The data provider would need to prove actual damages in many cases, which may be difficult. The outcome of any legal action would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction, the nature of any contracts involved, and the ability to prove harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright doesn't automatically apply to all data. Option B oversimplifies the situation by ignoring other potential legal protections. Option D is too narrow, as liability could arise from other sources besides a direct contract with the data provider."

How can the customer enforce his or her right to the data?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) of the GDPR provides that:\n\n> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data...\n\nThere is no exception for having previously provided data to the same subject.'\n[Article 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) paragraph 1 provides:\n\n> The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language ...\n\nParagraph 3 of article 12 further provides that:\n\n> The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.\n\nHowever paragraph 5 of article 12 provides that\n\n> Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:\n> \n> \n> (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or\n> \n> \n> (b) refuse to act on the request.\n> \n> \n> The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.\n\nIf the data controller (DC) claims that the SAR is \"manifestly unfounded or excessive\" it can be refused, but the DC must be able to prove that this is in fact the case, if challenged..\n\nAll these provisions can be enforced by the relevant Data Protection Authority (DPA), the national regulatory agency which handles GDPR and other data protection issues. In addition, privates suits under the GDPR are authorized under [Article 82](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-82-gdpr/). Paragraphs 1 and 6 of that article provide:\n\n> 1 Any person who has suffered material or non\\-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> 6 Court proceedings for exercising the right to receive compensation shall be brought before the courts competent under the law of the Member State referred to in Article 79(2\\).\n\nSo a retaliatory refusal to respond to an SAR, or an unexplained refusal, could result in fines or other sanctions from the relevant DPA, or in a private suit, or both.",

Which of the following actions would be most appropriate for the store under GDPR regulations?\n\nA) Refuse the request outright, as the customer has already received this information recently.\nB) Comply with the request without question, as GDPR requires all SARs to be fulfilled regardless of frequency.\nC) Charge a reasonable fee for fulfilling the request, citing the repetitive nature of the SAR.\nD) Evaluate if the request is \"manifestly unfounded or excessive,\" and if so, either charge a fee or refuse the request, while being prepared to demonstrate the reasoning if challenged.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate action under GDPR. Article 12(5) of the GDPR allows data controllers to either charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on requests that are \"manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.\" However, the burden of demonstrating the unfounded or excessive nature of the request lies with the controller. This approach balances the rights of the data subject with the potential burden on the business, while still adhering to GDPR principles. \n\nOption A is incorrect because outright refusal without proper justification violates GDPR.

The NOC, as I could understand, certifies that the vehicle doesn't have any criminal offenses or pending fines in that RTO, and therefore a new registration process may be initiated. However, it is not clear what documents are needed in order to get that NOC. The list of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways mentions\n\n1. Address proof\n2. Form 28\n3.

This is typically mentioned in the original purchase receipt of the vehicle, which you must get from the first owner of the vehicle if you are purchasing it from him/her. Without this, the new RTO will not know (on paper) what road taxes have been paid while purchasing the vehicle, and will redo the calculation for the entire life of the vehicle (which is stupid and meaningless in my view, but that's what it is) which may be way more than you'd expect.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under what circumstances could failing to pay for a pizza in the United States result in arrest, and what specific charge might be applied?\n\nA) Only if the pizza was ordered for dine-in at a restaurant, with a potential charge of theft of services\nB) Only if the unpaid amount exceeds $1000, with a potential charge of grand larceny\nC) In various scenarios including delivery or dine-in, with a potential charge of defrauding an innkeeper\nD) Only if the person deliberately planned to not pay before ordering, with a potential charge of premeditated fraud\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The provided documentation shows multiple examples across different states where individuals were arrested for failing to pay for pizza, whether it was delivered or consumed at a restaurant. The charge commonly applied in these cases is \"defrauding an innkeeper.\" This offense can apply to amounts less than $1000 and doesn't require premeditation. Examples include arrests for unpaid delivery pizzas in Florida, dine-in pizzas in California, and even cases involving small amounts like a $30.36 bill. The charge of defrauding an innkeeper is not limited to dine-in situations and can apply to various scenarios where food service is provided without payment."

The Act states, \"This section applies only if and as far as a contrary intention is not expressed in the conveyance, and has effect subject to the terms of the conveyance and to the provisions therein contained.\" Therefore, by explicitly stating that Section 62 does not apply to the lease, the landlord is legally excluding its application, which is permitted by the Act itself.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while many statutory rights cannot be excluded, this particular section allows for its own exclusion. Option B is incorrect because no separate agreement is required; the clause in the lease itself is sufficient. Option D is incorrect because local housing authority approval is not required for this type of clause."

Rather, the entire discourse poetically describes a youth, presumably under the legal adult age of 18 (given restrictions on smoking cigarettes and owning adult literature in the second verse), who faces restrictions upon his or her rights by his legal guardians, in this case a mother, father, and teacher.\n\nWhereas the dictionary definition of the verb form of \"Party\" is defined by Oxford Dictionary as \"Enjoying oneself at a party or other lively gathering, typically with drinking and music.\" As established, the subject of the proposed treaty on this right is legally barred from drinking, though a party may exist without alcohol and thus would not prevent the subject from engaging in an act of partying.\n\nA party or lively gathering would meat the definition of \"Freedom of Peaceful Assembly\" under the First Amendment Rights of the United States Constitution as well as \"Freedom of Association\" under the same amendment. Said party may additionally be for any purpose so long as it is peaceful.\n\nThe state may impose reasonable restrictions on the party, such as noise ordinances, age based restrictions on minors including \"Adult Contents\", cigarettes and alchohol, as discussed. While typcial, they're absence does not prevent the assembly from rising to the level of \"party\" as previous defined.\n\nBeastie Boys contends that the restrictions place upon the subject of their discourse on the Right to Party is unreasonably restricted by the confiscation of several items, enforced school requirements, and dress code as defined by the legal guardian in their right as authority of the youth's rights. Beastie Boys offers little evidence that these restrictions are unreasonable or prevent the subject from \"partying\" as defined above. Beastie Boys do propose that the authority known as the father can not restrict the use of cigarettes by the youth as the father \"smokes two packs a day\". While Beastie Boys is correct that this meets the definition of hypocritical, the father is assumed to be of legal age to purchase cigarettes and is legal allowed to restrict access to them based on reasonable age restrictions and possible heath risks the father wishes to prevent in the youth that he may or may not be suffering from. As there are no formal requirements for a peaceful assembly to rise to the level of party, it can be presumed that these restrictions would not affect the party as defined. It should also be noted that in the Beastie Boys discourse, that the authority figure referred to as mother did not restrict the youths ability to listen to the content of the discourse, nor were any restrictions described tailored in such a fashion as to restrict the discourse specifically.\n\nWhile there is no amendment defining the right to party in the United States Constitution, the 9th Amendment does clearly state that citizens rights are not enumerated in the constitution and other rights not discussed in the constitution may exists and be claimed by the individual.\n\nFrom an originalist standpoint, it is widely accept that a good number of The Framers of the Constitution quite frequently met the accepted definition of the phrase \"Drunk off their Ass\" and thus, would not reasonably be against what can be defined as a \"party\". Additionally, many were participants in an event that was known as the \"Tea Party\", which was agreed by many to be quite the lively gathering at its time and was still viewed as quite the \"radical\" affair of the day, many wearing costumes such as those who attended in clothing traditional of Native Americans. They were also most likely not drunk during the course of this party. Thus, the intent of the framers was never to restrict or deniegn such a right\n\nThus, a reasonable court in the United States would hold that the Right to Party does exist for all U.S. citizens and is inalienable.\n\nBeastie Boys also argues that it is acceptable to fight for one's right to party. This does not conflict with the First Amendment Right to petition government for grievances so long as it is again a peaceable affair. Given the poetic nature of the discourse, we can presume that \"Fight\" would mean to defend or struggle in a non\\-violent manor for such a right. This is backed up through originalism as the restrictions placed on many citizens of Boston for their actions during the Tea Party were subsequently fought against for many years, culminating in the Constitution.\n\nThus, it can be assumed that the United States does recognize the right of the people to party and the right of the people to fight for the aforementioned right. This right would still be subject to reasonable time, manner, and place restrictions so long as said restrictions are content neutral to the message of the party.",

The analysis also notes that this right would be subject to reasonable restrictions, such as noise ordinances or age-based restrictions, as long as these restrictions are content-neutral.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the right to party is not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution and can be subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the Beastie Boys' song is used as a cultural reference point in the analysis, not as a legally binding definition.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation specifically states that alcohol is not a necessary component for an event to be considered a party, and that parties can exist without alcohol."

Even though the daughter was driving, it was the mother who owned the car and suffered the financial loss when selling the damaged vehicle. The lawsuit would be based on the diminution in value - the difference between what the car sold for in its damaged state versus what it hypothetically would have sold for if undamaged. The driver (daughter) did not incur direct financial loss, so she would not have grounds to sue. The fact that the car has been sold does not prevent a lawsuit, but it does complicate proving the exact amount of damages. The repair estimate is not directly relevant, as the cost was never incurred. Instead, evidence would need to be presented showing how the accident affected the sale price of the vehicle."
