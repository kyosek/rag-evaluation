This means that the tenant of a rental unit finds someone else to rent their unit from them for a period of time. Therefore, in a sublet the original tenant becomes a master tenant and the new tenant becomes a subtenant. ...\n> \n> \n> Subletting your unit is very risky. In a way, it is the worst of both worlds, because you have both the obligations of a landlord and of a tenant.\n> ...\n> \n> \n> In a sublet the landlord still has obligations to you, and the landlord can also claim against you as well as the person you have sublet to. If there is a dispute between a subtenant and master tenant it has to be re\\- solved through Residential Tenancies. Similarly, if you are a subtenant, you can file a Residential Tenancies claim against either the landlord or the master tenant.\n\nAlso, note that Section 2(d) of the Residential Tenancies Act specifically applies to situations where only part of a unit is rented (bolding mine):\n\n> \u201cresidential premises\u201d includes any house, dwelling, apartment, flat, tenement, manufactured home, land\\-lease community, manufactured home space or other place that is occupied or may be occupied by an individual as a residence **or that part of any such place that is or may be occupied by an individual as a residence**...\n\n(I have omitted the list of exceptions which follow, but they do not seem to apply to a \"rented room\" situation.)\n\nTaken together, it appears that a full landlord\\-tenant relationship would exist in the situation you describe. The only caveat is that it appears that the landlord and subtenant can, in principle, file suit against each other in case of dispute (as well as against the \"master tenant\".)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Nova Scotia, Alice rents a 3-bedroom apartment from a landlord. She then sublets one room to Bob, who shares the kitchen and bathroom with Alice. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal relationships in this situation?\n\nA) Bob has no legal tenant rights because he's sharing common areas with Alice.\nB) Bob has a landlord-tenant relationship only with Alice, not with Alice's landlord.\nC) Bob has a landlord-tenant relationship with Alice's landlord, but not with Alice.\nD) Bob has landlord-tenant relationships with both Alice and Alice's landlord, and can file a Residential Tenancies claim against either of them.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the Nova Scotia Residential Tenancies Act and the interpretation provided by Dalhousie University Legal Aid Service, the situation described creates a complex web of landlord-tenant relationships. Bob, as a subtenant, has a landlord-tenant relationship with Alice (the master tenant). However, the Act also recognizes Bob as a tenant in relation to Alice's landlord, as he is occupying part of the residential premises. \n\nThe Act does not provide exceptions for situations where tenants share common areas, unlike some other provinces. Furthermore, the Dalhousie guide explicitly states that a subtenant can file a Residential Tenancies claim against either the landlord or the master tenant. This means Bob has legal recourse against both Alice and her landlord, effectively establishing landlord-tenant relationships with both parties.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they fail to capture the full extent of the legal relationships established in this subletting situation under Nova Scotia law."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57943/is-it-possible-to-bypass-ccpa-using-eula", "docs_id": 57943, "title": "Is it possible to bypass CCPA using EULA", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to avoid CCPA by using an EULA that explicitly bans users with residence location or relation to California?\nBy writing that the app is not intended to target californians and that they are not allowed I am no longer targeting californians nor am I offering services to them which means CCPA should not apply.In case they breach this I should get money from them as the person suffers fines(damages) because of the user so he must pay for it under breach of contract.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nThe [law](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) applies to all residents of California dealing with all businesses that meet the criteria.\n\nYou cannot contract outside the law so any provision in your EULA that attempted to exclude the law would be void and the existence of such a clause could possibly put you in breech of laws prohibiting misleading and deceptive conduct.\n\n> Businesses cannot make you waive these rights, and any contract provision that says you waive these rights is unenforceable.\n\nWhile you could, in theory, refuse to deal with Californians, that faces a number of difficulties:\n\n* it applies to Californians no matter where they are so geolocation is a bust (without even considering the widespread use of VPNs)\n* if you ask, and a Californian lies; well, they are in breach of contract but you are in breach of the law.

The bank (or whoever owned the loan) had already sent notices and tried other options. They had to do quite a bit of detective work to find the owner. The owner had also gotten plenty of notices in the mail and probably a visit from someone trying to collect, so they were already on the lookout. Simply by the law of averages, a couple of mistakes have to happen.\n\nMy question is\n\n1. What happens when a car that is legally owned by someone is \"repossessed\"? Is the repo man charged with theft?\n2. What happens to personal items in the car? For example, a laptop in a book\\-bag.\n3. How does the rightful owner go about getting the car back? Do they file a police report?\n4. Are there special statutes that protect repo men from honest mistakes?\n\nThere were several popular \"repo shows\" in the early 2000s. Most of them were staged, but I believe some showed real repos, at least at first. I believe most of the shows filmed in Florida or California. I don't doubt sometimes repo men played a bit fast and loose with the rules. Repo was generally the final option after notices and visits from collectors had failed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is it a crime for a repo man to accidentally repo the wrong car?\n\nNot unless the car was retained after the accidental repossession was discovered, and then, only by the person retaining it (as the repo man may have turned over the car to the creditor whose loan on a similar car is in default).\n\nGenerally speaking, taking property of another with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property of it is a crime only if one knows that the property is the property of another.\n\nFor example, if two people leave black umbrellas in an entry room and someone accidentally leaves with the wrong one, the taking of the wrong umbrella is not a crime.\n\nWhether the repo man's assertion that he accidentally took the wrong car is credible is a question of fact to be determined at trial, if the prosecution doubts him. If he was supposed to repossess a 1936 Ford and he repossessed a 2021 Tesla, the repo man is probably going to lose and be convicted of theft. If he was supposed to repossess a white 2021 Tesla and he repossessed a different white 2021 Tesla in the same neighborhood with a license plate from the same state as the one he was supposed to repossess, he has a very good chance of prevailing.\n\nHowever, once someone learns that they have taken the wrong property, they have a duty to return the property promptly to the owner upon request, and probably, to notify the owner (if the owner can be determined) and the authorities who were informed that a different vehicle was taken, promptly. Otherwise, the originally good faith mistake becomes theft.\n\nIf the repo man's explanation is convincing, he is not likely to be charged with theft, even though no special law applies. What makes the repo man special is that he did have permission from the secured car loan creditor to repossess it due to the secured car loan debtor's default by the Uniform Commercial Code. If he had taken the right car without a breach of the peace, the Uniform Commercial Code would have absolved him of liability and given him legal permission to do so.\n\nIf the repo had been of the right car, the creditor would have had a duty to promptly return the personal possession in the car in which it did not have a lien to the rightful owner. This conclusion doesn't change when the repo man accidentally takes the wrong car.\n\nWhile the repo man's mistake was not knowing or intentional, it was probably negligent to repossess the car without carefully confirming the VIN number and license plate to make sure that he was repossessing the correct car. As a result, the car own probably has a claim against both the repo man (whose negligence caused the wrongful repossession) and the creditor (for whom he was acting as an agent to repossess the car) for any damages caused to the owner of the wrongfully repossessed car, including damages to the vehicle and damages from loss of use of the car and possibly damages for emotional distress caused by thinking that his car had been stolen or by missing a non\\-economic opportunity that he could have had if the car had not been wrongfully taken (e.g. if this caused the car owner to miss the funeral of the car owner's father).\n\nThe creditor and the repo man probably have insurance policies in place that cover legal defense of such claims and also economic settlements or money judgments entered on that kind of claim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A repo man accidentally repossesses the wrong car, a white 2021 Tesla, instead of a similar white 2021 Tesla he was supposed to repossess in the same neighborhood.

In those cases, they seem more likely to, for example, accept to remove the source for a defamation claim, despite everything in the written or recorded statement being true, when compared to wealthier people.\n\nAnd if the situation was reversed, there is a decent chance that they might not even sue. I'm not sure how true it is, but it seems common amongst the people around me that having more money tends to give you a better chance in court, because your lawyer tends to have more experience, a better team around them from being in a bigger law firm, etc.\n\nWith those factors in mind, it appears to me that money is an obstacle that prevents some people from benefitting from the law as much as other people, going against the article above as it creates an unequal benefit of the law, based on the money you make.\n\nBut, clearly I haven't seen many people in Canada, or any country that I am aware of with an equal protection clause, that legal fees are unconstitutional, and thus should be removed, which leads me to believe that they are probably constitutional.\n\nSo, why aren't legal fees being a barrier of entry unconstitutional? How does it not go against the equal protection clause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> How does it not go against the equal protection clause?\n\nPeople had argued poverty is an analogous ground but it is not recognized. You may find the arguments outlined in *[William Head Institution v. Canada (Commissioner of Corrections)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/1999/1999canlii7643/1999canlii7643.html#document)* useful to respond to your question, but you certainly do not have to agree with those arguments.\n\nThe main arguments there include\n\n1. The Charter is not a document designed to protect economic rights and freedoms, in so far that \"the worth and dignity of the human person\" is not threatened.\n2. Poor people form a disparate and heterogenous group without a central *personal* characteristic. The Charter protects \"discrete and insular minorities\".\n3. Poverty is not immutable and changing it does not come with unacceptable personal cost; in fact, most people would be happy to become not poor.\n\nIt is also necessary to understand section 15 or the constitution is not designed to *create* a \"perfect\" society. They must be read in conjunction of social and political \"progress\" or understandings of the society and interpreted so that it is \"practical\" and \"pragmatic\" under such understandings.\n\nDirecting government policies in minute details are not the role of the constitution or the judiciary. Taking to the extreme, the equal protection requirement could require the government to assess all its policies at an individual level to ensure literally everyone does not benefit more than any other person under any law. But most people do not believe that should be done and it will paralyze essentially all governing activities.\n\nAs another answer has showed, court fees can be unconstitutional for other reasons. But in general, court fees serve an important purpose to fund the judicial system and encourage non\\-judicial resolutions of disputes so reasonably compensated judges can have a reasonable caseload; in some sense, the courts are self\\-serving (but also serve the interests of the society in general so everyone is not suing everyone for every small things).\n\n> With those factors in mind, it appears to me that money is an obstacle that prevents some people from benefitting from the law as much as other people, going against the article above as it creates an unequal benefit of the law, based on the money you make.\n\nThe above is by no means a justification of barriers of access in the justice system.

Key arguments for this position include that poor people do not form a discrete and insular minority with immutable personal characteristics, and that poverty is not considered immutable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Charter is not primarily focused on protecting economic rights and freedoms, but rather on protecting fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because poverty has not been recognized as an analogous ground for discrimination under Section 15 of the Charter.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the constitution does not require the government to ensure all laws benefit every individual equally in a literal sense.

One refers to the study of linguistic structure as it pertains to legal interpretation (i.e. testifying as to what a law says), and the other, the sense you have in mind, pertains to testifying as an expert about legally relevant facts at a trial. In the US, the relevant rule is [FRE 702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702). There is no need for a special certificate, and most forensic phoneticians do not have certificates. The presiding judge will make a determination whether you are qualified as an expert. In practice, this comes down to showing that you do actually have relevant specialized knowledge, so you would submit a resume indicating the degrees, publications and practical experience you have in the area. Since judges aren't particularly tuned into details of the field, they tend to allow testimony from people who pass the basic sniff test for expertise. The bulk of the \"work\" in being a forensic phonetician is the scientific quality of their testimony, e.g. are you able to show that voiceprint evidence is so unreliable that it should not be trusted (assuming it is even allowed). It is my understanding that most FP experts are professionally in law enforcement, e.g. work for FBI labs; but, regular phoneticians might be contacted by an attorney.\n\n\"Certificates\" are available from various companies, and might impress someone; one would be better off in an academic program from an established university (Cardiff for example).

The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 702) govern the qualification of expert witnesses. The judge presiding over the case will make the determination of whether an individual is qualified as an expert based on their specialized knowledge, education, experience, and practical expertise in the field. While certificates from companies or academic programs may be beneficial, they are not mandatory.

If so, how would the statement of cause and demand for relief differ for each tort?\n\nOr if they would not be used in the same pleading, can you provide minimal examples that would discriminate between the most applicable tort?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: FYI, I'm not an attorney, this isn't legal advice, and you should seek an attorney in your jurisdiction if you have a real legal concern or potential case. \n\n**Detinue**\n\n[Detinue](https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/detinue/) seeks recovery of a piece of property that has been wrongfully held or retained (distinguished from replevin which seeks recovery of property that has been wrongfully taken). Under detinue, the defendant received the property legally and the plaintiff never had to have the property in the first place (so, say you have something that I am supposed to receive, but I've never had it and you won't give it to me). \n\n**Conversion**\n\nConversion occurs when one purposely interferes with another's personal property. The plaintiff must show that he owns or has the right to have the item at the time it's interfered with, that the defendant's interference with it was intentional, that the interference deprived the plaintiff of possession or use of the item, and that the interference caused damages to the plaintiff. \n\nSay I swipe a document off of your desk and walk out with it. Within 30 seconds, it would be unlikely you could claim conversion. Why? Because there had not yet been any damages to you. Now, if I had that document for three hours and you were supposed to file it in court for a deadline or something, and you could show I intentionally took it (aka did not mistakenly believe it was mine), you may then have a claim. \n\nAlso, conversion can happen if you receive an item from somebody who was not authorized to give it away from you. \n\n**Trespass to Chattels**\n\nThis is an intentional and wrongful interference with another's possession of property. The difference between this and conversion is about the degree of interference. Trespass to chattels can be found where one merely challenges another's right of possession. However, if the offending party exercises \"dominion and control\" over the item, it's likely conversion. \n\nTo return to the document example, if I had it for those 30 seconds, you may not be able to claim conversion, as I stated, but you *may* be able to claim trespass to chattels in that situation. \n\nAnother example, for clarity's sake: someone steals your car and you recover it within 20 minutes. Probably trespass to chattels. Someone steals your car and sells it to another person. Probably conversion. \n\n**Single Cause of Action?**\n\nDetinue is almost in complete disuse, so you in fact may not need to worry about it. Most jurisdictions have statutes for the recovery of personal property which have largely superseded detinue. Detinue is an action to recover personal property belonging to the plaintiff. Trover is an action for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. Mixed in with all this is replevin, which is an action where a party seeks the return of an item that was taken wrongfully pending the final determination by the court of its true owner (maintaining the status quo until it's figured out who should be entitled to keep it).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A local art collector, Alice, lends a valuable painting to her friend Bob for a month.

It also typically applies when the defendant received the property legally and the plaintiff never had possession, which is not the case here.\n\nB) Conversion is the most appropriate action in this scenario. Bob has intentionally interfered with Alice's personal property (the painting) by refusing to return it after the agreed period. This action deprives Alice of possession and use of her property, which are key elements of conversion.\n\nC) Trespass to chattels involves a lesser degree of interference than conversion. While it might apply in the initial stages of Bob's refusal, the extended and complete deprivation of the painting makes conversion more appropriate.\n\nD) Replevin is typically used to recover property that was wrongfully taken, pending a final determination of ownership.

Both are retail sales. A retail sale is a sale for use rather than a wholesale sale for resale. Wholesale sales are exempt from sales tax and so are easy to distinguish. Online sales are still retail sales. It is a distinction without a difference.\n\nSales and Use Tax Law \u00a7 6007(a)(1\\) and common law case law would suffice. There is also case law under the UCC, and the relevant federal statutes. But, I doubt that the argument of the vendor would be that it didn't make a retail sale (at least once their lawyers got involved). More importantly, there is nothing that says that online sales aren't retail sales.\n\nBob should contact the online sales department to seek a remedy since he was advised by the company to contact that department. But the part of the company handling his complaint doesn't change his rights.\n\nWarranty rights don't depend upon the intent of the parties. If a warranty arises and it good isn't as warranted, there is a legal right to a remedy.\n\nIf a store doesn't honor one's legal warranty rights, then you sue the store for damages, typically, in a court of limited jurisdiction, or if there is an arbitration clause, in a consumer arbitration forum (some of which are not actively doing business due to controversies in recent years, leaving a judicial forum open).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Bob purchases a consumer good from Corp's physical store in California, but is later told by Corp that his purchase was actually an \"online sale\" when he tries to return the defective item.

Whether the sale is classified as in-store or online is irrelevant to Bob's consumer rights in this situation. Both are considered retail sales under California law. A retail sale is defined as a sale for use rather than resale, and this definition applies to both online and in-person transactions. Bob retains his consumer rights, including warranty rights, regardless of how Corp categorizes the sale internally. The company's attempt to redirect Bob to the online sales department does not change his legal rights or the nature of the transaction as a retail sale. If Corp fails to honor Bob's warranty rights, he can pursue legal action to enforce those rights, regardless of which department Corp claims should handle the complaint."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76791/are-fictional-races-from-a-video-game-universe-protected-by-copyright", "docs_id": 76791, "title": "Are fictional races from a video game universe protected by copyright?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For instance, the Warcraft Universe contains fictional races (various), such as the Orcs, Humans, Night Elves, Blood Elves, Tauren, etc. Are these races considered \"original works\" to fall under copyright law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, but \u2026\n----------\n\nMost fantasy races you named are part of long\\-standing folklore and any copyright the author had has long since expired.

You are not charged, you are just accused of this related and greater crime. This tactic even has a special name: [Hitojichi shih\u014d](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitojichi_shih%C5%8D). Someone they want to investigate for murder can be first imprisoned to *investigate the deposit of the corpse*, then for the actual *murder*, for a total of 46 days maximum \\- and if the DA isn't creative to get some other lesser included charges in. Against some Yakuza, some DAs allegedly managed to chain up much more.\n\nHowever, those 23 days (per investigation) are all the pre\\-trial investigative confinement that the state gets before a trial \\- the moment the formal charge is entered, the trial has to begin soon after... However, the state also often has the arrestee's confession at that point \\- partially because a creative DA might manage to keep you nigh permanently and in part because you don't have the right to have your attorney at your side during questioning in Japan. This is partially the reason why Japanese courts have such a crazy high conviction rate: more than 99% of the cases brought by DAs are convictions, in most cases using the confession obtained in the pre\\-charge detention as a piece of key evidence.\n\n[england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are a suspect of **terrorism**, you can be kept for **up to 14 days** before you need to be either charged or released, [as Rick explains much better](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/84027/10334). **Generally, 24 hours or 96 hours for serious crimes**, starting at the arrest hours, apply.\n\n[european\\-union](/questions/tagged/european-union \"show questions tagged 'european-union'\")\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe EU has the [European Convention on Human Rights (Art. 5 III)](https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf):\n\n> Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the\n> provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought\n> promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to\n> exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a\n> reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be\n> conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\n\nHowever, what is Promptly is dependant on what the countries implementing say it is. As an example, let's take a (closer) look at Germany.\n\n### [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nWhile you can be in *investigative confinement* (Untersuchungshaft / U\\-Haft) for months or up to a year typically, you need to be already officially charged and a judge has to affirm you are in U\\-Haft. This decision that you need to be in confinement needs to be repeated regularily in case of long investigative confinements. This Investigative Confinement, \"Untersuchungshaft\", is defined in [STPO \u00a7112](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stpo/__112.html) (\\~process regulations for criminal trials), and *usually* is limited to about 6 months before the suspect is to be released or be at trial, but in extremely difficult cases it can be extended by special motion in the layer of Oberlandesgericht, which is about the highest state court. Still, while an extension to 9 or 12 months is possible, there can be cases where this may be extended even further, even if that might not be entirely correct on *other* grounds \\- there had been appeals to the European court for human rights about such.\n\nOn the other hand, once a trial starts and the court sees a flight risk or that you might pose a potential danger, you stay in (or are taken into) Untersuchungshaft for the duration of the trial. That is different from pre\\-trial Untersuchungshaft, in that you can't appeal on that your trial didn't start yet. In either case of Untersuchungshaft, any and all confinement is counted as time served, like the case of [Fritz Teufel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Teufel). In his case, his trial was seriously delayed and he was in Untersuchungshaft for 5 years **before** they convicted him to 5 years. In the end, he had already served all the due time due to the investigatory confinement, so he was released almost on the spot \\- just a little bit of paperwork and he was out..\n\nNow, that is all *court\\-ordered* confinement. How far can we get **without** the court? What does Germany count as *prompt*?\n\nSo, unless you have been put into investigative confinement by court order, **you have to be released at the end of the day after you were arrested**. End of the day is defined as midnight by the general rules. So if you were arrested Monday, 1st of January at 00:01, you are to be released on Tuesday, 2nd of January, 24:00\\. So, the absolute maximum confinement outside of the daylight\\-saving change day is 47 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds until you need to have been seen by a judge, but because it is nigh impossible to get to see a judge between 16:00 and 24:00, the typical confinement till you are formally charged and possibly transferred to Untersuchungshaft is usually less.

If damage wasn't present at the beginning but is now present, that indicates (but doesn't prove) that you broke it.\n\nThe protocol should be factually correct, and ideally include photos of any relevant aspects (e.g. dirt, scratches). If there are disagreements, both standpoints should be noted. By signing you confirm that the protocol is correct, so you shouldn't sign if you think the protocol is too vague or misleading. It is not legally required to make or sign such a protocol, but when done correctly it protects both parties: it lets the landlord charge you as necessary to fix your damage, but also protects you from charges relating to things that were not listed as damaged in the protocol\n\nIn this case, it seems that no protocol was made at the start of the lease. This makes it difficult to prove \u2013 for either party \u2013 what you actually damaged. If you can't settle this between yourselves, the landlord would have to sue you. They have six months to file a lawsuit, so they can keep the deposit until these things are settled. But they should really provide an itemized bill of the actual costs. If there are no remaining disputes, courts sometimes require the deposit to be returned more quickly, e.g. within two or thee months.\n\nJust as the landlord can sue you, you can use the legal system to get your deposit back. The first step towards court collection proceedings would be to write a dunning letter in which you request repayment within some reasonable deadline (e.g. two weeks), and in which you note that the joint walkthrough of the flat did not show any damage that wasn't already there upon moving in. This should be sent via certified mail, not email. The landlord would then have to dispute the debt, otherwise you can go to a lawyer to help you request a court order.\n\nWhile the legal route might not be prohibitively expensive, it probably isn't worth the effort. Instead, make sure that the landlord has your current address so that you can communicate via mail instead of email (important so that you can react if they do try to sue you). Insist on an itemized bill. Offer to settle for some amount between what you really owe and what they claim \u2013 probably still cheaper than involving lawyers.\n\nThe Schufa is the German credit rating agency. Businesses and landlords notify Schufa when you don't pay your bills. To rent a flat in Germany, you are effectively required to have a clean Schufa report. In this case, the landlord doesnt' (yet) have grounds to report anything to Schufa because there is no undisputed debt. You can access the reports on your Schufa profile four times per year without cost via a GDPR data subject access request (*DSGVO\\-Anfrage*).

While French law does have a \"duty to rescue\" provision, it typically applies to situations where a person is physically present and able to render immediate assistance without putting themselves in danger. Being so far away and only witnessing events via Skype calls does not create a legal obligation to act under the duty to rescue law.

If you are arrested, you will be given the opportunity to call an attorney. You do not give testimony when police ask you questions, you give testimony in court.

Then go into any interactions with the police apprised of the risks.\n\nSuppose you witness a robbery and the perps escape in a car: the police ask if you saw them, and where they went. You should not lie, because that is a crime. It would be good to help the police in this situation: is there any risk to you? Do they think maybe that you are involved in the crime? I think the relevant distinction is between being asked information questions, and being interrogated. If you are being interrogated, lawyer up. Even if you are free to go, they may still be interrogating you, and you may not know that when you are not being detained, you have to explicitly invoke your right to silence if they casually imply that you've committed a crime (this is the adoptive admissions thing, not widely known by non\\-law people). \n\nThe reason why many people advocate lawyering up is that the risks arising from not getting competent advice are high.

There are search firms that will do such searches for a client, and also search for marks in use but not registered, for a fee.\n\nTrademark protection is generally restricted by the type of product or service involved. An anti\\-virus program, say, called \"Guard dog\" would probably not interfere with a fantasy game called \"Guardog\". A private security service of the same name would pretty surely not interfere.\n\nThe range of protection depends on how widely known the product is, but \"software related\" is a very wide area, and except for famous marks, a mark protected in connection with one area of software will not be protected in a very different area of software.\n\nNames that a purely invented, such as Kodak, are more strongly protected than descriptive marks such as \"Best Pizza\"\n\nParticularly famous names such as \"Microsoft\" get additional protection even outside their usual areas, so \"Microsoft Pizza\" might be a problem.\n\nLogos and other graphic marks can also be protected as trademarks, but that is not what the question asked about.\n\nThe styling of a trademark, such as a particular font, choice of colors, and so on, can also be protected.

No other things are similar, no character names, no similar story, nothing at all. Just both are about space.** So I expect the same answer? ;)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: General Rules\n-------------\n\nThe rules on this vary somewhat by country. In some counties the is no trademark protection unless a mark is formally registers. In others use \"in trade\" offers a degree of protection even in the absence of registration. The US follows the second rule. Some of Europe follows the first.\n\nBut in pretty much all countries trademarks (aka trade marks) are only protected when they are \"used in commerce\" and are only protected against other uses \"in commerce\". This mans that a phrase or design or other possible mark is only protected when it is functioning as a mark, that is it is used by the maker to identify or advertise a product or service (hereafter I use \"product\" to mean either or both).\n\nMoreover a mark is only protected when an alleged infringer uses the mark (or a similar mark) in such a way that people might reasonably be confused into thinking that the infringer's product comes from the same source as the products of the owner of the mark, or is approved, sponsored, or endorsed by the owner of the mark.\n\nA simple literary or pop\\-culture reference is normally not trademark infringement. This is both because a well\\-known phrase is not usually protectable as a mark at all, and because a reference to it is normally not infringement, even if the mark is protected.\n\nThe likelihood of confusion is a very important concept in trademark cases.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThe phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" Is often used as a reference to the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels. But it was never used to brand or advertise those stories, so its use in a novel or video game now would not be infringement. Even if a game used that phrase as a title, it would not be infringement, because the phrase is not protected. All this would still be true even if the Sherlock Holmes stories were still being published.\n\nThe tagline \"In space, no one can here you scream\" was used extensively to advertise the movie *Alien*. It had some protection as a mark (in the US), and might well have been registered for fuller protection (I haven't checked the US register of trademarks, or any other for this phrase). A game titled with this phrase might well be infringing. A game where a character speaks the phrase at some point probably will not be infringing.\n\nCaution\n-------\n\nAll that said, exactly where the limits of infringement lie depend on the detailed factual situation.

Is\n> this a title insurance situation?\n\nYou aren't far from the mark, but keep in mind that in the U.S. title to real property is not represented by a certificate for a particular geographic area as it is in most of the U.K. and Australia, for example (the modern U.K. land title system was actually invented in Australia). So, unlike those jurisdictions, the full legal description of what you own may not be consolidated into a single, up to date document.\n\nInstead, in the U.S., people file various documents with the real property records (usually maintained on a county level) of the county where the property is located. These records are indexed by grantee and grantor, not by geographic location.\n\nSo, in this case, someone would file a plat for the subdivision you live in and that is a matter of public record. Later on the state transportation department would bring an eminent domain proceeding to seize property for public use in exchange for fair compensation, or would negotiate a non\\-court ordered sale of the land. The decree transferring the property in an eminent domain proceeding and/or the deed transferring the land to the state, would have been recorded in the real property records. But, if there was a discrepancy between how the owner of the property was described in the deed giving that owner title to the property and the name of the owner in the eminent domain matter, this decree or deed or a replat of the land might not get properly indexed.\n\nIf the land was taken while you owned it, you should have received notice of the eminent domain lawsuit, although if you ignored it or failed to realize its significance, a default judgment could have been entered against you in that case with no further notice to you.\n\nIf you purchased the land after the land was taken in a commercial real estate transaction, a title company should have identified the recorded documents that took that land away from you and that limitation should be listed in the deed by which you took title\n\nSometimes the deed will simply reference \"all easements of record\" since the state highway interest will often be a very restrictive easement rather than outright ownership, since this costs the state less to acquire than outright ownership.\n\nIf there is not some reference in the title commitment and the deed conveying the land to you, that references the land that the state took for the highway, then you have a title insurance claim against the title insurance company if this limitation was omitted from the title commitment, and you would have a claim for breach of warranty of title to every prior seller conveying by a warranty deed (which is the norm in arms length sales of real estate for fair market value) that omitted the land taken from the highway after the state took that land.\n\nThe designation of the land taken, if it is actually an easement, wouldn't change the legal description of the property although the existing of the easement would have to be mentioned, at least in a general sense (\"*subject to all easements of record*\") in the deed, and in a specific sense with a copy of instrument creating the easement in the title commitment. The draft title commitment would normally be disclosed pursuant to a real estate contract prior to closing, with an out from the contract available if the title work revealed had an unacceptable problem.\n\nEven if the land was taken outright, the change in the legal description could be subtle, such as \"Lot 1, Block 23 of the *Amended and Restated* Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 456, page 128\\.\" And might not note that the original legal description was \"Lot 1, Block 23 of the Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 34, Page 456\\.\"\n\nThe change could also be stated as a reservation or limitations on the original property description, such as \"Lot 1, Block 23 of the Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 34, Page 456, *subject to* the decree of the Hill Valley County District Court recorded at Book 455, Page 100\\.\"\n\n> Apart from the missing land.

If you think that the money offered is too small for the fair market value of the property you should consider hiring a lawyer and your own appraiser to context the valuation.\n\nBut, as you note, if the trees in question are \"are already in the right of way or on their land depending on which survey is used\" then you don't own them and aren't entitled to compensation from the state for taking the trees. Again, this should have been mentioned five years ago in a title commitment and if it wasn't you may have a warranty of title and/or title insurance claim to compensate you for land you thought you were buying but didn't actually own.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John purchased a property 5 years ago with a deed describing the boundary as 50 feet from the center of a state highway.

Now the state is improving the highway again and taking another 17 feet without compensating John for the mature trees in this area.

The situation described suggests a potential title defect that should have been discovered and disclosed during the property purchase 5 years ago.

The matter is mildly obscured by two facts. First, the movie was based on an earlier German book and was adapted without permission. For a while, this was okay because of details of German copyright law, then the US 9th Circuit court decided in [Twin Books Corp. v. Walt Disney Co](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1304377.html)., 83 F.3d 1162 that the original work did not fall into the public domain in the US. However, the artwork in the movie was indisputably created by Disney in 1942\\. Then the question would be whether copyright protection has lapsed. The [rules for duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States#Duration_of_copyright) of protection of works created before 1978 are complex, but under the circumstance that Disney followed the rules for publication and registration, copyright expires in 2037\\.

The copyright holder (Disney) retains rights to the artistic representation of these animals as they appear in the film. Even \"deconstructed\" or inspired versions could potentially infringe on Disney's copyright. The artist being based in the UK does not exempt them from copyright laws, as international copyright agreements exist. It's advisable to obtain permission from Disney for any designs inspired by or featuring elements from their films to avoid potential legal issues.

Some places, it seems, it might be illegal as vandalism; some places, it seems it's totally fine, and some places, it seems, are contingent upon enforcement. \n\nPlease help me, Law Stack Exchange. Is it safe to unchain my inner six year old? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have bad news. California's vandalism law prohibits maliciously:\n\n* defacing property with graffiti\n* defacing property with inscribed material\n* damaging property\n* destroying property\n\nChalking the sidewalk probably doesn't sound very malicious, but maliciousness includes \u201can intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d So the questions is whether you intended to do a wrongful act \\-\\- meaning that you intended to do the act, which happens to be wrongful, not that you intended to act wrongfully. So unless you drew on the sidewalk accidentally, the malicious\\-intent requirement isn't going to help you.\n\nSo then you have to ask if your conduct is described by the statute. In [*Mackinney v. Nielsen*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1464004.html), the Ninth Circuit said that sidewalk chalking did not violate the law, but California has since amended the law to add the \"deface with graffiti\" language. I haven't seen any chalk cases since then, but another case, [*In re Nicholas Y.*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1130080.html), from the Second District, dealt with someone who used a marker on a window. He argued that it could be easily erased, but the court said it was still vandalism because:\n\n* it \"mars the surface with graffiti which must be removed in order to restore the original condition\"\n* the definition of \"deface\" \"does not incorporate an element of permanence\"\n* \"marring of the surface is no less a defacement because it is more easily removed.\"\n\nGiven that language, I'd argue that the vandalism statute includes sidewalk chalking.\n\nBut one important element here is that most sidewalks are owned or controlled by the government, so any effort to restrict \"expressive conduct such as writing with chalk\" ([Guilliford v. Pierce County](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19981481136f3d134511292)) expressive activity\" there must comply with the First Amendment.\n\nThe government has varying degrees of latitude on the restrictions it can impose, depending on the character of the space involved. So in a courtroom, whose function is incompatible with free\\-wheeling public debate, a judge can set quite a few rules about how people may speak. But sidewalks are considered a \"public forum,\" where the government's ability to regulate speech is a lot more limited.\n\nSo how does the First Amendment apply?\n\nThere's a D.C. Circuit case (*[Mahoney v. Doe](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1571470.html)*) dealing with abortion protesters who wanted to use chalk on the streets and sidewalks outside the White House. Police told them they would be arrested for violating D.C.'s defacement statute, so they brought a First Amendment challenge. The court upheld the law, saying that it satisfied all three prongs of the public\\-forum test:\n\n1. **The law must be content neutral**, meaning that it prohibits conduct without reference to what is being said. The Court said the defacement statute was content neutral because people could be prosecuted regardless of what they wrote or drew.\n2. **The law must be narrowly tailored**, meaning that it serves a significant governmental interest and does not restrict more speech than is necessary to achieve that goal. The Court said the defacement statute was narrowly tailored because it served the government's interest in maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the area in front of the White House and didn't restrict any speech that does not deface public property.\n3. **The law must leave open ample alternatives for communication**, meaning that even if you can't express yourself in the way restricted, you still have meaningful opportunities to express yourself. The Court said the defacement statute law allowed adequate alternatives for communication because the group could still congregate, march, speak, hold signs, and hand out leaflets.\n\nThere's an interesting wrinkle there in terms of whether the interest in aesthetics is heightened because we're talking about the White House, but generally speaking, aesthetic concerns can still justify speech restrictions. \n\nSo the bad news is that unchaining your inner six\\-year\\-old may subject you to criminal liability. That leaves the question of whether you want to unleash your inner teenager and do it anyway.

According to the information provided, California's vandalism law prohibits maliciously defacing property with graffiti or inscribed material, damaging property, or destroying property. While chalking may not seem malicious, the legal definition of \"maliciousness\" includes the intent to do a wrongful act, even if the person didn't intend to act wrongfully.\n\nThe case In re Nicholas Y. established that even easily removable markings can be considered vandalism, as the act of defacement doesn't require permanence. This interpretation could potentially apply to sidewalk chalking.\n\nHowever, because most sidewalks are government property and considered public forums, there are First Amendment considerations. The government's ability to restrict expressive activities in these areas is limited. Any restrictions must be content-neutral, narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels for communication.\n\nWhile option A might seem plausible due to First Amendment protections, it's not always true that sidewalk chalking is legal. Option B is incorrect because California law doesn't explicitly permit chalking, and the content's offensiveness is not the determining factor. Option D is also incorrect because, as established in In re Nicholas Y., ease of removal doesn't determine legality.\n\nTherefore, C is the most accurate answer, reflecting the complex legal status of sidewalk chalking in California, which could potentially be considered vandalism while also involving First Amendment considerations."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46602/is-the-car-in-my-possession-part-of-my-household-effects", "docs_id": 46602, "title": "Is the car in my possession part of my household effects?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Netherlands have [a tax on the acquisition or import of private motor vehicles (BPM)](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/cars/bpm/) which can be fairly expensive depending on what car you have.\n\nI am moving from Germany to the Netherlands and planned to bring my car with me.

What is the attorney's ethical obligation in this situation?\n\nA) The attorney must inform the wife about the invalid check, as she is considered a party to the transaction.\nB) The attorney has no obligation to the wife, as she is an adverse party to the husband.\nC) The attorney should only inform the husband about the invalid check and let him decide how to proceed.\nD) The attorney must inform all parties involved in the transaction about the invalid check to avoid assisting in a potentially fraudulent act.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly Rules 4.1 and 4.3. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Rule 4.1 requires lawyers to avoid assisting in fraudulent acts by disclosing material facts to third parties when necessary.\n2. The post-dated check is a material fact that could potentially lead to a fraudulent transaction if not addressed.\n3. While the wife is unrepresented, Rule 4.3 suggests that the lawyer should not take advantage of her lack of representation.\n4. By informing all parties, the lawyer maintains ethical integrity without overstepping bounds or showing preference to any party.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the wife is not the attorney's client, and directly advising her could violate Rule 4.3.

Tam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matal_v._Tam), the phohibitation of the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage\" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols was ruled Unconstititutional. At issue, Tam, the bassist and founder of an all Asian\\-American band that was named after a slur for Asians (the linked article contains the Band Name, but to avoid a possible rule violation, I will not use the actual term). Tam was unable to register the trademark for his band due to the term being a slur, despite the bands intention to use the term in a re\\-appropriated manner.\n\nSCOTUS held that the act was unconstitutional and that Trademark protection did not constitute government speech beyond that the specific mark was registered with the government and thus protected. The decision found 9\\-0 in favor of Tam. (The case gained some fame as it immediately ended litigation on the name of Washington D.C. NFL football team as well).\n\nThe other famous case is that of [Jacobellis v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio) which held obsecenity is not protected speech, but that obscenity is to be determined by the most local levels of government. After all, what is Not Obscene to Los Angeles could be highly obscene to the Amish in Pennsylvania (Basically, no opinion was agreed too, but this was concurred with and every Justice held a concurring opinion). This case is famous for Justice Potter Stewart's concurring opinion, in which he stated obscenity should be limited to only Hard Core Porn, but famously did not offer a legal definition of that term beyond \"I know it when I see it \\[and the motion picture involved in this case is not that].\" Basically, check your local limits for guidance, as there is no federal or state law to help discuss this.\n\nFinally, as a small aside, the specific name of the establishment in the OP may be on it's face a little naughty, but \"Dick\" is a diminutive name for \"Richard\" and this gets all sorts of playful puns on it's other vernacular uses. For example, in one comic featuring Batman's young ward Robin (Dick Grayson), who was admonishing other heroes for not protecting their secret identity, one character comments to another that \"Robin is being such a \\-\" only for the second character to interrupt and remind the first \"No real names.\"\n\nAnother example is the stage name of a famous parody artist who sepcializes in singing modern pop songs in the style of a Vegas Crooner or Lounge Singer, Richard Cheese. The pun relies on knowing this nickname.\n\nFor one that is not punning on the body part, The Red Green Show once had a sketch where Red Green (the character's name) was talking with the town's notorious liar, Hap, who in this particular sketch dropped the time he went whaling and chased after the \"Great White Whale Moby Richard.\" Red asks if he meant the titular whale from the novel Moby Dick, to which Hap responds, \"I didn't know him that well, Red.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the Supreme Court cases mentioned in the passage, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the naming of a business with a potentially offensive or provocative name in the United States?\n\nA) The federal government has the final say in determining whether a business name is too obscene to be registered as a trademark.\n\nB) Business names are protected under the First Amendment, and there are no restrictions on what a business can be named, regardless of local standards.\n\nC) The legality of a potentially offensive business name depends primarily on local community standards and regulations.\n\nD) Only names that are classified as \"hard core porn\" can be restricted from use as business names nationwide.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage discusses two key Supreme Court cases relevant to this question. In Matal v. Tam, the Court ruled that trademark registration cannot be denied based on disparagement, which expanded protection for potentially offensive names. However, the Jacobellis v. Ohio case established that obscenity is not protected speech and should be determined at local levels of government. The passage specifically states, \"Basically, check your local limits for guidance, as there is no federal or state law to help discuss this.\" This indicates that local community standards and regulations play the primary role in determining the acceptability of a potentially offensive business name. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the federal government's ability to restrict trademark registration based on offensiveness was limited by Matal v. Tam. Option B goes too far, as there are still some restrictions based on local standards. Option D misinterprets Justice Potter Stewart's comment about \"hard core porn,\" which was not established as a universal standard for restricting business names."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77282/under-the-gdpr-in-germany-is-a-privacy-policy-required-when-not-tracking-any-pe", "docs_id": 77282, "title": "Under the GDPR in Germany, is a privacy-policy required when not tracking any personal data whatsoever", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a small static personal website, where I publish some technical articles and my personal CV.\nDo I need to include a privacy\\-policy if:\n\n* There are no (third\\- or first party) tracking services used\n* There are no IP logs kept\n* There are no comment fields or other features where users can enter information to be saved\n* I do not publish information about specific persons in the articles\n\n**To provide an idealized model, assume that the server is configured to forget ALL state after serving a HTTP request for the website.

Do I need to inform people that this provider could theoretically collect data (still nothing more than IP addresses with timestamps and encrypted TLS traffic)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Congrats, you've done well to minimize your processing of personal data. But I think you're still processing personal data, and are subject to the GDPR.\n\nServing a website necessarily involves processing an IP address. This IP address will typically be personal data. While you are not storing the IP address, the GDPR's definition of \u201cprocessing\u201d extends beyond storage and pretty much covers doing anything with that IP address. As far as I know this is not an entirely settled matter, but it's better to err on the side of caution and to assume that you are in fact performing a processing activity. Even a static web page can easily lead to additional relevant processing of personal data, for example if the HTML embeds resources from third party domains.\n\nSince your website is clearly targeted at the public, it does not fall under the GDPR's exception for \u201cpurely personal or household\u201d purposes.\n\nSo I think you do need a (minimal) privacy notice that contains at least the items mentioned in Art 13 GDPR. The main reason why some people try to avoid posting a privacy notice is because it must disclose your identity and contact details. But in Germany, that information has to be provided anyway due to the *Impressumspflicht*.\n\nAs part of your GDPR compliance obligations, you must protect how data is processed by others on your behalf. A hosting provider will typically act as your *data processor*. For this to be legal, you need a contract / data processing agreement that fulfills the conditions in Art 28 GDPR. This contract binds the data processor to only use the data as instructed by you, and not for their own purposes. European hosting providers sometimes include the necessary terms in their terms of service / AGB, but you should check to make sure. Netcup expects you to accept their data processing amendment in your account settings.\n\nIn the hypothetical case that you were not processing any personal data at all, the GDPR would not apply and it wouldn't require you to post a privacy notice. Other laws might still have information obligations, notably the German TMG and TTDSG.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web developer has created a personal website with minimal data collection.

The processing of IP addresses, even without storing them, falls under the GDPR's broad definition of \"processing.\" Additionally, the website is targeted at the public, so it doesn't qualify for the \"purely personal or household\" exemption. Therefore, a minimal privacy notice containing at least the items mentioned in Art 13 GDPR is required.

Or would any such scheme necessarily be bribery if it were effective?**\n\nFor example, say I adopt a policy of downloading all the legislators' votes, determining what I think was the correct vote on each item, and then splitting my pot of political donations in proportion to the number of correct votes. This policy clearly dispenses money to politicians in exchange for votes, so it's bribery, right? But it's also merely allocating my money towards legislators who have demonstrated that they agree with me and away from legislators who don't. So would this be allowed or not?

Their amount may be affected by the nature of the judgment.\n\nThe general rule is each party is responsible for that party's attorney's fees. That means that the trial result is irrelevant \\- no matter what happens, one pays for one's own attorneys fees.\n\nThere are, however, some exceptions:\n\n* First: if the parties are litigating a contract, the contract text\nitself may provide that the prevailing party can recover attorneys\nfees from the non\\-prevailing party. Such \"Attorneys' Fees Clauses\"\nare common. The prevailing party may have to file a motion in the\ntrial court for the judge to add attorneys fees to the judgment\namount; the judge will also be responsible (in ruling on the motion)\nto determine the amount of attorneys fees.\n* Second: specific state statutes may allow the prevailing party to\nrecover \"Statutory attorneys fees.\" This is completely dependent on\nwhether the case at issue fits the various statutory definitions. For\nexample, the Song\\-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (the California\n\"Lemon Law\") provides for the recovery of attorneys fees by an\naggrieved consumer. There are multiple other examples throughout the\nCalifornia Codes.\n* Third: @ohwilleke (to whom thanks) added a comment below that includes other exceptions to the general rule. The comment text was: There are a few other exceptions, e.g. breaches of fiduciary duties involving trust finds, bad faith breaches of insurance contracts, etc. Also, it is possible for attorneys' fees awards to be made because litigation or some specific conduct in litigation is either groundless and frivolous, or violates a court rule. Further, a prevailing party generally gets court costs (e.g. filing fees, expert witness fees, copying costs, and other out of pocket expenses other than attorneys' fees) even when attorneys' fees are not awarded.

Can someone clarify the situation, and the costs of going public these days?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Which Companies Are Covered By SOX?\n===================================\n\n> When exactly does the Sarbanes\\-Oxley Act apply to a company?\n\nThe provisions of the [Sarbanes\\-Oxley Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/html/PLAW-107publ204.htm) (a.k.a. SOX) sometimes apply to \"issuers\" (i.e. companies that are going public pursuant to the 1933 Securities Act and companies that have already gone public which are regulated by the 1934 Securities Exchange Act) and sometimes only to companies that have already gone public which are regulated by and required to make reports the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.\n\nBut, some provisions of the Act and its regulations exempt or alter its requirements, mostly in regard to audits of and establishment of \"internal controls\" in the case of \"small\" publicly held companies.\n\nThe law also applies to accountants, securities professionals, members of a board of directors, officers and major shareholders of such corporations.\n\nSOX does not apply to private offerings of stock made pursuant to an SEC regulatory exemption from the securities laws for closely held companies, to companies that are not publicly held, and to foreign companies that are not listed on any U.S. stock exchange which have never been listed on any U.S. stock exchange.\n\nWhat Does SOX require?\n======================\n\n> what do they have to do in order to avoid criminal penalties? What\n> about civil penalties?\n\nShort answer: They have to not violate the provisions of SOX.\n\nLong answer: [They must](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act#Implementation_of_key_provisions)\n\n* Establish \"internal controls\", which are steps taken by a company to prevent accounting fraud by insiders, by methods set forth in the law and related regulations. Companies then have to have an external audit of the adequacy of the company's \"internal controls\" conducted annually pursuant to standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The work necessary to establish internal controls and then conduct the audits of these internal controls (the internal controls audit is Section 404 of SOX) is the main source of compliance costs.\n* Disclose material off balance sheet transactions.\n* Not defraud, coerce or bribe outside auditors.\n* Not knowingly alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, cover up, falsify, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence an investigation by a government agency, or in a bankruptcy case.\n* Not retaliate against whistleblowers who report fraud.\n* Not sign off as a CEO or CFO as required by the act on financial statements and tax returns knowing that they are fraudulent or do not comply with securities laws and accounting standards.\n\nThere are overlapping civil and criminal penalties, with criminal penalties generally requiring that the individual charged personally had knowledge of, or participated in intentional misconduct.\n\nWhat Impact Does SOX Have On The Cost Of Going Public?\n======================================================\n\n> it seems SOX increases the cost tremendously if it is required for all\n> public companies.\n\nThis is inaccurate propaganda.\n\n[SOX compliance costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act#Analyzing_the_cost-benefits_of_Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley) are on the order of 0\\.4% of the revenues and have been offset by a 0\\.5\\-1\\.5 percentage point drop in interest rates on corporate bonds due to the fact that it reduces the risk of defaults caused by fraud. SOX did not make foreign companies less likely to list their stocks on U.S. Exchanges.\n\nThe costs of compliance with SOX net of the benefits arising from compliance with SOX are negligible rather than \"tremendous\" for most companies, although they can become material. Compliance costs would have been up to about 2\\.4% of revenues if it weren't for the small public company exemptions in the smallest publicly held companies.\n\nSOX modestly shifts the scale at which it makes economics sense to go public towards largely companies, a concern that has been significantly offset by more lenient exemptions for private offerings of stock and bonds.\n\nThis isn't to say that going public and being publicly held [isn't expensive](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/deals/library/cost-of-an-ipo.html):\n\n> Underwriting makes up the largest component of IPO costs by far. Based\n> on the public registration statements of 315 companies, on average,\n> companies incur an underwriter fee equal to 4\\-7% of gross proceeds,\n> plus an additional $4\\.2 million of offering costs directly\n> attributable to the IPO. Legal and Accounting fees also add up and can\n> increase significantly for larger companies that may face additional\n> complexities in preparing for an IPO.\n\nBeing publicly held costs $1 million to $1\\.9 million a year in compliance costs, and in addition disqualifies a company from using pass through taxation (requiring them to pay a corporate level tax on their profits in addition to taxes owed by shareholders, resulting in double taxation).\n\nThe desire to secure pass through taxation is generally a much more important motivation than the desire to avoid the compliance costs associated with being publicly held in most \"going private\" transactions (usually involving leveraged buy outs of companies by their own management which are financed by large banks, or buy outs by private equity companies and hedge funds).\n\nBut, the lion's share of the costs of going public and being publicly held were unchanged by SOX, which had no real impact on underwriters fees, for example. SOX's main impact is that it mainly moderately increases the accounting costs involved.\n\nWhat Is A Publicly Held Company?\n================================\n\nGenerally speaking, a company is \"publicly held\" if (1\\) it has made a public offering under the '33 Act, (2\\) it is listed on a U.S. stock exchange, (3\\) it has more than 500 unaccredited investors, or (4\\) it has more than 2000 investors (including accredited investors) and has more than $10,000,000 of net worth per its balance sheet at year end (even if it has fewer than 500 accredited investors). It is also subject to SOX if it was formerly listed on a U.S. stock exchange and became a foreign company not listed on a U.S. stock exchange.\n\nAs a matter of empirical reality, the vast majority of companies in the U.S. either have few than 50 investors, or are publicly held. Companies in between are quite rare and are economically fairly insignificant in the U.S. economy. The are several million privately held companies, the number of publicly held companies is in the low tens of thousands, and the number of companies in between is probably in the single digit thousands.\n\nGenerally speaking, an offering of stock, bonds or investment opportunities that is open to unaccredited investors and involves more than $5,000,000 of funds raised, or is marketed to the general public, it must be registered under the '33 Act before investments can be offered to the public.\n\nThere are two main \"private offering\" exemptions from the '33 Act found in SEC [Regulation D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_D_(SEC)) that allow stock of privately held companies to be sold without registering under the '33 Act.\n\n[Rule 504](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small-entity-compliance.html) of Regulation D allows investments of up to $5,000,000 a year with minimal requirements but strict limitations on marketing to the general public, and requires stock to be held for at least one year.\n\nRule 506 of Regulation D allows unlimited investments by accredited investors in privately held companies with disclosures that are a simplified bare bones version of what companies that are going public must disclose. \"Accredited investors\" include affluent individuals, certain kinds of professionals, and institutional investors.\n\n[Regulation A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_A) provides additional crowdfunding exemptions, one of which applies to smaller single state offerings regulated by state securities laws, and the other of which applies to larger national crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nCaveat\n======\n\nThis summary should not be relied upon as legal advice.

Before you pay for a lawyer, it might help for you to know roughly what you're up against.\n\nThe contract case is where you pay a person to render some type of assistance in creating music. What you apparently didn't know at the time as that might have given the other party some right to the music. That of course depends on what they did. That right comes from the possibility that they have copyright in the music because they created the music (\"help\" is vague, we don't know what they actually did). If they only supplied technical non\\-creative assistance, they gain no rights to your music. If the two of you created the music, then you are the authors and you share rights to the music equally, so you can do what they want and so can you. If they entirely created the music entirely for you, then they hold the copyright. In *that* case, there's a theoretical possibility that they could say \"You can't use that work\". Even without an explicit \"work for hire\" clause in the contract, you can exploit the work under the theory (established in the US, wonder where in the world you are talking about) that they have granted an impicit license to use. That is, the courts will not say \"We assume you paid this person a bunch of money so that they could create music for their sole use\". If the goal is for you to have copyright, they you need to enter into a new contract, where they give you something you want (they transfer copyright to you), and you give them what they want (money? help painting the house?). This *quid pro quo* is known as \"consideration\" in contract law: without it, you don't have a contract and the putative transfer of copyright is revocable. The \"something\" that constitutes their obligation under the contract has to be a *new* obligation.\n\nIn the case of the translation volunteers, the matter is simple: the translators hold copyright to their translations. Your use of their work is with permission, but it's not irrevocable \u2013 you don't have a contract (lack of consideration). Again, if you pay them something in exchange for transfering their work to you, you have an enforceable contract. A licensing scheme that lack consideration runs a risk of revocation.

According to the information provided, the translators who volunteered their work hold the copyright to their translations. For the music, the copyright situation depends on the extent of the paid assistant's creative contribution. If they provided only technical, non-creative assistance, they would not have copyright claims. However, if they created the music entirely or collaborated creatively, they may have full or shared copyright. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because initiating the project does not automatically grant copyright to all contributions.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because volunteering or being paid for work does not negate copyright claims, especially without proper contracts.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because having contributors sign a contract after the fact without new consideration (something of value exchanged) would not create a valid, enforceable contract for copyright transfer."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31719/is-publication-of-an-unpaid-debt-considered-to-be-libelous", "docs_id": 31719, "title": "Is publication of an unpaid debt considered to be libelous?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the United States, if a debtor is in default, is it considered libel if the creditor publishes the fact that the debtor is delinquent?\n\nMy understanding is that normally truth is a perfect defense to a charge of libel in the United States, but I wondering if this is still true if a creditor sets out to deliberately damage the reputation of a debtor over an unpaid debt.\n\nFor example, let's imagine person A borrows $50,000 from person B and agrees to pay it back with interest in 1 years time.

The tenant apologises to the landlord and agrees (verbally) to replace the carpet at the end of the tenancy.\n\nAfter moving out, the bill for the new carpet was much more than the tenant expected. The room was slightly larger than estimated (requiring 4 x 4m of carpet instead of the initial guestimate of 3 x 3m) (the actual size is about 3\\.1 meters each side). In addition, the bill also includes the cost of delivery and fitting, plus new underlay and the removal of the old carpet. The end result is that the bill is about 4 times the tenants 'guestimate' and nearly half the overall deposit. The tenant is now reluctant to pay.\n\nDoes the tenant have any wriggle room on paying this bill? is it fair and reasonable (and legal!) for the landlord to include the cost of delivery, fitting and removal of the old carpet? Or should the tenant be limited to just paying for the carpet and the landlord pick up the rest of the costs?\n\nFurther info \\- tenancy was a 12 month Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST). Carpet was new at start of tenancy, the bill comes from a reputable high\\-street carpet retailer. The replacement carpet is similar in quality (and cost) to the original. 10% has been deducted from the bill to cover depreciation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your tenancy agreement most likely has terms requiring you to hand the property back in good condition or similar condition to how it was at the start, and to pay for any damage which you cause, allowing for any fair wear and tear. Spilling a bottle of wine on the carpet is not fair wear and tear, but at the same time the landlord cannot reasonably expect to get back a brand new carpet after a 12 month tenancy. In my opinion he has covered for that by deducting 10% from the cost, so the bill you are left with seems reasonable. It's not the landlord's fault his carpet was destroyed, so there's no particular reason he should have to pay for the delivery and fitting.\n\nWith that said, the landlord would have been required to register your deposit with a tenancy deposit scheme and provide you with prescribed information within 30 days of receiving the deposit pursuant to [section 213 of the Housing Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/213). Assuming they did so then you can challenge any deposit deduction using that scheme's dispute resolution procedure. Doing so is free of charge so you have very little to lose other than your time. In my experience the dispute resolution services, which are not courts, can come up with some fairly irrational and badly considered decisions, so it is entirely possible you will get lucky. I have seen deductions reduced by 50% for reasons that appear to make little sense.\n\nIn the event that the landlord failed to register your deposit *and/or* provide you with prescribed information within the required deadline, then you are in better luck. You can sue your landlord in the County Court under [section 214 of the Housing Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/214) and the court must make an order awarding you an amount between 1 and 3 times the deposit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant accidentally spilled wine on the carpet in a rental property and verbally agreed to replace it at the end of the tenancy.

The documentation states that tenancy agreements usually require tenants to return the property in good condition and pay for any damage they cause, excluding fair wear and tear. Spilling wine is not considered fair wear and tear. The landlord has already accounted for the 12-month use by deducting 10% for depreciation. The costs for delivery, fitting, and removal are part of the necessary process to restore the carpet to its original condition, which is the tenant's responsibility due to the accidental damage. However, the tenant can still challenge the deduction through the tenancy deposit scheme's dispute resolution procedure if they feel it's unfair."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61658/is-mere-accusation-without-evidence-other-than-testimony-of-the-accuser-grounds", "docs_id": 61658, "title": "Is mere accusation without evidence other than testimony of the accuser, grounds for arrest in the UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Several years ago I was stopped in public by the police.
