While the data about real streets and geographic features is a fact and not subject to copyright. \u201cFacts\u201d about fictional things are creative works and are subject to it. So if you reverse engineer Google map\u2019s data and create your own map, you will be in breach of copyright because your map will include the same fictional information. Gotcha!\n> \n> \n> BTW, paper mapmakers did this too; including Ordinance Survey maps.\n\nComment:\n\n> Apparently fictional facts also were used to protect Trivial Pursuit decks from copying.\n\nMy first thought was does that mean I can lie to a journalist, and if they print the lie I can claim copyright on there whole distribution? Then I thought what if [ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) is doing this? They could be quitely introducing [synonymous substitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonymous_substitution) into the data, and then at a later date reveal the intentional inaccuracies and claim copyright over most of the biomedical field that uses their data (which could well be in the region of a trillion dollars at this point)?\n\nI am sure they are not, not least because the data is hosted independently at the [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/).\n\nIs this really true? Can an organisation present data as factual, and therefore not protected by copyright, and then at a later date reveal that it contained inaccuracies so the users are in breach of copyright, and are liable for damages to the entity that introduced the inaccuracies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your question is at heart a difficult philosophical one: what is a \"fact\"? A fact is some describable aspect of reality, and it is not the sentence used to describe reality. It is more like \"an abstract logical proposition, free from language\". Copyright law protects the specific expression of an idea in a language (it could be via some other symbolic means but let's avoid the complexity of a 'lying picture'). The propositions that underlie a protected work do not have to be true (therefore works of fiction are canonical examples of copyright\\-protected works). From a legal perspective, truth does not determine what the \"fact\" is, therefore you cannot claim copyright over an actually\\-factual work by inserting a false assertion into the work.\n\nYour original scheme for copying involved actual copying without permission plus a transformation of the original work. When you speak to a reporter (a) you understand that the reporter will extra both \"facts\" and \"expression\" from the interview \u2013 which when it leaves your mouth is not a creative work with a fixed form and (b) you voluntarily agree to letting the reporter disseminate that content. So there is no impermissible copying, irrespective of the veracity of your claims.\n\nThe relevance of injecting fake data into an otherwise factual database is that it provides *proof* of an illegal act \u2013 copying a protected work without permission. Google Maps is clearly a \"creative work\", and you have provably copied (without permission) a creative work. The Fibonacci sequence is not a protected work and aside from the millenia\\-old mathematical insight underlying the sequence, it is not a \"creative work\", so you cannot be sued for copying it from a web page, even if they insert a false entry (6767\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company creates a comprehensive database of genetic information, including gene sequences and their functions. To protect their work, they secretly introduce a few artificial gene sequences that don't exist in nature. Years later, a researcher uses this database to publish a groundbreaking paper on genetic disorders. The company then reveals the artificial sequences and claims copyright infringement. What is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The researcher is liable for copyright infringement because they unknowingly used the artificial sequences.\n\nB) The company's copyright claim is invalid because they presented the database as factual information.\n\nC) The researcher can claim fair use and avoid copyright infringement.\n\nD) The company can copyright the entire database, including the factual information, due to the presence of artificial sequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely legal outcome is that the company's copyright claim would be invalid. While the company may have inserted artificial sequences, they presented the entire database as factual information. Copyright law protects the expression of ideas, not facts themselves. By presenting their database as factual, the company cannot later claim copyright over information that users reasonably believed to be true facts. Additionally, the inclusion of false information in an otherwise factual database is typically used to prove copying, not to extend copyright protection to the entire work. The researcher's use of what they believed to be factual information would not constitute copyright infringement, even if some of that information turned out to be artificially created."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86190/ambiguous-meaning", "docs_id": 86190, "title": "Ambiguous(?) meaning", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *Disputes handled by TeamX can only address the hours, not the quality.*\n\nWhat does it mean:\n\n1.

This is the verb construction is `can [only] address` and it has two objects: `only [address] the hours` as well as `not the quality`. The `only` clearly belongs to the first object, but makes no grammatical sense with the second. The sentence would be arguably less ambiguous if there was a `but` after the comma for `[but] not the quality`.\n\nAs such, the sentence is easy: TeamX can only handle (address) disputes regarding the *length* of work (hours). **But** TeamX can not handle disputes about the quality of work.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software development company's policy states: \"Disputes handled by TeamX can only address the hours, not the quality.\" Which of the following interpretations is most accurate?\n\nA) TeamX is responsible for resolving all disputes, but can only discuss hours worked during the resolution process.\n\nB) Clients can raise disputes about both hours worked and quality of work, but TeamX will only consider the hours in their resolution.\n\nC) TeamX handles disputes solely related to the number of hours worked, while quality-related issues are addressed by a different team.\n\nD) The dispute resolution process conducted by TeamX is limited to a specific number of hours and cannot assess the quality of work done.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct interpretation is that TeamX is specifically tasked with handling disputes related to the number of hours worked, but not disputes about the quality of the work. This aligns with the grammatical structure of the sentence, where \"Disputes handled by TeamX\" is the subject, and \"can only address the hours, not the quality\" describes the limitation of what these disputes can cover. Option C accurately captures this meaning, indicating that TeamX's role is restricted to hour-related disputes, implying that quality issues would be handled separately.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests TeamX handles all disputes but is limited in discussion topics, which is not supported by the statement. Option B is wrong as it implies clients can raise both types of disputes with TeamX, which contradicts the policy. Option D misinterprets the meaning of \"hours\" in this context, incorrectly suggesting a time limit on the dispute process itself rather than the subject of the disputes."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13178/what-is-plausible-deniability-and-to-what-extent-can-it-be-used", "docs_id": 13178, "title": "What is plausible deniability, and to what extent can it be used?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a hypothetical question: Say I am a normal person, I go on the internet, and buy a prepaid debit card, that seems completely normal and legitimate.

Federal money laundering statutes require proof of intent or knowledge as elements of the crime. If John truly had no knowledge that the prepaid debit card contained laundered money and no intent to engage in money laundering, the prosecution would have difficulty proving these essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. \n\nOption A is incorrect because possession alone is not sufficient for a money laundering conviction; intent or knowledge is required. \n\nOption B is incorrect because \"plausible deniability\" is not an absolute defense, but rather describes a situation where the prosecution fails to prove the required elements of the crime. \n\nOption D is incorrect because if John truly had no knowledge or intent, he should not be found guilty at all, rather than receiving a reduced sentence.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the key elements required for a money laundering conviction and the concept of burden of proof in criminal cases."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5154/what-are-the-different-kinds-of-rules-procedures-that-describe-what-counts-as-co", "docs_id": 5154, "title": "What are the different kinds of rules/procedures that describe what counts-as/constitutes a rule change and what kinds of problems can they cause?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **This is a question about legislation, including constitutive rules and administrative law**\n\nTo give some context, I am interested in legal reasoning (as in a logic of law), but I am not a legal\\-expert. For research, I was hoping to look at rules which govern the change of other rules. Specifically, rules which state what constitutes a rule change (presumably for different types of rules). \n\nTo give an example, I can cross off a rule in a constitution, but due to not being empowered that presumably would not mean I have changed any rules. It would not count\\-as a rule change. What I would like to know is:\n\n1\\) What sub\\-types of these rule types are there? For example, some would state when a retroactive rule change is made \\- what other types are there?\n\n2\\) What kind of absurd outcomes can come as a result of rule changes, due to the way rule changes are governed? For example, I can imagine that retroactively annulling a rule that states I can retroactively annul a rule is paradoxical, are there other similar absurdities that can occur?\n\nI am ideally looking for some legal theory on this and if that isn't available then some examples covering different possibilities, but I don't know where to look. Thanks in advance!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Why do you want to know?\n\nI think that the reason this question seems so obscure is because it does not involve sufficient context and specificity. It can't be answered until one knows the reason that it matters to know if a rule is new or not. In a particular context, these questions usually have obvious and clear answers. The murkiness arises only when one tries to overgeneralize. \n\nThe life of law is not reason, it is experience. In general, it is almost never fruitful to try to apply legal principles of any kind to their logical conclusion without grounding that logic in fact specific and context specific precedents and applications. That approach to legal reasoning is a classic rookie mistake that gets a lot of young associate attorneys doing legal research into trouble by overstating the confidence that they should have in their conclusions when there is no case right on point addressing a situation.\n\nFor example, if a federal government agency publishes something in the federal register that does not exactly restate an existing regulation, then it is a rule change, in the narrow sense that is changes an existing published narrowly defined Code of Federal Regulations rule. The process by which one does so derives from the Administrative Procedures Act and other authorizing legislation passed by Congress and also custom and case law interpreting these, so it isn't self\\-referential.\n\nA completely different context in which the question of whether there is a \"new rule\" of law is when a court according to the principles of *stare decisis* makes a ruling interpreting the constitution in a manner different from or expanding upon previously rulings interpreting the constitution in a similar circumstance. In this context, this matters because a \"new rule\" of constitutional law is generally given only prospective effect, while an interpretation of an existing rule of law that merely expands upon existing precedents in a foreseeable way has retroactive effect. \n\nIn this situation, as in any case in which one tries to determine the best definition to apply under the law, the best approach is to look for a definition that produces just results given the consequences of a particular definition v. another particular definition. In that context, the determination of whether a rule is a \"new rule\" should depend upon foreseeability and the amount of reliance that people put on the old rule as opposed to the new rule being in force.\n\nThere is no good reason to have transsubstantive legal meta\\-rules that apply to both of these situations. The former mechanistic rule makes sense in its context and makes the status quo clear and the events that constitute a change in the rule clear, while the latter consequence oriented definition makes sense in the completely different context where it is used.\n\nSurely, there are other contexts in which the question of what constitutes a \"new rule\" could have different consequences still. For example, to determine what constitutes a new v. old rule of U.S. Senate procedure, or to determine which statute is newer or older for purposes of determining which statute of two that conflict should be given effect when there was a cosmetic recodification of the section numbers of one of the titles but not the other without changing the substantive meaning of the recodified statute.\n\nThe determination should generally be made on a case by case basis as there is no important purpose served by having a uniform metarule to answer these questions. \n\nIf you are getting paradoxes trying to apply your legal theory, you are probably doing it wrong.\n\nFor what it is worth, I have a dim opinion of Hart as someone who uses lots of words to say nothing of consequence or use, and I am not familiar with Biagoli or Suber.

According to the First Homes program eligibility criteria, a person who has previously purchased any share of a property, no matter how small, is considered to have acquired a \"major interest\" and is therefore not classified as a first-time buyer. In this case, Sarah's 15% share in a holiday home, even if it's not her primary residence, disqualifies her from the program.\n\nOption A is incorrect because inheriting a share of a property does not count as a purchase, which is the key factor in determining eligibility.\n\nOption B is irrelevant to the eligibility criteria, as renting a property and paying a refundable deposit does not constitute a property purchase.\n\nOption C does not affect Sarah's eligibility, as receiving a gift towards a future house purchase does not disqualify her if she hasn't actually purchased a property yet.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the specific definition of a \"first-time buyer\" under UK law for this program, emphasizing that any previous purchase of a share in a property, regardless of size or purpose, disqualifies an individual from being considered a first-time buyer."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48995/can-a-nda-be-non-terminable-for-an-indefinite-period-of-time", "docs_id": 48995, "title": "Can a NDA be non-terminable for an indefinite period of time?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been given a NDA which say it is \"unilaterally non\\-terminable for an indefinite period of time\".\n\nIs this legal?

Mike is the Florida landlord.\n\nJane slips and falls on the Mike's rental property, Can Mike's attorney construct lease so that Bob is required to have some sort of insurance so that his visitor's injuries are covered by Bob's insurance?\n\nIs there nomenclature for said practice?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are multiple separate issues presented by this question.\n\n**Allocating Responsibility In The Lease**\n\nOne is that the lease between Mike and Bob can attempt to allocate all responsibility for matters that could give rise to personal injuries at the rental property to Bob.\n\nThe lease could also require that Bob indemnify Mike for any claims that are brought against Mike related to the rental property. An indemnification clause basically makes Bob the insurer of Mike with regard to these claims.\n\nIndemnification requirements are routine in leases.\n\nUltimately, it isn't clear that delegating responsibility for claim's on Mike's rental property to Bob could actually relieve Mike from legal liability to a third\\-party for these claims. Realistically, it probably couldn't because normally two people can't contract to limit the liability of one or all of them to a third\\-party who didn't agree to that. So, Mike would have residual liability for any claim that Bob couldn't pay.\n\nSo, it would make sense for there to be liability insurance in place to protect Mike directly as well, in addition to any insurance that Bob has in place.\n\n**Requiring Bob To Have Insurance In Force**\n\nThe other issue is that the lease could require Bob to have insurance of particular kinds and amounts in place as a condition of the lease, to provide proof of insurance, and to set up the insurance so that Mike receives notice if it is canceled. Failure to do so would be a default under the lease.\n\nRequirements in a lease that a tenant have certain kinds of insurance in force are routine in leases.\n\nThis said, while such indemnification requirements are common, it isn't obvious that Bob could obtain an insurance policy that would fully cover Bob's indemnification liability in this context as a matter of commercial reality, even though it would be legal to write such an insurance policy.\n\nIt would generally be easier for Mike to obtain liability insurance for the rental property on his own (which his mortgage, if he has one, almost certainly requires him to have in place) and to have the lease provide that Bob is required to pay for Mike's insurance policy on the rental property.\n\nIn certain kinds of leases, such as commercial \"triple net\" leases, it is routine to have the tenant pay the landlord's expenses related to the property rented. The indemnification requirement would also give Bob a strong incentive to keep his payments of the insurance policy protecting Mike current.\n\nAlternatively, Mike could pay for his own insurance and increase the base rent by a like amount, which is economically equivalent to having Bob pay for Mike's insurance, and is almost economically equivalent to requiring Bob to have an insurance policy that covers Bob's indemnification liability to Mike.\n\nIf there was an insurance policy in place for Mike that is merely paid for by Bob, then the indemnification obligation of Bob would end up being limited to covering Mike's deductible for each claim under Mike's insurance policy, which would be a manageable uninsured risk for Bob to be responsible for paying.\n\nIf Mike were really worried about Bob's ability to pay the indemnification liability for the deductible under Mike's liability insurance policy, Mike could increase the amount of Bob's security deposit to make sure that Bob would have the ability to pay it out of the security deposit if from no other source.\n\n**Insurance Companies Almost Never Have Direct Liability For Third\\-Party Claims**\n\nIt would almost never be the case that the liability for injuries on the property would be placed directly upon Bob's insurance company, or that Bob would be required to make a claim against his insurance company if he was sued. Liability attaches to people who own and do things. Insurance exists to help people who have liability or potential liability deal with that fact.

While Mike can include an indemnification clause in the lease (making Bob responsible for claims), this doesn't eliminate Mike's potential liability to third parties. Having his own insurance is crucial. Making Bob pay for this insurance (either directly or through increased rent) is a common practice. The indemnification clause can then serve to cover deductibles. This approach provides the most comprehensive protection for Mike while being legally and practically feasible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an indemnification clause doesn't eliminate Mike's liability to third parties, and Mike should still carry his own insurance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because insurance companies are almost never directly liable for third-party claims, and it's unlikely Bob could obtain such comprehensive coverage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because two parties generally can't contract to limit liability to a third party who hasn't agreed to such limitations."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15237/what-does-to-the-order-of-mean-excluding-contexts-of-bills-promissory-notes", "docs_id": 15237, "title": "What does &#39;to the order of&#39; mean (excluding contexts of bills, promissory notes)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Source: p 33 Middle, [*JC Smith's The Law of Contract*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0414041801/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=8AWSERSMKG5WTHNPGVKS) (2016\\) by [Paul S.

In this context \"to the order of\" means that the lawyer holding the physical signed original contract document (which is a form of tangible personal property in this sense rather than a true intangible property right) agrees in a binding oral contract to deliver that physical signed original contract document according to the instructions of the other lawyer who represents another party with whom the contract was made.\n\nBecause the recipient of the \"to the order of\" promise has a right to direct the disposition of the signed original piece of paper, that recipient of the \"to the order of\" promise is legally considered to be in possession of that piece of paper.\n\nPossession of the piece of paper is important because a written contract or instrument is not normally binding until it is \"signed\" (ordinary meaning), \"sealed\" (either notarized or marked with a corporate seal for contracts that required either of these at the time), and \"delivered\" (transferred from the legal possession of the person signing to another party to the contract or beneficiary of the instrument or to an attorney or agent for that person).\n\nThus, for example, if you sign and notarize a deed giving Blackacre to your nephew, the deed is still not effective until you **deliver** the deed to your nephew or an agent or attorney acting on his behalf. (The exception to that general rule is a will which is effective when signed and witnessed even if it is never delivered prior to death.)\n\nHistorically, a signed original was much more important for enforcement of contracts than it is today, when a copy or scan is easily made and equally effective in most circumstances. The class of \"real documents\" which physically embody a legal right rather than merely being evidence of an agreement or action of the parties, is increasingly small. For the most part it consists of live checks, promissory notes, mortgages, deeds of trust, wills, warehouse receipts, bearer bonds, certificates of title (sometimes), and unrecorded deeds.\n\nThis reference is to a transitional arrangement using legal fictions to overcome obsolete requirements for \"real documents.\" We are currently at the tail end of the process of this transition.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a chain property transaction involving parties W, X, Y, and Z, solicitors use the phrase \"to the order of\" when exchanging contracts by telephone.

My understanding is that a direct appeal happens when the defendant, now called an appellant, appeals to a higher court or the highest court in the State, to override judgement for conviction or sentence from a trial court. \n\nBut how does that work? What are the documents or procedures needed to do this type of appeal?\n\nAlso, since this type of appeal is based on your conviction and sentence, does that mean you must have gone to trial, and lost, in order to file this type of appeal? Can you plea guilty and be \"convicted\", then proceed to this type of appeal? \n\nNow, for example, say one were to file a motion to dismiss a criminal case, and the court refuses/rejects/denies whatever grounds and arguments you've brought up. How does one appeal that order that denies a dismissal? \n\nSince the denial for dismissal is actually counted as a \"Final judgement or decision\", would it still be called a direct appeal if you were to pursue an appeal to grant the dismissal? You aren't yet convicted, pleaded, or have gone to trial.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Rules of court procedure are specific to the individual court system. An appeal normally involves filing paperwork with the appeals court and the court you're appealing from, and serving some form of notice on the other side. \n\nAn appeal normally has to come at the end of the lower court proceedings. This is for practical reasons: it's time\\-consuming to transfer the case to a new court, brief the issue, and argue the issue, all for something that might end up not mattering at all. If the trial has actually started, doing that breaks the flow of the trial. Instead of going back and forth and back and forth, courts generally expect you to wait until the lower court has issued a final judgment, at which point you can appeal both that judgment and anything leading up to it. For instance, if you try to have evidence suppressed and fail, you can't appeal immediately. If you end up being convicted, you can then appeal on the grounds that the evidence should have been suppressed (if you're acquitted, there's no point appealing).\n\nThere are some exceptions to this rule where you really can't wait for the lower court proceeding to finish. In the US, a common example is orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions. The whole point of preliminary injunctions is that the issue really can't wait for the trial to finish, because by the time that happens one or both sides will have suffered irreparable harm. So, they can be appealed immediately. Another example in criminal cases is certain orders favoring the defendant. Because the prosecution *can't* appeal an acquittal, they can't wait until the final judgment and have to be able to appeal right away. These appeals are called interlocutory appeals.\n\nA dismissal of a case with prejudice is a final judgment: it ends the case, and so you can appeal. A dismissal without prejudice (meaning you can fix the issues and refile) may or may not be appealable, depending on the court. But refusing to dismiss a case isn't a final judgment, because there's still plenty to do (i.e. an entire trial) in the lower court. Even if you should have won a dismissal, that doesn't mean the appeals court will step in early and save you the burden of a trial. One judge has already ruled you have to stand trial, and in most cases that's enough for you to have to stand trial.\n\nThere are some exceptions that let you appeal the denial of a motion to dismiss. For instance, foreign sovereigns normally have immunity in US courts, and can immediately appeal if the immunity is refused. Public officials who are being sued and assert qualified immunity can immediately appeal if the court refuses it. If you're being prosecuted and claim double jeopardy, you can appeal if the court denies the claim. Anti\\-SLAPP laws often provide for immediate appeal if the anti\\-SLAPP motion is denied.\n\nWhat these cases have in common is that the law protects you from even *standing trial* for the claim. Trials are expensive, stressful, and time\\-consuming, and each of these cases has important reasons why you're entitled to avoid it. Forcing a sovereign to stand trial in US courts can seriously hurt foreign relations, so before it happens the courts need to make sure that US law really does require it. Qualified immunity exists so that officials don't always have to second\\-guess themselves; if they had to sit through an expensive trial, the point would be lost. Ditto for anti\\-SLAPP cases. Double jeopardy protects you from the government repeatedly putting you through the extreme stress of criminal prosecution (on the other hand, you can't generally do an interlocutory appeal on speedy trial grounds, because the appeal would just delay your trial even more).\n\n---\n\nSo, in your example: In general, in the US, you can't appeal a court refusing to dismiss your criminal case until the end of the trial unless your motion to dismiss was on double jeopardy grounds (in which case you file an interlocutory appeal). A guilty plea does result in a final judgment, but it's extremely risky to plead guilty on the theory that you'll immediately appeal: if you lose the appeal, you've forfeited your right to an actual trial. If you try to have your case dismissed but the court refuses, the appropriate action is to try to win the case in the lower court.

In general, a defendant cannot immediately appeal a trial court's denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case. This is because such a denial is not considered a final judgment, and appeals are typically only allowed after the conclusion of the trial court proceedings. \n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule. One notable exception is when the motion to dismiss is based on double jeopardy grounds. In such cases, the defendant is allowed to file an interlocutory appeal immediately. This is because double jeopardy protection is meant to prevent a person from even standing trial again for the same offense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the denial of a motion to dismiss is not considered a final judgment in most cases. Option B is overly broad; not all denials of motions to dismiss are eligible for immediate appeal.

For example [the Win10 one](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm). very typical clauses from the Win10 EULA explicitly forbid to transfer of the license without the device it was installed on:\n\n> 2.

Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device), for use by one person at a time, so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Updating or upgrading from non\\-genuine software with software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation, you do not have a license to use the software.\n> c. Restrictions. The device manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement. For example, this license does not give you any right to, and you may not:\n> \n> \n> (iii) transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement);\n> \n> \n> 4. Transfer.

Software preinstalled on device. If you acquired the software preinstalled on a device (and also if you upgraded from software preinstalled on a device), you may transfer the license to use the software directly to another user, only with the licensed device. The transfer must include the software and, if provided with the device, an authentic Windows label including the product key. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.\n> \n> \n> b. Stand\\-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand\\-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand\\-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device.

The licensor had put express language that forbids the transfer of the license by licensee into the contract:\n\n> When Alcan Ohio merged with Alcan Texas, the license granted by Cincom solely to Alcan Ohio transferred to the surviving corporation, now known as Novelis.

A signature is also not mandatory for there to be a contract: the signature simply serves as proof of an agreement.

It would help if you had some idea what evidence of authorization they have \u2013 your attorney would know how to get that information.\n\nYou will also want to consult [federal regulations regarding debt collection](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text#804). It is not clear how you first heard of this issue, i.e. did you receive a notice from the bank, or the collection agency; or did you first learn about this by getting served? At any rate, you cannot be held liable for credit card debts on legitimate card except as provided for in 15 USC 1643, which includes a $50 limit on liability for unauthorized use, and there is no special exception that if a card is fraudulently obtained, you become fully liable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case of alleged credit card fraud in Washington state, what is the primary burden of proof for the card issuer according to 15 USC 1643?\n\nA) To provide a signed credit card application from the defendant\nB) To show that the credit card use was authorized or that conditions of liability for unauthorized use have been met\nC) To produce a photocopy of the bank record showing an account in the defendant's name\nD) To prove that the defendant knowingly and willingly entered into a contractual agreement\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to 15 USC 1643, as mentioned in the passage, \"the burden of proof is upon the card issuer to show that the use was authorized or, if the use was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the card issuer to show that the conditions of liability for the unauthorized use of a credit card, as set forth in subsection (a), have been met.\" This directly corresponds to option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a signed application is not specifically required as per the information given.

Operationally, once the relevant agency makes a decision, the lawsuit would be brought by the antitrust division within the U.S. Justice Department. The other agencies including FCC, DOD, Energy Department, Homeland Security, and the State Department also sometimes have a say, but neither the SEC or FINRA usually do. Anti\\-trust law is designed to prevent abusive monopolies and unfair competitive practices like pricing goods or services at below costs in order to increase market share.\n\nBut, the SEC wouldn't be seeking to enforce anti\\-trust laws. The SEC would be seeking to enjoin a transfer that violates securities laws, which protect investors from fraud and market manipulation. The SEC asserts that the manner in which the offering of stock was made in connection with the proposed merger is illegal because it violations securities laws and/or securities law regulations.\n\nThe SEC does have authority to enjoin an illegal stock offering, or, other conduct related to the securities markets, for example, an improper proxy context, that violates SEC regulations.\n\nIndeed, as of January 1, 2021, in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that limited the SEC's authority, Congress [passed a bill](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2021/01/congress-expands-sec-enforcement-authority/) (attached to the National Defense Authorization Act) that increased the authority of the SEC to seek such relief. This new bill extends the statute of limitations for the SEC to obtain \"any equitable remedy,\" including injunctions, bars, suspensions, and cease\\-and\\-desist orders, without any showing of intent or knowledge of wrongdoing.\n\n> If the wrongdoing is significant enough, could the SEC force the SPAC\n> to replace its management,\n\nReplacing the management of a company when the managers were previously not disqualified from serving in that role, would not normally be a remedy available to the SEC, unless the managers were convicted of criminal securities fraud, and hence unable to serve in management because of that conviction, or something similar. Merely planning to conduct a transaction that would violate securities laws if consummated, with advanced notice to the SEC of the proposed transaction, would probably not qualify for this kind of remedy.\n\n> or is this not an issue to begin with considering the SEC will\n> eventually have to let the merger go through once fines are issued and\n> once the SPAC complies with securities laws?\n\nThe SEC could fine the company before or after the merger if it violated securities laws, but that wouldn't prevent the SEC from enjoining the merger on the grounds that going forward with it would violate securities laws. The remedies are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and often an injunction that prevents a violation from being consummated in the first place would be a remedy that is preferred to a fine.\n\n> This is of course dependent on whether the SPAC is found to violate\n> antitrust laws, but if that isn't the case, is it correct that the\n> SEC/FINRA don't have the legal authority to block a merger?\n\nThe SPAC isn't being attacked on the ground that it violates antitrust laws. It is being attacked for the lack of due diligence and disclosure that occurred in connection with the transaction that was made possible by virtue of its SPAC structure.

Even then, the prevailing assumption is that the judge will be prejudiced against litigant in all discretionary matters for the rest of the case, and that the lawyer for that litigant will be at a disadvantage before that judge for the rest of his or her legal career.\n\nColorado has no similar duty for municipal court judges or administrative law judges (who are not administrative part of the state judicial branch), or for appellate court judges. Likewise, there is no such duty in federal court.\n\nIn an extreme circumstance, a state court litigant could file a Colorado Appellate Rule 21 motion (formerly called a writ of mandamus) with the Colorado Supreme Court seeking interlocutory relief from the excessive delay, and a federal court litigant in an Article III federal trial court could seek parallel interlocutory relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the trial court is located. But, either way, the likelihood of the relevant appellate court actually granting interlocutory relief for excessive delay by a trial court in addressing a pending matter is virtually nil, unless the case is one statutorily entitled to priority scheduling such as election law cases, protective order cases, and in Colorado state court, in certain civil cases involving very elderly parties.\n\nBy way of example, I have had civil cases in which dispositive motions have been fully briefed and awaiting a ruling from a judge in both a general jurisdiction state trial court, and also in a different federal court, in which no ruling was forthcoming for more than a year after the matter was fully briefed.\n\nIt isn't terribly unusual when appellate court rulings are released, to see that the oldest case ruled upon (often an appeal of a serious criminal conviction) that day was filed five or more years before the opinion is issued, even though once a trial court record is transmitted to the court (which typically takes three to six months), and there are typically only three or four appellate briefs to be filed plus half an hour of oral argument to conduct once the case is fully briefed for the appellate judges to consider before ruling.\n\nThere are rare cases where proceedings can be even slower due to exigent circumstances.\n\nFor example, I once had a limited jurisdiction civil case that went to trial over automobile repairs in which the presiding judge who had heard all of the testimony and taken careful notes from it had a serious health incident the evening after the last day of the trial, leaving him hospitalized for seven months, and in which it was discovered that the tape recorder that was supposed to have recorded the trial court proceedings that could have been used to create a transcript for use by another judge to rule on the case was broken and had recorded nothing. A year after the trial was completely and the judge had recovered and returned to work, we got the judge's ruling that he otherwise would have provided within a week (because that would have been his normal practice, not because he was required to do so) had he not been hospitalized.\n\nNeedless to say, no one can tell the U.S. Supreme Court to speed up ruling on a matter in any binding way.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this in U.S. criminal law trial practice at both the state and local and at the federal level, where there is a constitutional right to a speedy trial that if abridged results in the dismissal of charges against the defendant, and there are a few other deadlines of a similar character related to the post\\-conviction process.

The area where a crime or other wrongdoing is committed is considered the proper \"forum\" for adjudicating the case.\n\nWith respect to the law you cited, you should take note of the statutory limitations imposed upon the Attorney General in pursuing such a case (called a \u00a7 1119 prosecution).

This permission cannot be granted if the other country has already prosecuted the individual for the same conduct.

The Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section handles these issues within the Criminal Division.\n\n> Does the Attorney General have to petition the other government for permission to prosecute them in the home country?\n\nNo. The statutory limitations listed above necessitate that the suspect has already left that country and part of the AG's determination must be that it is unlikely that country will be able to secure the person's return.

Only one of these remedies \\- a reverse condemnation action \\- is allowed as a remedy for agency action also governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, and both are present only in very rare cases where a new regulation or agency action deprives someone of all economic use of their property without just compensation.\n\nI suspect that what you are really looking for a different comparison about which there is a moderate sized academic literature that is discussed by economists and in legal theory (especially by tort law scholars).\n\nThis is the literature comparing two different ways other than criminal law for the government to regulate unlawful conduct by private actors.\n\nOne way to do that is with \"private law\" by authorizing someone who is harmed by the unlawful conduct of a private actor to sue the person who engaged in the unlawful conduct in a private tort law lawsuit (a tort is a \"civil wrong\" that may be remedied in a private lawsuit for money damages).\n\nAnother way to do that is to create a government agency that has the authority to have a government official enforce statutes or regulations enforcing or implementing statutes by bringing civil lawsuits, either in an administrative tribunal (like the National Labor Relations Board, or the Securities and Exchange Commission or the hybrid case of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission proceedings) subject to eventual Article III federal court review at least on appeal, or in a court. In these enforcement actions, remedies including fines, restitution to victims of the unlawful conduct, and/or injunctive relief.\n\nThere are many academic discussions comparing the features of these two ways to address wrongful, harmful conduct in violation of the law outside the criminal justice system.\n\nBut, generally speaking, an administrative agency enforcement mechanism arises from substantive federal regulatory statutes and not from the Administrative Procedures Act which governs primarily the process by which administrative agencies adopt regulations and to a much lesser extent to how administrative tribunals are constituted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and tort law in federal agency cases?\n\nA) The APA and tort law provide equal and interchangeable remedies for challenging federal agency actions.\n\nB) Tort law is the primary means of seeking redress against federal agencies, while the APA plays a minor role.\n\nC) The APA governs the process of agency rulemaking and some adjudications, while tort claims against federal agencies are generally barred by sovereign immunity.\n\nD) The APA and tort law are both commonly used to sue federal agencies for monetary damages resulting from regulatory actions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Your contract cannot protect you against claims by third\\-parties.

But, the defendant had wide latitude to do so in order to create a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.\n\nIn most circumstances, it would be a reversible abuse of discretion to prevent the defendant from introducing evidence to support a theory of this kind.\n\nA similar strategy, for example, was recently used in [a preliminary hearing in a case involving a high profile murder in Colorado](https://arkvalleyvoice.com/suzanne-morphew-murder-to-proceed-to-trial-barry-morphew-bail-set-at-500000/) where a man stands accused to murdering his wife (the man is Barry Morphew) has developed a theory that his wife was murdered by someone else based in part, for example, on the evidence of unidentified DNA near the murder scene allegedly associated with previous crimes in DNA databases.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a murder trial where the defendant Y is accused of killing X, the defense attorney attempts to introduce evidence suggesting that Z, the prosecution's star witness, had similar motive, means, and opportunity to commit the crime.

In criminal trials, defendants have the right to present evidence supporting their theory of the case, including evidence that someone else (in this case, Z) may have committed the crime. However, this right is not unlimited. The defense must explain to the judge how the evidence about Z is relevant to Y's defense, typically by showing how it creates reasonable doubt about Y's guilt. This approach balances the defendant's right to a fair trial with the need to maintain focus on the charges against the defendant.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because judges do not automatically exclude evidence about alternative suspects.

Taking [Washington drug laws](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=69.50&full=true) as an example, the numerous prohibitions generally start \"It is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally...\". If you requested it, you are intentionally in possession.

In that case, you are expected to notify the police that you're received something against the law to possess, but of course there could be a couple of minute lag between your realization and you getting the police on the phone. There is no statutory provision to the effect that you have 5 minutes from the point of discovery to call the police, instead, the jury would consider whether you were making reasonable efforts to inform authorities of the crime and become *not* in possession of the illegal goods.

First, anything created by Tagxedo enjoys copyright protection, be it software, fonts, images or text. They may give you a license to use any of this material, which can require you to attribute the thing to them. The FAQ is unclear as to whether \"images created by Tagxedo\" refers to material created by the company, or with the software. The former would be perfectly standard. The odd interpretation would be that if you use the program to create an image, you must attribute the image to Tagxedo (i.e. \"was created using Tagxedo\"). That does not give them ownership of the image, though (unless the terms specifically say that whatever you create, they own). This is possible, since it may be in the EULA (if you can link to the actual EULA that would be helpful), and the terms of the EULA govern the permitted usages of software. Unless specifically prohibited by law \\-\\- and I don't know of any such law, in the US, yet.

However, the legal interpretation suggests that this doesn't necessarily mean Tagxedo owns the copyright to user-created images.

The key prohibition is in [section 5363](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5363).\n\nTo fall within the scope of this prohibition, a person must: \n\n(1\\) be \"in the business of betting or wagering\" and\n\n(2\\) accept a payment in connection with the participation of another person in \"unlawful Internet gambling\".\n\nSo you need to look at (1\\) what is betting or wagering and (2\\) what is unlawful Internet gambling.\n\nBoth terms are defined in [section 5362](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362) and discussed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006#Section_5362.2C_Definitions).\n\nAssuming that you are running a video game that is not a thin veneer over a casino, and the users are gambling in\\-game items that are not purchased with actual money, then you are unlikely to be found to be engaged in the business of betting or wagering, especially given the exclusion in section 5362(1\\)(E)(viii) for \"participation in any game or contest in which participants do not stake or risk anything of value.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the SAFE Port Act and related legislation, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered illegal under U.S. online gambling laws?\n\nA) A fantasy sports website where users create teams of real-life athletes and compete based on the athletes' statistical performance, with no entry fee required\n\nB) An online poker website based in the U.S. that accepts credit card payments from American players for buy-ins to cash games\n\nC) A video game with an in-game currency that players can use to bet on virtual horse races, where the currency cannot be purchased with real money or exchanged for real-world value\n\nD) A free-to-play mobile game that offers players the chance to win small prizes through randomized \"loot boxes\" obtained through regular gameplay\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Fantasy sports are generally considered games of skill and are explicitly mentioned as an exception in the FBI statement.\n\nB) This scenario directly violates the SAFE Port Act by being \"in the business of betting or wagering\" and accepting payments for \"unlawful Internet gambling.\" Online poker for real money is typically considered illegal under U.S. federal law.\n\nC) This falls under the exclusion mentioned in section 5362(1)(E)(viii) for games where participants do not stake or risk anything of value, as the in-game currency has no real-world value.\n\nD) While loot boxes are controversial, they are generally not considered gambling under current U.S. federal law, especially if they are free and obtained through regular gameplay.\n\nOption B is the clearest violation of the SAFE Port Act and related online gambling prohibitions, making it the correct answer."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73756/public-figures-patents-and-inventions", "docs_id": 73756, "title": "Public Figures, Patents And Inventions", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any law or regulation that prevents or regulates the inventions made by public figures?\n\nPublic figures are people with hobbies and maybe some dedicate their free time to research.

Firstly, such an announcement is very likely to be protected by the First Amendment regardless of whether the announcement is made by the President or by any other person, because making an announcement is clearly a form of speech. In some cases, there might be concerns that a particular invention implicates the national security of the United States, in which case disclosure of the invention is unlawful (see [35 USC 181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181)), but the President [can unilaterally declassify anything](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/), so under [35 USC 187](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/187), the President is very likely exempt from the entire secrecy law altogether. Obviously, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea for the President to ignore the national security implications, but they have the legal power to do so if they wish.\n\nThere are also serious questions about the Constitutionality of 35 USC 181, because it constitutes a prior restraint on speech, and prior restraints are nearly always unconstitutional under well\\-established Supreme Court precedent. See particularly *United States v. Progressive*, which frustratingly never reached a firm conclusion on a closely\\-related issue, due to the government dropping the case. Nevertheless, there is a colorable legal argument that even national security considerations are not an adequate basis to impose a prior restraint on specific people in this fashion. If this argument is correct, then anyone can announce the invention of anything they like, President or not.\n\nAs to whether the President can patent it, it depends on whether they received federal funding to conduct the research, or did it on their own time and with their own money. If they did it on their own time, then the answer appears to be \"yes, they can patent it,\" as far as I can tell. If they did it with federal assistance, then [complicated rules apply](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/part-II/chapter-18) to protect the national interests of the United States.\n\nAs far as conflicts of interest are concerned, the normal way to deal with this problem is to put all of the President's assets (held before they were elected) into a [blind trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_trust), which might or might not then proceed to liquidate and/or diversify the President's portfolio in order to further distance it from any specific company or industry's interests. By design, the President should neither know nor control how, when, and whether that diversification happens.\n\nIt's not common for the President to invent something world\\-changing while in office, because the presidential office is already more than a full\\-time job. As a result, any specific discussion of how this problem would be solved will necessarily be somewhat speculative. I imagine that the President would proceed to create a corporation or other legal entity, give the patent to that entity, and then hand its ownership over to the President's pre\\-existing blind trust. But this is very much uncharted territory, and it's possible that the White House might come up with an alternative means of insulating the President from the conflict of interest. For example, they might form some sort of committee to formally advise the President and provide a paper trail of justifications for the President's actions with respect to their invention.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The President of the United States invents a revolutionary clean energy device while in office.

The documentation clearly states that \"The music, in musical notation form, has copyright.\" This means that permission is required to use the musical composition, regardless of the format in which it's presented (audio, sheet music, or light patterns). \n\nOption A is incorrect because this use doesn't automatically qualify as fair use, and the absence of audio doesn't negate the need for permission. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it only addresses audio recordings, which aren't being used in this case, and ignores the copyright on the musical composition itself.\n\nOption D is incorrect because creating original light patterns doesn't override the copyright on the underlying musical composition.\n\nThe question tests understanding of copyright law as it applies to different aspects of music (composition, recording, presentation) and the misconception that lack of audio playback exempts the use from copyright considerations."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84397/would-it-be-legal-for-a-bystander-to-use-force-to-prevent-an-abortion-in-texas", "docs_id": 84397, "title": "Would it be legal for a bystander to use force to prevent an abortion in Texas?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Would it be legal for a bystander to use deadly force to prevent a doctor from committing an abortion in Texas?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Under [Texas Penal Code Title 2 Subchapter A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.9.htm), one of three three conditions must be true to use the defense\\-of\\-others defense, that the person against whom force is used unlawfully and with force entered the person's residence, vehicle of business (not applicable), or attempted to forcibly remove the person from same (idem), or attempted aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.

Where are the pitfalls?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Giving advice on business or personal matters isn't legal advice. In this specific example it sounds like they have counsel in state already, the relative is not representing them as their attorney.\n\nGiving legal advice often isn't unlicensed practice of law. It could be though. If the lawyer was representing a client in court, taking them on as a client, accepting money for legal services, or preparing a motion it would be a problem.\n\nMany states offer reciprocity to lawyers licensed in some other states, or are part of the uniform bar exam. And if they are only covering federal law, like immigration it is typically not an issue. There is an exception for in house counsel, as the business is not harmed when an attorney practices outside of where they are licensed because they do so for the benefit of their employer, and they understand the risks. So it is possible to practice law legally in a state you were not originally licensed in some cases.\n\nMJP or UPL violations can be misdemeanors in the worst case. Unless a client was financially harmed, or there were other serious ethical breaches like a sexual relationship with a client, it is very rare for the bar to get involved.

While giving legal advice to a family member in another state where the lawyer is not licensed could potentially be considered unauthorized practice of law (UPL), the risk is relatively low if the advice is limited and not part of formal representation. The situation falls into a grey area that depends on various factors such as the extent and nature of the advice, whether there's any compensation, and whether the lawyer is acting in a formal capacity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while this could be an ethical violation, it's unlikely to result in immediate disbarment, especially for a first-time offense with a family member.\n\nOption B is incorrect because lack of payment doesn't automatically make it ethically permissible.

The key point is that both citizens and non-citizens alike can potentially perform a citizen's arrest, as the term simply refers to an arrest made by a member of the general public rather than a law enforcement official."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64704/someone-took-a-picture-of-me-with-my-camera-at-my-request-who-owns-the-copyrig", "docs_id": 64704, "title": "Someone took a picture of me with my camera, at my request. Who owns the copyright?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am digitally archiving photographs taken by my deceased relative. Most of the time it is clear they took the pictures, but once in a while in a film roll there is a picture of the relative, clearly taken by someone else, in the scenery otherwise photographed by the relative. Presumably the relative arranged the scene and set up the camera, the other person just pushed the shutter release button.\n\nIs there a case to be made that my relative holds the copyright to such *not exactly selfie* images, or should I state \"copyright unknown\" on them?\n\nThese images are private in nature and have never been published, though sometimes they might have some historical interest as they depict structures and landscapes long gone, and such images *will* be published (not for profit). This obviously doesn't matter from the copyright point of view, but might still affect the answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright is held by the person who creates the work, not the person who owns the device (typewriter, camera, chisel). However, copyright may be held by the person who hired the creator to create the work, that is, the work may be a \"work for hire\". In the US, this refers to \"a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment\". As you describe it, this is not a work for hire. It is also possible that A might have a contract with B where B takes pictures for money and transfers copyright to A (presumably not applicable).\n\nCopyright in pictures taken by the relative is held by the relative. Copyright in the pictures *of* the relative might be jointly held by the relative and the person operating the camera. The creative (protected) elements include not just the act of pressing the button, it includes all sorts of setup stuff. Then the relative and the other person may hold joint copyright in the work. Since copyright is about protecting a person's creative work and it is unclear whether the operator contributed creatively to the work, it's impossible to say whether certain of those pictures are \"Copyright Relative and Anonymous\". If I hand a person my camera and say \"Take a picture of me\", that doesn't constitute the kind of creativity on my part that is protected by copyright law (whereas a more detailed description of what should be the camera angle relative to the rock and the sun etc. would involve requisite creativity). Lacking any substantive information on how the picture was created, it is hard to assert with confidence who holds copyright.\n\nIn the 19th century, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the photographer as owner of the photograph in Burrow\\-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53 (1884\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where a photographer sets up a shot, including composition, lighting, and camera settings, but asks a bystander to press the shutter button, who holds the copyright to the resulting photograph?\n\nA) The bystander who pressed the shutter button\nB) The photographer who set up the shot\nC) Both the photographer and the bystander jointly\nD) No one holds copyright as it's a collaborative work\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to copyright law principles and the precedent set by Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony (1884), copyright is typically held by the person who contributes the creative elements to a work. In this scenario, the photographer who set up the shot, including composition, lighting, and camera settings, is providing the bulk of the creative input. The act of merely pressing the shutter button, when instructed to do so, does not typically constitute a level of creativity that would confer copyright ownership. This is similar to the scenario described in the original question where a relative set up shots but occasionally appeared in photos taken by others. The creative decisions made in setting up the shot are the key factors in determining copyright ownership, not the mechanical act of pressing the button."}}
