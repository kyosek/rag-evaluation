Did police ever say this as a matter of course? If so why? If not where did this expression enter the popular consciousness?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In long ago English practice, the phrase used was \"**Stop in the name of the King**\". At one time this was, if I am not mistaken, required for a valid arrest. I am talking about a time hundreds of years ago, by the way.\n\nThat phrase, in turn, goes back to a still older concept. At one time, in Germanic customary law, each important leader had a \"peace\" \\-\\- an area in and around his dwelling, domain, and presence \\-\\- in which any violation of law and custom was an offense against the leader, not just against a victim. Inside his \"peace\" a leader was allowed to enforce rules without any complaint from a victim. Later the peace of all lesser leaders was subsumed in the Kings Peace, which came to cover the entire kingdom, the area of the king's authority and rule. This concept came over with the Normans, although a version of it had come over with the Anglo\\-Saxons centuries before.\n\nThat is why indictments in England (later England and Wales) long included such language as \"... That on or about {date} the said {accused} did, **against the peace of our Lord the King, his crown and dignity**, commit {offense} by {details}...\"\n\nI will need to do some searching to find the exact citations to support this, although Charles Rembar's *The Law of the Land* includes the part about the king's peace.\n\nSpecifically, in a footnote on page 192 of my (trade paper) edition (and at location 3345 0f my kindel edition) Rembar writes:\n\n> The concept of a \u201cpeace\u201d that is a ruler\u2019s right goes back to Germanic law. It belonged not only to a king but to each leader in the social structure. Every ruler, naturally enough, wanted order in his group, as do modern governments. The difference is that freedom from disturbance was considered the chieftain\u2019s personal privilege, and disorder among those he led was a personal affront. With the strengthening of central rule, the king\u2019s peace overrode all others.\n\nI will need to search further to learn just when the phrase \"in the name of the law\" became common, and when either phrase ceased to be legally required. I believe that the phrase persisted in common use long after it was no longer legally required, but I will need citations for that also. I will update this answer with all of that when I can.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the historical evolution and significance of the phrase \"Stop in the name of the law\" in English legal practice?\n\nA) The phrase originated in modern times as a dramatic device in popular media, with no historical basis in actual law enforcement practices.\n\nB) It evolved from the Germanic concept of a leader's \"peace,\" later becoming \"Stop in the name of the King\" in English practice, and was once legally required for a valid arrest.\n\nC) The phrase has always been \"Stop in the name of the law\" and has been consistently used in English law enforcement since medieval times.\n\nD) It was introduced by the Normans and immediately replaced all other forms of arrest declarations in English legal practice.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The question tests understanding of the historical context and evolution of legal phrases in English practice. The passage indicates that the concept originated from Germanic customary law, where leaders had a \"peace\" - an area where violations were considered offenses against the leader. This evolved into \"Stop in the name of the King\" in English practice, which at one point was required for a valid arrest. The phrase \"Stop in the name of the law\" is a more modern variation, but it stems from this historical precedent. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the phrase has historical roots and wasn't merely a media invention. Option C is wrong as it doesn't acknowledge the phrase's evolution from \"Stop in the name of the King.\" Option D is inaccurate as it oversimplifies the introduction and adoption of the concept in English law."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8362/is-it-legal-to-sell-access-to-recordings-of-public-tv-broadcasts", "docs_id": 8362, "title": "Is it legal to sell access to recordings of public TV broadcasts?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Increasingly TV channels supplement their on\\-air broadcasts with publicly\\-accessible IPTV\\-service \"broadcasting\" the same content via Internet.

S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\), the US Supreme Court held that activity almost identical to what you describe is copyright infringement.\n\n> Respondent Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\u2019s website. Aereo\u2019s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber\\-specific folder on Aereo\u2019s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\u2019s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over\\-the\\-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n> \n> \n> We must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes \\[copyright] by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. We conclude that it does.\n\nA nicer summary, oral argument transcript and audio are available from the [Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-461).\n\nIn my opinion, your example is more clearly an infringement of copyright than Aereo's. Aereo dedicated separate antennae to receive a signals for each subscriber at the subscriber's direction, and rebroadcast the signal over the internet in near real\\-time. This let them argue two things: 1\\) that they were not *performing* the work, only letting other people perform it, and 2\\) that the performance was not \"to the public\". In your example, the server is receiving and saving the broadcast, and then later, that single copy is being reproduced and transmitted to whomever requests it.

Aereo ruling. This scenario involves recording and storing broadcasts, then allowing multiple users to access these recordings later, which clearly constitutes both reproduction and public performance of copyrighted content without permission.\n\nOption A describes a system similar to Aereo's, which was ruled as infringing.

However by the time the house is sold, 20 years later, the house is worth \u00a3900,000 and is equivalent to $1,200,000\\. The owner must now calculate exactly how much money he earned \\- taking into account the GBP/USD exchange rate every time there was a mortgage payment. This would require many dozens or possibly hundreds of hours to do, at massive cost (if performed by a tax professional). \n\nIn the example above, should the owner not properly follow these rules, and perhaps just make some rough estimate, could he be held criminally responsible for filing an incorrect tax return? \n\n**Or** does there exist some kind of defense that complying with the law would simply have been completely unreasonable or impractical?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sometimes laws contain exceptions when they are \"unreasonably\" burdensome.

But even if a separate conversion had to be applied to each separate payment, that is exactly the kind of thing that an app or computer program could do quickly and easily.

This immunity protects them from both civil liability and criminal prosecution for their judicial acts, even if those acts were in error, malicious, or exceeded the judge's authority. However, this immunity is not absolute. In rare cases, a judge can be held liable for actions that fall completely outside their judicial role or involve corruption, fraud, or deliberate abuse of judicial authority. In this scenario, while the judge's actions violated regulatory procedures, they were still performed as part of their judicial duties.

He sought no permission for what he was about to do. ...With background noises barely registering, he rushed toward her as if in a vacuum.\n> \n> \n> Though George halted his steps just before running into Greta, his upper torso\u2019s momentum swept over her. The motion\u2019s force bent Greta backward and to her right. As he overtook Greta\u2019s slender frame, his right hand cupped her slim waist. He pulled her inward toward his lean and muscular body. Her initial attempt to physically separate her person from the intruder proved a futile exertion against the dark\\-uniformed man\u2019s strong hold. With her right arm pinned between their two bodies, she instinctively brought her left arm and clenched fist upward in defense. The effort was unnecessary. He never intended to hurt her.\n> \n> \n> As their lips locked, his left arm supported her neck. His left hand, turned backward and away from her face, offered the singular gesture of restraint, caution or doubt. The struck pose created an oddly appealing mixture of brutish force, caring embrace, and awkward hesitation. He didn\u2019t let go. As he continued to lean forward, she lowered her right arm and gave over to her pursuer\u2014but only for three or four seconds. He tried to hold her closer, wanting the moment to last longer. And longer still. But they parted...He just had to kiss her. He didn\u2019t know why.\n\nThe photo was taken August 14, 1945\\.

The legal analysis provided indicates that even by modern New York legal standards, this incident would not be classified as sexual assault. The key reasons are:\n\n1. In 1945, the legal definition of sexual crimes was much narrower, mostly limited to rape.\n2.

While Trump has been involved in many lawsuits, as have his businesses, only one prior case to his Presidency was criminal or quasi\\-criminal and might have involved an arraignment (although not necessarily):\n\n> In 2006, the Town of Palm Beach began fining Trump $250 per day for\n> ordinance violations related to his erection of an 80\\-foot\\-tall (24 m)\n> flagpole flying a 15\\-by\\-25\\-foot (4\\.6 by 7\\.6 m) American flag on his\n> property. Trump sued the town for $25 million, saying that they\n> abridged his free speech, also disputing an ordinance that local\n> businesses be \"town\\-serving\". The two parties settled as part of a\n> court\\-ordered mediation, in which Trump was required to donate\n> $100,000 to veterans' charities. At the same time, the town ordinance\n> was modified allowing Trump to enroll out\\-of\\-town members in his\n> Mar\\-a\\-Lago social club.\n\nSome municipal ordinance violations are treated procedurally like traffic tickets, and some are treated more like misdemeanor criminal offenses (which do generally involve arraignments).\n\nAfter his Presidency, one of his business entities [was convicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_and_business_legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump) of rare criminal charges against an organization:\n\n> On December 6, 2022, Trump's company The Trump Organization was\n> convicted on 17 criminal charges.\n\nLawsuits do not give rise to arraignments. This isn't part of the civil lawsuit process.\n\nIt is estimated that [70 to 100 million Americans](https://www.sentencingproject.org/app/uploads/2022/08/Americans-with-Criminal-Records-Poverty-and-Opportunity-Profile.pdf) have criminal records because they have been convicted of at least one criminal offense. This is about one in three or one in four American adults. The number of Americans who have even been arraigned for a crime, in a case that is not currently pending, who have never been convicted of a crime, is probably on the order of 1 million to 10 million. Probably tens of millions of Americans who have never been arraigned, however, have been arrested but never charged with any crime, in addition to those who have been arraigned and not convicted with no charges pending, those who have been arraigned only in cases that are still pending, and those who have been convicted of crimes.\n\n**Lots Of Crimes That Are Committed Are Never Prosecuted**\n\n> There is also a CREW report listing 56 \"credible\" criminal offenses\n> since Trump launched his campaign in 2015\\.\n\nThese are cases in which there is there are credible allegations that Trump acted in ways that could have been the basis for committing a crime. But, CREW is not alleging that any of these circumstances (other than the 2022 Trump Organization conviction and the two felony cases upon which Trump has been arraigned in 2023\\) have resulted in any court action being taken to press criminal charges.\n\nIt is possible that Trump or one of his businesses was the subject of criminal investigations that did not result in charges being brought, but there is really no way to know that this is the case. And, there is nothing terribly dishonorable about being investigated for a crime but not ultimately charged with any criminal offense.\n\nBy analogy, if you are speeding, you are committing a traffic offense. The vast majority of the time, you are not ticketed for speeding even if a law enforcement office's radar gun tells the law enforcement officer that you were going slightly over the speed limit. Eventually, after the statute of limitations for traffic offenses (which is quite short) runs, you can't even be charged with those offenses.\n\nIn the same way, while unlawful sexual contact or sexual assault is a crime, if charges are not brought within the statute of limitations (something we know empirically to be quite common) then it doesn't result in criminal charges even though the offender committed a crime.\n\nLikewise, most civil fraud lawsuits allege conduct that could have been prosecuted as a crime if authorities sought to do so. But, in practice, criminal prosecutors with limited resources most often chose not to bring criminal fraud prosecutions in cases where a civil fraud lawsuit could bring complete relief to the party who was harmed by it.\n\n**Not All Illegal Conduct Is Criminal**\n\nMany kinds of conduct that can give rise to civil lawsuits cannot generally give rise to criminal charges at all. These include breaches of contract, negligently but unintentionally causing a personal injury, disagreeing over the interpretation of the tax laws in a way that cause the government to allege that you failed to pay the full amount of the taxes that you owe, employment discrimination, and many kinds of housing discrimination.\n\n**Big Businesses Are Usually Parties To Many Lawsuits**\n\nBusiness entities, large and small, are routinely involved in lots of civil lawsuits, sometimes as plaintiffs and sometimes as defendants, and the number of lawsuits is, more or less, usually roughly proportional to the economic scale of the enterprise.\n\nFor example, almost every landlord brings eviction and rent collection lawsuits from time to time, and sometimes is sued by tenants over security deposit issues and alleged defects in the maintenance of the rental property. Almost every significant property owner will sooner or later become involved in litigation over boundary discrepancies or easements or in eminent domain cases. Almost every developer will sooner or later be involved in construction defect and/or mechanic's lien litigation.\n\nAlmost every bank brings foreclosure lawsuits and collection lawsuits when loans are allegedly not paid as agreed or loan covenants are not met.\n\nAlmost every business with a great many employees with eventually be involved in some sort of lawsuit with an employee.\n\nA large business will typically litigate a significant tax dispute at least every few years.\n\nMost of the lawsuits filed in the United States are brought by banks alleging defaults on loans, landlords alleging unpaid rent, and governments collecting unpaid taxes.\n\nFor example, [in Colorado, in 2022](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Administration/Planning_and_Analysis/Annual_Statistical_Reports/2022/FY2022%20Annual%20Report.pdf), there were 62,996 tax collection cases, 29,836 evictions, 1,971 simple mortgage foreclosures, 66,875 debt collection cases, and 306 personal property repossession cases, for a total of 161,984 civil lawsuits out of 199,293 civil lawsuits in the state (about 81%), the lion's share of which are brought by financial institution lenders, landlords, and government tax collectors.\n\nWhether 4,000 lawsuits over several decades is a lot or a little for a large business enterprise, or is just par for the course, really comes down to the nature of, and scope of, the businesses involved. The character of the allegations in the lawsuit, and whether the allegations are atypical of lawsuit involving large business enterprises, is really more telling than the number of lawsuits.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Donald Trump's legal history prior to his presidency?\n\nA) Trump had been arraigned multiple times for personal criminal charges before becoming president.\n\nB) The majority of legal cases involving Trump were criminal charges against him personally.\n\nC) Trump's businesses were involved in numerous civil lawsuits, which is typical for large business enterprises.\n\nD) Trump had never been involved in any legal proceedings before running for president.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because there's no evidence of multiple arraignments for personal criminal charges before his presidency.

Transfer.** The provisions of this section do not apply if you acquired the software in Germany or in any of the countries listed on this site (aka.ms/transfer), in which case any transfer of the software to a third party, and the right to use it, must comply with applicable law.\n> \n> \n> **a. Software preinstalled on device.** If you acquired the software preinstalled on a device (and also if you upgraded from software preinstalled on a device), you may transfer the license to use the software directly to another user, only with the licensed device. The transfer must include the software and, if provided with the device, an authentic Windows label including the product key. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.\n> \n> \n> **b. Stand\\-alone software.** If you acquired the software as stand\\-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand\\-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.\n\nSo, (for everywhere other than Germany) pre\\-installed copies can't be transferred \\- if this is what came with those machines then you're good to go, slap a new hard drive in there and you can install the same version it came with originally, or use the keys to get an upgrade to Win10 as desired (any upgraded\\-to\\-Win10 license remains an OEM license tied to that machine).\n\nWhile that explains the case for your laptops, if it *wasn't* a preinstalled (which is only really likely in the event of a machine privately home\\-built by the original owner) then there's a possibility that they could have transferred the license to another machine.\n\nAs @user253751 says in a comment:\n\n> What if it's the motherboard of Theseus?\n\nWhile people are unlikely to have a *motherboard* of Theseus (it's more common for the motherboard itself to be treated as a discrete component) people do change/upgrade components in PCs all the time.

US](https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013cv0942-136-0) is whether the statue is a building or a sculpture. The government sought dismissal of the case because\n\n> The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does\n>  not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public\n>  display of pictures ... of the work, if the building in which the work\n>  is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.\n\ncontending \"that the sculpture is part of a much larger, unitary architectural work, namely the New York, New York Hotel \\& Casino\".

Previously, architectural\n>  works had little protection because they were considered utilitarian\n>  and not subject to copyright protection. See Leischester v. Warner\n>  Bros., 232 F.3d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir. 2000\\). That changed in 1990 when\n>  congress passed the Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act\n>  (\"AWCPA\"), which added specific protection for architectural works but\n>  with the limiting proviso, on which the government relies, that\n>  photographs of public architectural works are exempted from\n>  protection.

Moreover, the regulatory definition of building is given [37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202\\.11(b)(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/202.11):\n\n> The term \"building\" is defined in the applicable regulations as a\n>  \"humanly habitable structure.\"\n\nand there is no dispute that the sculpture is not a building in that sense.

The court rejected the government's argument that the Statue of Liberty replica was part of the architectural work of the New York, New York Hotel & Casino. Instead, it determined that the replica was a sculpture, not a building as defined in copyright law (which refers to \"humanly habitable structures\").

The word \"appropriate\" is included not to impose strict limitations, but rather to avoid a narrow interpretation of \"necessary\" that would only allow actions if they were absolutely essential.

Aircraft are not, however, enentitled to use false markings.\n\nFrom [false flag Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#cite_ref-9)\n\n> In land warfare, such operations are generally deemed acceptable under certain circumstances, such as to deceive enemies, provided the deception is not perfidious and that all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy.

Assuming \"yes\" to both questions, the housing provider must \"modify or provide an exception to a 'no pets' rule or policy\".

The landlord cannot charge an additional deposit for a service or support animal.

The object or condition must be such as to attract children likely to be put in danger. An uncovered swimming pool or a disused refrigerator are classic examples of an attractive nuisance\n\nA bicycle would not usually constitute an object of danger to a trespassing child that the child was unable to understand or foresee. A child able to climb on and operate the bicycle is probably aware enough to foresee the ordinary dangers of riding a bicycle. But much would depend on the exact facts of the case. If there was some circumstance that made use of a bicycle more risky than usual, that might alter the decision.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine)\n\n> The attractive nuisance doctrine emerged from case law in England, starting with *Lynch v. Nurdin* in 1841\\. In that case, an opinion by Lord Chief Justice Thomas Denman held that the owner of a cart left unattended on the street could be held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto the cart and fell. The doctrine was first applied in the United States in [*Sioux City \\& Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stout* 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 657 (1873\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City_%26_Pacific_Railroad_Co._v._Stout), an 1873 case from Nebraska in which a railroad company was held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto an unsecured railway turntable. The term \"attractive nuisance\" was first used in 1875 in *Keffe v. Milwaukee \\& St. Paul Railway Co.*, a Minnesota case. The doctrine has since been adopted in some other common law jurisdictions, such as Canada, but not universally.\n\nConditions\n----------\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article listed above, quoting the *Restatement of Torts (second)* \u00a7339, an attractive nuisance is an **artificial** hazard which meets all of the following conditions. Natural hazards, such as lakes, do not fit the rule:\n\n> * The place where the condition exists is one on which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and\n> * The condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children,\n> * The children, because of their youth, do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in inter\\-meddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it,\n> * The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and\n> * The possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.\n\nSome US jurisdictions, such as Maryland, do not follow this rule.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has an old, rusty playground set in their unfenced backyard. The set includes a tall slide with loose bolts and a damaged ladder. A 6-year-old child from the neighborhood enters the property, climbs the slide, falls, and is severely injured. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the homeowner's potential liability under the attractive nuisance doctrine?\n\nA) The homeowner is not liable because the child was trespassing on private property.\nB) The homeowner is automatically liable due to the presence of playground equipment on their property.\nC) The homeowner may be liable if all conditions of the attractive nuisance doctrine are met, including the child's inability to appreciate the risk.\nD) The homeowner is only liable if they were present at the time of the accident and failed to warn the child.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The attractive nuisance doctrine may apply in this situation, but all conditions must be met. The playground set is an artificial hazard that the homeowner likely knows children might be attracted to (condition 1). Its poor condition presents an unreasonable risk of harm (condition 2). A 6-year-old may not fully appreciate the dangers of the damaged equipment (condition 3). The burden of repairing or removing the set is likely small compared to the risk (condition 4). If the homeowner failed to take reasonable care to eliminate the danger (condition 5), they may be liable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because trespassing alone doesn't exempt the homeowner from liability under this doctrine. Answer B is overly broad; mere presence of playground equipment doesn't automatically create liability. Answer D is incorrect because the homeowner's presence at the time of the accident is not a requirement for the doctrine to apply."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42533/when-does-it-become-illegal-to-exchange-bitcoin-for-cash", "docs_id": 42533, "title": "When does it become illegal to exchange bitcoin for cash?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've read several \"stings\" and raids for running unlicensed money transfer businesses for people buying and selling bitcoin on localbitcoins.

Such crimes typically involve money laundering, identity theft, stolen card numbers, and the like. As quoted in [one of the links](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-a-canadian-was-charged-with-money-laundering-in-sale-of-bitcoins/article16831445/) you provide, \"*\\[t]he use of bitcoins in the transactions is a new technological flourish to this very old crime*\".\n\n> Is there any direct source or any laws with numbers?\n\nApropos of your first link, mentioning that \"*a Florida judge threw out money transmitting charges against a bitcoiner*\" (see also [here](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article91682102.html)), I will point out that the court's dismissal of charges against that defendant has been reversed early this year. See [*State v. Espinoza*, 264 So.3d 1055 (2019\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inflco20190130174).\n\nAlthough the judges' narratives of a case are questionable and/or sloppy and to be taken with a grain of salt, the appellate decision cites language from Florida legislation as applicable to virtual currencies (and, impliedly, cryptocurrencies). You will notice that the focus in the *Espinoza* decision is the interpretation of Florida Statutes in its sections 560\\.125(1\\) and (5\\)(a) (regarding unauthorized vendors), and [560\\.103](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0500-0599/0560/Sections/0560.103.html)(21\\), (29\\) (defining *monetary value* as \"*a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in currency*\").\n\nAs usual, each legislation may present subtle and/or fundamental variations. For instance, the court in *Espinoza at 1065* identified that federal law is inapplicable there in that 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010\\.100(ff)(5\\)(i)(A) contemplates that \"*the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency **to another location or person** by any means*\" (emphasis added), and Espinoza's transaction(s) did not involve a third party. By contrast, the Florida statute does not allude to third parties in that transmission of monetary value, hence preventing the statutory sanctions from being *preemptively* foreclosed in the matter of Espinoza.\n\n> What about when someone buys with stolen money or money from illegal proceeds. Did you commit a crime if you sell bitcoin to someone and the money is stolen, or the gift cards are stolen?\n\nThat also depends on the jurisdiction and the facts of the case. In *Espinoza*, he was allegedly informed that the cash he received (or was about to receive) in exchange for bitcoins \"*derived from engaging in illegal activity and that \\[the buyer] was planning to use the bitcoins to engage in further illegal activity*\", *Espinoza at 1058*.

This assessment would typically be made by an Environmental Health Officer, who would consider factors such as the frequency of the broadcast, its volume, duration, and impact on the community.

If it simply walks away from the lease, it will lose some of the money it invested in those improvements. \n\n2\\) Hughes, the landlord, *does not* own all of the rights to his property. Because of the lease, the MRC owns the right to use the property for the term of the lease. This right is valuable \u2014 that is why the MRC is willing to pay for it. Depending on how valuable that right is, the MRC might balk at simply giving this valuable property away for free. \n\nAssuming the lease prevents the MRC from subletting the property, then MRC and Hughes are stuck having to deal with each other.

In most cases, no one person owns all of the sticks in the bundle. Instead, rights to control various aspects are held by different people. For example, my neighbors may \"own\" the right to drive across \"my\" property to get to their garage through an easement. The city may \"own\" the right to decide what sort of building I can put on the property through zoning.

One of the defining characteristics of modern business is selling digital products online, but obviously there are problems with legal protection on that front as it is newer legal territory. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to hire a lawyer or get some kind of formal legal advice, but rather to find the right direction and a proper precedent for people facing this situation. Specifically, what is the best license agreement that allows any random person off the street to be legally protected when licensing purely digital content over the internet? \n\nWhat I mean is, say a business owner or sole proprietor wants to license a digital file, like a picture or audio file so that the buyer can use it to make and sell their own games, videos, commercials and freelance work, educational purposes, presentations, or really anything else that uses multimedia. But, the creator of the original digital product obviously doesn't want a buyer to simply start selling or distributing the individual files themselves or as a collection of files, they original creator or organization wants to retain their rights while preventing the buyers from selling specifically the files or modified versions of the files while allowing the buyers the utility to make commercial end\\-products with it. What kind of terms of use, in a simple text document, can be provided to ensure this with a product download? And does such a text document actually create any binding agreement in the first place? \n\nI would hope someone who has studied this or has experience with this matter could point me in the right direction so that I can convey it to designers and students alike. \nYou can use microsoft word, but you can't sell microsoft word or any of its components or reverse engineer it. What kind of agreement is the equivalent of that but for digital media files? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem is stating exactly what you want to license versus forbid. You indicate that you want to prohibit resale of unchanged copies of the work, so you could include a license condition that forbids the sale of the unmodified work, but allows the sale of a derivative work. That would mean that the person can't just re\\-sell copies of the original image file, but that can package it with other works and sell a derivative work, or change the formal from GIF to JPG, or add a border around the file, and sell the derivative work. But that doesn't seem to be strong enough.\n\nIt's not clear what distinction you are drawing between forbidding the sale of \"the files or modified versions of the files\", but allowing \"the utility to make commercial end\\-products with it\". In order to \"use\" the material, you are copying it and transforming it in some way. You might be able to craft language in a specific license to use a high\\-resolution digital representation of a unicorn, which allows a certain free use of copies with a certain level of degradation, such as 5% of the original resolution and limited to 8 bit color. There is no general license that covers all such cases, because we don't know what cases are in versus out.

The content creator wants to allow commercial use of their files in end products while preventing direct resale or distribution of the original or slightly modified files. This requires a carefully crafted license that specifies allowed transformations and uses, potentially including technical parameters like resolution or format changes.

There has also been a verdict in a German court according to which embedding Google Fonts (loaded from Google servers) requires such consent, because the IP address is shared with Google. So website operators can either ask for consent or serve the fonts from their own server instead.\n\nBut, what if my entire site is hosted at Google? Obviously Google receives the visitors' IP addresses starting with the very first HTTP request and I get no chance to ask them for permission BEFORE that happens.

When engaging a data processor they must be legally bound to only use the data on your behalf, for example with a contract / data processing agreement (DPA). See Art 28 GDPR.\n\nData processor status is attractive because processors are seen as an extension of the controller. In contrast, when sharing data with other controllers you would need a separate legal basis to authorize this sharing.\n\nGoogle offers tons of different services, so this question needs to be considered on a case by case basis. For Google Cloud services or Google Workplace, Google generally acts as a data processor. For other services, Google acts as a controller. Notably, Google Fonts does not offer a DPA so that you cannot claim they're acting as a processor in that context, regardless of what other Google services you use.\n\nAn equally important problem when using Google services is the data transfer problem. Google is controlled from the US, but the US do not offer an adequate level of data protection (see the Schrems II judgement). Comparatively few Google services allow you to select where the servers are located, as to prevent transfers of personal data to countries where privacy cannot be guaranteed. For example, this is why Google Analytics (GA) is problematic. Google acts as a data processor for basic GA features but makes no promises about the location of servers. Thus, using GA implies a (probably) illegal transfer of personal data to the US.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is considering using various Google services for their website.

If your business has goods or services sold in more than one category using the same mark, you can protect it in every category that applies.\n\nWith respect to each category, if a good or service in a category sold with a mark just like yours would harm your sales of goods and services that you currently provide, then it makes sense to seek a mark in that category. If your product line expands, you can also add categories later if someone else using the same mark or a confusingly similar one hasn't moved into that market in the meantime.\n\nIn the case of a medical manufacturing company, the cost of obtaining a trademark in an additional category after the first category (several thousand dollars or less), relative to the economic importance of the company's trademarks and the economic scale of your operations (which should be in the multiple millions of dollars), is so small that cost should be a non\\-issue. So, you should apply for a trademark in every category that you could plausibly and truthfully be said to do business in.\n\nIf you can't afford a few thousand dollars to perfect a trademark in a few additional categories, you should think twice about whether investing in trademark registration at all makes any sense, because enforcing a trademark in the face of potential infringement is far more expensive (tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for each infringer who doesn't go away with a mere cease and desist letter and thousands of dollars a year monitoring the market for infringement) and if you fail to enforce your trademark in the face of clear evidence of infringement, you risk your trademark losing its validity entirely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A medical device company, MediTech, is planning to trademark its brand. MediTech produces a range of medical devices and related software, and also offers design and consultation services for other medical companies. Which of the following trademark strategies would be most appropriate and beneficial for MediTech?\n\nA) Apply for a trademark only in category 010 (medical devices) to protect their flagship product\nB) Apply for a trademark only in category 044 (medical services) to cover their design and consultation services\nC) Apply for trademarks in both categories 010 and 044, even if it costs more, to protect all aspects of their business\nD) Wait to trademark until they can afford to enforce it against potential infringers\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, it's beneficial for a company to apply for trademarks in multiple categories if their business spans different areas. MediTech produces medical devices (category 010) and offers design and consultation services (category 044), so trademarking in both categories would provide the most comprehensive protection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only covers the medical devices and not the services. Option B is incorrect for the opposite reason - it only covers the services and not the devices. Option D is not advisable because if the company can afford to register trademarks, they should do so to establish their rights, even if enforcement might be costly later. The cost of registration is relatively small compared to the potential benefits and the scale of operations for a medical device company.\n\nFurthermore, the passage emphasizes that if a company can't afford a few thousand dollars for additional trademark categories, they should reconsider whether trademarking at all is worthwhile, given the potentially high costs of enforcement."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7884/what-types-of-websites-must-respect-the-web-content-accessibility-guidelines-in", "docs_id": 7884, "title": "What types of websites must respect the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in the United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I wonder what types of websites, if any, must respect the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines) in the United States?\n\nI am especially interested in the application of a [minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are at least three kinds of \"must\" implied by the question. The broadest is the non\\-legal \"in order to avoid all negative consequences\", in which case probably any and all. From the legal POV, you can distinguish two varieties of compulsion, one being ordinary tort or contractual liability. Theoretically, I could try to sue anybody that uses color distinctions to convey information on a web page. As an out\\-of\\-the\\-blue web surfer (no pun intended) I would probably have no luck. However, I might have a contractual relationship with a website, where I pay big money and they provide me information, only they do it via virtually imperceptable color differences like 123456 vs 123459\\. It is possible (but certainly not a foregone conclusion) that they would be in breach of the agreement. One would have to look at the contract. That then leaves the possibility that there is a federal or state regulation that obligates some/all web pages to comply with certain standards (which could lead to a discrimination suit). The short answer is, there aren't any across\\-the\\-board requirements. There are very many specific requirements.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the two relevant pieces of law are the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990) and the [Rehabilitation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973). Whether or not you have to do something to comply with these acts depends on what you are doing. One reason would be in connection with employment: as an employer, I have some legal obligation to comply. Regarding 42 USC 12111, an employer is\n\n> a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more\n>  employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in\n>  the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person,\n>  except that, for two years following the effective date of this\n>  subchapter, an employer means a person engaged in an industry\n>  affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day\n>  in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year,\n>  and any agent of such person\n\nand then it mentions exclusions, such as an Indian tribe, or the US, or a corporation owned entirely by the US government, etc. As an employer, I would have to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual (these are terms defined in the statute). The latter *may* include \"making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities\". If the web page (which the employee has to use on the job) employs the color scheme \"light greenish yellow vs. light yellowish green\" for conveying important information, and if that could be trivially re\\-coded to black and white by changing two constants, then that would be a reasonable accommodation (probably), where if it required massive and expensive reprogramming, that would not be reasonable. Even then, it would depend on the disability in question. There is a federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has jurisdiction over that and can decide what is a disability for their purposes. As far as I know, color blindness is not a protected disability, and the [EEOC Q\\&A on vision impairment](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_vision.cfm) and ADA does not suggest that this is a protected disability. That page has extensive examples that you can work through to get a feel for who might be covered, and what accommodations are reasonable.\n\nPursuant to [section 508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973) of the (amended) Rehabilitation Act, the Federal government has to provide access to information for disabled persons that is comparable to that available to others. An obvious example of that would be web pages that could be listened to rather than only being read. This doesn't per se apply to private web pages, as long as you are not receiving federal funds. Also, this is not an absolute requirement, so if it would impose an undue burden on the agency to comply, then they can be in less than full compliance. Even so, assuming that color\\-blindness is not yet a legal disability, the widespread color abuses on web pages are not legally covered.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small tech startup with 20 employees is developing a web application for a federal government agency.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to provide comparable access to information for disabled persons. This applies to web applications developed for government use, even if created by contractors.\n\n2. While the startup has fewer than 25 employees (which is relevant for some ADA provisions), this doesn't exempt them from Section 508 requirements when working on a federal project.\n\n3. Section 508 compliance is not absolute; there is some flexibility if full compliance would impose an undue burden on the agency (or, by extension, its contractors).\n\n4. The startup's obligations extend beyond just their employees to the end-users of the government web application.\n\n5. While WCAG guidelines are often used as a reference for accessibility, they are not explicitly mandated by law in this context.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex interplay between different accessibility laws, their applicability to government contractors, and the nuances of compliance requirements."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18020/public-intoxication-in-texas", "docs_id": 18020, "title": "Public Intoxication in Texas", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was recently arrested for public intoxication after my friend was pulled over about 100 feet from his home.

Both of the arresting officers had body cameras and there's no way I could be considered a danger and I have no criminal record at all. One officer asked me to step out after my friend had also been asked the same and after talking with the officer, I was arrested and imprisoned over night and released on a PR bond. All of this appears extremely harsh and not proper but I've been told this sort of conviction is difficult to contest. Is there any point fighting this or spending lots of money on a lawyer (Cheapest one here is around $1,500\\)? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm guessing when you say 'public intoxication' you mean this:\n\n> \u00a7 49\\.02\\.

If you want to pay it, you'll have it on your record.\n\nIf it were me, I'd show up to the arraignment and then ask the prosecutor to agree to deferred adjudication and a few hundred dollar fine. Deferred means you promise to not get another citation for public intoxication for the next several months (whatever you can get the judge to agree with \\- which is typically 3 to 6 months) and then they'll dismiss your case \\- but only after you pay a disposition fee, which is likely a few hundred dollars more than the fine you'd pay, plus court costs.\n\nBut if they balked I'd make them give me a jury trial, and fight it *pro se* (on your own). If you truly only had 2 drinks and the video showed that you were a passenger, and weren't (as the law states) **\"intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger the person or another\"** then I'd ask for a not guilty verdict from the jury based on that.\n\nIf you really want to be sure to keep it off your record, then hiring an attorney might be best, but I think in that case all he'd do is ask the prosecutor to agree to deferred disposition and then ask the judge to agree to it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Texas, a person arrested for public intoxication is facing a Class C misdemeanor charge.

This option potentially allows the defendant to have the case dismissed after a probationary period and payment of fees.

This approach gives the defendant an opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not \"intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger the person or another\" as required by the law.

The 5th Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not give individuals the right to be untruthful in current financial reporting. It protects against being forced to testify about past crimes, but does not exempt people from accurately reporting current information, even if that information could potentially be incriminating. The oath on tax forms is about current financial status, not past criminal activity.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the 5th Amendment's protections extend beyond just criminal trials. Answer B is incorrect because filing taxes is generally mandatory, not voluntary, and fundamental rights are not typically waived simply by complying with legal obligations. Answer D is incorrect because while tax matters are often civil, they can become criminal if fraud is involved, and the 5th Amendment can apply to both civil and criminal matters."}}
