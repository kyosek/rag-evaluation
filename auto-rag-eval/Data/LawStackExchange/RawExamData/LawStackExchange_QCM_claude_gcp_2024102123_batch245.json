Law enforcement must often make quick decisions in dangerous situations, and the use of tools like flashbangs may be necessary to protect lives and end active threats. While flashbangs can potentially destroy or contaminate evidence, their use is justifiable when the emergency at hand takes precedence over evidence preservation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it fails to consider the necessity of using such tools in dangerous, active situations.

The prosecution can, subject to admissibility, put forward whatever evidence they like in order to convince the jury. This can include a pile of ash that they allege contained convincing and unambiguous evidence of guilt. Of course, if that's all they've got the prosecution would probably be censured by the judge for wasting everybody's time and money, more likely, a prosecutor wouldn't lay charges in the first place.\n\nAs to punishment for an evidence tampering conviction: you have been convicted of evidence tampering, not drug production so you will be punished for evidence tampering, not drug production. The legislature sets different punishments for these for a reason, possibly a reason known only to them but a reason nevertheless.

The whole legal process started well, however, because of deceit and trickery (including my father's naivety), almost all of the land went to one of my uncles. \n\nMy father never really actively pursued the right to regain back some of that land except for calling my uncle on multiple occasions, which resulted in hanged phone from my uncles side. \n\nFew months ago we had a family tragedy in which my father passed away.

You also need to collect all paperwork that's related to the inheritance. Typically an estate need to get \"settled\" and there is an official statement that (often issued by the town or a local court) that spells out all the details and conditions (if any). Try to document any type of follow up discussion or dispute in as much detail as possible including dates, means of interaction, topics, etc. \n\nOnce you have all this, have a lawyer or equivalent look it over.

Not in the courtroom, and not upon entering the building and passing security. Not even inspection of ID documents.\n\nFrom experience, this appears true in the magistrates', Crown, and county courts although in criminal proceedings one is asked to confirm one\u2019s identity including date of birth is correct.\n\nIn general, is there a reason for this lack of exercised skepticism and forensic scrutiny when courts are generally so principally concerned with truth and probity?\n\nApart from this empirical/historical question about court practice, what about the legality? One can easily imagine that in Criminal proceedings, impersonating a defendant and then actively, explicitly deceiving the court is unequivocal contempt and perjury.\n\nBut suppose one wishes to bring a civil action under an alias that one assumes from the beginning of pre\\-action proceedings until the conclusion of the action. Practically speaking there appears to be nothing standing in the way of this.\n\nAnd furthermore, I recall a decision from either the UKHL or the EWCA that discussed how generally the laws of England have always allowed one to assume and use whatever name one may please to.\n\nHow does this compute with the litigation question here? Is there anything unlawful of assuming a different name under which one wages a lawsuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In an adversarial legal system, the parties are responsible for framing the issues in dispute and adducing relevant evidence. The parties, and perhaps more importantly their lawyers, also have an obligation of candour to the court. Courts routinely accept unchallenged assertions because there are serious consequences for misleading the court, and the opponent (rather than the court which should remain neutral) is in the best position to investigate and prove any suspected dishonesty.\n\nIt is a matter for the party commencing proceedings (plaintiff or prosecutor) to decide how the parties will be named. People often change their names, and may use multiple spellings. It is not uncommon for typographical or other errors to appear. Generally, it is in the interest of at least one party to name the parties \"correctly,\" ie. consistently with other government records that will be used to enforce any judgment, but a person's name is ultimately a formal matter that can be corrected if necessary. In cases of uncertainty, aliases can be specified, as occurred in *Microsoft v McDonald (aka Gary Webb)* [\\[2006] EWHC 3410 (Ch)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2006/3410.html).\n\nA person who is genuinely known by an alias (ie. the use of the alias is not part of an attempt to mislead the court) should use their \"real\" name in court, but could potentially conduct litigation using the alias without anybody noticing. However, court proceedings are public and this would not necessarily protect the person's identity. To achieve this, an anonymity order under [CPR 39\\.2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/3132/rule/39.2) is required, as explained in *XXX v Camden London Borough Council* [\\[2020] EWCA Civ 1468](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/XXX-v-London-Bor-of-Camden-judgment.pdf) \\[13]\u2013\\[22]."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the English legal system, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of aliases or alternative names in civil court proceedings?\n\nA) It is always illegal to use an alias or alternative name when bringing a civil action, as it constitutes contempt of court.\n\nB) Courts are required to perform extensive identity checks on all parties involved in civil proceedings to prevent impersonation.\n\nC) A person may conduct litigation using an alias they are genuinely known by, but should use their legal name in court if possible.\n\nD) The use of any name other than one's birth name in court proceedings automatically invalidates the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a person who is genuinely known by an alias could potentially conduct litigation using that alias without necessarily breaking any laws. However, it is generally expected that they should use their \"real\" or legal name in court if possible. This aligns with the principle that courts generally accept unchallenged assertions about identity, relying on the parties' obligation of candour to the court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using an alias is not always illegal, especially if it's a name the person is genuinely known by.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage indicates that courts do not typically perform extensive identity checks in civil proceedings, relying instead on the adversarial system and the parties' responsibilities.\n\nOption D is overly strict and not supported by the information given.

I contacted them offering to settle without going to court and they made me an initial offer.\n\nTheir initial offer includes a clause about them making no admission of guilt. The language in the offer is (paraphrased):\n\n> **No admission of liability** This settlement does not in any way constitute an admission of guilt, liability, or wrongdoing by The Company.

Such an admission is likely to harm their reputation, and might be admissible evidence in other civil or even criminal cases, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances. \n\nYou also mention that:\n\n> ...the same agreement also includes a section where I promise not to sue them for any other reason ever again (I object to this and tell my lawyer that when they return)\n\nSuch a provision in a settlement is very common, perhaps more common than not. It is intended to make sure that the settlement covers the entire dispute between you and the Company, that you do not later come up with some aspect that was not covered by the agreement now being negotiated, and file a new suit. The provision should be so worded that it covers only causes of action that arose **prior** to the date of the agreement; it should not immunize them from being sued for future wrong doing. It could be further limited to causes related to the transaction or issue now under dispute, but the Company is likely to insist that it be fairly broadly worded. If told that you object to the provision, they are likely to say something like \"well, what other claims does he have? Let's get them out in the open and settle all of them.\" which does not seem unreasonable.

Even if the individual agrees not to sue the company again, the admission of guilt could still harm the company's reputation and potentially be used as evidence in other legal cases, either civil or criminal, depending on the jurisdiction.

As a minority shareholder, the general rule is that you have to accept the decisions of the directors while they have the support of the majority shareholders. It does not matter what the majority shareholders paid for their shares or if they received them in exchange for other contributions to the business.\n\nHowever, the law does recognise that the general rule creates the potential for [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression_remedy) of minority shareholders. In Australia, the courts can order that a company be wound up, or that some members \"buy out\" other members' shares, if \"the conduct of the company's affairs is oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a member\": [s 232](https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s232.html) of the *Corporations Act 2001* (Cth).\n\nApplying for such a court order is expensive and complex. The court fee alone starts at [$1,530](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/fees), and litigation of this kind would normally be conducted by professionals at a cost of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars. The unsuccessful party would generally be required to pay the successful party's legal costs. Almost invariably, it would be in the mutual interest of all parties to negotiate a settlement.\n\nFor more information about shareholders' oppression in Australia, see Victorian Law Reform Commission, [The oppression remedy in the *Corporations Act*](https://www.lawreform.vic.gov.au/publication/trading-trusts-oppression-remedies-report-3/3-the-oppression-remedy-in-the-corporations-act/) (2021\\):\n\n> Irreconcilable differences may establish a basis for winding up, they do not of themselves constitute oppression or unfair prejudice \u2026 oppression connotes a lack of probity and fair dealing (although this is not a necessary condition), is something which is burdensome, harsh or wrongful, or is inequitable or unjust, or exhibits commercial unfairness \u2026 Examples of oppressive behaviour given by Brockett include where a majority shareholder:\n> \n> \n> * runs the company in their own interests and ignores the interests of minority shareholders\n> * improperly issues shares to themselves to outvote other shareholders\n> * excludes a minority shareholder from being involved in the management decisions of the company\n> * redirects business opportunities from the company to themselves\n> * pays themselves excessive salaries at the expense of paying dividends to shareholders."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Western Australia, a minority shareholder in a company believes the other two shareholders/directors are acting against the company's interests.

I would like to put up a site where I share the recipes I used. I sometimes use recipes from the cooking book which obviously copyrighted work. Therefore, I decided what if I 'retell' the process involved when I am cooking the dish myself, producing 'my own' 'cooking instruction'? Of course, I would like my recipe to have the same ingredients as the reference book I am using, else the taste is not going to be the same. Is this allowed? How about international law since I am not in the US. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Recipe books can be, and often are, protected by copyright. If the individual recipes are by others, this would constitute a collective work or compilation. See [this recent answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64800/17500) for more on the rights protected for a collective work.\n\nThe selection of which recipes to include would be a creative element, protected by copyright, and could not be copied or closely imitated without permission. However, division into groups by type of dish would be a \"natural and obvious\" arrangement, and not protected. So would alphabetical or chronological arrangement within a group, or over all. A \"non\\-obvious\" order of recipes would however be a protectable element.\n\nAn individual recipe may be protected by copyright, but this protects less than one might think. Copyright does not protect facts or methods. This means that the list of ingredients is not protected, nor is the general list of steps of preparation. Only the exact wording of the recipe will be protected.\n\nCreating a new collection of recipes based on several different previously published collections of recipes (whether from the web, books, magazines, or other media) and making one's own selections of which ones to include that is significantly different from any of the previous collections would not violate the collection copyrights of any of the previous collections. If the actual recipes were rewritten so that any creative expression from the originals was not copied, then it seems that no copyright infringement has occurred. Most recipes, after all, are not fully original but are modified from older ones.\n\nThere is no set figure for how many recipes could be copied from a given source before this becomes infringement. That would be, if a suit was field, a matter for the judgement of the count as to whether the new book was \"based on\" the alleged source. The more the list in the new work resembles a particular source, the more like a derivative work it seems and the more likely that it would be held to be an infringement. One could always ask for a license from the older source, to avoid any risk of suit, but it might not be available or the copyright holder might demand an excessive fee. Asking for a license risks drawing attention to the new work, as well, and might cause a holder to file suit who otherwise would not."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A chef wants to create a cookbook using recipes from various sources.

For example, the Clay Institute\u2019s [Millennium Prize](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems) does exactly what you propose: it pays people who solve unsolved math problems. Similarly, the the Everglades Foundation used a [prize](https://www.evergladeswaterquality.org/meet-the-teams) to get people to come up with new ways to get phosphates out of the water sources.\n\nTo do what they did, you need to follow their lead, and set up and run a non\\-profit (aka, 501(c)(3\\), named after the relevant provision of the tax code).\n\nBecause non\\-profits are tax exempt under US tax law, you have to apply to the IRS to become a non\\-profit. Speaking broadly, the IRS imposes two requirements on non\\-profits: 1\\) It must serve a charitable purpose; 2\\) It must spend a certain percentage of its money every year doing charitable work.\n\nTo set up a foundation you have to specify the charitable purpose you will serve (\u201cencourage research in mathematics\u201d), and have a plan to do so (\u201cwe will award a cash prize to people who solve important unsolved problems\u201d). If the IRS decides your plan is genuine, then they give you a pass on paying taxes.\n\nTo make sure you are carrying out your charitable plan, the IRS requires you to spend a certain percentage of your money each year on charitable work. (This is called the \"distribution requirement.\") Meeting the distribution requirement may be a problem, since you may not award prizes every year.\n\nYou may be able to get a general idea about how the IRS deals with such situations by searching on line. At some point, however, you will probably need to talk to a lawyer with experience setting up non\\-profits. (FWIW, it looks to me as if the Clay Institute meets its yearly spending requirement by supporting lots of other activities that count towards the spending requirement.)\n\nOne other problem that it seems you won\u2019t have involves giving prizes directly to individuals. For obvious reasons, the IRS is generally suspicious of prizes given to individuals, so they impose restrictions. For example, for the winner to avoid taxes, the prizes have to be for previous work.\n\n**Where to go for more information:**\n\nUSA.gov has a nice overview of the application process [here](https://www.usa.gov/start-nonprofit). The IRS has several publications and websites that you might find helpful: [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf), [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf), [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4221pc.pdf), and [here](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/application-process).

As explained in the documentation, this structure has been successfully used by similar initiatives like the Clay Institute's Millennium Prize. To qualify as a non-profit, the organization must serve a charitable purpose (such as encouraging mathematical research) and must meet annual distribution requirements by spending a certain percentage of its money on charitable work each year. This structure allows for tax-exempt status but comes with IRS oversight to ensure the organization is carrying out its charitable mission.

Preventing citizens from going to each others home for a visit seems like the ultimate form of restrictions, so it would be interesting to see if it ever held up in court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think the Washington law and order is fairly clear: you must stay home unless you are engaged in certain allowed activities. The underlying law, [RCW 43\\.06\\.220(h)](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.06.220) empowers issuing an order prohibiting \"Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace\". Therefore I can walk my dog. When I do, there are a lot of people also out walking their dogs, so that provides a letter\\-of\\-the\\-law permitted exception to the stay\\-at\\-home order. Nothing in the order specifically addresses the situation where you pause your dog\\-walk to talk to a neighbor (the \"appropriate social distancing\" sub\\-rule only applies to recreational departures from your home).\n\nIt is well\\-established that the central legal issue is what the \"compelling government interest\" is, and whether these restrictions fail on grounds of narrow\\-tailoring or least\\-restrictiveness. The failure to include \"go to your brother's place for lunch, provided you follow appropriate social distancing guidelines\" as a permitted activity is a candidate for not being least\\-restrictive.

The precise scope of what actions are sufficient to establish that duress is present vary. A credible threat that someone will kill you or your child is generally sufficient in every state that recognizes the defense. There is also a closely related defense known as \"choice of evils.\"\n\nThis said, eight years is a very long time and usually the defense of duress is available only if the threat was imminent or immediate. So, it is probably less likely than not that a finder of fact would conclude that it was impossible to seek to involve authorities in the situation, for all of the time in that eight year time period, without reasonably risking the threatened harm.\n\nAlso, while you call his acts \"treasonous\", in reality the crime of treason is defined very narrowly in the U.S. Constitution to taking up arms against your country and providing aid and comfort to people who are doing so, and the fact pattern suggested probably does not constitute treason under U.S. law.\n\nFinally, while his circumstances only dubiously are sufficient to assert a defense of duress over the sustained eight year time period, this doesn't mean that authorities couldn't choose to refrain from prosecuting him, or that the couldn't seek only lesser charges with mitigating circumstances conceded in sentencing, in an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Often this exercise of prosecutorial discretion would be conditioned upon cooperation in the case brought against other defendants in related cases.\n\nIn an exceptional case, the pardon power could be invoked for relieve him from criminal liability as has been done in some past insurrections in U.S. history like the Whiskey Rebellion and the U.S. Civil War.

This raises the question of whether the design or the name/word may also be protected as \"registered trademarks\" when used separately, and the answer is no. A registered trademark is \"considered as a whole\" and if you want to protect parts of it, you would be required to apply separately for registration of those parts.\n\nA registration of a \"standard character\" mark may give much broader protection for a distinctive name than if it is only registered in combination with something else. Contrarily, a valuable (recognizable) logo may be the most important element, regardless of whether the name is with it.\n\nIn the USA, registration of a trademark is completely optional for enforcement in state or federal courts, although registration gives additional valuable rights, including \"national preemption\".\n\nSo, in theory, one could register a combination word\\-mark and design and then enforce the design (alone) or the word\\-mark (alone) outside of the registered rights (e.g., national preemption), and even place (tm) on it, but not \u00ae (circle R), if it is not federally registered as shown.\n\nThere are numerous gray areas in most aspects of trademark rules for registration, let alone enforcement, often tied to subjective evaluation of \"distinctiveness\" or \"related fields\" that may \"create a likelihood of confusion\" among reasonable consumers in that market."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company is applying for a trademark with the USPTO and is considering whether to include their logo in the application along with their company name.

When a company includes both a name and logo in a single trademark application, it can indeed save on filing fees.

At someone else's trial, he testifies on relativity as an expert. Answering questions, he explains both his special and general theories in terms a jury understands. Counsel thanks him. Opposing counsel in cross\\-examination asks Einstein if his theory includes a \"cosmological constant\". Einstein testifies firmly: \"No.\" Opposing counsel reads to the court from an earlier publication by Einstein that there is a cosmological constant. Einstein seems urgently about to say something but the judge reminds him that he may only answer questions he is asked and no questions are pending at the moment. Opposing counsel has no further questions, counsel who brought Einstein does not seek to ask anything (perhaps because not expecting this turn of events) and the witness is dismissed. Someone searching history would find that Einstein had publicly said that the cosmological constant was the \"biggest blunder of his life\", but a jury is not allowed to do outside research before issuing its verdict and this is not a nonjury trial. I understand that impeachment frequently works to persuade a trier of fact to disregard impeached testimony; assume such persuasiveness succeeds in this case.\n\nI think this illustrates an inadequacy of the system of determining the state of scholarship through expert testimony, among other reasons because it discourages bringing an expert who might ever have published a statement they would later dispute, and that would exclude most research scholars with long publication histories.

Does this vary much by jurisdiction of place?\n\nI'm not opening a debate on reform, just trying to see if I misunderstand the general law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your main misunderstanding is that opposing counsel cannot testify. He can ask a question, such as \"Did you say ...?\", which provides Einstein an opportunity to answer in a way that maintains the credibility of his testimony, but consel cannot just enter his own testimony into the record. In addition, counsel on \"his side\" has the opportunity to pose appropriate clarifying questions, e.g. could ask \"Did you repudiate that idea 88 years ago?\", though there is a problem that the attorney may not have the technical expertise to recognize the subject\\-matter question that they should ask. \n\nExpert testimony does not attempt to determine the state of scholarship in an area, it attempts to resolve a specific factual matter. The two are not the same thing. Einstein would not testify as to what his general and special theories of relativity say, except in a bizarre universe where some person is accused of the crime of denying the theory of relativity. Instead, he might be testifying for the defense, where the defendant is accused of an act that (it turns out) is physically impossible in light of the theory of relativity. If Einstein had been in the habit of posing random mutually\\-contradictory conjectures on a weekly basis, opposing counsel's question could be relevant to establishing that the witness's testimony is not reliable. Theoretically, counsel could \"hint\" that the witness is scientifically flighty, so Einstein would have to have a credible explanation for changing his position.

In [Church of God, Etc. v. Amarillo Indep. Sch](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/511/613/1429691/)., 511 F. Supp. 613, plaintiffs successfully sued the school district \"to enjoin the enforcement of the Amarillo School District's absence policy which limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays to two days each school year\", where \"A fundamental tenet of the Church of God is that members must abstain from secular activity on seven annual holy days\". The school district imposed an absence polity where \"School work missed may be made up whether an absence is excused or unexcused\", and \"Excused absences shall be granted to students for a maximum of 2 days for religious holidays in each school year\". The court concluded that \"This policy poses an unquestionable burden on the Plaintiffs' religious belief\", and \"This burden is not ameliorated by the make\\-up work provision.

Here, there is an intent only to hold possession of the keys during the shift and to return them.\n\nAlso, while the surrender of keys is contingent upon the incentive of further employment, it is still a voluntary surrender of the keys.\n\nThe place where theft issues could arise is if the keys are not returned by the person holding them, either at the end of the shift as punishment, or in mid\\-shift, if someone insists upon their return, either in an emergency or because they are sick of this manager and want to quit. If keys were retained in those circumstances upon a demand for their return, there might be a problem.\n\nThis is because continuing to refuse to surrender possession of property permissively given to someone when that permission is revoked, in the absence of a legal right to impose a possessory lien, would generally constitute theft.\n\nWhile the purpose for the manager holding keys in this particular situation don't seem very valid, I can imagine circumstances (e.g. MRI technicians, jail guards, underwater divers, the site only has [tandem parking](https://definedterm.com/tandem_parking_space)), where retaining keys during a shift might be reasonable and appropriate."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A manager at a factory implements a policy requiring all employees to surrender their car keys at the beginning of each shift, to be returned at the end.

The hiring manager says that I have this wrong and that it only means anything related to work that I would undertake during my employment with the company.\n\nBased on the quoted language, the hiring manager is correct. The key phrase is \"all rights to all material created **in the course of your employment** with the Company\"\n\nThis means things created as part of your new job.

A one\\-time consult should be available at a fairly small cost.\n\nThe section about \"whether now existing or created in the future\" refers not to existing IP, but to existing **kinds** of IP and existing laws. If the UK should pass a new \"algorithm rights \" law next year, this language attempts to make sure that such rights are covered without needing you to sign a revised contract.

Why or why not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, the ePrivacy Directive is way more general than cookies. The translated Swedish law seems close to the original in the ePrivacy Directive:\n\n> Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent \\[\u2026]. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service.\n\n(from Art 5(3\\) [ePrivacy Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02002L0058-20091219))\n\nSo, the general question when you access some JavaScript API is: what is the **purpose** of this access?\n\n* Is the access necessary for performing a service that the user explicitly requested? Then fine. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of providing an appropriate layout is fine, because the user explicitly requested you to show them the website. Using LocalStorage to store user data for an offline\\-capable webapp is perfectly fine.\n* Otherwise, you will need consent. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of better ad targeting would require consent, because the user did not explicitly request that you show them targeted ads. The user requested to see a website, and showing ads is not strictly necessary for that. Similarly, using any technologies that access or storage on the user's device to access, store, infer, or construct an advertising ID would require consent.\n\nThe WP29 has discussed this aspect of the ePrivacy Directive in their [Opinion 9/2014 on device fingerprinting (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp224_en.pdf). They explicitly note that \u201cJavaScript objects (e.g., document, window, screen, navigator, date and language)\u201d can be used to form a fingerprint, for example by accessing \u201cinformation relating to the screen size, colour depth and available system fonts. Other APIs may request access to information elements stored in the firmware (e.g. the CPU type), operating system (e.g. the OS type) or graphics card model. API calls may also reveal the presence of installed software (e.g. browser plug\\-ins) or even the precise version number\u201d.\n\nThe document defines criterion A and B to refer to the \u201ccarrying out the transmission\u201d and \u201cstrictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user\u201d exceptions, respectively.\n\n* For the specific case of first\\-party analytics purposes, WP29 notes:\n\n> However, the Opinion also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first\\-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption defined in\n> CRITERION A or B and consent of the user is required.\n* Similarly, for a user tracking for online behavioural advertising use case, WP29 states:\n\n> Opinion 04/2012 emphasised that third\\-party advertising does not fall under the exemption defined in CRITERION A or B. Therefore, device fingerprinting for the purpose of targeted advertising requires the consent of the user.\n\nThe [Opinion 04/2012 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp194_en.pdf) discusses these \u201ccookie consent exceptions\u201d in more detail, but of course this is more general than cookies and applies equivalently to any JavaScript API. In the summary, they caution that the \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d criterion must be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> When applying CRITERION B, it is important to examine what is strictly necessary from the point of view of **the user**, not the service provider.\n\nThese guidelines are rather dated, but since ePrivacy has remained essentially unchanged since then the WP29 guidelines and opinions are still the most authoritative discussion of these matters. The only relevant change is that the GDPR changed the definition of consent. The ePrivacy directive leaves no room for national derogations from the consent exception, though some countries like the Netherlands and (until 2021\\) Germany do provide exceptions. However, it is expected that the ePrivacy Directive will eventually be replaced by an ePrivacy Regulation that allows for access in case of a legitimate interest, similar to the more flexible approach chosen by the GDPR. It is also worth noting that this aspect of the ePrivacy Directive is not an enforcement priority for many supervisory authorities."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Swedish company is developing a web application that uses JavaScript to collect information about users' devices for various purposes.

The general rule is that whoever creates the thing (book, song, software) has the exclusive right to the thing.

This would then be a [work for hire](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf), and the copyright is held by Company 1\\.

Without some explicit disposition of copyright, Company 2 is in a sketchy position. Since C1 holds copyright, they must grant a license to C2 so that C2 can legally use it; or, C1 must transfer copyright to C2\\. This does not happen automatically, and (if C1 does not want to remedy the situation after the fact) C2 would need to take C1 to court to force a resolution to the situation. At that point, the issue would be what C1 *implicitly* promised, even though they didn't put it in writing. It is likely that the initial exchange was along the lines \"Can you make us a program that will do X?\", and the answer was \"Sure, that will cost Y\", and then \"Okay, go ahead, looking forward to the product\". The courts would not simply say \"Well, you didn't explicitly require a license, so you don't get to actually use the software that you paid for\".

You yourself point out that the visa process has not even started. The company's letter is merely an expression of its interest in your skills set. In this sense it reciprocates your expression of interest (from when you applied for the job), which does not restrict the company's right to eventually decline your application either. Once the company wishes to upgrade to a less ambiguous status, it can start by informing you accordingly and proceed based on your response.\n\nFurthermore, the prolonged uncertainty of both processing and granting of your visa in a country would make it inequitable to preclude you from trying to secure a job elsewhere.

The Art 2(2\\)(c) exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household activity\u201d does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.\n\nYou must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the *public*. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.\n\nOn a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:\n\n* For what *purpose* are you processing personal data?\n\nContext: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1\\)(b)\n* What is the *legal basis* for processing?\n\nGDPR Art 6(1\\) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.\n* What is the *minimal data necessary* to achieve the purpose?\n\nPer the Art 5(1\\)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide *data protection by design and by default* per Art 25\\. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.\n* What *appropriate safeguards* and security measures should you apply?\n\nPer Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1\\) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.\n* What *further compliance measures* do you have to consider?\n\nThere are additional GDPR and non\\-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:\n\n\t+ Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13\\.\n\t+ Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35\\.\n\t+ If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a *joint controller* or *data processor* and apply appropriate safeguards.\n\t+ If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3\\).\n\t+ If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.\n\t+ If you transfer data into a non\\-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non\\-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45\\. For US\\-based companies, this is the case only when they have self\\-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.Non\\-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.\n* How can you prepare for *data subject requests*?\n\nData subjects have various rights per Arts 15\u201323, subject to the modalities in Art 12\\.

But, that isn't the only conceivable procedural approach.\n\nBut, it isn't obvious that you couldn't have a process in which the determination were made first, administratively, and could be contested within a reasonable time after the person affected has notice of it by having the affected person bring a lawsuit challenging the determination.\n\nThe process would have to have a timeline that would not prevent a person who successfully challenged the classification from running for and winning public office.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding copyright protection for this work?\n\nA) Only the lyrics are protected by copyright, as the melody is from an old folk song.\nB) The lyrics and the recording are protected by copyright, but the melody remains in the public domain.\nC) The entire work, including the melody, is now protected by copyright due to the musician's use of it.\nD) Only the recording is protected by copyright, as it's a new performance of existing elements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, copyright is automatic for original works. In this case, the lyrics written by the musician are original and thus protected by copyright. Additionally, the recording of the performance is also protected as a new work. However, the melody from an old folk song is likely in the public domain and does not become copyrighted simply because it was reused. The combination of the public domain melody with new lyrics is protected, but the melody itself remains in the public domain. Option A is incorrect because it ignores the copyright protection for the recording. Option C is incorrect because using a public domain melody doesn't make it copyrightable. Option D is incorrect because it ignores the copyright protection for the original lyrics."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2207/driving-through-a-red-after-traffic-lights-have-been-broken", "docs_id": 2207, "title": "Driving through a red after traffic lights have been broken", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A situation happened to me today that got me thinking. I live in Victoria, Australia.\n\nI was driving and entered an intersection on a green light to make a turn. I waited until there was no oncoming traffic, by which time the light turned amber, to complete my turn. As I was completing my turn the lights started to flash amber, which indicates an error with the signals and that drivers need to follow the rules for unregulated intersections. (There are also some pedestrian crossings with red\\-amber\\-green lights that flash amber as part of their cycle before turning back to green, but not in the area I was driving.)\n\nAfter I completed the turn I could see that at least the next two sets of lights had been affected too and were flashing amber as well. As I approached the first set it changed back to red and I was able to stop in time. I was wondering what would have happened if I drove through the intersection just as the light changed to red (with not enough time to stop) and got a fine for driving through a red light? Would the authorities realise that there had just been an outage of the traffic lights and not issue it or would I have to prove that the lights had just been down to avoid having to pay the fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you were to be issued a ticket in such circumstances, you would likely be able to bring up an affirmative defense that it was not possible for you to stop safely in the circumstances, an action most likely required by the statutes.\n\nP.S. I've actually sat through a traffic trial where some guy in KW, Ontario, was defending against a red\\-light ticket he has gotten when passing a red light in the winter. I recall that his defense basically amounted to the fact that he would not have been able to stop safely in the circumstances (a requirement / exception of the statute), that the pavement was too slippery, other cars were nearby (maybe a car that followed, which would not have been able to stop had he stopped?), and that the light was likely still yellow when he crossed into the intersection (he took quite some time to cross\\-examine the cop). I recall that he was acquitted, but the guy did look quite exhausted from the trial!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A driver in Victoria, Australia enters an intersection on a green light to make a turn. While waiting for oncoming traffic to clear, the light turns amber. As the driver completes the turn, the traffic lights begin flashing amber, indicating a signal malfunction. The driver approaches the next intersection just as the lights change from flashing amber to solid red, with insufficient time to stop safely. If the driver proceeds through the red light and receives a fine, what is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) Pay the fine immediately, as the driver is always responsible for obeying traffic signals regardless of circumstances.\nB) Ignore the fine, as the recent signal malfunction automatically invalidates any tickets issued during that time.\nC) Contest the fine by presenting evidence of the signal malfunction and arguing that it was unsafe to stop.\nD) File a complaint against the traffic authority for improper maintenance of traffic signals.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate course of action would be to contest the fine by presenting evidence of the signal malfunction and arguing that it was unsafe to stop. This approach aligns with the concept of an \"affirmative defense\" mentioned in the documentation. The driver can argue that due to the sudden change from a malfunctioning signal (flashing amber) to a solid red, there was insufficient time to stop safely, which is likely a requirement or exception in the traffic statutes. This defense is similar to the example provided in the documentation where a driver in Ontario was acquitted of a red-light violation by demonstrating that it was unsafe to stop under the circumstances. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the unusual circumstances. Option B is incorrect because signal malfunctions don't automatically invalidate tickets. Option D is not the most appropriate first step and doesn't address the immediate issue of the fine."}}
