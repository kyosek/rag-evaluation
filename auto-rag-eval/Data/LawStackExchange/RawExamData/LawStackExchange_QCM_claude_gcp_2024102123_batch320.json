            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Here's my layman's understanding of Roe v Wade:\n\n* A state had a law prohibiting abortion;\n* That law was challenged all the way up to the Supreme Court;\n* The Supreme Court found a right to abortion in the 14th Amendment;\n* The right to abortion was thus determined to be constitutionally protected;\n* The Constitution takes precedence over both state and federal law;\n* Therefore, neither the states nor the federal government may pass any law abridging the right to abortion.\n\nIf Roe v Wade were to be overturned by some future Supreme Court, it would mean that the right to abortion is not found in the Constitution, and therefore not constitutionally protected. Thus, the states and the federal government would be free to pass laws banning abortion, if they so choose.\n\nI think many Americans would be surprised to learn that if Roe v Wade were overturned, it wouldn't mean abortion is automatically outlawed throughout the land. It means every state and the federal government would have the opportunity to make its own laws about it. (Get ready for 50\\+1 more battles, I guess.)\n\n**But could a future Supreme Court not only overturn Roe v Wade, but also find that abortion is *prohibited* by the Constitution, thereby preventing the states from making their own laws about it? Does the Supreme Court ever rule that something is prohibited, or only protected/not protected?**\n\nNot exactly sure how this could go down anyway. The Supreme Court doesn't write laws, and a prohibition on abortion would have to involve not only the prohibitory statement itself, but also exact definitions, sentencing mandates, parole guidelines, etc. This sounds more like the state legal codes on homicide (first\\-degree murder, premeditated murder, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, accidental homicide, accessory to murder, etc.) than a Supreme Court ruling.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no higher court which can overturn a SCOTUS decision, so in theory (or, imaginarily) they can rule any way they please. The ruling could then be overturned by a later court, as happened in [these cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_overruled_United_States_Supreme_Court_decisions). However, justices of the Supreme Court can be impeached (impeachment is not subject to judicial review), so the individuals responsible for such a ruling could be impeached. Or, if the sitting president is favorable and the enabling legislation has been passed, additional members of the Supreme could be added, as was unsuccessfully attempted during the Roosevelt administration.\n\nThe court could not write specific enforceable statutes defining the crime and imposing a penalty. They could rule that there is such\\-and\\-such right which is protected by the Cconstitution, and that that right must be protected by the states (for instance, a state may not pass a law that prohibits practicing the Pastafarian religion). It would be unprecedented, though, for SCOTUS to order a legislature to pass particular legislation. That would not mean that a ruling could not be written which mandated that, but it would be a huge break from tradition and a clear breach of the separation of powers. Legislatures could respond \"[they have made their decision; now let them enforce it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia)\".\n\nDecades ago, existing state death penalty laws were [declared unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia) as defective with respect to the 8th Amendment, meaning that there was no death penalty in many states for some time. Homicide statutes could likewise be struck down *en masse*, perhaps as an Equal Rights violation, which would means that either homicide is now legal, or the Equal Rights violation in those statutes must be eliminated. All that SCOTUS would have to do is rule that a fetus is a person. Recall [Roe v. Wade](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/410/113.html):\n\n> If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case,\n>  of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be\n>  guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.\n\nA model for how this might take place is [McCleary v.Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCleary_v._Washington), where the Washington Supreme Court ordered the legislature to act to fund public education, on constitutional grounds that the legislature has an obligation to do certain things. The leverage imposed by the court was a large daily contempt fine that went up to over $100 million. However this was symbolic (lifted when the legislation was passed), and it took 3 years to implement the order.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential outcomes if the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade and rule that a fetus is a person?\n\nA) The Supreme Court could immediately enact nationwide abortion prohibition laws with specific penalties and enforcement guidelines.\n\nB) States would be required to pass laws prohibiting abortion, but would have flexibility in determining the specifics of those laws.\n\nC) Existing homicide statutes could potentially be applied to abortion cases, but this would likely face significant legal challenges and require legislative action.\n\nD) The ruling would automatically make abortion illegal nationwide, with no need for further action by states or the federal government.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the information provided. If the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade and rule that a fetus is a person, it would not directly enact new laws (eliminating A). While this ruling would significantly impact abortion rights, it wouldn't automatically make abortion illegal nationwide or require states to pass new laws (eliminating B and D). Instead, as suggested in the passage, existing homicide statutes could potentially be applied to abortion cases. However, this would likely face significant legal challenges and require legislative action to clarify and implement, making C the most accurate answer. The passage notes that if personhood of a fetus is established, it would collapse the case for abortion rights, but the practical implementation of this would still require further legal and legislative processes."

In the US, works published between 1926 and 1977 are protected for 95 years from the date of publication. Since the anthology was published in 1946, it would be protected until 2041 in the US (1946 + 95 years).

Referring yourself (via the subterfuge of using a joint account that you have) would not be bringing in new business; nor would getting family (including \"same household\"). The first interpretation limits the prohibition of referrals to just \"yourself\", and fails to include a prohibition against referring all of your aunts, cousins and roommates (which they assume, reasonably enough, are not actual potential new customers).

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A visitor to a shopping mall is injured when a newly installed light fixture falls from the ceiling. The mall owner had hired a reputable contractor to install the fixtures. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the mall owner's liability?\n\nA) The mall owner is automatically liable for the visitor's injuries because the incident occurred on their property.\n\nB) The mall owner is not liable if they can prove they hired a licensed contractor, regardless of any other factors.\n\nC) The mall owner may avoid liability if they can demonstrate they acted reasonably in hiring the contractor and took appropriate steps to ensure the work was properly done.\n\nD) The mall owner is never liable for injuries caused by work performed by independent contractors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the provided documentation, an occupier (in this case, the mall owner) is not automatically answerable for dangers caused by faulty work of an independent contractor if they can show that:\n1. They acted reasonably in entrusting the work to the independent contractor.\n2. They took reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that the contractor was competent.\n3. They took reasonable steps to ensure the work had been properly done.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mall owner is not automatically liable just because the incident occurred on their property. There are circumstances where they can avoid liability.\n\nOption B is too narrow. While hiring a licensed contractor is important, it's not the only factor. The mall owner must also take reasonable steps to ensure the work was properly done.\n\nOption D is too broad and incorrect. While the mall owner can avoid liability in some cases, they are not universally exempt from liability for all work done by independent contractors.\n\nOption C accurately reflects the nuanced approach described in the documentation, where the mall owner's liability depends on whether they took reasonable precautions in hiring and overseeing the contractor's work."

Like if they call you a bunch of nasty names, or threaten you in some way, that information is yours and you can publish it. \n\nHowever, I'll give you three scenarios where you should not publish an email sent to you (and I'll edit to add more if they come up). \n\n**Private facts. There is a tort called publication of private facts.**\n\n> A plaintiff must establish four elements to hold someone liable for\n>  publication of private facts:\n> \n> \n> 1. Public Disclosure: The disclosure of facts must be public. Another way of saying this is that the defendant must \"give publicity\" to the\n>  fact or facts in question.\n> 2. Private Fact: The fact or facts disclosed must be private, and not generally known.\n> 3. Offensive to a Reasonable Person: Publication of the private facts in question must be offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary\n>  sensibilities.\n> 4. Not Newsworthy: The facts disclosed must not be newsworthy. Stated differently, the facts disclosed must not be a matter of legitimate\n>  public concern.\n\nFrom [Digital Media Law Project](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/publication-private-facts)\n\nNote one thing \\- the offensive fact does not need to have been completely private for you to be liable, it must not have been *generally known*. In other words, someone like you who has a really low \"public\" bar needs to be careful. \n\nAlso note that your buffer system might not help if the facts you publish are about someone other than the email sender; you are the one who published them. \n\n**Stolen Information** \n\nIf someone sends you some intellectual property of a third party it is not yours to publish. Trade secrets, copyrighted works, prototype photos, etc. The sender might be breaking the law by sending the stuff to you but you're the one who published it so you can join as co\\-defendants.\n\n[Barrett Brown was indicted for sharing a link to some stolen information](http://www.wired.com/2012/12/fbi-charges-barrett-brown/). A link! He's in prison on other charges.\n\n**Copyright held by the original sender (ht to @Dave\\_D)**\n\nIf the sender is the original author of the email, then the sender holds the copyright to the body of the email.

Which of the following scenarios could still potentially lead to legal issues for the website owner if they publish an email after the 7-day period?\n\nA) Publishing an email containing offensive personal opinions about a public figure\nB) Publishing an email that reveals private medical information about the sender's neighbor\nC) Publishing an email where the sender expresses dissatisfaction with a product they purchased\nD) Publishing an email that contains general business correspondence\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) While potentially controversial, publishing offensive personal opinions about a public figure is generally protected speech and unlikely to lead to legal issues.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. Publishing private medical information about a third party (the sender's neighbor) could be considered a \"publication of private facts\" tort, even if the sender provided the information. The website owner could be held liable for publishing this type of private, sensitive information about someone who didn't consent to its release.\n\nC) Publishing a customer's product review or complaint is generally acceptable and unlikely to cause legal problems.\n\nD) General business correspondence is usually not considered private or sensitive enough to cause legal issues if published.\n\nThe key point is that the 7-day buffer system may not protect the website owner from all legal risks, particularly when it comes to publishing private information about third parties or copyrighted material."

EULAs are typically used for software that is licensed to users, not owned by them. Since the client will own the software, they don't need a license to use it as they see fit. The contract between the developer and client should cover all necessary terms, including ownership transfer, payment, and any relevant restrictions or obligations. Prompting for EULA acceptance would be unnecessary and potentially confusing, given that the client owns the software.

Prior to any formal litigation:\n\n**How can you determine whether the troll has the authority of the copyright owner to settle an infringement claim?**\n\nE.g., if you respond to the troll with a demand that they prove they have such authority, and they do not, are they estopped from pursuing that claim in the courts?\n\nOr do you have to wait to be sued before you have an absolute right to such discovery?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A person or entity making a copyright claim need not respond to a request or \"demand\" that s/he establish ownership of the copyright or authority to represent the owner. Such a person could simply file suit. But a legitimate copyright owner would be likely to respond. If a \"troll\" actually files suit, s/he would need to establish ownership as part of the suit, and might be subject to sanction for filing a frivolous suit if s/he could not do so. \n\nWhat follows is largely US\\-based.\n\nNotice that, in the US, before filing suit, the copyright must be registered, and the records of such registrations are public. This is provided under [17 USC 411](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#411)\n\n> ...no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title. In any case, however, where the deposit, application, and fee required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights\n\nOne can have the US copyright office search for registrations of a particular work or by a particular owner. (There is a fee for such searches.) You could also do a google image search to find if the image has been posted elsewhere, and who claimed the copyright, if anyone.\n\nRules will be different if the copyright is claimed to be non\\-US.\n\nSee [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33363/how-can-one-verify-a-purportedly-freely-licensed-image-on-a-user-content-site) for more on this issue.\n\n[17 USC 501(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html) provides that:\n\n> (b) The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411, to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it. The court may require such owner to serve written notice of the action with a copy of the complaint upon any person shown, by the records of the Copyright Office or otherwise, to have or claim an interest in the copyright, and shall require that such notice be served upon any person whose interest is likely to be affected by a decision in the case. The court may require the joinder, and shall permit the intervention, of any person having or claiming an interest in the copyright.\n\nSections 502\\-505 (found on the same web page) indicate the various remedies that a court may order.\n\nSection 506(3\\) provides that:\n\n> (e) False Representation.\u2014Any person who knowingly makes a false representation of a material fact in the application for copyright registration provided for by section 409, or in any written statement filed in connection with the application, shall be fined not more than $2,500\\.\n\nThat might discourage a troll from actually filing a suit.",

In the U.S., copyright registration is required before filing an infringement lawsuit, and these records are public. Checking the U.S. Copyright Office records can provide legitimate information about the copyright owner and registration status.\nD) While a Google image search might provide some information about the image's usage, it doesn't definitively prove copyright ownership or the authority to settle claims.\n\nThe correct answer (C) allows the website owner to independently verify the copyright registration, which is a prerequisite for any formal legal action in the U.S. This can help determine the legitimacy of the claim and the identity of the actual copyright owner before responding to the demand letter."

Filing a complaint with the Department of Transportation may put pressure on the airline, but it doesn't provide the passenger with personalized legal advice about their specific situation.\n\nOption D, suing the airline in small claims court, may be premature at this stage.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's rights and potential courses of action?\n\nA) The tenant can legally refuse all inspections if they feel uncomfortable, citing their right to \"quiet enjoyment\" of the property.\n\nB) The tenant must allow all inspections without question, as landlords have unrestricted rights to access the property at any time.\n\nC) The tenant can request that inspections be scheduled when they are home, but cannot completely prevent them, especially if the property is being sold.\n\nD) The tenant can immediately take the landlord to court to stop all inspections without first attempting to negotiate a compromise.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Texas, tenants have the right to \"quiet enjoyment\" of their rental property, but this doesn't mean they can refuse all inspections, especially if the property is being sold. The tenant can request more convenient timing for inspections, such as when they are home. While excessive inspections could potentially be challenged in court, this would require showing that they are abnormally frequent and disruptive. The tenant should first attempt to negotiate with the landlord for more suitable inspection times. Options A and B are incorrect as they represent extreme positions not supported by Texas law. Option D is premature, as legal action should typically be a last resort after attempting to resolve the issue directly with the landlord."

Game mechanics and rules generally cannot be copyrighted, allowing developers to recreate the core gameplay. However, visual elements, artwork, and names are often protected by copyright or trademark. Therefore, a developer can recreate a classic game's mechanics but must create original designs and avoid using trademarked names to stay within legal boundaries.

Companies are generally expected to be truthful in their representations to consumers.

Is it possible it could be unconscionable that one side has essentially 100% power and the other side has no recourse?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Two essential elements of a contract are that each part gives something of value (such as money, or whatever the club has to offer), and each part has an obligation (the member must give money and do certain things, the club must allow the member to use the facility). Without these elements there is no contract, meaning that the \"member\" has no obligation to pay (and the courts will then order the return of the membership payment). If indeed the club can revoke membership at any time and for no cause, there is no contract and no legal justification for the club to keep your money.\n\nThe status of social clubs is not entirely clear, and it's not clear whether \"membership\" is a contractual matter, however an organization like Elks is a corporation, and state laws regulate expulsion of members of a corporation. They will typically require termination that is fair and reasonable and is carried out in good faith, as discussed in [this article](https://www.wardandsmith.com/articles/Private-Country-and-Social-Clubs-Member-Discipline-and-Expulsion).

This agreement lacks one of the essential elements of a contract - mutual obligation. While the member has clear obligations (paying dues, following rules), the club's ability to cancel \"at any time, without reason and without refund\" means they have no binding obligation to the member. Without mutual consideration, there is no valid contract. \n\nOption A is incorrect because even if parties willingly agree, a contract must have valid elements to be enforceable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the fundamental issue is the lack of obligation, not the refund policy.\n\nOption D touches on an important point about fair processes for membership termination in social clubs, but it doesn't address the core issue of the contract's validity due to lack of consideration."

A judge in Northern Ireland had made an anonymity direction in the case, but Mr Eastwood used parliamentary privilege to circumvent this and publicly name Soldier F. As the linked article shows, the media have resolutely refused to repeat Mr Eastwood's identification, but it is not clear to me if this is for legal or ethical reasons.\n\nCan anyone in the UK (especially anyone in Northern Ireland) now name Soldier F in the context of directly quoting Mr Eastwood's remark? Is the anonymity direction now a dead letter, or does anyone using the name in the context of quoting Mr Eastwood and are they thus protected as a consequence of parliamentary privilege? Or does the order still apply to everywhere outside of Parliament, and one could be arrested for contempt of court for using the name in public?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At common law, parliamentary privilege does not extend to the republication of words spoken in Parliament: [*Stockdale v Hansard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockdale_v_Hansard) (1839\\) 112 ER 1160\\. To overcome this, Parliament passed the [*Parliamentary Papers Act 1840*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Papers_Act_1840), which provides absolute privilege for a report published \u201cby or under the authority of either House of Parliament\u201d (ie. Hansard).\n\n[Section 3 of the Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/3-4/9/section/3) provides qualified privilege for publishing an \u201cextract or abstract\u201d of Hansard. In relation to statements made under parliamentary privilege in breach of a court order, the Committee on Super\\-Injunctions wrote in its report on [Super\\-Injunctions, Anonymised Injunctions and Open Justice](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf) (May 2011\\):\n\n> In order to obtain the benefit of the immunity from civil or criminal proceedings under section 3, the individual must prove, before a jury, that the relevant material was published in good faith and without malice. It is an open question whether publication of any extract from or abstract of Hansard which had the effect of frustrating a court order and was deliberately intended to do so would be held to be in good faith and without malice \u2026\n> \n> \n> Where media reports go beyond, or fall outside, the ambit of protection provided by the 1840 Act, it is the common law which determines whether there is any protection from contempt proceedings for breach of court orders. Mr Woolf noted that while *Wason v Walter* (1868\\) 4 QB 73 established a limited common law protection in defamation proceedings for honest, fair and accurate reporting of Parliamentary proceedings, there was \u2018no reported case which authoritatively decides the extent of protection against proceedings for contempt available in respect of fair and accurate reports of proceedings of Parliament\u2019 \u2026\n> \n> \n> It therefore appears to be an open question whether, and to what extent, the common law protects media reporting of Parliamentary proceedings where such reporting appears to breach the terms of a court order and is not covered by the protection provided by the 1840 Act. What is clear is that unfettered reporting of Parliamentary proceedings (in apparent breach of court orders) has not been established as a clear right.\n\nIn its report on [Parliamentary Privilege](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/30.pdf) (June 2013\\), the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege said that the *Parliamentary Papers Act* would generally not apply to the contemporary media, and that the defence of qualified privilege was limited to defamation actions:\n\n> An \u201cabstract\u201d was defined by the 1999 Joint Committee as a \u201csummary or epitome\u201d. Thus media reports of what goes on in Parliament, even if they draw on documents published by order of the House, such as Hansard, do not generally enjoy the (qualified) protection afforded by section 3 of the 1840 Act\u2014a point confirmed by Sarah McColl, Solicitor Advocate in the BBC Editorial Legal Department, in her oral evidence on behalf of the Media Lawyers Association \u2026\n> \n> \n> Outside the field of defamation, it does not appear that media reports of parliamentary proceedings (as opposed to extracts or abstracts) enjoy legal protection. This arises most obviously in the case of breaches of court injunctions \u2026\n\nThe Joint Committee recommended that the law should be reformed:\n\n> On balance, we do not support extending absolute privilege to all reports, including media sketches and summaries, of proceedings in Parliament \u2026 we consider that the existing protection of qualified privilege\u2014that is, that all fair and accurate reports are protected, unless they can be proved by the claimant to have been made maliciously\u2014already provides a robust defence of press freedom \u2026\n> \n> \n> At the same time, we acknowledge that the media need clarity and certainty. The *Parliamentary Papers Act 1840* provides qualified protection for all \u201cextracts and abstracts\u201d of parliamentary publications (including broadcasts), but as we have already said these terms do not appear to cover media reports or editorial comment \u2026\n> \n> \n> We endorse the recommendation of the 1999 Joint Committee that \\[the] *Parliamentary Papers Act 1840* should be replaced by modern statutory provisions \u2026 We recommend that these new provisions should \u2026\n> \n> \n> * establish that qualified privilege applies to all fair and accurate reports of parliamentary proceedings in the same way as to abstracts and extracts of those proceedings;\n> * provide that in all court proceedings in respect of such fair and accurate reports, extracts or abstracts, the claimant or prosecution shall be required to prove that the defendant acted maliciously \u2026\n\nHowever, it appears that Parliament has not taken up the Joint Committee\u2019s recommendation, and the extent of any common law protection remains an open question. Accordingly, the article linked in the question states that \u201cThe BBC is not naming Soldier F for legal reasons.\u201d",

While parliamentary privilege protects the MP's speech in Parliament, this protection does not automatically extend to media reports. The Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 provides some protection for \"extracts and abstracts\" of parliamentary proceedings, but it's unclear if this covers modern media reports. Common law protection against contempt proceedings for reporting parliamentary statements that breach court orders is also an open question. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege acknowledged this uncertainty and recommended law reform, but this hasn't been implemented. Therefore, the safest conclusion is that the newspaper's legal position is uncertain due to gaps in the current law and lack of clear precedent."

She has recovered physically for the most part, but still has significant issues with short\\-term memory. So knowledge work is not a very realistic option at this point, and consequently, she is still on medical leave.\n\nWe just (yesterday) received a letter from the university. They want to convene a \"due process\" hearing to determine whether she can return to work and what accommodations might be necessary.\n\nIt's not (IMO) unreasonable for them to ask whether and/or when she intends on returning to work. And we live in a state (Ohio) where employment is \"at will\" (either the employee or employer may sever the relationship at any time).\n\nAt the same time, recovery from this type of injury is typically 1\\-2 years. (That doesn't necessarily mean everyone makes a full recovery. It means that, however much a person recovers, 90%\\-95% of that is going to happen withing 12\\-24 months.) So December 2017 / January 2018 would be a more appropriate time to have a discussion about her long\\-term capabilities.\n\nAnd I am somewhat concerned that the hearing is next week, and they want a list of people who will testify on her behalf by the end of this week (three days from now). It was probably unlikely that I could get any of her doctors or therapists to this meeting; but with so little notice, I have zero chance of getting any of her medical providers to the meeting.\n\nI'm not looking for specific legal advice so much as I'm wondering if this type of hearing is a standard procedure ... and if so, I'd like to have a rough idea of what to expect.\n\n**Update / Clarification:**  \n\nMy wife's employer is a state school (not private). I don't know for certain whether her position would be classified as civil service or not; but I would guess that it is (civil service), since she is required to contribute to the state employees' retirement fund.\n\nI do not believe her position is covered by a collective bargaining agreement \\-\\- as I understand it, most positions at this university are not (although some functions, e.g. maintenance or campus police, may be an exception).\n\n**Update 2:**  \n\nThe university agreed to postpone the hearing. And I did contact an employment attorney. His opinion was that this was probably just a routine formality \\-\\- policy does say that medical leave should be reviewed at or about six months \\-\\- they would probably just extend her leave, and it would be a waste of time for him to attend the meeting with us.\n\nHe was partially correct. The meeting certainly was a formality, and it probably would have been a waste of time for him to attend. But as to the outcome ... they had obviously already made the decision to terminate her employment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are procedural rules in place in the state universities pertaining to any negative action, but the exact rules depend on the nature of the position. Faculty for example have one set of rules, students another, and staff yet others. A hearing is thus required to do anything significant (such as fire an employee), so it is very common. The function of a \"due process\" hearing is to make certain that the rules are followed before visiting a negative outcome on an employee. This is not a matter that you should try to deal with on your own: you need an attorney.\n\nThere are two distinct issues involved in such a procedure. One is whether the hierarchy of fact\\-finders follows the process. Usually there is a technical screw\\-up (I was part of the process in Ohio), but typically not anything that would lead to overturning a final decision. The other is whether there are specific disability or work\\-related injury protections.\n\nThe timing of such a hearing and matters of notice would figure prominently in the first response from an attorney. Three days notice is not inconceivable, but it is arguably unreasonable, which is one of the first things that an attorney would tell them. It is probable that the internal rules require that notices be delivered to the employee who must forward them to their attorney, which adds delay.",

Or could Trump plead the fifth, thereby avoiding having to testify against himself?\n\nThe basis for this question is that there's a bit of [debate](https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/465389-why-impeachment-is-a-political-act) [upon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/14/impeachment-is-law-saying-political-process-only-helps-trumps-narrative/) whether impeachment itself is a legal process or a political one. The criteria by which a president is impeached is deliberately vague, but the penalties for a successful impeachment are partially legal and partially political (i.e. removed from office, barred from serving again; but this does not otherwise deprive the defendant of their liberty (though other legal charges may)). Regardless, because impeachment does not have any stated criteria other than, \"Treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\" those penalties could theoretically come about simply by virtue of Congress holding a 2/3 majority of an opposing party.\n\nGiven that the 5th amendment protects a defendant from being a witness against themselves in a criminal proceeding, could Trump exercise that protection to avoid being compelled to testify before Congress?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nImpeachment proceedings (as are all activities of Congress) are legal proceedings in that they are enabled by the Constitution.\n\nWhile it is true that they are not *judicial* proceedings, the activities of the legislature as with the executive (like a police interview) and judiciary (like a trial) are legal processes and the Fifth Amendment rights apply.\n\nDuring the McCarthy \u201cred scare\u201d era, pleading the fifth was commonplace by witnesses to Congressional hearings.\n\nHowever, pleading the fifth does not mean you can avoid testifying.

While impeachment proceedings are not judicial proceedings, they are still legal processes enabled by the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment rights apply to all activities of Congress, including impeachment hearings. However, invoking the Fifth Amendment does not allow a witness to avoid appearing altogether if subpoenaed. The witness must appear and can then selectively invoke their Fifth Amendment rights in response to specific questions that might lead to self-incrimination in criminal matters. This approach was common during the McCarthy era hearings. Options A and D are incorrect because impeachment proceedings, while political in nature, are still considered legal processes under the Constitution. Option B is incorrect because invoking the Fifth Amendment does not excuse a witness from appearing if subpoenaed; it only allows them to avoid answering specific incriminating questions."

In 1869 there was [*Griffin\u2019s Case*, 11 F. Cas. 7, 2 Am. Law T. Rep. U. S. Cts. 93; 8 Am. Law Reg. N. S. 358](https://cite.case.law/f-cas/11/7/?full_case=true&format=html). This was tried by Chief Justice Chase, in his role as a Circuit Justice, not as a Supreme Court case.\n\nOne Caesar Griffin was accused of shooting with intent to kill, tried before a Virginia state court, convicted, and sentenced to two years in prison. He then filed a writ of *Habes Corpus* claiming that his imprisonment was unlawful, because the jusge before whom he was tried, Hugh W. Sheffey, (in the words of Justice Chase):\n\n> in December, 1849, \\[Sheffey] as a member of the Virginia house of delegates, took an oath to support the constitution of the United States, and also that he was a member of the legislature of Virginia in 1862\\. during the late Rebellion, and as such voted for measures to sustain the so\\-called Confederate States in their war against the United States; and it was claimed in behalf of the petitioner, that he thereby became, and was at the time of the trial of the petitioner, disqualified to hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state ...\n\nSeveral other people tried and convicted before Judge Sheffey in the circuit court of Rockbridge county, including some convicted of murder, filed similar *Habes Corpus* petitions, claiming that Sheffey was prohibited by Section 3 from holding office, and that therefore their convictions were invalid. Judge Sheffey had been appointed to the office of Judge after the end of the US Civil War by the reorganized government of Virginia, the one recognized as valid by the Federal Government. He was appointed before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. There was no dispute that he fit the letter of the group of prohibited persons in Section 3\\.\n\nJustice Chase wrote:\n\n> The general question to be determined on the appeal from this order is whether or not the sentence of the circuit court of Rock\\-bridge county must be regarded as a nullity because of the disability to hold any office under the state of Virginia, imposed by the fourteenth amendment, on the person, who, in fact, presided as judge in that court.\n\nJustice Chase rejected the suggestion that all official actions by Sheffey and anyone in a similar position were automatically void and of no authority because of sectio0n 3\\. He wrote that:\n\n> The proposition maintained in behalf of the petitioner, is, that this prohibition, instantly, on the day of its promulgation, vacated all offices held by persons within the category of prohibition, and made all official acts, performed by them, since that day, null and void.\n\nAfter pointing out that many of the offials of the reconstructed governments of the sothern states were withign the terms of the prohibition of section 3, Chae went on to write:\n\n> If the construction now contended for be given to the prohibitive section, the effect must be to annul all official acts performed by these officers. No sentence, no judgment, no decree, no acknowledgment of a deed, no record of a deed, no sheriff\u2019s or commissioner\u2019s sale \u2014 in short no official act \u2014 is of the least validity. It is impossible to m\u00e9asure the evils which such a construction would add to the calamities which have already fallen upon the people of these states.\n\nAs a further reason not to construe section 3 as instantly and automatically removing all such officials, Chase wrote:\n\n> Now it is undoubted that those provisions of the constitution which deny to the legislature power to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or to pass a bill of attainder or an ex post facto, are inconsistent in their spirit and general purpose with a provision which, at once without trial, deprives a whole class of persons of offices held by them, for cause, however grave. It is true that no limit can be imposed on the people when exercising their sovereign power in amending their own constitution of government. But it is a necessary presumption that the people in the exercise of that power, seek to confirm and improve, rather than to weaken and impair the general spirit of the constitution.\n\n...\n\n> Is there, then, any other reasonable construction? ... The object of the amendment is to exclude from certain offices a certain class of persons. Now, it is obviously impossible to do this by a simple declaration, whether in the constitution or in an act of congress, that all persons included within a particular description shall not hold office. For, in the very nature of things, it must be ascertained what particular individuals are embraced by the definition, before any sentence of exclusion can be made to operate. To accomplish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, proceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of decisions, more or less formal, are indispensable; and these can only be provided for by congress.\n\n...\n\n> \\[I]t seems to put beyond reasonable question the conclusion that the intention of the people of the United States, in adopting the fourteenth amendment, was to create a disability, to be removed in proper cases by a two\\-thirds vote, and to be made operative in other cases by the legislation of congress in its ordinary course.\n\nChase also note that, 2 months after the conviction of Griffin:\n\n> in February, 1869, congress adopted a joint resolution entitled \u201ca resolution respecting the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas.\u201d In this resolution it was provided that persons, \u201cholding office in the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas,\u201d but unable to take and subscribe the test oath prescribed by the act of July 2, 1862 \\[12 Stat. 502], except those relieved from disability, \u201cbe removed therefrom;\u201d\n\nand that this indicates that such people were regarded by Congress as having remained in office and not beign automatically removed.\n\n*Griffin's Case* seems to establish that **some** proceeding is needed to establish when a person falls under the exclusion rule of Section 3 of the 14th. In 1869 this was done by military order. In 1870 Congress passed a statute providing for criminal proceedings in such cases. This was repealed at the end of Reconstruction.\n\nCurrently [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383) makes \"rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof,\" a crime, and provides that anyone convicted of it \"shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\" This is not quite the same as the section 3 disqualification. One the one hand, it does not depend on a prior oath to support the constitution, and on the other it does not appear to ban holding a state or local office. But it shows how a similar law could be drafted by Congress.\n\nLegislative declaration\n-----------------------\n\n> Can a Congressional resolution, or a Federal statute declare that specific people have so engaged?\n\nThis is probably prohibited as a *Bill of Attainder*, that is, a legislative declaration, without trial, that particular persons are guilty of particular crimes.\n\nOther Proceedings\n-----------------\n\n> What proceedings would be needed to establish that a person had \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\"?\n\nIf a person subject to the section 3 disqualification was elected to either house of Congress, that house could refuse to seat such person, or expel him or her, as the Constitution permits. Most state legislatures have similar powers over the seating and expulsion of their own members.\n\nIf a person is convicted under 18 USC \u00a7 2383 or any similar law, that person would clearly be excluded. Congress could pass a law establishing a special tribunal for determining when a person was subject to Section 3 of the 14th. But it has not done so.\n\n### See also\n\nSee also:\n\n* [this leglal blog post](https://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2020/08/section-three-of-the-fourteenth-amendment-.html)\n* [This article in *Constitution Daily*](https://constitutioncenter.org/amp/blog/the-constitution-offers-another-path-to-trump-accountability)\n* [14th Amendment's Section 3 Gets New Look as Democrats Weigh Measures Against Trump](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/01/12/14th-amendments-section-3-gets-new-look-as-democrats-weigh-measures-against-trump/) from the *National Law Journal*",

The documentation states that there is no generally applicable definition of \"relative\" in contract law. Instead, the parties to the contract must agree on what they mean by \"relative\" if they use the term. This implies that the definition can be flexible and vary depending on the specific agreement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that there isn't one universal definition of \"relative\" across different areas of law in the UK.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the documentation does not provide a specific cut-off point for what constitutes a relative. It suggests that the definition can vary, so third cousins may or may not be considered relatives depending on the agreement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect for two reasons. First, the documentation states that not all contracts require a witness signature to be valid. Second, it mentions that even if a relative does witness a signature contrary to the contract's terms, the contract can still be binding if the other party accepts it."

But I don't see how a lien can be field before the invoice is delivered, because the payment is not due until 30 days after the invoice date, and no lien can be field until payment is overdue.\n\nIt seems that the warranty on the work is not in effect until after final payment is made. If there is any reason to consider a warranty claim, it might be desirable to get and pay the invoice.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner hired a contractor for home renovations. The contract states that payment is due within 5 days of invoice date, and full payment of the final invoice within 30 days is a condition for the warranty to be effective. The contractor has completed the work but has not sent the final invoice. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the homeowner's obligations?\n\nA) The homeowner must proactively contact the contractor to request the final invoice.\nB) The homeowner is legally required to pay for the work even without receiving an invoice.\nC) The homeowner has no obligation to pay or pursue the invoice until it is received.\nD) The homeowner should pay an estimated amount to ensure the warranty becomes effective.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The homeowner has no legal obligation to pursue or pay the invoice until it is received. According to the contract, payment is due within 5 days of the invoice date, and the 30-day period for warranty effectiveness only begins once the final invoice is issued. The contractor is responsible for providing the invoice, and the homeowner is not required to proactively seek it out. However, it would be prudent for the homeowner to set aside funds for when the invoice does arrive, and to consider the trade-off between prompt payment (to activate the warranty) and waiting for the proper invoice to be sent."

This is below:\n\n> In an action for slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious\n> falsehood, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special\n> damage\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) if the words upon which the action is founded are\n> calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and are\n> published in writing or other permanent form; or\n> \n> \n> (b) if the said words\n> are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in respect\n> of any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried\n> on by him at the time of the publication.\n\nBut surely this section of the Act would always apply. The loss suffered as a result of a statement is always going to be economic (e.g., lost investment, sales, etc.) and the statement being malicious means that it was intended to cause damage when it was made.\n\nThus, whis this section of the Act considered to be an exception to the general rule, when in fact it would seem to apply in all cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### The section exempts the plaintiff from having to prove or even plead special damages when they instead plead and prove that the words were intended to cause pecuniary (even if not yet realized) damages\n\nThis statutory exception has also been adopted in Canadian jurisdictions and they have turned to U.K. jurisprudence to understand its meaning (*Almas et al. v. Spenceley*, [\\[1972] 2 O.R. 429](https://canlii.ca/t/g17r5) (C.A.)):\n\n> The Court was referred to a number of cases under the law as it then stood whereby it was strictly required that special damages be set forth in the pleading and whereby no plea of general damages would be entertained. This was changed in England by the Defamation Act, 1952 (U.K.), c. 66, s. 3 (1\\), and here by a similar section, s. 19(a) of the Libel and Slander Act, 1958\n> (Ont.), c. 51 ...\n\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal quoted from *Clavet v. Tomkies et al.*, \\[1963] 3 All E.R. 610 (Lord Denning) (emphasis mine):\n\n> All I would say is that, as I read s. 3 of the Defamation Act, 1952, **it gives a benefit to a plaintiff in that it is not necessary to plead or prove special damage if the words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage**.\n\nThis means that special damages (actual and provable pecuniary losses up to the date of trial) need not be proven nor even pleaded if the words *are calculated* (meaning *intended* to) cause pecuniary damage (which might have not yet occurred, but might be proven as likely future damages at trial).\n\n*Brown on Defamation* confirms that generally:\n\n> there must be an express allegation that the plaintiff has suffered some particular special damage as a result of the slander, unless there is some special statutory provision foregoing an allegation of special damages where the words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage with respect to an office, profession or trade.\n\n### This is not redundant with the maliciousness element\n\nMalice need not be the intent to cause pecuniary loss. Malice can be made out by any improper motive, including spite, or an intention to cause pure reputational harm with no regard for pecuniary damages.\n\nIn my view, this section has the greatest effect at the pleading stage. I agree that in many (although not all) malicious falsehood cases, proof of malice will double for proof of an intention to cause pecuniary damages.",

When opening a bank account she used her correct social security number, but used her similar planned new name instead of her current legal name. Well of course she discovered it was much harder to have your name legally changed than she believed, and you are required to post about it in the papers which somewhat defeats the point. So she may have committed a kind of fraud or forgery for very innocent reasons, not financial gain.\n\nWhat sort of legal repercussions might this have? She would like to get her old financial records from this now closed account, but her ID does not match. Might she have any way to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an interesting question and one that does not have a uniform answer.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, while there is a court proceeding by which you can change your name, there is also case law precedent that says your legal name is what you go by even if it doesn't match your birth certificate or other official records.\\* \n\nFor example, I have a client who has a birth name completely different from the one she uses in day to day life (as different as, for example, \"Sophia\" and \"Betsy\" are from each other) that she picked up in college and just started living under for reasons that she could never really fully explain to me in a way that made sense. Under Colorado law, the name she used on a day to day basis is one of her legal names, even though there was never a legal name change proceeding conducted in a court.\n\nI happen to know someone who set up a bank account with a name other than on their official documents and with their own Social Security number at a bank and it caused no problems, because banks don't routinely check Social Security numbers against names (employers, in contrast, routinely do cross\\-check).\n\nNot every state recognizes \"common law\" name changes, or even every bureaucratic entity within a state that expressly does have that as their law. Most bureaucrats in both the public and private sector don't understand the concept of a common law name change even in places where that is the law, because it doesn't fit with bureaucratic logic.\n\nIt is not forgery, which would involve signing with an intent to appear to be some other actual person who you are not. \n\nWhether or not it is fraud turns on intent. If you use a different name to evade a creditor or to cash a check that wasn't intended to be payable to you, that is fraud. But, simply changing a new to avoid family members who mistreat you is not fraud.\n\nIn terms of getting the bank records, the best thing to do is to try to explain the situation to the bank official (ideally with, e.g., a Social Security card and other evidence such as the name of a former employer or a person to whom checks were regularly written to corroborate your story).\n\nName disconnects aren't that unusual in banking. For example, I was beneficiary of an account established by my late father that identified me by my pre\\-marital name of 23 years ago. But, the rule of law is that a beneficiary designation is valid if the intended person is clear, even if the names don't exactly match, for example, because your name changed in the meantime. As a result, I am able to deposit checks payable to my pre\\-marital name. So, a lack of a name match shouldn't be a strict bar to getting old banking records of your own account.\n\nFor another purpose, it is also permissible to have checks whose name don't match the name on the account, and to have \"trade name\" accounts of an unincorporated individual supported only by an obscure trade name filing for businesses. \n\n**Post\\-Script: Some Similar Concepts**\n\n* In the same vein, Colorado recognizes common law marriage that arises when two people agree that they are married and hold themselves out to the public as married, without any formal paperwork. If you just start calling someone \"my husband\" and you both mean it, it is true.\n\nEmancipation of a minor in Colorado is a similar concept. An emancipated minor in Colorado is a minor who provides most of his or her own support and lives independently. Courts in Colorado don't declare that a minor is emancipated causing the minor to become emancipated following a petition requesting emancipation. Instead, courts in Colorado determine as a factual matter if given the way that the minor lives his or her life, he is or is not emancipated. The emancipation determination of a court flows from the reality on the ground, rather than the other way around.\n\nThe race\\-notice recording system for real estate also works this way. Ownership of real estate flows from transactions that happen outside the recording system and can be private. Recording real estate documents provides evidence of an underlying reality and provides a means of weighing evidence when there is a dispute over who owns real property, but recording a document with the clerk and recorder of a county in not what actually causes title to that real estate to change, unlike the situation in title registration jurisdictions like the UK and Germany and South Africa where the filling with the government office is the moment at which title is changed.",

She now wants to open a bank account under the name \"Emily\". Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's situation?\n\nA) Sarah must legally change her name to Emily before she can open a bank account under that name.\nB) Sarah can open the bank account as Emily, but it would be considered fraud.\nC) Sarah can legally open the bank account as Emily, as Colorado recognizes common law name changes.\nD) Sarah can only open the account as Emily if she provides documentation of her intent to legally change her name.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, Colorado recognizes \"common law\" name changes. The passage states, \"in Colorado, while there is a court proceeding by which you can change your name, there is also case law precedent that says your legal name is what you go by even if it doesn't match your birth certificate or other official records.\" Since Sarah has been using the name Emily in her day-to-day life for an extended period, this would likely be considered her legal name under Colorado law, even without a formal name change process. Therefore, she could legally open a bank account under the name Emily.\n\nOption A is incorrect because in Colorado, a formal legal name change is not necessary if the person has been using the new name consistently.\n\nOption B is wrong because using a common law name change is not considered fraud in Colorado, especially when there's no intent to deceive or gain financial advantage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in Colorado, no documentation of intent to change names is required if the person has been consistently using the new name in daily life."

Pharmacists can refuse to fill prescriptions they are uncomfortable filling, and many will not fill self\\-prescriptions.\n\n---\n\nIt's not clear if, as originally written, this question is referring to the FDA's [Expanded Access Program](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access), which was created under FDA's regulatory authority (ergo it is not a law) and is colloquially called *compassionate use*; or the [Right to Try Act](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/right-try), which was signed into law by President Trump in 2018\\. I am going to take a few moments to give an overview of both and then get to the question of self\\-prescribing.\n\nExpanded Access has been around for about 30 years, when it began as a way to make experimental HIV drugs available to patients during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been used since them to make drugs available for a variety of diseases (like [cancer](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/compassionate-drug-use.html)), and most recently for COVID\\-19\\.\n\nThe Right to Try Act is similar in that it makes experimental drugs available to patients before they have received full regulatory approval. The mechanism for that availability is a different, and it has since it is a law it has the explicit approval of Congress. Here are a [journal article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081483/) and a [very good table breaking down the differences](https://triagecancer.org/expanded-access-vs-try-patients#:%7E:text=What%20is%20the%20Food%20%26%20Drug,access%20to%20investigational%20medical%20products.) between Right to Try and Expanded Access.\n\nNeither of these modify the patient/doctor relationship, so they do not effect whether a prescriber can write their own prescriptions either way. **A doctor could probably prescribe COVID\\-19\\-related treatments for themselves approved for widespread use under Expanded Access; they would likely be unable to self\\-prescribe other more medically\\-complex, higher\\-risk treatments like chemotherapy.** See below.\n\n---\n\n**Self\\-prescribing is legal under federal law.** As noted by the [Emergency Care Research Institute](https://www.ecri.org/components/HRC/Pages/AskHRC111219.aspx):\n\n> Under federal law, physicians in the United States are not prohibited from self\\-prescribing medications. State laws governing physicians, however, vary greatly, and some may prohibit physicians from prescribing, dispensing, or administering certain medications to themselves or family members.\n\n[Restrictions vary by state](https://www.grantsformedical.com/self-prescribing-laws-by-state.html). Most (perhaps all) states prohibit a prescriber from self\\-prescribing [Schedule II](https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling) controlled substances, with some providing an exception for an emergency. Many prohibit prescribing of Schedule II drugs to family members. I have found several sources that claim some states outright prohibit self\\-prescribing, but whenever I follow those back to the actual statute they only apply to Schedule II drugs.\n\nProfessional organizations like the American Medical Association strongly discourage their members self\\-prescribing, stating in their [Code of Ethics](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/treating-self-or-family) that \"treating oneself or a member of one's own family poses several challenges for physicians, including concerns about professional objectivity, patient autonomy, and informed consent.\"\n\nThe greatest barrier to self\\-prescribing lies at the pharmacy, where pharmacists are able to refuse prescriptions when they question the medical necessity or standard of care that lead to the prescription.",

The judge's question, while seemingly broad, is designed to uncover any promises or threats made to the defendant outside the scope of the official plea agreement. This is in line with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which requires the court to ensure that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force, threats, or promises other than those in the plea agreement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because plea bargains are explicitly exempt from being considered \"promises\" in this context, as per Rule 11.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the question might seem confusing to defendants, it's intentionally broad to encourage full disclosure of any external influences.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because this question has significant legal importance in ensuring the voluntariness of the plea, and is not merely a formality."

The EU does not have any specific regulation that mandates companies to replace their IT equipment at fixed short intervals like 3 or 6 months. The claim mentioned in the question is incorrect. While the EU encourages businesses to stay technologically current, there's no strict timeline enforced for equipment replacement. Answer A is a misrepresentation of EU policy. Answer B, while less extreme, is still incorrect as there's no such biannual requirement. Answer D confuses accounting practices with equipment replacement regulations; while some countries may have depreciation schedules for IT equipment, this is not an EU-wide regulation about physical replacement. Option C is the most accurate, acknowledging the lack of a specific mandate while recognizing the general encouragement of technological updates."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of your recording?\n\nA) You must explicitly inform the representative that you're also recording the call, or you'll be in violation of California law.\n\nB) You can legally record the call without informing the representative, but only if you're calling from outside of California.\n\nC) You can legally record the call without additional notification, as the call is no longer considered a \"confidential communication\" under California law.\n\nD) You can only record the call if you get verbal consent from the representative after the automated message plays.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Under California Penal Code 632, all parties must consent to the recording of a \"confidential communication.\" However, once the company announces that the call may be recorded, the communication is no longer considered confidential. The California Civil Jury Instructions specify that a plaintiff must prove they had a \"reasonable expectation that the conversation was not being overheard or recorded.\" When the automated message plays, this reasonable expectation no longer exists. Therefore, you can legally record the call without additional notification, as the call is no longer considered a \"confidential communication\" under California law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because once the automated message plays, you don't need to explicitly inform the representative of your recording.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the legality doesn't depend on your location, but rather on the nature of the communication itself.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because additional verbal consent is not necessary after the automated message has played."

Additionally, it is entirely possible to not have earphones covering you ear and still perfectly hear the sound from the device due to it's general proximity to the ear drum.\n\nThe reason for this ban is because there are several audio cues that are required for safely driving a vehicle. Earphones may prevent you from hearing a siren of an emergency vehicle, the beep of a horn from a car that you are about to accidentally merge into, or the distinct beeping of a reversing truck to warn people in it's driver's blind spot.",

Using a single earbud is permitted.\n\nB) is incorrect because bone conduction headphones do not cover, rest on, or insert into the ears. They transmit sound through the cheekbones, leaving the ears open to hear ambient sounds.\n\nC) While this scenario involves headphones covering both ears, which seems to violate the law, the question is tricky. The law doesn't specify whether the headphones need to be playing audio to be in violation. However, since they are covering both ears, this would likely still be considered a violation.\n\nD) is the correct answer. The law specifically mentions \"resting on\" both ears as a violation. Even if the speakers are swung away, the earphones with hooks are still resting on both ears, which meets the criteria for a violation according to the statute.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the specific language in the law, including the \"resting on\" clause, and requires careful consideration of different headphone types and configurations."

According to the information provided, using a US forwarding address could subject the user to sales and use taxes in the state where goods are delivered. This is a potential legal implication that the business owner should be aware of.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the risk of deportation is minimal, as the business owner is not physically present in the US.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there are no customs duties or import taxes between US states for this type of consumer activity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the forwarding service is not obligated to handle all tax obligations for the user. The user is still responsible for understanding and complying with applicable tax laws.\n\nWhile not mentioned in the options, other potential risks include investigations for shipping contraband, complications with intellectual property licensing restrictions, and suspicion of money laundering for high-volume, high-value shipments."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was t\\-boned in a parking lot in Utah. I have Allstate insurance. The police came and gathered insurance information from both parties and gave each of us copies. I believe they later made a report.\n\nI have been working with my insurance company to get this resolved and I feel like they are purposely blowing me off. First, Allstate said they couldn't contact the other party in the accident so I will have to pay for my car repair myself. Second, they said that no fault is assigned and each party pays for their own damages. I know the police don't assign fault when the accident is on private property, but surely fault still exists.\n\nAre these statements true? What rights do I have and what ability do I have to get my insurance company to go to bat for me? I assume their statements are false. Otherwise, I could drive around hitting cars in private parking lots with an uninsured car with no consequence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"No fault\" is a term of art in this case. In a \"no fault\" insurance regime, such as [the one in place in Utah](http://www.all-about-car-accidents.com/resources/insurance-law/car-insurance/utah-auto-insurance-law), minor car accidents are covered by the insurance company of the person who suffers the damage, and not by the person who is at fault in the accident.\n\nUtah's \"No\\-Fault\" Insurance System\n\n> Utah is a \"no\\-fault\" car insurance state. This means that when a car\n>  accident occurs, the people injured in the crash turn to their own\n>  insurance coverage first (and sometimes exclusively), filing what is\n>  known as a \"first\\-party\" claim. This insurance is required to pay at\n>  least $3,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits, regardless\n>  of who was at fault for the accident. For minor accidents, that may be\n>  the extent of the process \\-\\- an injured person receiving a settlement\n>  from their own car insurance carrier. Because Utah is a no\\-fault\n>  state, its laws limit the situations in which people injured in car\n>  accidents can step outside the no\\-fault rules and file a liability\n>  claim or lawsuit seeking compensation from others who may have caused\n>  the accident. Before filing a lawsuit after a car accident in Utah, an\n>  injured person must first have incurred $3,000 in medical expenses\n>  stemming from the accident, or must have suffered certain kinds of\n>  serious injuries as a result of the accident. In Utah, the kinds of\n>  injuries that qualify under this \"injury threshold\" are:\n>  \\- permament disability\n>  \\- permanent impairment\n>  \\- permanent disfigurement, or\n>  \\- dismemberment\n\nWithout knowing more details about the damages suffered and the terms of the respective policies, it is hard to determine if your claim is or is not beyond the threshold where private lawsuits are allowed. It could be that property damage is not covered by \"no fault\" at all, or that it could be covered by \"no fault\" but that you have waived that coverage.\n\nIf this is a case where private lawsuits are allowed, someone who is injured would hire a private personal injury lawyer, unaffiliated with their insurance company, to sue the person at fault in the accident to recover the damages not covered by your no fault coverage due to the other driver's fault. This would not be the responsibility of your insurance company, unless you have uninsured motorist coverage and the other driver was uninsured, which does not seem to be the case.\n\nIn non\\-no fault states and in cases in a no fault state where a lawsuit is allowed, your insurance company (after paying any PIP benefits) would not be involved and cannot help you sue the other driver. If you sue the other driver, the other driver's insurance company will hire a lawyer to defend him and would have authority to settle the case up to the policy limits of the other driver's insurance policy.\n\nThe insurance company has a duty to affirmatively help you obtain the rights you are entitled to under your policy and if they fail to do so this is called a \"bad faith breach of insurance contract\". But, they are not obligated to help you with respect to harm not covered by your policy.",

These qualifying injuries include permanent disability, permanent impairment, permanent disfigurement, or dismemberment. This threshold is in place to limit lawsuits for minor accidents while still allowing legal recourse for more serious incidents."

Brand Protection: It protects the overall brand name, which will be used for multiple products in the future.\n2. Flexibility: It allows the company to use the brand name with various product names without needing separate registrations for each combination.\n3. Cost-Effective: It's more economical to register one strong brand name rather than multiple product names or combinations.\n4. Distinctiveness: \"BrightWave\" is likely more distinctive than \"UltraScreen,\" which could be seen as somewhat descriptive.\n5. Future-Proofing: It supports the company's plan to launch more products under the same brand name.\n\nOption B is not ideal because \"UltraScreen\" might be too descriptive or generic. Option C limits protection to that specific combination and doesn't cover future products. Option D, while comprehensive, may be unnecessarily expensive and complex, especially if \"UltraScreen\" is not highly distinctive on its own."

Such a disclaimer makes it much harder for someone to sue the writer (or the company that the writer works for) for trademark infringement. Since it is an infringement to falsely claim or imply an endorsement or affiliation, such that the quality and good will associated with the trademark or its owner is attributed to the product being described, such a disclaimer makes it clear that no such claim is being made. Some companies in the past have tried to sue anyone who mentions their products by trademark without permission, claiming an attempted infringement. Such disclaimers are defenses in advance against such suits. Most readers have no reason to care, as you said, and many disclaimers are probably not needed, but the cost of inserting them is low, and the cost of even an unsuccessful suit is comparatively high.",

These disclaimers make it clear that the writer or company is not claiming ownership of the trademarks mentioned, nor implying any endorsement by the trademark owners. This preemptive measure makes it more difficult for trademark owners to sue for infringement, as it explicitly states that no false affiliation or endorsement is being claimed. While such disclaimers may seem unnecessary to many readers, they serve as a low-cost defense against potentially high-cost legal actions, even if those actions might ultimately be unsuccessful.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the disclaimers actually do the opposite - they acknowledge that the trademarks belong to other entities.\nOption B is incorrect as these disclaimers do not prevent competitors from using trademarks; they merely clarify the relationship between the document creator and the trademark owners.\nOption D is incorrect because while common, these disclaimers are not mandatory legal requirements for all product documentation."

The response given is the standard response to any allegation of law. Allegations number 1, 2, and 9\\-14 are all allegations of law. The only factual allegations are allegations 3\\-7 (with allegation 8 merely unnecessarily reincorporating the previous allegations by reference).\n\nFurthermore, a bare denial of an itemized allegation of fact is sufficient, without further explanation.\n\n> Does the government limit its defenses to the jurisdictional issue,\n> and to the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\n> by not following the rule requires defendants state in short and plain\n> terms its defenses to each claim asserted against?\n\nThe requirement of the rule is to set forth affirmative defenses in the section entitled defenses, but denials of fact sufficient to defeat the elements of the claim for relief sought also suffice.\n\nIf further affirmative defenses are discovered in the course of the litigation, the answer can be amended and leave to do so is granted liberally.\n\nIn this case, the government is basically saying, \"So what? There is no common law right of access, and even if there was one, you as a third\\-party unconnected to the events doesn't have standing to exercise it.\"\n\n> How might J.W. have done a better job in writing the complaint in a\n> way that would require a more specific answer?\n\nJudicial Watch could have pursued a cause of action that is recognized under the law.\n\nThere is no legally established common law right of access for a third\\-party as asserted. Judicial Watch really doesn't care if it gets a detailed response in an answer or not. It is trying to establish new law that is not present in prior precedents.\n\nAlso, in modern civil litigation, the main means of getting factual information is though disclosures and discovery required later in the litigation process. The notion that the answer to the complaint should be a significant source of substantive disclosure of facts was largely abandoned in connection with the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the 1930s.\n\nThe denial of jurisdiction is primarily on the basis of lack of standing (since lack of standing is one form of lack of subject matter jurisdiction). It has not alleged that is has members who suffered an injury to a legally protected right, or that the entity itself suffered an injury to a legally protected right.\n\nIt is likely that the complaint will be dismissed summarily in early motion practice, probably for lack of standing. The J.W. complaint is short in an effort to make the scope of that notion practice narrow and less expensive.",

I already understand most of my company's policies around this, but I am a little unsure about one area.\n\nI understand that if I use a license purchased for me by my company on my side business, this could be a breach of contract and my primary employer could bring action against me, as considered in [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16625/does-my-employer-own-code-i-write-at-home-using-the-visual-studio-license-from-w).\n\nIf I were to purchase the license myself and seek reimbursement for it, would this change the ownership of the license and therefore negate the breach of contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are hired to create a piece of software X, then it is a work for hire and your employer holds the copyright. If you are hired to write software X and also write software Y on your own, you hold the copyright. However, you could well get fired for using company resources for personal projects, whether it is a pen, computer or software license. If your contract actually says e.g. \"If you use any company resources in a personal business venture then we hold all rights to that venture an an extension of your employment\", you might have a harder time maintaining that this wasn't a work for hire, but that would have to be sorted out in court. But if they just said \"Don't use our stuff\", then it would be a breach of contract. The point is, ownership of the created work is not determined by ownership of one or more tools used to create the work. You could ask for exceptional permission to use their license for your product, or you could buy a license and then sell it to the company, or you could ask them to but a separate license for you, or you could buy it yourself and then ask them to reimburse you. Whichever way you do it, you would own the copyright, unless of course they made it a condition of purchasing / using / reimbursing that any resulting IP be transferred to them.",

It's just me.\n\nSo is it possible to state in the terms and conditions that it is the responsibility of the user to take down any copyrighted work and require the user to give a public email through which the affected party can contact them?\n\nAnother thing is, is that between the time where a user uploads copyrighted work and when it's taken down the user is being paid.\n\nThanks\n\nP.S. In case this is important I live in England to this is a case of UK law\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A number of commercial cartoonists operate in the US, so you might be sued in US courts (with judgment enforced by your courts), regardless of where you live. Basically, you have to comply with *everbody's* copyright law, when you operate a web page, unless there's an issue with a strange law in a country that has no legal reach into the UK (no treaty governing enforcement of foreign judgments).\n\nIf you knowingly and willfully allow others to post protected material, you can be sued and found liable for major damages. If you unwittingly allow others to post protected material, you can be sued and found liable for lesser damages, unless you've protected yourself by following DMCA safe harbor rules. The gist of those rules is that you have to make it easy for rights\\-holders to contact you and request removal of infringing material. If you do this in the right way (expeditiously; following a certain protocol for notice and counter\\-notice), you will not be liable. There are particular requirements on the takedown notice and so on: pushing the matter off onto the uploader will not work. Rather, *you* must respond to takedown requets. (From a practical POV, putting contributor's email addresses out there in the open is also going to seriously restrict the number of contributors you will get).\n\nYour website presumably operates under someone else's domain, hardware and so on, and that business might be sued as well, for letting you let someone infringe copyright. Undoubtedly they will have included some statement about copyright infringement in their terms of service with you, and they can sue you if you don't do that. It is extremely unlikely that you could hide from a person whose copyright you have infringed (the service provider will comply with requests for information, assuming privacy laws are followed in doing so), so assume that a cease and desist letter can and will be delivered to you, even if *you* don't provide any contact information.\n\nThere is no equivalent safe\\-harbour law in the UK. This may put some burden on the rights\\-holder, that they may have to give you \"actual knowledge\" of infringement (it would not be hard for a rights holder to provide evidence of their rights). \n\nA TOS clause whereby users must vow that they have a right to upload the material does not remove your liability. You could include an indemnification clause requiring an infringer to cover your costs created by his actions, but then you would have to locate and sue the infringer to actually cover those costs. Since the work is being used for profit, you would also be liable for those lost revenues, even if you had paid out a share to the uploader.\n\nSince there is no definitive database where one can determine who holds the rights to a work, it can be difficult to protect oneself against infringers who upload to your website. The risk can be reduced by making it easy for rights\\-holders to notify you of infringements, and by responding rapidly to such notices. However, it is not automatically safe to take down any alleged infringing materials, because that may infringe on the contractual rights of your contributors, especially since the user provides you something of value in exchange for something that they value (money, in particular). If you just take down somebody's cartoon, you may be liable for lost revenues and even copyright violation. If the uploader had in fact infringed somebody else's copyright, they could not sue you for taking down \"their\" cartoon: but you don't know if they actually have the rights. To prevent yourself from getting sued by contributors, your TOS would need to include language reserving the right to take down a contribution (this is where you would need to hire an attorney to craft the TOS).\n\nDMCA not only protects a service provider against liability for infringement, it also protects them against customers who want to sue for taking down their material. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Notice_from_copyright_owner) gives an overview of this aspect of DMCA law, and redundantly building such provisions into your TOS is not legally harmful. Unfortunately, one of the provisions is that you \"not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity\", which would not be the case if you are making money from ads where cartoons attract customers.",

The website can be sued in various jurisdictions, including US courts, regardless of the owner's location in England.\n3. Pushing responsibility onto users for takedown requests is not sufficient; the website owner must respond to takedown requests themselves.\n4. Even with disclaimers and Terms of Service clauses, the website owner may still be liable, especially if they profit from the infringing content through ad revenue.\n5.

I also want her to be able to manage pretty much any single aspect of our financial life if situation forces her. Again, no limitations here \u2013 I trust her 100%. So, for example, I want her to be able to access my banking accounts, acquire and sell property of any kind, etc.\n\nWhat kind of Power of Attorney will grant her these legal permissions? In Russia we'd call such document a \"General Power of Attorney\". To get it, you'd need to officially notarize it. How does it work in the US?\n\n(Note: I live in Washington state.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As it happens, the law was just changed, effective 1/1/2017, and [here are the changes](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5635-S.SL.pdf). One part, section 105(1\\), states \n\n> A power of attorney must be signed and dated by the principal, \n>  and the signature must be either acknowledged before a notary\n>  public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments, or\n>  attested by two or more competent witnesses who are neither home care providers for the principal nor care\n>  providers at an adult family home or long\\-term care facility in which\n>  the principal resides, and who are unrelated to the principal or agent by blood, marriage, or state registered domestic partnership, by subscribing their names to the power of attorney, while in the presence of the principal and at the \n>  principal's direction or request.\n\nthen 105(3\\) states\n\n> A signature on a power of attorney is presumed to be genuine if the\n>  principal acknowledges the signature before a notary public or other\n>  individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments.\n\nThat leaves open the possibility that there could be a dispute over the legitimacy of your signature if you use two witnesses. A related reason to prefer a notarized version is that it is \"acknowledged\" under Sec. 119 (1\\):\n\n> For purposes of this section and section 120 of this act,\n>  \"acknowledged\" means purportedly verified before a notary public or\n>  other individual authorized to take acknowledgments.\n\nThe reason why an \"acknowledged\" POA is a good thing is that there is also (new) law that gives such a POA special (good) status. Sect 119 continues:\n\n> (2\\)A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of\n>  attorney without actual knowledge that the signature is not genuine\n>  may rely upon the presumption under section 105 of this act that the\n>  signature is genuine.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of\n>  attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney is void,\n>  invalid, or terminated, that the purported agent's authority is void,\n>  invalid, or terminated, or that the agent is exceeding or improperly\n>  exercising the agent's authority may rely upon the power of attorney\n>  as if the power of attorney were genuine, valid and still in effect,\n>  the agent's authority were genuine, valid and still in effect, and the\n>  agent had not exceeded and had properly exercised the authority.\n\nA prudent person would not hand over your stuff to a stranger or someone claiming to have power of attorney, unless they were sure that the person with a POA form actually had a legitimate POA form. They would be liable for damages if they gave away your stuff to an unauthorized person. An acknowledged POA is better than a POA with two neighbors as witnesses, because the acknowledged POA further establishes that the signature is valid.\n\nSection 120 also requires acceptance of an acknowledged POA within 7 days (whereas with neighbor signatures, further investigation may be called for, meaning delays).\n\nThe existing statute is [here](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=11.94&full=true), which is the law at the moment. There is no mention of a notary requirement, and no witness signature requirement (that changes). Section 40(1\\) says that \"Any person acting without negligence and in good faith in reasonable reliance on a power of attorney shall not incur any liability\" \u2013 now, is it negligence to accept a signature (of a principle) without investigating its validity? I really don't know. If you follow the new rules and get it notarized, that is covered. RCW 11\\.94\\.010 addresses the \"what type\" question, that is, whether the POA remains valid if you are incapacitated, or becomes effective once you are incapacitated. The point is that you have to say what they can do, and when they can. There is in fact [a site with templates](http://powerofattorney.com/washington/) that gives you some idea what the kinds of POAs there are. I'm not vouching for the correctness of their templates.",

In fact, enacted law is usually quite ambiguous until it has a body of unenacted (or case) law that surrounds it and provides guidance on how the courts will interpret it.\n\nPart of a lawyers skill is knowing (within their area of expertise) what the relevant case and statute law is with respect to the specific facts of the case, or knowing how to research them.\n\n[Publish and be damned!](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rear-window-when-wellington-said-publish-and-be-damned-the-field-marshal-and-the-scarlet-woman-1430412.html)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can always take the Duke of Wellingtons approach.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, everything is legal unless there is a law (enacted or unenacted) that makes it otherwise.\n\nIf you do not believe that the action you wish to take is illegal then advise the other party that you will give them 24 hours to come back with a court injunction to prohibit it, otherwise you will proceed.\n\nYou can't call a bluff harder than this!",

This is also true in most other kinds of lawsuits.\n\n> if I cannot beat this challenge, can I remove myself as beneficiary\n> and have the Probate court declare that all 5 blood\\-related\n> grandchildren will get equal shares?\n\nRemoving yourself as a beneficiary is called filing a \"disclaimer\" in legalese. It means to refuse to accept a gift or inheritance. But you can't do that if you have already received any personal benefit from the estate and there are other statutory restrictions. For tax purposes, the deadline to do is nine months after the date of death, but the state law deadline could be different.\n\nWhat would happen if you do so depends upon the language of the will. Usually, gifts to a group of people are made \"per stirpes\" (also called \"by representation\") which means that if a child predeceases or makes a timely disclaimer that their children share in the share that their parent would have received only. It is possible that it says something different, but that would be by far the most common provision.\n\n> Under the original Probate interpretation, when the real\\-estate sold,\n> I invested the proceeds in the stock market and there have been\n> losses.

Section a covers the great seal of the United States (emphasis mine):\n\n> Whoever knowingly displays any printed or other likeness of the great seal of the United States, or of the seals of the President or the Vice President of the United States, or the seal of the United States Senate, or the seal of the United States House of Representatives, or the seal of the United States Congress, or any facsimile thereof, in, or in connection with, any advertisement, poster, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication, public meeting, play, motion picture, telecast, or other production, or on any building, monument, or stationery, **for the purpose of conveying, or in a manner reasonably calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States or by any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof**, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\n\nBased on a plain reading of the law, it would seem that you are allowed to reproduce the seal so long as you do not do it in such a way that would convey approval by the government to do so. If you actually intend to do this, you may consider checking with a competent attorney to make sure your use does not \"convey a false impression of sponsorship.\" Note that this only applies to the great seal, the rest of the section covers the seals of the President, Vice President and the houses of Congress and specifically requires approval by an appropriate entity before reproduction of those seals, depending on the context.",

Which of the following uses of the Great Seal of the United States would most likely be considered legal under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 713?\n\nA) Displaying the Great Seal on promotional posters for the exhibit, which are distributed throughout the city\nB) Using the Great Seal on the museum's letterhead for all correspondence related to the exhibit\nC) Including a historically accurate reproduction of the Great Seal in an educational display about its symbolism and history\nD) Selling souvenir badges featuring the Great Seal in the museum gift shop\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because it involves using the Great Seal in an educational context, focusing on its history and symbolism. This use is unlikely to convey a false impression of government sponsorship or approval.\n\nOption A could be problematic as it might suggest government endorsement of the exhibit, especially if the seal is prominently featured on promotional materials.\n\nOption B, using the seal on letterhead, could easily be misconstrued as implying official government communication or approval, which would likely violate the statute.\n\nOption D involves commercial use, which, while not explicitly prohibited by the statute, could be seen as implying government endorsement of a product, potentially violating the law.\n\nThe key factor in determining legality is whether the use could reasonably convey a false impression of government sponsorship or approval. An educational display about the seal itself is the least likely to create such an impression."

If found guilty, what would a typical punishment be in the US?\n\nDoes it matter whether the victim is under\\-aged?\n\nDoes it matter if the perpetrator is in a position of authority? (Say the perpetrator is a high school teacher and the victim is a high\\-school student.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most states have two parallel sets of sexual assault statutes. One set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual penetration that has greater penalties. The other set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual contact without sexual penetration that has smaller penalties but otherwise the same elements of the offense.\n\nUsually, almost every offense which is a crime when it involves sexual penetration is also a crime when it involves sexual contact but not sexual penetration, with the fairly frequent exception of statutory rape offenses that cover an adolescent victim who is below the age of consent but post\\-pubescent (with the statute itself setting specific age thresholds that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction).\n\nOften, even when statutory rape of an adolescent (i.e. sex with consent by an adolescent under the age of consent) itself is a relatively minor crime, often a misdemeanor, and is rarely prosecuted to the full extent of the law, child prostitution or attempted child prostitution with the same victim is often a very serious offense, and child pornography offenses often also carry serious penalties when the \"child\" is under the age of eighteen, even when the sexual act filmed or photographed itself is of people who are above the age of consent and are legally having consensual sex.\n\nIn many states, sex with someone in a position of authority over the victim is a crime without regard to consent, much like a statutory rape offense, but without regard to age. In some states there would be a parallel sexual contact offense, and in some states there would not be one.\n\nThe name of the offenses varies considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes they are different degrees of the same offense, sometimes they are offenses with different names, and the names used varies quite a bit.\n\nAlso, even when an arguable sexual contact offense is not a sex offense, it would almost always be some form of non\\-sexual criminal assault offense.\n\nFor example, [Colorado](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2018-title-18.pdf) has sexual assault related crimes called **sexual assault** at Colo. Rev. Statutes \u00a7 18\\-3\\-402 (involving sexual penetration and including two grades of statutory rape, and including cases where \"the victim is in custody of law or detained in a hospital or other institution and the actor has supervisory or disciplinary authority over the victim and uses this position of authority to coerce the victim to submit, unless the act is incident to a lawful search\" and cases where \"the actor, while purporting to offer a medical service, engages in treatment or examination of a victim for other than a bona fide medical purpose or in a manner substantially inconsistent with reasonable medical practices\"), a parallel crime called **unlawful sexual contact** at Colo.

Statute \u00a7 18\\-17\\-101, et seq.\n\n> If found guilty, what would a typical punishment be in the US?\n\nIn a system in which there are several classes of felonies and several classes of misdemeanors, usually sexual contact offenses are one to three offense classes below the sexual penetration offense with the same elements.\n\nFor example, if unaggravated sexual penetration without consent is the second lowest grade of felony, unaggravated sexual contact without consent is typically the lowest grade of felony or the highest grade of misdemeanor.\n\nA highly aggravated sexual assault with penetration offense is often punishable by decades in prison. An unaggravated sexual contact without consent offense may be punishable by up to six to twelve months in jail or a long period of probation. The offenses are too varied by jurisdiction and crime details to summarize easily. Aggravated rape is a death penalty offense in U.S. military justice although the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the imposition of the death penalty (at least in cases where the victim is not a child) is unconstitutional. Some states declare in their statutes that the aggravated rape of a child is a death penalty offense although the constitutionality of those statutes has not been tested in court and no one has been executed for such an offense since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s in the U.S.\n\nMost sex offenses in the U.S. of all types, including both sexual contact offenses, sexual penetration offenses, and even offenses involving no contact at all, such being a peeping tom, also require to convicted defendant to register as a sex offender, either for a long period of time or for life, which is a quite severe and separate punishment in addition to the incarceration and/or fine and court costs and surcharges involved.\n\nIn the case of child sex offenses and some repeat rape offenders, even after a term of incarceration is fully served, the state may seek to have the offender detained indefinitely civilly to protect the public until it is determined that the offender is no longer a threat, which rarely happens in practice.",

In the latter case the burden of proving a *lack of intent* is on the accused, while in the former case I think it's not. Nevertheless, the two provisions are similar due to \"sexual intent\" being used. How is this proven and disproven?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sexual intent is proven (or disproven) like any other form of intent. A confession is not necessary, although that is one available method. It may be inferred with proof from circumstantial evidence.\n\nAny combination of direct and circumstantial evidence is allowed. There isn't a formula for it. The prosecution or defendant, as the case may be, simply has to convince the trier of fact that there was or was not sexual intent. Any otherwise admissible evidence that could rationally show that sexual intent is more or less likely can be presented.\n\nIf it happens in a gynecological appointment, or because the defendant slipped on a banana peel after the defendant's glasses were splattered with mud so he couldn't see what he was doing, this is going to be exceedingly hard to prove in the absence of a pattern and practice in multiple cases that couldn't be a coincidence, or with something like bragging to a friend in private.\n\nIf this happens at a festival celebration, or after a dinner date, or intent is corroborated by perverted photographs on the defendant's phone, or is accompanied by sexual language, any other intent is going to be highly implausible and circumstantial evidence will strongly point to a sexual intent.\n\nOne way to disprove sexual intent is for the defendant to testify that there was some other intent. There is risk in that approach. You can't simultaneously testify that sexual contact never happened and that sexual contact did happen but without sexual intent, for example. Testifying that there was sexual contact without intent basically admits some other element of the crime. But it also forces the prosecution to prove that the defendant is lying, which depending upon the evidence, may be easy, or may be hard.\n\nIn real life, most of the cases that get prosecuted are easy cases. But, there will always be cases that are closer and circumstances that one wouldn't easily foresee in advance, and that is why we have courts and trials.\n\nUltimately, the prosecution presents evidence and the finder of fact has to decide if it proved that element of its case.",

Unless there's a pattern of misconduct or other corroborating evidence, it would be extremely difficult to prove sexual intent in this professional setting.\n\nC) Explicit photos of the victim on the accused's phone would serve as strong circumstantial evidence of sexual intent, making this scenario relatively easy for the prosecution to prove.\n\nD) Overheard lewd comments would provide direct evidence of the accused's state of mind and sexual interest in the victim, making it easier to establish sexual intent for subsequent physical contact.\n\nThe gynecological exam scenario (B) presents the most significant challenge for proving sexual intent due to the professional context and the legitimate reason for physical contact, absent other incriminating evidence."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My parents and I live in Suffolk County, New York.\n\nIn January 2017 my father's friend began living with us. During this time, my father's friend was arrested and convicted of animal neglect and abuse.\n\nI believe this man is currently on probation. I have not looked up his probation officer.\n\nMy mother and I have expressed both to my father and to this man that we do not want him to live with us.\n\nMy father does not put pressure on this man to leave and the man refuses to leave.\n\nThere have been numerous verbal fights and altercations between this man, my mother, and me. I believe my mother's name is on the title of the house that he refuses to leave and her name is on the title of the car that he uses without her consent.\n\nI want to know if I can contact this man's probation officer. Are there grounds for me to do this? I understand this man is not committing crimes per se but he is not living in good conditions, he is living at our home against half the home's will, and he is not taking steps to improve his life or stay out of trouble in the future. Would a probation officer in Suffolk County, New York investigate his living situation? I understand a probation officer is not a social worker.\n\nDo I have valid grounds to contact the probation officer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: May you contact his probation officer? Yes, the First Amendment protects your right to contact the government to complain about your grievances, even if the government cannot or will not resolve them.\n\nShould you contact his probation officer? You should ask a lawyer. It sounds like you and your mother may have assaulted the guy, so inviting law enforcement into this relationship could be stickier than you're thinking.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a situation where an unwanted guest is living in a home against the wishes of some family members, which of the following actions is legally permissible but potentially risky?\n\nA) Forcibly removing the guest from the property\nB) Changing the locks without notice to prevent the guest's re-entry\nC) Contacting the guest's probation officer to report the living situation\nD) Withholding utilities from the guest to encourage them to leave\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Contacting the guest's probation officer is legally permissible under the First Amendment, which protects the right to contact the government with grievances. However, this action could be risky for several reasons:\n\n1. It may not resolve the situation, as the probation officer's role is limited and they are not social workers.\n2. It could escalate tensions in the household.\n3. If there have been verbal fights or altercations, involving law enforcement could lead to unintended consequences for all parties involved.\n4. It might not address the underlying legal issues of tenancy and property rights.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are likely illegal and could result in legal troubles for the homeowners. Option C, while legal, requires careful consideration of potential outcomes and should ideally be discussed with a lawyer before proceeding."

Which of the following statements is correct regarding GDPR compliance?\n\nA) This technique is fully GDPR-compliant because it doesn't store actual user data on the server.\n\nB) The resulting hash is not considered personal data under GDPR since it's anonymized.\n\nC) This approach exempts the website from GDPR requirements as it uses cryptographic hashing.\n\nD) The hash is still considered personal data and subject to GDPR regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the technique uses hashing to avoid storing actual attribute values, the resulting hash still serves as an identifier linked to a specific computer and, by extension, its owner. Under GDPR, this hash is considered personal data because it can be used to identify an individual or their device. Therefore, all GDPR requirements still apply, including having a valid legal basis for collection, ensuring data security, allowing for deletion requests, and limiting retention periods. The use of hashing does not exempt the website from GDPR compliance obligations."
