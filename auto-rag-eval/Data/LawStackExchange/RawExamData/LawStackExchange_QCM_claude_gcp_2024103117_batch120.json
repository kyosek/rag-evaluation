I expect it to arrive before November 3rd and I am excited to wear it at the polling place. I am, however, not certain if this is permitted under the law. I checked on the Electoral Judge's manual for clarification and I found this:\n\n> Electioneering is defined as working for, against, or in the interest of a candidate, party, or proposition.\n> Electioneering is not allowed in the polling place or within the campaign free zone (a distance of within 100 horizontal feet of the room). No one is permitted to wear a campaign button, display political literature, or engage in any political discussion within the restricted area.\n\nSo I interpret this as putting me in the clear. The pin is unrelated to a candidate, party, or any proposition on my region's ballots.\nI wanted a concrete illustration of the law so I did a search and found within the [Illinois Compiled Statutes: 10 ILCS 5/7\\-41 (c)](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=001000050K7-41)\n\n> No person shall do any electioneering or soliciting of votes on primary day within any polling place or within one hundred feet of any polling place, or, at the option of a church or private school, on any of the property of that church or private school that is a polling place. Election officers shall place 2 or more cones, small United States national flags, or some other marker a distance of 100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the room used by voters to engage in voting, which shall be known as the polling room. \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> \\[\u2026] This subsection shall be construed liberally in favor of persons engaging in electioneering on all polling place property beyond the campaign free zone for the time that the polls are open on an election day.\n\nIt's striking that *electioneering* isn't defined within the section, so I reviewed 10 ILCS 5/0\\.01 et seq. and found section 5/7\\-4\\. Definitions does not provide clarification about *electioneering.*\nOkay, maybe it\u2019s a common sense term. I checked Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 5th ed. and also found no definition of *electioneering.*\n\nWell maybe there's relevant case law? I reviewed West's Smith\\-Hurd ILCS Annotated and found there were no reported cases related to 10 ILCS 5/0\\.01 et seq.\n\nLast I checked West's IL Digest and found no relevant case law. There were surprisingly only 5 cases related to elections, none of which had anything to do with electioneering.\n\nSo I imagine if a judge were to make a determination about whether displaying this pin within a polling place is electioneering, they would have to refer to a dictionary definition. From Webster's:\n\n> electioneer verb   \n> \n> elec\u00b7\u200btion\u00b7\u200beer \\| \\\\ i\\-\u02cclek\\-sh\u0259\\-\u02c8nir \\\\   \n> \n> electioneered; electioneering; electioneers   \n> \n>   \n> \n> Definition of electioneer   \n> \n> intransitive verb   \n> \n> : to take an active part in an election   \n> \n> specifically : to work for the election of a candidate or party\n\nWell this is incredibly unhelpful! While this pin is not working for the election of a candidate or party, my very presence in the polling place is taking an active part in an election.\n\nSo in summary, would displaying this pin in a polling place be considered unlawful electioneering?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A poll worker [was fired](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/20/us/poll-worker-fired-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html) for making people turn a Black Lives Matter T\\-shirt inside out before voting.

Based on the provided information and similar cases in other states, wearing an ACLU pin that says \"Let People Vote\" would likely be considered legal in Illinois polling places. The pin does not endorse a specific candidate, political party, or ballot measure, which are the typical criteria for prohibited electioneering materials. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the ban is not on all political expression, but specifically on electioneering related to candidates, parties, or propositions on the ballot.\n\nAnswer C, while tempting due to the vague definition of electioneering in Illinois law, is not the most accurate. The precedent from other states and the specific language in Illinois law about candidates, parties, and propositions suggest that this type of general civic message would be permissible.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because if the pin is legal to wear, there would be no requirement to cover it up inside the polling place.\n\nThis question tests understanding of election laws, interpretation of legal language, and application of precedents from similar situations."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65368/can-legal-actions-be-taken-against-an-app-developer-if-his-her-app-fails-due-to", "docs_id": 65368, "title": "Can legal actions be taken against an app developer if his/her app fails due to technical faults?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example, a developer has developed an app that shares the location of the user to the saved contacts during an emergency on the press of a button.

To protect themselves from potential liability, developers should include appropriate disclaimers and limitations on liability in their app's terms of service. This approach acknowledges that while the developer has created the app in good faith, there may be circumstances beyond their control (such as network issues) that could cause the app to fail. By clearly stating that the app is provided \"as is\" without any warranty, and limiting liability for any damages resulting from its use or failure, the developer can significantly reduce their legal exposure. This practice is common in software licensing, as demonstrated by the example of the LibreOffice license.

According to the information provided, copyright protects not only exact copies but also \"derivative works.\" Even if the symbols on the custom tokens are slightly different from the original game's symbols, they would still likely be considered derivative works.

The Apache license definition states that a derivative work is based on or derived from the original work, with modifications representing an original work of authorship. This implies that any significant modification to the software would result in a derivative work. The distinction between modification and creating a derivative work is minimal in software, as most modifications that go beyond simple API calls or linking would be considered creating a derivative work.

Are there assistants typing up each person's notes and sending them to the other eight Justices?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Justices communicate by exchanging written memoranda, or at least they did during Justice Stevens\u2019 time. See Jeffrey Toobin, [*The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_(book)) (2007\\), p 48:\n\n> Outsiders tend to be surprised by how rarely Supreme Court justices speak to each other, one on one. Under Rehnquist, the nine spent a good deal of time together as a group. Argument days, most Mondays and Wednesdays when they were in session, were preceded by the traditional thirty\\-six handshakes, each justice with every other, and they had lunch together most of these days as well. There were also conference discussions every Friday during these weeks. **After the conference, however, the justices tended to communicate with one another through memos, which were often drafted by their law clerks.** (After e\\-mail became ubiquitous, the memos also circulated electronically, but always with paper copies as well; among the justices, only Thomas and Breyer, and eventually Stevens, were fully comfortable communicating by e\\-mail.)\n\nSome further detail about the distribution of these memos appears later in an anecdote about *Bush v. Gore* (p 170\\):\n\n> Stevens drafted an order of just a few sentences remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court for the setting of a statewide standard to continue the recount. He sent his messenger scurrying down the marble hallway to Kennedy and the rest of the justices. He heard nothing back, except from Ginsburg, who said she would join if it was a way of bringing the whole Court together. (The rush of events in Bush v. Gore strained the Court's technology, which was, in 2000, still rather primitive. As a security precaution, the e\\-mail system circulated only within the building. Plus, there was only a single, communal computer from which the justices and clerks could obtain access to the Internet.

If the CEO was aware of the company's insolvency when taking on the contractor's services, they could face prosecution for insolvent trading. \n\nOption A is incorrect because lying alone does not constitute fraud, and personal liability is not automatically established. Option B is inaccurate because preferential payments are difficult to enforce, especially for unsecured creditors.

Also, there isn't enough information available to us about your relationship with Block.\n\nPresumably, you have some kind of client agreement with the company, which will say things about what they will and can do, and likewise for you. That agreement will be the primary source of privacy\\-related restrictions on what they can do w.r.t. you. If \"you\" (the account holder) are defined as being you and your ex\\-wife, then they cannot deprive your wife of her contractual right to access to information. It does not matter that you are now divorced: what matters is what is in the agreement. It is highly likely that her access to this information is based on her being a party to the contract. There is a tiny chance that this is due to a screw\\-up on their part, such as them typing in the wrong ssn when modifying an account or creating a new account.\n\nThe document you link to regarding privacy policies is just one of many \u2013 they provide 4 other links applicable to other client relations. That document tells you what information they collect, there they get it from, what they do with it and who they share with. For example they say they do not sell your information.

We may share your information to support the\n>  products and services you request or provide you information on\n>  products and services that may benefit you. We may also share your\n>  information as permitted by law or with your additional consent.\n\nThis does not preclude freely sharing information in a way that is allowed by law. [26 USC\u202f6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) is relevant law. The general rule is that returns are confidential and cannot be disclosed if obtained by certain people in connection with service as an employee acording to provisions of that section. In particular,\n\n> (3\\) no other person (or officer or employee thereof) who has or had\n>  access to returns or return information under subsection\n>  (e)(1\\)(D)(iii), subsection (k)(10\\), paragraph (6\\), (10\\), (12\\), (16\\),\n>  (19\\), (20\\), or (21\\) of subsection (l), paragraph (2\\) or (4\\)(B) of\n>  subsection (m), or subsection (n),\n\nSection (e) is about permitted disclosures to persons having material interest. That section starts by saying that that is \n\n> (A) in the case of the return of an individual...(ii) the spouse of\n>  that individual if the individual and such spouse have signified their\n>  consent to consider a gift reported on such return as made one\\-half by\n>  him and one\\-half by the spouse pursuant to the provisions of section\n>  2513\n\nThus they are allowed to disclose your return to your wife. It does not matter whether you file jointly or separately. What *does* matter is whether she is your spouse.\n\nIf they disclosed a return for a tax year where you were not married (and she had none of the other listed interests), that might be a violation of the law. For the most part, this law restricts government disclosure of tax returns, but there is that clause applicable to *all* employees. Your attorney would then scrutinize that extremely long section to see whether such a disclosure is illegal, and whether there is some escape from liability if you fail to notify the company that X is no longer your spouse.\n\nYou need an attorney to solve your problem.

If no other legal basis allows the processing, you need to acquire consent. Consent must be *freely given*. If something is gated behind consent without that consent being really necessary, this might coerce users and they would not be able to consent freely. The GDPR does not have a hard ban on this, but it explicitly calls out that this case must be considered when determining whether consent is valid.\n\nSo what your company is trying to do is in a dark grey area. Not necessarily wrong, but likely so.\n\nConsent could be made free if users have an actual choice. For example, some online newspaper sites had success with a \u201cpay or consent\u201d wall. (Success in the sense that some data protection authorities allowed this). In your case, this could mean that users either consent to extra data collection, or that they buy some reasonably priced premium mode.\n\nBut none of this is for you to decide. You can voice your doubts that the software would be compliant. You could also ask if the Data Protection Impact Assessment document for this proposed processing is available (creating such an assessment is likely mandatory in this case).

The protected classes under federal law include sex, race, age, disability, color, creed, national origin, religion, and genetic information. Occupation, including being a firefighter, is not included in this list of protected classes. Therefore, refusing service based solely on someone's occupation is not illegal under federal law. \n\nOption A is incorrect because firefighters (or any occupation) are not a federally protected class. Option C is wrong because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not cover all forms of employment-based discrimination, only those related to the protected classes it specifies. Option D, while acknowledging that states can add protected classes, implies that occupation is commonly added as a protected class by states, which is not typically the case.

To sum it up, a teacher fed a dying puppy to a snapping turtle and was charged with animal cruelty.\n\nPersonally, I would never feed a dog to a turtle, as I consider it morally wrong. However, I started thinking, why is it illegal?\n\nPet shops sell live animals for the purpose of feeding other animals.\n\nI have had many pets in my life and fed them live food. I have fed live shrimp to fish. I gave live fish to my snakes. I fed live insects to lizards. I gave rats and mice to my python. None of these are considered animal cruelty.\n\nSo what makes feeding a dying dog to a turtle less legal than feeding a perfectly healthy rat to a snake? Both animals can be pets, so why is one animal cruelty and the other perfectly acceptable? The only thing I can think of is that Americans consider dogs to be cuter than rodents.\n\nIs this a law due to common morality? Or is there some other legal reason?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, the law is not based on the species, it is based on the use of the animal. This gives rise to the difference between food rabbits and pet rabbits, and so on. The definition or applicable offenses are spelled out in each state's criminal code. In Washington, Chapter [9\\.08 RCW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.08&full=true) covers \"Crimes relating to animals\", and [16\\.52 RCW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true) covers \"prevention of cruelty to animals\". 9\\.08\\.065 defines a \"pet animal\" as\n\n> a tamed or domesticated animal legally retained by a person and kept\n>  as a companion. \"Pet animal\" does not include livestock raised for\n>  commercial purposes\n\nand then makes it a crime to steal a pet animal (this is in addition to regular laws against theft that applies to any property). So if you steal someone's pet goat, that's two or more crimes, but if you steal a meat goat, that's one less crime.\n\nThe main anti\\-cruelty laws are in [16\\.52](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true). Distinctions may be made between between domestic animals and generic animals, or between livestock and others, or food animals and others, so it just depends on the action being forbidden. RCW 16\\.52\\.205 says you commit first degree animal cruelty if you\n\n> intentionally (a) inflicts substantial pain on, (b) causes physical\n>  injury to, or (c) kills an animal by a means causing undue suffering\n>  or while manifesting an extreme indifference to life, or forces a\n>  minor to inflict unnecessary pain, injury, or death on an animal.\n\nThere is no other provision allowing you to torture any animal, not even a backyard rat. It is generally illegal to poison animals, but RCW 16\\.52\\.190 allows euthanizing by poison, or pest\\-eradication by poison (insects are animals too). Thus it is legal to poison a pest rat but illegal to poison a pet rat. There is also a general exception, in 16\\.52\\.180, that\n\n> No part of this chapter shall be deemed to interfere with any of the\n>  laws of this state known as the \"game laws,\" nor be deemed to\n>  interfere with the right to destroy any venomous reptile or any known\n>  as dangerous to life, limb or property, or to interfere with the right\n>  to kill animals to be used for food or with any properly conducted\n>  scientific experiments or investigations, which experiments or\n>  investigations shall be performed only under the authority of the\n>  faculty of some regularly incorporated college or university of the\n>  state of Washington or a research facility registered with the United\n>  States department of agriculture and regulated by 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2131\n>  et seq.\n\nThis allows you to kill chickens for food, and might be construed as allowing you to feed rats to your snake (the law does not say \"used as food for humans\"). The definition of 1st degree cruelty also has an exception that \"Nothing in this section may be considered to prohibit accepted animal husbandry practices\" (however, keeping an animal as a pet or educational object does not constitute \"animal husbandry\" in the ordinary meaning of words). There is no clear statutory division in Washington between feeding rats to reptiles, and feeding dogs to reptiles, and if you were to feed kittens to your monitor lizard, you might well get arrested.\n\nIdaho [animal cruelty law](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3504/) also forbids cruelty to any animal:\n\n> Every person who is cruel to any animal, or who causes or procures any\n>  animal to be cruelly treated, or who, having the charge or custody of\n>  any animal either as owner or otherwise, subjects any animal to\n>  cruelty shall, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with section\n>  25\\-3520A, Idaho Code.\n\nand cruel(ty) is\n\n> (a) The intentional and malicious infliction of pain, physical\n>  suffering, injury or death upon an animal; (b) To maliciously kill,\n>  maim, wound, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, drink or\n>  shelter, cruelly beat, mutilate or cruelly kill an animal; (c) To\n>  subject an animal to needless suffering or inflict unnecessary\n>  cruelty; (d) To knowingly abandon an animal; (e) To negligently\n>  confine an animal in unsanitary conditions or to negligently house an\n>  animal in inadequate facilities; to negligently fail to provide\n>  sustenance, water or shelter to an animal.\n\nAgain, feeding a rat to a snake is not intrinsically malicious, nor is feeding a puppy to a turtle intrinsically malicious. A distinction *can* be made under the related law on [torturing a companion animal](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3504A/) (an extension of the original anti\\-cruelty law):\n\n> A person is guilty of the offense of torturing a companion animal if\n>  he tortures a companion animal as defined in this chapter.\n\nwhere \"companion animal\" is defined as \n\n> those animals solely kept as pets and not used as production animals,\n>  as defined in this section, including, but not limited to, domestic\n>  dogs, domestic cats, rabbits, companion birds, and other animals.\n\nThis gives a basis for distinguishing feeder rats from feeder puppies.\nTorture is then defined as\n\n> the intentional, knowing and willful infliction of unjustifiable and\n>  extreme or prolonged pain, mutilation or maiming done for the purpose\n>  of causing suffering. \"Torture\" shall not mean or include acts of\n>  omission or of neglect nor acts committed unintentionally or by\n>  accident. \"Torture\" also shall not mean or include normal or legal\n>  practices as provided in section [25\\-3514](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3514/), Idaho Code.\n\nAnd thus it is not clear that feeding an animal to a turtle counts, since the purpose is to feed the turtle, not to cause suffering. The exceptions spelled out in 25\\-3514 might be applicable, but there are not *clearly* applicable. One exception is \"The humane slaughter of any animal normally and commonly raised as food, for production of fiber or equines\" \u2013 perhaps using an animal as feed for another animal can be \"humane slaughter\", perhaps rats are \"normally and commonly\" raised as food, unlike dogs.\n\nIt is not currently against federal law to slaughter cats and dogs for meat, but there is a [bill in Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1406?r=1) which would make it so.

The board receives the hearing officer's report and denies the applicant again, without giving any reason.\n\nAssuming all of the above is permitted by statute, does anybody see a due process problem?

One source of law is the constitution (state or US). A second is a statute. A third is regulations that are statutorily authorized. A fourth is case law. If you don't follow the law, you have a due process problem. The government has to follow fair legal procedures in depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. If it doesn't, you have a procedural due process problem, and that could figure into a lawsuit (then the courts will decide if your claim is correct). [Here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process) is a bit of a guide.\n\nThe facts as stated to not show that the required fundamental fairness was omitted or that the law was not followed. If the law obligates the board to accept the judgment of an external reviewer, then there has been a violation of due process \u2013 there is no chance that there is any such requirement. If the board is legally required to state a reason for denying an appeal and they fail to do so, then they have not followed the law.\n\nThere is also \"substantive due process\", which involves fundamental rights. The right to ply your trade is a fundamental right \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\", but the Commerce Clause (in your favorite state) also gives the government the right to regulate businesses, so there is a balancing act that has to be performed. In this case, a board cannot just say \"we don't want this guy working in our state because we don't like his face\", so they would have to have a reason to deny the person a license. It might take a lawsuit to get them to reveal that reason, and the lawsuit would resolve the question of whether the government followed the law.\n\n[This article](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2346/73994/13_7TexTechAdminLJ205%282006%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) touches on Due Process concerns w.r.t. occupational licensing in Texas, and [Patel v. Texas](https://cases.justia.com/texas/supreme-court/2015-12-0657.pdf?ts=1435327444) is a Texas case where the court found that a requirement imposed on persons to receive a license to pursue their trade was unconstitutional on the state equivalent of the Due Process Clause (a substantive due process issue). [Here is a page](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/proceduraldueprocess.html) on procedural due process, with various court citations, such as [Mackey v. Montrym](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/Mackey.html), 443 U.S. 1 where the fundamental issue was failure to have a process (a license was suspended without a hearing).

The applicant appeals through the proper channels, and a hearing officer (not a board member) recommends licensure after a thorough review. The board then denies the application again without providing a reason. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential due process issues?\n\nA) This scenario definitely violates due process, as the board must accept the hearing officer's recommendation.\n\nB) There is no due process issue as long as the board's actions are permitted by state statute.\n\nC) A potential due process issue exists, but would require further investigation into specific state laws, regulations, and possibly a lawsuit to determine if the board's actions were lawful.\n\nD) Due process is not relevant in occupational licensing decisions, as these are purely administrative matters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate response. While the scenario raises potential due process concerns, determining whether a violation occurred requires a deeper examination of several factors:\n\n1. Specific state laws and regulations governing the licensing board's procedures\n2. Whether the board is legally obligated to provide reasons for denial\n3. The extent of the board's discretion in accepting or rejecting hearing officer recommendations\n4. Possible substantive due process issues related to the fundamental right to pursue an occupation\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's typically no absolute requirement for a board to accept a hearing officer's recommendation. Option B oversimplifies the issue, as due process involves more than just statutory compliance. Option D is incorrect, as due process is indeed relevant to occupational licensing decisions, which involve government regulation of an individual's right to pursue their chosen profession."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11626/is-it-legal-to-hack-my-wifi-hotspots-password", "docs_id": 11626, "title": "Is it legal to hack my wifi hotspot&#39;s password?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm gonna explain it exactly: Parents divorced, I have a laptop from mom, and a smartphone from my father (with subscription contract), with internet access, and hotspot capable.

Turns out, cell phones and home computers affect interstate commerce. So the forbidden acts are delimited by expressions like \"having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access\", \"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access\" or \"knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value\". Notice that the law is stated in terms of authorization to access, and not \"cracking passwords\". Similarly, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701) uses phrases like \"accesses without authorization\". Each state has its own laws: in Washington, [RCW 9A.52\\.110\\-130](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.52.110) identifies forbidden acts via phrases like \"without authorization, intentionally gains access\".\n\nThe closest I can find that comes to a law that might imaginably have some bearing on \"password cracking\" is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1029](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1029) which prohibits uses of \"counterfeit access devices\". An \"access device\" is defined in para (e) as \"any ...means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money...\" (there is the usual attempt at an exhaustive listing behind the ellipses). A password cracker would then be an access device since it along with a user interface to a system allows one to access the system and thus the internet of things. A counterfeit password cracker would be e.g. one manufactured by BlackhatHackersoft which passes itself off as one manufactured by WhitehatHackersoft.\n\nHowever: 18 USC 1029 specifically says \"knowingly *and with intent to defraud* produces, uses, or traffics in one or more counterfeit access devices\", and the intent that you describe is *not* to defraud. If you want a paid analysis by a professional, you can hire an attorney. My view is that if the police were to come after you, that would be an abuse of law, because the law does not prohibit taking reasonable steps to select a safe password (something like \"CorrectHorseBatteryStaple\", which I hear is now just behind \"password\" in use as a password).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to US federal law, which of the following actions would most likely be considered illegal when attempting to test the security of a personal device?\n\nA) Using a password cracking tool to test the strength of your own WiFi password\nB) Accessing your father's phone without permission to test its security\nC) Using a counterfeit password cracking software to test your own device's security, without intent to defraud\nD) Testing the security of your mother's laptop with her explicit permission\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is likely legal as you are testing your own device's security without unauthorized access.\nB) is correct as it involves accessing a device without authorization, which is explicitly forbidden under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030 and similar state laws.\nC) While using counterfeit software could potentially violate 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1029, the lack of intent to defraud makes this less likely to be prosecuted.\nD) is legal as you have explicit permission from the device owner.\n\nThe key factor in determining illegality is unauthorized access, not the act of password cracking itself.

Carrots are only subject to ordinary food safety regulations in the US, and the outcome would not change by substituting broccoli, mustard, filet mignon, or \"lots of water\". Drugs that are introduced on the market have to be approved by the FDA, but legacy foods do not. We are in the realm that requires no FDA approval of carrots. The line, for product\\-purveyors, is drawn by [21 USC 321(g)(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/321), and [here](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/santhigram-kerala-ayurvedic-co-us-inc-625892-05192022) is an FDA warning letter to an Ayurvedic medical treatment maker / seller.\n\nThere are ample law concerning \"practice of medicine\", and there is the First Amendment which erects a strong barrier against laws which aim to prohibit people from disseminating an officially\\-unapproved viewpoint (to simplify matters, I presume \u2013 contrary to fact \u2013 that no medical authority has endorsed the specific efficacy of carrots). The government cannot punish you for taking approach A or B.\n\nIf you have a license to practice medicine (of the relevant kind), you may be subject to state licensing\\-board sanctions for making unapproved claims (one of the factors that overrides the First Amendment). If you have no license, then the question is whether your activity falls within the realm of \"practicing medicine\" in the state. In Washington, the line is drawn via [RCW 18\\.71\\.011](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=18.71.011)\n\n> A person is practicing medicine if he or she does one or more of the\n> following: (1\\) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise, or\n> prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,\n> deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or\n> imaginary, by any means or instrumentality...\n\nTechnically, you cannot advise a person to take an aspirin if they have a headache. However, this law is within the scope of business regulations, so part of the line not directly encoded in that definition (related to the requirement to have a license) is that you are doing this as a business.\n\nA person must have a state license in Washington to be a \"common school\" (K\\-12\\) teacher. Your gym teacher can tell you to eat carrots to cure your depression or whatever, and there is some (miniscule) chance that the teacher will get punished for giving such advice. A person does not have to have a license to be a university professor, therefore telling a student to eat carrots will lead to no government sanctions, though the employer may fire or reassign you, depending on circumstances. The crucial question is not whether you are advocating eating carrots, but what business you are engaged in, whereby in the course of that business you give advice.

The lease specifically mentions both \"animals\" and \"reptiles\" to avoid potential disputes arising from different definitions of the word \"animal\". As explained in the documentation, the term \"animal\" can have multiple definitions. One common definition refers specifically to mammals, which would exclude reptiles. By mentioning both \"animals\" and \"reptiles\", the lease ensures that there's no ambiguity or room for interpretation regarding which creatures are prohibited, regardless of which definition of \"animal\" one might use.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the clause does prohibit all living creatures, the specific mention of reptiles serves a more nuanced purpose than mere emphasis.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because reptiles are indeed considered animals in both scientific and most legal contexts. The issue is with the potential for multiple interpretations of the word \"animal\", not a legal exclusion of reptiles from the animal kingdom.\n\nAnswer D, while plausible, is not the primary reason for this wording. The distinction between cold-blooded and warm-blooded creatures is not typically a consideration in lease agreements.

Therefore it is not possible to give an absolute yes/no as to whether masking text with asterisks is or is not lawful.\n\nWe can gain a deeper insight by looking at the GDPR itself. Firstly, the definition of **processing** (Art. 4 lit. 2\\):\n\n> any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction\n\nAs [mentioned by amon](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46652/hiding-order-invoice-information-gdpr#comment89702_46652), the principles relating to processing of personal data (Art. 5\\) are highly relevant, insofar as the activity constitutes processing. In particular, **purpose limitation**:\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\n\n...and **data minimisation**:\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed\n\nI would argue that **making available** the personal data on an invoice is processing. There are two separate operations:\n\n1. Making the data available to authenticated users; and\n2. Making the data available to non\\-authenticated users\n\nThe purpose of making it available to authenticated users may be different to the purpose of making it available to non\\-authenticated users. Again acknowledging [amon](http://amon), the necessity of making the data available to non\\-authenticated users must be examined, as too must the means by which a non\\-authenticated user gains access to an invoice: are they using a URL that contains a token of some kind? Is this unique in some way? It could be that the presentation of a token itself constitutes authentication and thus authorisation to view the entire invoice, in which case further redaction may not be necessary if there is a clear necessity to disclose the entire contents to such a user. Whether the token expires or is limited to a certain referrer would be part of complying with the **integrity and confidentiality** principle and Art. 32 (Security of processing) by implementation of technical measures.\n\nWhen considering pseudonymisation and anonymisation, you will note that the redaction of name and address data from a certain view of the invoice, while nevertheless displaying the invoice number, constitutes pseudonymisation, since it would be possible with unfettered access to the remaining data, to determine the name and address from the invoice number, but not for the non\\-authenticated user whose view is redacted. In such a case, I fail to see how or why the replacement of a string with the same number of asterisks, or starting with the real character is secure or even practical, when the entire field could simply be replaced with a fixed\\-width string of asterisks or other filler, thus providing the user with no right or necessity to view the personal data with no further insight into what the personal data may or may not be.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under GDPR, when displaying partially redacted personal information from an invoice to non-authenticated users, which of the following approaches is most aligned with data protection principles?\n\nA) Replacing each character of sensitive data with an asterisk, maintaining the exact length of the original information (e.g., \"John Doe\" becomes \"****  ***\")\n\nB) Showing the first character of each field followed by asterisks (e.g., \"John Doe\" becomes \"J*** D**\")\n\nC) Replacing entire sensitive fields with a fixed-width string of asterisks, regardless of the original data length\n\nD) Displaying the full invoice information, including all personal data, as long as a unique URL is used to access it\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most aligned with GDPR principles. Replacing entire sensitive fields with a fixed-width string of asterisks, regardless of the original data length, provides the best balance between data minimization and purpose limitation. This approach:\n\n1. Doesn't reveal any part of the personal data, unlike options A and B.\n2. Doesn't give insight into the length or structure of the original data, which could potentially be used to infer information.\n3. Limits the processing and display of personal data to what is necessary for non-authenticated users.\n4. Reduces the risk of re-identification compared to options A and B.\n\nOption A is problematic because it reveals the exact length of the data, which could aid in guessing or inference attacks. Option B is even more risky as it reveals part of the actual data. Option D violates the principle of data minimization by displaying full personal data to non-authenticated users without a clear necessity.\n\nThe correct approach balances the need to indicate that certain information exists (by using asterisks) while not revealing any part of the actual personal data, thus better adhering to GDPR principles of data protection and minimization."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/10775/in-english-law-who-or-what-body-starts-the-process-of-creating-a-new-statute", "docs_id": 10775, "title": "In English law, who or what body starts the process of creating a new statute?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Statutes are legislation from the UK Parliament and devolved parliaments.

For example, you may prepare a suitable contract that you sign, or attain a suitable certification.\n\nNote that ChatGPT cannot give reasonable advice on these matters. While it may not be outright *wrong*, it is not\\-entirely\\-correct in subtle ways. For example, the PDPA does not require an adequate level of data protection by the recipient *country*, but that the importing *organizations* provide such guarantees.

According to Section 26 of Singapore's PDPA, organizations can transfer personal data outside Singapore if they ensure that the recipient provides a standard of protection comparable to the PDPA. This can be achieved through various means, including legally binding contracts that essentially translate PDPA requirements into contractual obligations. The answer doesn't depend on India's data protection laws (ruling out A), nor is it automatically allowed due to regional proximity (ruling out B).

Most obviously, they may threaten to fire employees who refuse, whether immediately or at the end of their current term, as another answer observes. Indeed, if Big Company makes an NC a condition of employment then they are likely to insist on the same for employees they obtain from Original Employer.\n\nFiring employees for refusing to sign does, of course, put them in the job market as potential competitors, but the company may well find it acceptable to do that on their own terms. In particular, Big Company can ensure that those who won't sign go out the door with minimal knowledge of Big Company's clients, trade secrets, etc. other than those obtained from Original Employer.\n\nAnd that leads into other forms of inducement.

BigCorp can also make signing the agreement a condition of continued employment, effectively giving employees the choice to sign or risk termination.

Where does it get the name?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Letters patent are instruments issued by the monarch to publicly grant some specific rights to some person(s) with the backing of the royal power. It is also where the word *patent* (in its intellectual property sense) comes from, since the monopoly of invention was only granted by the authority of the monarch via a letter patent.\n\nAnother use of the letters patent is to constituting certain offices, particular those exercising the royal power, for example, [the Governor General of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_Patent,_1947).\n\nUnder the British system, the courts are thought to be [the monarch exercising their power over the bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Bench).\n\nMany High Courts of India were constituted by the British monarch during the colonial rul. The British Parliament allows the monarch to issue letters patent for such purposes in the [1861 High Courts Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_High_Courts_Act_1861). Their jurisdictions were specified by letters patent.\n\nOne of such jurisdiction is the power for a High Court to hear appeals from the decisions of one of its justices.\n\nFor example, in [the letters patent establishing the High Court in Calcutta](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979dd64a93263ca60b74d6):\n\n> 14.

Option C is wrong because the SSA only applies to Steam users, not to everyone.

I don't mean off\\-brand clones of MagSafe itself, but rather another style of connector which uses the same principle.\n\nIf so, when does the patent expire?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The connector is patented, as you [see here](http://www.google.com/patents/US7311526). It contains 57 claims which define what is protected, and [35 USC 116](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/112) spells out the logic of claims (which, in a nutshell, says \"this can get really complicated\"). The set of claims defines what it patented, and infringement is defined in [35 USC 271](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271) as\n\n> whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any\n>  patented invention, within the United States or imports into the\n>  United States any patented invention during the term of the patent\n>  therefor, infringes the patent\n\nthat is, there isn't anything statutorily more specific about how similar similar is. Since the claims define what is protected, this generally is taken to refer to things that are the same w.r.t. to all of the claims. \"Generally\" means that there is a [doctrine of equivalents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_equivalents), exemplified by [Warner\\-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co. 520 U.S. 17](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/17/case.html), whereby a court may find infringement when there is an insubstantial difference between the allegedly infringing thing and the protected invention.\n\nThe Apple patent does not specify a specific number of millimeters between the contacts, so making a connector that is exactly the same as the Apple device (as marketed) but with different spacing on the connectors would be an infringement, because that spacing is not specified in a claim. A similar device that uses chewing gum rather than magnets to keep it together would not likely be found to be infringing since that is a substantial divergence from what Apple claims it has invented.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tech company, InnoTech, has developed a new power connector for laptops that uses a magnetic attachment mechanism similar to Apple's MagSafe.

Given Apple's patent on MagSafe, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding InnoTech's potential legal situation?\n\nA) InnoTech's connector is definitely not infringing on Apple's patent because it has a different shape and locking mechanism.\n\nB) InnoTech is likely infringing on Apple's patent because the use of magnets for easy detachment is a key feature of MagSafe.\n\nC) InnoTech's connector would only be considered infringing if it used the exact same spacing between contacts as Apple's MagSafe.\n\nD) The court would need to apply the doctrine of equivalents to determine if InnoTech's connector infringes on Apple's patent, considering whether the differences are substantial.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The doctrine of equivalents, as exemplified in Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., allows courts to find patent infringement even when the allegedly infringing product is not exactly the same as the patented invention. In this case, while InnoTech's connector has some differences from MagSafe, it still uses the core principle of magnetic attachment for easy detachment. A court would need to determine if these differences are substantial enough to avoid infringement or if they are insubstantial, making the product equivalent to what's described in Apple's patent claims. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because having some differences doesn't automatically mean there's no infringement. \nAnswer B overstates the case; similarity in one feature doesn't guarantee infringement. \nAnswer C is incorrect because the patent doesn't specify exact spacing, so different spacing alone wouldn't prevent infringement."}}
