Under which circumstances could TechNova potentially sue InnoTech for trademark infringement?\n\nA) TechNova can only sue InnoTech for infringement that occurred after September 1, 2023, when the trademark was officially registered.\n\nB) TechNova can sue InnoTech for infringement from March 1, 2023 onwards, as this was the date they filed for trademark registration.\n\nC) TechNova cannot sue InnoTech at all, as InnoTech stopped using the similar logo before the trademark was officially registered.\n\nD) TechNova can potentially sue InnoTech for infringement from January 1, 2023 onwards, as they began using the logo on that date, establishing common law trademark rights.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Trademark rights in the United States are established through use, not just registration. TechNova began using their logo on January 1, 2023, which established their common law trademark rights from that date. While registration provides additional benefits and nationwide protection, it is not necessary to have a registered trademark to sue for infringement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because trademark rights exist before official registration.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it assumes rights only begin at the filing date, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it wrongly assumes that only registered trademarks can be enforced.\n\nAnswer D is correct because it recognizes that trademark rights begin with use, allowing TechNova to potentially sue for infringement from the date they started using the logo, regardless of registration status.

This is not what's at question here. At question here is the arrangement in which public IPs are masked by presenting traffic to site operators as appearing to originate from the veneer IPs of the VPN operators.\n\nThis allows (for example) users in a country A to route their traffic through a commercial VPN operator in a country B and access services in country B which are restricted to users from country A. This can be used to subvert both intellectual property restrictions on traffic and legal restrictions that site operators attempt to enforce by geography\\-based restrictions.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem that it would not be impossible to track all veneer IPs and identify them as such publicly. So a knee\\-jerk response to this question might be \"there is no need for such a law.\" However, while it may be possible to track all IPs used by a commercial operator of a VPN which engages *exclusively* in VPN business, it is not possible to track all IPs dedicated to VPN business by an operator which has many other forms of business.\n\nSo, for example, NordVPN's IPs can be identified as belonging to NordVPN, but IBM's or Google's IPs cannot be identified as used exclusively in their VPN business.\n\nSince there is a public policy interest (mentioned in the 3rd paragraph of this question) in knowing which IPs are VPN veneer IPs, Congress may decide to require commercial VPN operators to register those veneer IPs in a way which would make them clearly distinguishable from non\\-veneer IPs used by the same entities.\n\nWould that be constitutional? More specifically, is there any case law which may be relevant to deciding whether this would be constitutional?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a law would be constitutional\n----------------------------------\n\nThe US Congress could decide to require VPN providers to register the IPs that they provide to VPN customers. The use of such techniques would almost surely be considered \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and so Congress would have power under the Commerce Clause of the constitution to legislate concerning it.\n\nThere would clearly be a rational basis for such a law \\-\\- the question outlines such a basis. This is not an area subject to strict scrutiny.

Whether Congress **will** act is speculation.

These bases now lie there, waiting for someone to discover them.\n\nMy question is: who becomes the owner of the ancient alien bases once they're are discovered? Is it the person or country that discovered them, the Antarctic Treaty signatories, or the aliens themselves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Antarctic Treaty doesn't establish ownership or sovereignty\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle IV of the [Antarctic Treaty](https://documents.ats.aq/ats/treaty_original.pdf) makes clear that the Treaty is *not* a renunciation by any contracting party of any basis of claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica. And \"\\[n]o acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica.\"\n\nSo, while the Antarctic Treaty establishes an arrangement for cooperative shared use of the areas, it is not about sovereignty or ownership.\n\nTerritorial claims\n------------------\n\nThere are (were) however [territorial claims to various areas of Antarctica](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/law-and-treaty/history/antarctic-territorial-claims/). These have not been resolved at international law.\n\nWho owns the centre of the earth?\n---------------------------------\n\nA traditional common\\-law property rule is that ownership extends to the center of the earth (see generally, John G. Sprankling, \"[Owning the Center of the Earth](https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/facultyarticles/131/)\"). Sprankling notes that this was never taken literally until after it was introduced by Blackstone and argues that its time is near an end. But in any case, I think the correct starting point is that the owner of the surface owns what's underneath, at least to an extent.\n\nWho owns the alien bases, and what would that mean?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nApplying Earth law, ownership of the alien bases would be disputed among those nations who are willing to assert territorial claims to the surface under which the alien bases are found. However, if these bases are cultural heritage property (which their age suggests they might be), the 1970 [UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property](https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural) could prevent the import, export, or transfer of any of the material from the bases. The \"owning\" country (if that is ever resolved) might have obligations under international law to preserve the bases. Further, if the dispute over the property results in armed conflict, the competing states could have obligations under the [1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict](https://en.unesco.org/protecting-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-convention) to avoid damaging the cultural property.\n\nIs Earth law the applicable law?\n--------------------------------\n\nIf we take this hypothetical at face value, it implies we are not alone and in relationship with other extra\\-terrestrial culture(s). If members of those cultures were to reach out, that should at least bring us to consider that our law is not supreme. Our law would need to coexist with other law; other law that potentially has very different conceptions of ownership and rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership of hypothetical ancient alien bases discovered in Antarctica?\n\nA) The Antarctic Treaty establishes clear ownership rights to any discoveries made on the continent.\n\nB) The person or country that discovers the bases would automatically become their legal owner.\n\nC) Ownership would likely be disputed among nations with territorial claims to the area where the bases are found.\n\nD) The aliens who originally built the bases would retain ownership rights under international law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that ownership of the alien bases would be disputed among nations willing to assert territorial claims to the surface under which the bases are found. This is because:\n\n1. The Antarctic Treaty does not establish ownership or sovereignty, nor does it resolve existing territorial claims.\n2.

Had the officer caught the unticketed driver, he would have ticketed him for the same offense. Courts would accept that it would be impossible for the officer to deal with both offenses at the same time.\n\nSelective enforcement is done properly when the prosecutor evaluates the risk verses reward of perusing a criminal prosecution against an individual based on the evidence, the nature of the crime, and the likely\\-hood of a conviction if it goes to trial. For example, while using illict substances is a crime, the government will usually only prosecute on that charge if they find your use while in possession with intent to sell (or in connection to another crime). In this instant, the high school stoner is not going to be as instrumental in the case as the dealer, who can lead to suppliers if he cooperates OR is removed from distributing in his territory if he does not.\n\nIf the stoner is picked up on a minor offense and carrying a small amount on his person, the police might arrest him for the crime but agree to not press charges if he gives them information to who the dealer who sold him the substance is. Again, the risk here is putting a small time criminal into jail at cost of society, when society would benefit more if that cell was housing the bigger fish (a criminal record can prevent getting certain jobs, which will more likely turn stoner high schooler into jobless loser, which would be a drain on public welfare in and of itself, and that's not including the possibility that joining in drug trafficking as a seller would fix his lack of income).\n\nConversely, in cases such as espionage, the death penalty is on the books but is rarely pursued in favor of lesser sentences. Here, the pay off is that they dangle the death penalty over the spies head unless he tells them about all his spying activities, which benefits the spy agency in filling in security gaps and potentially finding more spies.\n\nThe use of lighter charges in exchange for a guilty plea is also favored as trials are costly. If a criminal pleads guilty to a crime that the government has them dead to rights for, the prosecution will reward them with lighter offenses for saving their office the price tag of a full blown trial.\n\nAll this is on condition that selective enforcement is not used as a basis of discrimination, which is illegal for the prosecutors to do.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a legally acceptable form of selective enforcement in the criminal justice system?\n\nA) A prosecutor decides not to charge a wealthy businessman for tax evasion because he made a large donation to the prosecutor's re-election campaign.\n\nB) Police officers consistently ticket Asian drivers for speeding violations while ignoring similar infractions by drivers of other races.\n\nC) A district attorney chooses to pursue lesser charges against a low-level drug user in exchange for information about their supplier, as part of a strategy to target larger drug trafficking operations.\n\nD) A judge dismisses all jaywalking tickets issued in a month because some pedestrians were ticketed while others committing the same offense were not.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C represents a legally acceptable form of selective enforcement. The prosecutor is making a strategic decision based on the broader goal of targeting more significant criminal activities (drug trafficking) and using discretion to obtain valuable information. This aligns with the principle that prosecutors have broad discretion in deciding whom to prosecute and how to allocate resources effectively.\n\nOption A is an example of corruption and abuse of power, not legitimate selective enforcement. Option B describes racial profiling, which is a form of discrimination and is illegal.

Sometimes laws are enforced less harshly as a matter of law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial discretion against the rich, famous and powerful, than the poor, but they are **subject to the same laws** and the authorities have the same power to enforce those laws against a celebrity or other rich or powerful person, as they do against anyone else.\n\nMost criminal laws provide that factors such as whether someone is gainfully employed, whether they pay restitution for an offense, and whether someone has otherwise good character and be considered as grounds for leniency in sentencing someone for a crime of which that person is convicted, so that can systemically benefit such people at sentencing. \n\nAlso, the famous, rich and powerful may be seen as particularly credible in a trial by jurors.\n\nThey may be able to afford and support highly competent and exhaustively thorough legal representation, while the poor often get an overworked public defender with very little time or resources to devote to their case, or only a very inexpensive private criminal defense lawyer who similarly has limited resources and is rarely the most highly competent person in the field. \n\nSimilarly, the rich and famous can typically more easily be released on bail or on a personal recognizance bond pending trial, and being at large, rather than in jail, prior to being convicted, greatly reduces the pressure to plead guilty, the harm caused by the charge if there is an acquittal, and the ability of the defendant to mount a defense to a charge.\n\nBut, that doesn't change the fact that the same law applies to everyone, although this too has some bias inherent in it, as this famous aphorism illustrates:\n\n> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the\n>  poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal\n>  bread.\n\n\\-\\- Anatole France (16 April 1844 \u2013 12 October 1924\\), born Jacques Anatole Fran\u00e7ois Thibault, a French poet, journalist, and novelist, in *Le Lys Rouge* \\[The Red Lily] (1894\\), ch. 7 (In the original French, the quote is \"*La majestueuse \u00e9galit\u00e9 des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain.*\").\n\nAnatole France's point is true for somewhat deeper than the somewhat flip expression of the idea in this famous quotation suggests. \n\nAs a general rule, economic harms to others that people who cause them can usually remedy by actually being able to pay money as a result of a judgment in a civil lawsuit, are usually not defined as crimes.

After revocation, the (previous) patent holder is now in breach of their contract \\- they promised to licence a patent and they can't. This would allow the (previous) licensee to terminate the contract and/or sue for damages.\n\nAn invalid patent was never a patent and therefore never good consideration for a contract. If there was some other consideration alongside the patent, the contract would be valid and the licensor would have been in breach from the beginning \\- see above. If there was no other consideration, there never was a contract and there is no remedy in contract law for either party, that is, contract law cannot intervene so the status\\-quo remains. However, its possible the licensee could make a claim in equity on the basis of [unjust enrichment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unjust_enrichment). It's a 50\\-50 call whether such a claim would succeed because it's by no means obvious that the situation is unjust given the outcome if the patent was revoked rather than invalid.\n\nAs to refunds, at common law, you are only entitled to a refund if there is a [total failure of consideration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_of_consideration). So, for example, if you embark on a 10 day cruise and the ship sinks after 2 days, you might be (probably are) entitled to damages but you are not entitled to a refund because you got *some* of what you paid for.

Obviously even if it wasn't murder, it still warrants a 911 call because it was a death. The river however, is steadily moving the body away.\n\n**Can the fisherman move the body and avoid legal jeopardy because the intent was to preserve it as evidence?**\n\nYou can make other scenarios I'm sure, but I chose this one as an example. Basically, the concept here is that doing nothing will possibly result in the total destruction of the body/evidence.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In this specific scenario, not only is it not a crime, failure to do so is a breach of proper maritime protocols and could be illegal.\n\nA person manning a boat and sees a human in water in distress should immediately go to the rescue or recovery of the victim. This is commonly started by the crewman of the vessel who spots the body shouting \"Man overboard\" once... which triggers every crewman on the deck to also shout the same thing exactly once regardless of if they can see the man who is overboard (The idea is that the call is so all crew on the deck are not announcing the sighting but responding that they know there's an emergency situation in progress... and to muster to the appropriate situations). The boat's helmsman or pilot will then proceed to maneuver to recover the body in the water and bring it onboard the boat, (if traveling by sail, to then as soon as possible transfer to a motor powered vessel or to land which ever is quicker).\n\nAdditionally, should the boat have radio communication, the situation should trigger a mayday communication which will alert other vessels, regardless of purpose and local emergency services to the situation, with GPS tracking aiding all responders. Typically while underway at sea or in large bodies of water, all operators of watercraft are required to respond, regardless of actual purpose on the water (recall the famous \"Miracle on the Hudson\" incident where New York Ferry Operators were the actual first responders to get ALL passengers and crew off the crashed plane to land, where EMS and police services were waiting to deal with the survivors). Most boating licenses these days require a basic understanding of duties with maritime safety and if you come upon a situation while underway, you are a first responder automatically.\n\nRemove the question of water and say that there is person who you are unsure of if they are alive or dead on dry land. Under law, you cannot be held liable for anything you do in the course of saving a life so long as you are acting within your competency to do so, and do not take actions you are not licensed to do as part of training, oversight, and regulations dictate, you cannot be sued for medical injuries inflicted on someone in the course of saving their life (called \"Life over Limb\"... that if the only way to save an unconscious person from death is to amputate a limb, you're not liable for cutting off the limb in question, so long as you are trained to do this. To a lesser extreme example, if CPR is performed right, you will break the victims ribs... since it's a question of keeping the person alive, the temporary pain and handicap of broken ribs is seen as acceptable).\n\nAs a lifeguard (for pools, I wasn't certified for \"wilderness lifeguarding\" but the differences in this respect were minimum) your first thing to do when getting in the water to fish out a swimmer in distress was to get them back to the pool deck before life efforts could occur (there are a few times where you had to start the life saving efforts in water, but I can count them on one hand, and one of those incidents was only after confirming your victim was conscious and even then you still were moving to get them out of the water asap... it's just asap would be a little bit longer. We also weren't trained to pronounce death. If it was so serious that CPR starts, you do not stop unless another guard or EMS relieve you.).\n\nIn these situations, there is proper evidence gathering procedures that will be used to establish what happened. For example, the first responders will be fingerprinted and prints in the areas touched for life saving efforts will be noted as part of the evidence. Additionally, paramedics, EMS and first responders will often alert police to any items of note they saw around the victim that were disturbed in the process of life saving efforts. The police may collect evidence from you to rule you out as a suspect (by showing the evidence on the body was consistent with applied life saving techniques) and to identify evidence not related to you at all (a pink fiber on the body that doesn't match any of your clothes means the body came into contact with the fibers from another source).\n\nThis also establishes \"Chain of Custody\" when you call the body in and stay with it and allow minimum contact with it (many larger ships will store the body in a locked room to keep crew and passenger contact to a minimum). Either way, so long as you tell the police everything you did in rescue and recovery, this isn't tampering with evidence on the face of it. If something that is inconsistent with your story comes up, it's not necessarily incriminating either... in the heat of the moment in a rescue and recovery effort, tunnel vision can form and you aren't expect to recall everything you did. Police should know this and understand that you were cooperating in what for most of the world is an unusual situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A recreational boater discovers a floating human body in a river.

The boater should:\n\n1. Recover the body from the water, as failing to do so could be considered a breach of proper maritime protocols.\n2. Bring the body aboard the boat, which is standard procedure for \"man overboard\" situations, whether the person is alive or deceased.\n3.

Proceed to the nearest shore or transfer to a motor-powered vessel, whichever is quicker, to hand over the body to authorities.\n5. Maintain minimal contact with the body to preserve evidence, but the primary concern is recovery and reporting.\n\nThis approach balances the duty to recover a body or person in distress with the need to preserve evidence.

If you signed a contract with bank A with a certain interest rate, bank A can sell that contract to bank B, but neither A nor B can change the terms (e.g. increase the interest charge). There might be some sketchy clause in the contract that you did sign which they think allows that to change the terms unilaterally under some condition (e.g. \"we reserve the right to sell thig contract to a third parts who may increase the interest by X amount\"), but such a clause would most likely violate law recarding unlawful acts in car sales (example from [Washington state](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.70.180)).

There are no houses between my house and the neighbor's. Since only one or two vehicles go by during our walk, often none, we can hear any vehicles from about half a mile away. When we hear a vehicle approaching, we get the team as close to the side of the road as possible, and hold them still.

It would also be totally out of sync with any public understanding of \"titles of nobility\" at the time of the framing or today.\n\nThe US has conferred citizenship by parentage to children born abroad since 1790, which is further indication that the nobility clause was not understood to preclude citizenship by parentage.\n\nThe concern behind the nobility clauses was the creation of \"super\\-citizens.\" As [Joseph Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Story) wrote in his [*Commentaries on the Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States) at [Vol. 3, p. 215](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the/Am152G8mqiUC?hl=fr&gbpv=1&pg=PA215&printsec=frontcover):\n\n> \\[the nobility clause] seems scarcely to require even a passing notice. As a perfect equality is the basis of all our institutions, state and national, the prohibition against the creation of any titles of nobility seems proper, if not indespensible, to keep perpetually alive a just sense of this important truth. *Distinctions between citizens*, in regard to rank, would soon lay the foundation of odious claims and privileges, and silently subvert the spirit of independence and personal dignity, which are so often proclaimed to be the best security of a republican government.\n\nHe cited [Federalist No. 84](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493491), in which Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n> Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner\\-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.\n\nThe worry was that titles of nobility would undermine the republican system of government.\n\nI also question your premise that citizenship is \"clearly hereditary in the U.S.\" As you say, the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those merely born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction. For the vast majority of U.S. citizens, citizenship is based on their place of birth being in the U.S. Knowing that somebody is a citizen tells you nothing about their heritage.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why U.S. citizenship is not considered a title of nobility, despite its hereditary aspects?\n\nA) Citizenship is primarily based on birthplace rather than heredity, as established by the 14th Amendment.\n\nB) The U.S. Constitution explicitly allows for the granting of citizenship, making it incompatible with the concept of nobility.\n\nC) Citizenship has been conferred by parentage to children born abroad since 1790, predating concerns about nobility in the U.S.\n\nD) Citizenship does not create \"super-citizens\" or establish ranks among citizens, which was the primary concern behind nobility clauses.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The primary reason U.S. citizenship is not considered a title of nobility is that it does not create \"super-citizens\" or establish ranks among citizens, which was the main concern behind the nobility clauses in the Constitution. As explained by Joseph Story and Alexander Hamilton, the prohibition of titles of nobility was intended to prevent distinctions between citizens that could lead to claims of special privileges and undermine the republican system of government. Citizenship, while carrying certain rights and responsibilities, does not create a hierarchical system among citizens, which is the key distinction from titles of nobility.\n\nOption A is partially true but doesn't address the core issue of nobility. Option B, while factual, doesn't explain why citizenship differs from nobility.

At least not fully and not via a corporate structure.\n\nIt is fundamental that entities cannot change their liability to third parties without the consent of the third parties (subject to specific statutory exceptions like the priority afforded secured creditors vis\\-a\\-vis unsecured creditors, and the limited liability concept itself).\n\nSo, if a \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is negligent, nothing in your corporate structure can relieve that worker from liability. This is true without regard to whether the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is an employee or an independent contractor, although, in practice, it is less common to sue an employee than to sue an independent contractor. You can pay for construction defect liability insurance and comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance for them, but they can still be sued and will still have primarily liability.\n\nIn general, absent a direct contractual arrangement to the contrary, a \"mason\" will not have negligence liability for work done by a \"carpenter\" and vis\\-a\\-versa. \n\nOf course, it is often impossible to prevent both from being made parties to a lawsuit for defective work, because the question of whose work caused the problem is often a factual one that isn't clear until an exhaustive investigation by experts has been done. Often both will be sued at the outset and some who are determined to be not at fault or only minimally at fault will be dismissed voluntarily, or with token settlements, as investigations during the course of the litigation reveal who was really at fault.\n\nNow, if you have a contractual relationship with a third party, say the person who is hiring the general contractor, the contract between the person hiring the general contractor and the general contractor can contractually waive the liability of the general contractor and/or the liability of the subcontractor, for ordinary negligence (but not for intentional conduct of a subcontractor since such waivers are contrary to public policy), and can relieve the subcontractors of contractual liability to the person hiring the general contractor.\n\nThis is all a consequence of the contract between the general contractor and the person hiring the general contractor, however, and really has nothing to do with the corporate structure of the general contractor vis\\-a\\-vis the subcontractor.\n\nYou cannot limit the liability of the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" for harm to persons with whom there is no contractual relationship. For example, suppose that the mason negligently nicks a natural gas line causing an explosion that kills a dozen people who just work in the building and destroys the building. The individual mason and the individual mason's firm, will have liability to the people killed which could not have been limited contractually, although it could be insured against. This is true even if the mason's firm is incorporated, although, if the mason's firm is incorporated, only the person who actually did the work and the firm will have liability, not the co\\-workers of the person who did the work or passive investors in the firm.\n\nHowever, if the mason intentionally engaged in sabotage directed at the natural gas line, with an intent to harm the person who hired the general contractor or anyone else, any contractual waiver of liability in favor of the mason would be void and the mason's insurance policy would not cover the loss (and would not be allowed to cover the loss as a matter of public policy). On the other hand, if the victims of the sabotage had insurance to cover this kind of event, their insurance policies could cover their losses.\n\nIn the other direction, a pre\\-dispute waiver of a subcontractor's right to file a mechanic's lien against the person hiring the general contractor, is usually not permitted for any reason other than payments of the amounts owed to the subcontractor, as a matter of public policy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A general contractor, ABC Corp, wants to create a corporate structure that limits liability for its specialized trades (masonry, carpentry, etc.) while providing them with insurance and benefits.

While ABC Corp cannot create a corporate structure that completely shields its specialized trades from all liability, it can use contracts with clients to limit some liability. However, this limitation primarily affects contractual liability and ordinary negligence, not liability to third parties without a contractual relationship or cases of intentional misconduct. The corporate structure alone cannot prevent workers from being sued for their own negligence. Additionally, ABC Corp can provide insurance for its trades, but this doesn't eliminate liability - it only helps cover potential damages. Answers A and B are incorrect because they suggest a level of liability protection that is not legally possible.

The act could be elevated to a felony if it's determined that the throwers intended to cause great bodily injury and the projectile was capable of doing so. While eggs might not typically be considered capable of causing serious harm, the intent and potential danger created by the act (such as distracting drivers or obscuring vision) could factor into the charges.

And then it says:\n\n> Article III of the Constitution requires federal criminal trials to be held in the state in which the crime was committed. And the Sixth Amendment entitles a federal criminal defendant to a trial by jurors living in the state and district where the crime was committed. But if someone committed a crime in the uninhabited Idaho portion of Yellowstone, Kalt surmised, it would be impossible to form a jury. And being federal land, the state would have no jurisdiction.\n\nThe part about the state having no jurisdiction is something I wouldn't have guessed. It is, after all, within a state, and murder trials are usually not held in federal courts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article III, Section 2 of The Constitution requires that\n\n> The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\n>  jury; and such **trial shall be held in the state** where the said crimes\n>  shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state,\n>  the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law\n>  have directed\n\nSince the Idaho portion of Yellowstone is part of the state of Idaho and is not part of a non\\-state, ergo the trial shall be held in Idaho, according to The Constitution.\n\nOne jurisdictional statute, [16 USC 24](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/24), says \n\n> The Yellowstone National Park, as its boundaries now are defined, or\n>  as they may be hereafter defined or extended, shall be under the sole\n>  and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. All the laws\n>  applicable to places under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the\n>  United States, shall have force and effect in said park. *Nothing in\n>  this Act shall be construed to forbid the service in the park of any\n>  civil or criminal process of any court having jurisdiction in the\n>  States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming*. All fugitives from justice\n>  taking refuge in said park shall be subject to the same laws as\n>  refugees from justice found in the State of Wyoming.\n\nSo the crime would be a federal matter. I put emphasis on a sentence that doesn't have a straightforward interpretation. There is another jurisdictional statute [28 USC 131](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/131), the problematic one, which states:\n\n> Wyoming and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in\n>  Montana and Idaho constitute one judicial district.\n> \n> \n> Court shall be held at Casper, Cheyenne, Evanston, Lander, Jackson,\n>  and Sheridan.\n\nTherefore, the crime must be tried in Wyoming. Moreover, the judicial district of Wyoming also includes that unoccupied portion of the park in Idaho. This statute conflicts with Article III, Section 2, which requires court to be held in Idaho. Since The Constitution has precedence over federal statutes, the instruction to hold court in Wyoming is unconstitutional. \n\nThe 6th Amendment does not pose a particular problem, with its requirement that\n\n> the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an\n>  impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have\n>  been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained\n>  by law\n\nsince the jury could be of Idahoans, and transported to Wyoming \u2013 the 6th addresses the nature of the jury, not the location of the trial.\n\nIt is an open question what the 6th Amendment refers to in talking of \"state and district\", since district is not defined at a constitutional level. The only district with constitutional stature is the District of Columbia, which is not a state, and therefore there could be no \"state and district\" if we mean \"district, as specifically mentioned in The Constitution\". The [Judiciciary Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789) first created federal judiciary districts, signed by Washington on September 24, 1789, and the 6th Amendment was passed by Congress the next day. It is reasonable to assume that this is what they meant by \"district\".\n\n28 USC 131 does say that all of Wyoming plus a sliver of Idaho are a judicial district, so one could have a jury composed of citizens of Wyoming which satisfies the \"jury of the district\" requirement, but that would not satisfy the \"jury of the state\" requirement. If anyone lived in that area, those people could constitute a \"jury of the state and district\", but you would still have a clash between the statutory and constitutional requirements for venue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the hypothetical scenario of a crime committed in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the constitutional and legal challenges of prosecuting such a crime?\n\nA) The trial must be held in Idaho to comply with Article III of the Constitution, but this conflicts with 28 USC 131 which designates Wyoming as the judicial district for all of Yellowstone.\n\nB) The trial can be held in Wyoming with a jury of Wyoming residents, fully satisfying both constitutional and statutory requirements.\n\nC) The trial must be held in Wyoming according to 28 USC 131, and this statute takes precedence over the constitutional requirements.\n\nD) The trial can be held in Wyoming with a jury composed of Idaho residents, satisfying both the constitutional venue requirement and the 6th Amendment jury requirement.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A is the most accurate statement. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution requires that the trial be held in the state where the crime was committed (Idaho in this case). However, this constitutional requirement conflicts with 28 USC 131, which places all of Yellowstone National Park, including the Idaho portion, in Wyoming's judicial district. This creates a legal dilemma, as the Constitution takes precedence over federal statutes, making the instruction to hold court in Wyoming potentially unconstitutional.\n\nOption B is incorrect because using Wyoming residents for the jury would violate the \"jury of the state\" requirement in the 6th Amendment. \n\nOption C is wrong because constitutional requirements always take precedence over federal statutes.\n\nOption D, while creative, doesn't fully resolve the venue issue.

It could be for example a simple yes/no majority vote of those voters eligible to vote for president. In case Congress and POTUS approved the law but the majority of The People voted the law down, there is a distinct possibility that the constitutionality of the \"refer it to a vote\" provision would be ruled unconstitutional (conflicting with Art. 1 Sect. 1\\), and thus the bill would become law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the U.S. Constitution, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the process of enacting federal legislation through direct popular vote, similar to the Brexit referendum in the UK?\n\nA) The Constitution allows for binding national referendums on federal laws if approved by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress.\n\nB) The Constitution explicitly prohibits any form of direct popular vote on federal legislation.\n\nC) The Constitution permits binding national referendums, but only for amendments to the Constitution itself.\n\nD) The Constitution does not provide for direct popular votes on federal legislation, and such a mechanism would likely require a constitutional amendment.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The U.S. Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress, consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives (Article I, Section 1). The process for creating federal laws involves bills originating in either the House or Senate, passing both chambers, and then being signed or vetoed by the President. There is no provision for direct popular votes on federal legislation.\n\nTo implement a system of national referendums similar to the Brexit vote, a significant amendment to the Constitution would be necessary. This amendment would need to grant the people the power to enact legislation directly, potentially altering the current balance of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.\n\nWhile Congress could theoretically pass a bill that includes a provision for a popular vote, such a provision might be challenged as unconstitutional for conflicting with Article I, Section 1.

Jane's immediate departure is not illegal per se in civilian employment. The non-abandonment clause doesn't automatically entitle TechCorp to $20,000. Instead, TechCorp would need to prove actual damages resulting from Jane's lack of notice. These damages would typically be limited to costs directly associated with the insufficient notice period, such as temporary staffing or overtime for other employees to cover Jane's duties. The $20,000 penalty may be considered a liquidated damages clause, which courts often scrutinize for reasonableness. If the amount is deemed excessive compared to actual damages, it might not be fully enforceable. Labour laws may also affect the enforceability of such clauses, often favoring the employee.

I go into further discussion below, but for the **quicker answer to your specific question**, unless the person you are buying from is directly sanctioned or the subject of sanctions, or the entities specifically involved in the sale of goods (export company, vessel, etc) are directly sanctioned (or Russian companies operated in Crimea), yes it would be legal to purchase. So yes, unless the specific item you are buying/ entity you are buying it from is specifically sanctioned it would be legal, it is not particularly common for sanctions to prohibit the purchase of goods by consumers, unless there is a unique circumstance.\n\nHere is the 2\\-3 page overview of U.S. sanctions on Russia: [https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10779\\.pdf](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10779.pdf)\n\nAs to the further discussion.

Option B is the correct answer because Executive Order 13685 specifically prohibits new investment in the Crimea region of Ukraine by U.S. persons, regardless of their location. Sevastopol is in Crimea, so investing in a hotel project there would be banned.\n\nOptions A, C, and D involve purchasing goods from various parts of Russia. While Russia is under sanctions, these types of small-scale, person-to-person transactions are generally not prohibited unless the specific seller is sanctioned or the goods themselves are restricted. The sanctions primarily target larger economic sectors, government officials, and specific entities rather than ordinary commerce.\n\nThis question highlights the complexity of sanctions, showing that geographic specificity (Crimea vs. other parts of Russia) and the nature of the transaction (investment vs. purchase of goods) are crucial in determining what is prohibited."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5563/when-are-police-required-to-identify-themselves", "docs_id": 5563, "title": "(When) are police required to identify themselves?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It was my understanding that when a citizen asks for an officer's name and badge number, they're required to provide it to you (in Michigan).\nIs there a law pertaining to this?

It is quite probable that your landlord said \"fine\" to the month\\-to\\-month extension because it was already part of your existing lease.\n\nSecond, you will need to look at your existing lease and see what notification was required for you to move out.

Your \"verbal agreement\" is a contract and your landlord agreed to allow you to stay in the apartment as long as you gave him 30 days notice before moving out and paid your rent every month.\n\nMost of this is probably already spelled out in your current lease.

Even though John didn't sign a new written agreement, his verbal agreement with the landlord constitutes a valid contract. By agreeing to stay on a month-to-month basis with a 30-day notice requirement, John is legally obligated to provide that notice and pay rent for the notice period, even if he moves out earlier. Verbal contracts are generally enforceable, especially in rental situations. Additionally, many lease agreements automatically convert to month-to-month arrangements at the end of the fixed term, often with similar notice requirements.

Expedia offers airline credit but it's extremely restricted. Basically you can only use it for a single ticket on one booking for the same person on the same airline departing from the same country and costing the same price.

They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.\n\nSo, no matter what, you can\u2019t get your money from them.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nWe have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and *why* Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... \n\nAs an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree\n\nThe first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund \\- that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, \u201cwe can fly you tomorrow\u201d \\- they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don\u2019t want to fly tomorrow.

That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?\n\nIf the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage.

Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_v._Garner), common law allowed police to use deadly force to effect the arrest of a person suspected of a felony. Even though SCOTUS there held that such a practice violates Fourth Amendment civil rights, I was surprised to find that [in some states it is *still* lawful for police to use deadly force to effect an arrest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190206192128/http://www.slu.edu/colleges/law/journal/police-use-of-deadly-force-state-statues-30-years-after-garner/)!\n\nLet us examine the most extreme case, which is that the police can legally shoot at you to effect your arrest. As explained [here, you are always allowed to resist \"excessive force.\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/2211/10) If you make it to court, these qualifications (e.g., \"necessary\" and \"excessive\") are ultimately decided based on what a \"reasonable person\" would have believed in the situation. So if a cop shoots at you, and you \"dodge\" the bullet, it is *possible* for you both to be found not guilty of any crime. I.e., the cop can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because he believed you were a violent felon and shooting you was the only way to stop you. And you can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because you believed you were being subject to excessive force.\n\nWhile this is an interesting hypothetical, in practice of course by the time a cop is shooting at you you are almost certainly going to be *charged* with resisting arrest. Or, if the cop fired in self\\-defense (rather than to effect an arrest) you will be charged with a number of far more serious crimes (starting with felony assault, reckless endangerment, and going on from there...).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of deadly force by police and a suspect's right to resist?\n\nA) Police can always use deadly force to effect an arrest, and suspects have no right to resist.\n\nB) Police can never use deadly force to effect an arrest, and suspects always have the right to resist such force.\n\nC) The legality of police using deadly force and a suspect's right to resist depends on the specific circumstances and what a \"reasonable person\" would believe in the situation.\n\nD) Only federal law determines when police can use deadly force, and state laws have no bearing on this matter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legality of police using deadly force and a suspect's right to resist is complex and depends on specific circumstances. While the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner (1985) placed limits on police use of deadly force, some states still allow it under certain conditions. Simultaneously, individuals have a right to resist \"excessive force,\" but what constitutes \"excessive\" is determined by what a \"reasonable person\" would believe in the situation. This creates a nuanced legal landscape where both police actions and suspect responses are judged based on the specific context and perceived reasonableness.

This interpretation allows for all possible combinations of the fruits (including single types or any mixture) while specifying that the vendor makes the choice. It avoids the limitations of option A (restricting to only single types), the misinterpretation in C (wrongly giving the choice to the buyer), and the excessive requirement in D (tripling the total amount).

Fair\\-use defenses look at four questions, and the answers to the questions can tip the scales in favor of or against a finding of fair use:\n\n1. **Does your kind of copying affect the market for the original?** To what extent can your copy fulfill the demand for the original? What if there were widespread copying of the kind you're considering? The more potential there is for the copies to replace the original, the less likely it is to be fair use. *(This is the most important factor in the analysis.)*\n2. **Why did you make the copy?** If you made the copy for purposes of news reporting, criticism, or commentary, it's more likely to be fair use. If you made a copy just so you could emjoy the work again whenever you felt like it, that may still be fair use, but it is somewhat less likely. If you made a copy just so you could sell it for profit, that's almost certainly not fair use.\n3. **How much did you copy?** Did you copy the whole thing, or did you copy only as much as you needed to achieve your purpose under Question 2? If you copy \"too much\" \u2013 either in the raw amount or as a fraction of the whole work \u2013 it's less likely to be fair use.\n4. **What did you copy?** Highly creative works, such as poems, music, and movies, are at the \"core\" of copyright principles. A fair use analysis will be more stringent in these cases than when dealing with a copy of a purely factual work, such as a phone book, biography, or list of statistics. Such works are still protected by copyright, but that protection is not as strong.\n\nSo take all of those and imagine the answer to each on a spectrum. If you see things generally tipping in the direction of fair use, that's a good indication that you're going to be safe. If you see things tipping in the other direction, you may want to reconsider.\n\nThese questions can be trickier than you might think. If you're dealing with a real situation, you should consult an attorney to get an answer specific to your situation.\n\nBut what if I don't make any money?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis fact tips the scales in your favor, but only on Question 2; you still need to consider the other factors. Whether you make money is less important than whether your copying deprives the copyright owner of the opportunity to make money, but then you have to balance that consideration against the First Amendment principles embedded in fair\\-use analysis.\n\nSo if you're ripping *Star Wars* DVDs to hand them out as Christmas presents, your lack of a profit motive will not save you.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding fair use in this scenario?\n\nA) The student's use is likely fair use because she is not making any profit from the project.\n\nB) The student's use is unlikely to be fair use because she is using highly creative works that are at the core of copyright protection.\n\nC) The student's use is likely fair use because she is using short clips for educational and commentary purposes, which outweighs the creative nature of the works used.\n\nD) The student's use cannot be fair use because she did not obtain permission from the copyright holders.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves multiple factors of fair use analysis. While option A considers the non-profit aspect, which is favorable, it's not the most important factor. Option B correctly identifies that movies and music are highly creative works, which generally receive stronger copyright protection, but this alone doesn't determine fair use. Option D is incorrect because fair use can apply even without permission.\n\nOption C is the most accurate because it balances multiple factors:\n1. Purpose of use: Educational and commentary purposes are favored in fair use analysis.\n2. Amount used: Short clips suggest using only what's necessary for the purpose.\n3. Effect on market: Brief clips in a student documentary are unlikely to significantly impact the market for the original works.\n4.

Many jurisdictions tax products and services differently, with some places not taxing services at all or at lower rates.
