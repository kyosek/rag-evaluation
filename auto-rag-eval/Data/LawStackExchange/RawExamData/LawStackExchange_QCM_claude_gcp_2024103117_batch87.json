Rather, it implies that the state remains neutral and independent in matters of religion while allowing for the existence of different personal laws based on religious traditions. This approach is consistent with India's constitutional claim of being a secular state, as secularism doesn't necessarily require the elimination of all religious considerations from personal laws.

This person, (superhero or otherwise) often cuffs the baddies, and leaves them gift wrapped for the police, along with providing ***damning*** evidence to go with that. So my question is, does that actually ***help*** the police in any way?\n\nThese situations are almost always portrayed as:\n\n* Acquiring evidence without a warrant\n* Falsely imprisoning a person/criminal (This does not always involve the Vigilante seeing the crime happen, but they are usually acting like a police officer and pre\\-empting the crime.\n* The Vigilante is generally unable to be present for the accused to 'face their accuser'.\n\nSo, if evidence came from a known Vigilante, can it be used in a court of law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Can a vigilante perform an arrest?\n----------------------------------\n\nThis depends on whether the vigilante has the power to perform a [**citizen's arrest**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_arrest). The rules depend on the jurisdiction (and vary from state to state in the US), but generally the power to perform a citizen's arrest is quite limited. It may include the power to 'pre\\-empt' an offence if the would\\-be offender has [attempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempt) to commit the offence. However, often the power is limited to particularly serious offences (eg. felonies). There may also be a requirement that the crime occurred in the citizen's presence, or that the citizen was unable to contact the police instead.\n\nIs evidence obtained by a vigilante admissible?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn the United States, the constitutional [**exclusionary rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule) generally prevents evidence from being admitted if the government obtained it illegally. [I answered a general question about the scope of the exclusionary rule here.](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17851/how-far-does-the-fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree-doctrine-extend/19507) However, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained illegally by a private individual: *Burdeau v. McDowell*, [256 U.S. 465](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/256/465/case.html) (1921\\).\n\nIn *Burdeau*, the defendant's papers had been stolen and turned over to the government, which proposed to present them as evidence to a grand jury. The Supreme Court said:\n\n> In the present case, the record clearly shows that no official of the federal government had anything to do with the wrongful seizure of the petitioner's property ... there was no invasion of the security afforded by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure, as whatever wrong was done was the act of individuals in taking the property of another ... We assume that petitioner has an unquestionable right of redress against those who illegally and wrongfully took his private property under the circumstances herein disclosed, but with such remedies we are not now concerned.\n\nHowever, the exclusionary rule in some states goes beyond the Fourth Amendment. For example, [article 38\\.23 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure](http://codes.findlaw.com/tx/code-of-criminal-procedure/crim-ptx-crim-pro-art-38-23.html) provides that evidence illegally obtained 'by an officer *or other person*' is inadmissible. This provision was apparently enacted to deter vigilantes: Bubany and Cockerell, '[Excluding Criminal Evidence Texas\\-Style: Can Private Searches Poison the Fruit?](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/10601/1554/12TexTechLRev611.pdf)' 12 *Texas Tech Law Review* 611 (1981\\), p 625\\.\n\nCan such evidence be admitted even if the vigilante is not present?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming that no exclusionary rule applies, evidence obtained by a vigilante can potentially be admitted through the testimony of a police officer or other witness, subject to the rule against [**hearsay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay) and the question of reliability.\n\nThe rule against hearsay means that a police officer cannot give evidence that a vigilante told them that the accused was guilty. Evidence of this kind is not admissible because the accused has no opportunity to challenge the reliability of the source of the information in cross\\-examination.\n\nThe rule against hearsay does not apply when the probative value of the evidence does not depend on the truth of the absent vigilante's assertion. If the evidence provided by the vigilante is really 'damning' then it might fall into this category. For example, a vigilante might provide the police with a weapon that has the accused and victim's DNA on it, or tell the police that incriminating evidence can be found at a particular location.\n\nA police officer can then give evidence that the weapon was tested and found to have matching DNA, or a search warrant was executed and the incriminating evidence was found. There is no admissibility issue here. However, the fact that the police were tipped off by a vigilante who has broken the law and is not present to face court may cause the jury to reject the evidence as unreliable (ie. it could have been planted).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A vigilante apprehends a suspected drug dealer, confiscates illegal substances from their home without a warrant, and anonymously delivers the evidence to the police.

According to the U.S. Supreme Court case Burdeau v. McDowell, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained illegally by private individuals. Therefore, the evidence obtained by the vigilante would likely be admissible in a federal court, even though it was acquired without a warrant.\n\nHowever, the reliability of this evidence may be questioned by the jury. The fact that it was obtained by an anonymous vigilante who broke the law to acquire it could cast doubt on its credibility. The defense could argue that the evidence might have been planted or tampered with.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the exclusionary rule applies to government actions, not private individuals.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the vigilante's testimony is not required for the evidence to be admissible. The evidence could be presented through police testimony about receiving and processing it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the legality of a citizen's arrest is not directly related to the admissibility of evidence in this scenario.

The landowner likely also has a contract with a towing company allowing them to tow cars from their property.

Is there a sign that says \"Visitor parking\" and were you visiting someone who lives/works on the land?\n\nIf there is no sign and you have not specifically entered into a contract regarding parking there, then depending on the circumstances the landowner can still have your car towed, but it would be difficult for them to require you to pay a specific amount to get it back. They may need to make a claim against you for their towing costs, and show receipts from the towing company etc, because without a contract they have no right to profit from you parking there, even if you were trespassing.\n\nIn most cases there will be a sign, you will see it, and you will agree to it by parking.

The Copyright Act does allow for agreements that differ from the default ownership rules, and employment contracts can include clauses about intellectual property rights. However, courts may scrutinize such clauses for fairness and reasonableness. If the clause is too broad (e.g., claiming rights to work unrelated to the company's business) or extends unreasonably beyond the employment period, it may be limited or deemed unenforceable.

While patents can protect algorithms, not all jurisdictions recognize software patents, so universal protection isn't guaranteed.\n\nOption D is the most comprehensive and accurate approach.

As soon as you were made aware of that, you stopped. There is nothing more you could have done or can do now so don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely unlikely that the trademark owner will seek compensation as it simply isn\u2019t worth it.

The Mexican business owner's quick response to change their business name and logo upon being notified of the potential trademark conflict demonstrates good faith and likely reduces the risk of successful legal action. This aligns with the advice given in the original answer, which suggests that taking prompt corrective action when made aware of a potential trademark issue is the appropriate response.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the likelihood of a successful international legal case for damages is low, especially given the prompt corrective action taken.\n\nOption B is false because common law trademark protection is not universally enforceable across all countries.

Or is this immunity waived by the federal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes and No. The Federal U.S. Government as well as each individual state and territory claim Soverign Immunity to a limited degree. In the case of Federal Government, they claim Soverign Immunity to a near limitless degree (more on this in a moment), while States and Territories claim \"State Soverign Immunity\" which grants them immunity with respect to all soverign powers granted under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTo clarify, each U.S. State is seperately soverign in all matters not explicitly allocated to the Federal Government by the U.S. Constitution and all constitutionally written laws. Where the Constitution does not in writing claim a power for the federal government nor reserver a power for the state government, the power is assumed to be state government. So a State can claim immunity for a police situation but not a law it makes regarding immigration or foriegn policy, since that is the exclusive wheelhouse of the Feds. Per the 11th amendment, states can only be sued in state court by citizens of the state, while non\\-state citizens wishing to sue a state must sue in the Federal Court (Which for the purposes of the trial may adopt the defendant State's laws and regulations for the purposes of questions of fact and law brought up in the suit).\n\nAll U.S. States and the Federal Goverment additionally wave Soverign Immunity under specific conditions outlined in laws. In the case of the Federal Government, the laws governing when this immunity is waived are governed by the [Federal Torts Claims Act (1946\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act) and the [Tucker Act (1887\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Act). The FTCA covers intentional torts by the Federal Government, while the Tucker Act typically covers matters related to contractual obligations or monitary interactions with the federal government. Things that may be sued for include but are not limited too:\n\n* Intentional Torts committed by Government Agents in their Official Capacity (i.e. When the FBI violates your rights or maliciously investigates you).\n* Contractual disputes where the Government is a party to the Contract, either in written or implied terms.\n* Constitutional Claims (i.e. The Government may have violated the Constitution. These tend to be for non\\-monitary relief such as mandemuses, though the 5th Amendment's Taking Clause can be invoked of the government took property and does not justly compensate.).\n* Individual Agencies of the Government when the monitary claim is not drawn from the U.S. Treasury (the agencies own allocated budget is used to pay).\n* Refund for taxes paid\n\nIn all cases, a Judge will determin if the Government, under the laws, can be sued. If in the example of a government employee being sued, the Justice Department will first make a determination if the employee was acting as an agent of the government when they committed the tortious act, and then will declare themselves *Respondent Superior* through the agency of employement. From there, the case becomes a suit against the Federal Government and FTCA immunity waiver is determined by a Judge.\n\nFor example, lets say you (Mr. Rapt) sue Special Agent Jimmy Jones of an intentional tort that he committed in the course of his duty as an FBI agent. The DOJ will first declare that they are *Respondent Superior* in the case of Rapt v. Jones, thus turning the case to Rapt v. United States Government, Department of Justice, Federal Beura of Investigations, and Jones (Rapt v. United States, et. al.). From here, the Judge who gets the case then determins if the U.S. Government under FTCA can be sued by Rapt, based on Rapt's citizenship status (usually permanent legal residents are covered as citizens for this point, but I can say for certain in this particular law), ripeness (the suit must be filed within 2 years of the incident or first knowledge), and immunity waiver under FTCA.\n\nIn the case of the State Government, they should have similar laws, but I'm not going to identify all 50 individual laws here. Additionally, the 11th Amendment permits U.S. Congress to waive a State's immunity to suit in certain cases (mostly comes up with the Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment.).\n\nAs a fun point, in all cases where a government appears as a defendant in a suit, it is automatically a Bench Trial, as the government usually include a waiver of their right as defendant to a jury trial. The thinking here is that, as a country that was founded by rebelling against the government, a jury of 12 of the government's citizens aren't going to give them any slack at trial, where as a judge (who they pay) is much more likely.\n\nTL;DR: Both questions are yes.

The Department of Justice typically declares respondeat superior in cases involving federal agents, making the U.S. government the defendant. The judge then determines if immunity is waived under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Option A is incorrect because the case would likely become a suit against the government, not just the agent, and it would be a bench trial, not a jury trial. Option C is incorrect because this involves a federal agent, not a state matter, and the 11th Amendment doesn't apply in this way to federal cases.

You need to read the terms of the insurance very carefully, somewhere in there it says that the policy is only in effect while you are enrolled as a full time student. You (or your parents) broke this agreement, and the insurance company doesn't have any obligation to pay.\n\n> 1. Should I refuse to acknowledge the debt as mine? Can I claim it's the insurance company's debt?\n\nNo, the debt is yours from the moment of service, the insurance company's job is to cover some of that expense on your behalf. It isn't the insurance company's debt, it is yours.\n\n> 2. Contact my old insurance company and try to get them to pay up?\n\nUnfortunately you will not be successful at this. You violated the terms of your insurance (not being enrolled in school), the company has no obligation to pay. Your parents may be owed some refund of money for any extra premiums they paid while you were not enrolled, but that would be the extent of the insurance company's obligation.\n\n> 3.

And that is all that is required: that the suspicion is reasonable. Until someone makes a sufficiently persuasive legal stink about this, it is probably a legal stop. [This article](http://allentexascriminallaw.com/2014/11/can-an-officer-stop-me-for-no-insurance/) gives some legal discussion. One applicable case is [US v. Broca\\-Martinez](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/16-40817/16-40817-2017-04-28.html), a Texas case where a person was pulled over for being \"unconfirmed\" w.r.t. the insurance database: the court held that this was a reasonable suspicion.\n\nThereafter, a charitable interpretation is that you misunderstood the request in providing your sister's information when he asked for your license and insurance: but you are expected to understand that when they request your license and proofs of insurance, they mean you the driver, and not the car owner. That they is even more suspicious, although I understand your confusion. At your hearing you cane explain why you didn't comply with the first officer's request, and the judge may they chalk this up to a simple misunderstanding rather than intentional deception. The problem is that you are expected to know \u2013 whether or not you've ever been pulled over before \u2013 that you have to provide license, registration, and proof of insurance.

The case of US v. Broca-Martinez supports this view. Additionally, when stopped, drivers are expected to provide their own identification and insurance information, regardless of whether they own the vehicle.

Pelosi](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59673930/bravo-v-pelosi/) is the latest attempt to overturn the 2020 US Presidential and Congressional elections. The plaintiffs are suing everyone they think is even remotely related to the election, and a number of those defendants haven't responded to the summons.\n\nNormally, if a defendant fails to respond to a summons, the plaintiff can get a default judgement and the requested relief is granted. However, in this case, the core of that relief is:\n\n* Permanent injunctive relief in the form of a new federal election for Congress, President, and Vice President;\n* Permanent injunctive relief forever restraining Defendants from ever holding public office or participating in any way in an election campaign to public office other than exercising their own right to vote;\n* Permanent injunctive relief forever restraining Defendants from violating Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights described herein,\n\nMost of it looks like it's either outside the power of the court to grant, outside the power of the defendants to provide, or both. How would the court proceed in this case?\n\n(If it matters, ignore the fact that a few of the 643 defendants have responded, some haven't yet been served, and others don't yet need to respond. The case itself is a royal mess.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A federal court may dismiss a complaint *sua sponte* (i.e. without a request to do so from a party) if it is beyond its subject matter jurisdiction (a category of defenses including lack of standing) or fails to state a claim for relief on its face.\n\nA [Motion to Dismiss filed in the case](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1123851/gov.uscourts.txwd.1123851.113.0.pdf) provides a roadmap for the judge to dismiss the entire case. It argues in essence:\n\n* A Texas federal court can't assert jurisdiction over Georgia defendants.\n* A federal court can't entertain claims against state officials in their official capacities for the kind of relief requested.\n* The plaintiffs lack standing to sue.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction defenses (and lack of personal jurisdiction defenses) are also not barred from being raised later in a motion to vacate the judgment, by a default judgment.\n\nThe Texas federal court can also sanction parties for filing frivolous claims by, for example, awarding all of the costs and attorney fees incurred by the defendants against the party bringing the suit in a motion requesting that relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 against the parties and/or their attorney.\n\nI would not be surprised if the Plaintiffs' attorney in this case, Paul M. Davis, was disbarred and bankrupted by it.\n\nClass action lawsuits can't proceed as such until certified by the court.\n\nFurthermore, a summons has to be personally hand delivered with a complaint to be served in a way that is sufficient to result in an entry of a default judgment, even if the complaint is otherwise valid. This is unlikely to have occurred in all 600\\+ cases.\n\nThere are several instances in which a \"clerk's default\" has been entered, but that simply indicates that a return of service (even if facially defective) was filed by the Plaintiff and that the number of days set forth in the summons for a response has lapsed. In contrast, prior to entering a default judgment, which must be done by a judge, the judge must review the complaint to determine if the court has jurisdiction over the case and if a valid legal claim is stated in the complaint.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Bravo v.

A federal court has the authority to dismiss a complaint sua sponte (on its own initiative) if it lacks subject matter jurisdiction or fails to state a claim for relief, even without a motion from defendants. In this case, the complaint likely has jurisdictional issues (e.g., suing Georgia defendants in a Texas federal court) and requests relief beyond the court's power to grant. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because before granting default judgments, a judge must review the complaint for jurisdiction and valid legal claims, which this case likely lacks.\n\nAnswer C is wrong because class action lawsuits require court certification before proceeding, which hasn't occurred in this case.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the court doesn't need to wait for all defendants to be served before taking action, especially given the apparent jurisdictional and legal issues with the complaint."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8943/does-merely-serving-content-alone-constitute-operating-in-the-eu-and-so-should", "docs_id": 8943, "title": "Does merely serving content alone constitute &quot;operating&quot; in the EU and so should every website be compliant with the EU Cookie Law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was wondering if all websites in the world need to be compliant with the EU Cookie Law. \n\nFor example a company website of a US company, hosted in the US but serving visitors in the EU.\n\nAlso, does the situation change when that US hosted website used a CDN (content delivery network) and cache content (partly) within the EU?\n\nIn other words (like @Mowzer suggested):\n\n> Does merely serving content alone constitute \"operating\" in the EU (or any other specific jurisdiction)?

And given the limits of small claims cases and low dollar values of many of the injustices us commoners face on a daily basis, in contrast to the high price of law advice, speaking with a lawyer would cost more than a win would provide and is thus an impractical option.\n\nA synopsis of the administrative steps taken as part of a small claims case would provide a lot of clarity and a solid foundation to launch from.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The process of collecting a judgment once you win one is really no different in small claims court than it is in any other court, and as you note, it isn't easy. You may decide that once you have won, that it is easier to turn the judgment over to a collection agency or an attorney to collect (admittedly at a price). \n\nOften, garnishment of wages and bank accounts is the easiest way to collect, although placing a judgment lien on their real property (which you probably did in step 5\\) works too if you are willing to wait until the property is sold.\n\nOf course, once there is an appeal, you are basically back to square zero and have to establish that the default judgment is valid and that they have no shown valid grounds for setting it aside (which they probably haven't), by following the proper appellate process.\n\nMany court houses and public libraries have books on the small claims process and on enforcing judgments (with books on the latter often entitled \"creditor's rights\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a small claims court process, after winning a default judgment, what is typically the next step a plaintiff should take to begin the collection process?\n\nA) Immediately contact the defendant to demand payment\nB) Wait 30 days and then obtain a notice of judgment from the court\nC) File a new complaint with the county prothonotary\nD) Request a writ of execution from the court\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, after winning a default judgment in small claims court, the plaintiff typically needs to wait 30 days (the appeals period) before taking further action. The next step is to contact the court to obtain a notice of judgment. This is part of the process to begin enforcing the judgment and collecting the awarded amount.

[\u00a730 of the UK law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/30) seems to be what is relevant: usage requires \"sufficient acknowledgement\". It is not clear whether [\u00a733](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/education) on educational use is relevant (is this \"non\\-commercial\"; is this \"instruction\").\n\nSufficient acknowledgment relates to moral rights, covered in Ch. 4 of the law. \u00a72 says that moral rights\n\n> subsist in favour of the author, director or commissioner of the work,\n>  whether or not he is the owner of the copyright\n\nand [\u00a777](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/77) articulates this right to be identified as author or director.

You need to carefully read this chapter because there is also a moral right to not be falsely held to be an author, and a right to object to derogatory treatment.\n\nAs for whose law you have to care about, the possibilities are broad, because a work is probably protected under the laws of many nations.

The fair use/fair dealing doctrines do apply, but require \"sufficient acknowledgement,\" which goes beyond just naming the distributor and should identify the original creators (C is correct).

When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\u2019s website. Aereo\u2019s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber\\-specific folder on Aereo\u2019s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\u2019s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over\\-the\\-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n> \n> \n> We must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes \\[copyright] by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air.

This let them argue two things: 1\\) that they were not *performing* the work, only letting other people perform it, and 2\\) that the performance was not \"to the public\".

This option involves recording broadcasts and making them available to multiple users from centralized servers, which would likely be considered both unauthorized reproduction and public performance of copyrighted content.\n\nOption A involves personal use and doesn't distribute content to the public.

However by the time the house is sold, 20 years later, the house is worth \u00a3900,000 and is equivalent to $1,200,000\\.

The motion\u2019s force bent Greta backward and to her right. As he overtook Greta\u2019s slender frame, his right hand cupped her slim waist. He pulled her inward toward his lean and muscular body. Her initial attempt to physically separate her person from the intruder proved a futile exertion against the dark\\-uniformed man\u2019s strong hold. With her right arm pinned between their two bodies, she instinctively brought her left arm and clenched fist upward in defense. The effort was unnecessary. He never intended to hurt her.\n> \n> \n> As their lips locked, his left arm supported her neck. His left hand, turned backward and away from her face, offered the singular gesture of restraint, caution or doubt. The struck pose created an oddly appealing mixture of brutish force, caring embrace, and awkward hesitation. He didn\u2019t let go. As he continued to lean forward, she lowered her right arm and gave over to her pursuer\u2014but only for three or four seconds. He tried to hold her closer, wanting the moment to last longer. And longer still. But they parted...He just had to kiss her. He didn\u2019t know why.\n\nThe photo was taken August 14, 1945\\.

In 1945, the only sexual crime that existed was rape, which this act clearly does not constitute. Under modern New York law, sexual crimes require \"sexual contact\" with the purpose of gratifying sexual desire. While the kiss involved contact with lips, which might be considered \"intimate parts,\" there is no indication that the act was performed for sexual gratification.

Although on quick reading it seems most of these charges were against Trump's business / non\\-profit entities, might there be among them criminal charges filed against him *personally*? There is also a CREW report [listing 56 \"credible\" criminal offenses](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trumps-staggering-record-of-uncharged-crimes/) since Trump launched his campaign in 2015\\.\n\nMy question is:\n\n* If there *were* criminal charges against him personally but zero (0\\) arraignment, then these 2 arraignments ([with a few in the works](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/article/tracking-trump-investigations-and-lawsuits/?sh=67fd256272fc)) will be new territory for him. It's a testament to his lawyers that he could have those previous cases settled / dismissed. It would be nice if the answer can list them.\n* If he has been arraigned before, what were the charges and when?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Arraignments are only used for criminal matters. While Trump has been involved in many lawsuits, as have his businesses, only one prior case to his Presidency was criminal or quasi\\-criminal and might have involved an arraignment (although not necessarily):\n\n> In 2006, the Town of Palm Beach began fining Trump $250 per day for\n> ordinance violations related to his erection of an 80\\-foot\\-tall (24 m)\n> flagpole flying a 15\\-by\\-25\\-foot (4\\.6 by 7\\.6 m) American flag on his\n> property. Trump sued the town for $25 million, saying that they\n> abridged his free speech, also disputing an ordinance that local\n> businesses be \"town\\-serving\". The two parties settled as part of a\n> court\\-ordered mediation, in which Trump was required to donate\n> $100,000 to veterans' charities. At the same time, the town ordinance\n> was modified allowing Trump to enroll out\\-of\\-town members in his\n> Mar\\-a\\-Lago social club.\n\nSome municipal ordinance violations are treated procedurally like traffic tickets, and some are treated more like misdemeanor criminal offenses (which do generally involve arraignments).\n\nAfter his Presidency, one of his business entities [was convicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_and_business_legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump) of rare criminal charges against an organization:\n\n> On December 6, 2022, Trump's company The Trump Organization was\n> convicted on 17 criminal charges.\n\nLawsuits do not give rise to arraignments. This isn't part of the civil lawsuit process.\n\nIt is estimated that [70 to 100 million Americans](https://www.sentencingproject.org/app/uploads/2022/08/Americans-with-Criminal-Records-Poverty-and-Opportunity-Profile.pdf) have criminal records because they have been convicted of at least one criminal offense. This is about one in three or one in four American adults. The number of Americans who have even been arraigned for a crime, in a case that is not currently pending, who have never been convicted of a crime, is probably on the order of 1 million to 10 million. Probably tens of millions of Americans who have never been arraigned, however, have been arrested but never charged with any crime, in addition to those who have been arraigned and not convicted with no charges pending, those who have been arraigned only in cases that are still pending, and those who have been convicted of crimes.\n\n**Lots Of Crimes That Are Committed Are Never Prosecuted**\n\n> There is also a CREW report listing 56 \"credible\" criminal offenses\n> since Trump launched his campaign in 2015\\.\n\nThese are cases in which there is there are credible allegations that Trump acted in ways that could have been the basis for committing a crime. But, CREW is not alleging that any of these circumstances (other than the 2022 Trump Organization conviction and the two felony cases upon which Trump has been arraigned in 2023\\) have resulted in any court action being taken to press criminal charges.\n\nIt is possible that Trump or one of his businesses was the subject of criminal investigations that did not result in charges being brought, but there is really no way to know that this is the case. And, there is nothing terribly dishonorable about being investigated for a crime but not ultimately charged with any criminal offense.\n\nBy analogy, if you are speeding, you are committing a traffic offense. The vast majority of the time, you are not ticketed for speeding even if a law enforcement office's radar gun tells the law enforcement officer that you were going slightly over the speed limit. Eventually, after the statute of limitations for traffic offenses (which is quite short) runs, you can't even be charged with those offenses.\n\nIn the same way, while unlawful sexual contact or sexual assault is a crime, if charges are not brought within the statute of limitations (something we know empirically to be quite common) then it doesn't result in criminal charges even though the offender committed a crime.\n\nLikewise, most civil fraud lawsuits allege conduct that could have been prosecuted as a crime if authorities sought to do so. But, in practice, criminal prosecutors with limited resources most often chose not to bring criminal fraud prosecutions in cases where a civil fraud lawsuit could bring complete relief to the party who was harmed by it.\n\n**Not All Illegal Conduct Is Criminal**\n\nMany kinds of conduct that can give rise to civil lawsuits cannot generally give rise to criminal charges at all. These include breaches of contract, negligently but unintentionally causing a personal injury, disagreeing over the interpretation of the tax laws in a way that cause the government to allege that you failed to pay the full amount of the taxes that you owe, employment discrimination, and many kinds of housing discrimination.\n\n**Big Businesses Are Usually Parties To Many Lawsuits**\n\nBusiness entities, large and small, are routinely involved in lots of civil lawsuits, sometimes as plaintiffs and sometimes as defendants, and the number of lawsuits is, more or less, usually roughly proportional to the economic scale of the enterprise.\n\nFor example, almost every landlord brings eviction and rent collection lawsuits from time to time, and sometimes is sued by tenants over security deposit issues and alleged defects in the maintenance of the rental property. Almost every significant property owner will sooner or later become involved in litigation over boundary discrepancies or easements or in eminent domain cases. Almost every developer will sooner or later be involved in construction defect and/or mechanic's lien litigation.\n\nAlmost every bank brings foreclosure lawsuits and collection lawsuits when loans are allegedly not paid as agreed or loan covenants are not met.\n\nAlmost every business with a great many employees with eventually be involved in some sort of lawsuit with an employee.\n\nA large business will typically litigate a significant tax dispute at least every few years.\n\nMost of the lawsuits filed in the United States are brought by banks alleging defaults on loans, landlords alleging unpaid rent, and governments collecting unpaid taxes.\n\nFor example, [in Colorado, in 2022](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Administration/Planning_and_Analysis/Annual_Statistical_Reports/2022/FY2022%20Annual%20Report.pdf), there were 62,996 tax collection cases, 29,836 evictions, 1,971 simple mortgage foreclosures, 66,875 debt collection cases, and 306 personal property repossession cases, for a total of 161,984 civil lawsuits out of 199,293 civil lawsuits in the state (about 81%), the lion's share of which are brought by financial institution lenders, landlords, and government tax collectors.\n\nWhether 4,000 lawsuits over several decades is a lot or a little for a large business enterprise, or is just par for the course, really comes down to the nature of, and scope of, the businesses involved. The character of the allegations in the lawsuit, and whether the allegations are atypical of lawsuit involving large business enterprises, is really more telling than the number of lawsuits.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about Donald Trump's legal history, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Trump has been arraigned multiple times for criminal charges prior to his presidency.\n\nB) The majority of the 4,000 legal cases involving Trump before his presidency were criminal charges against him personally.\n\nC) Trump's first criminal arraignment occurred in 2023, despite numerous civil lawsuits and allegations of criminal conduct.\n\nD) All of Trump's previous legal issues were resolved without any criminal charges or convictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The information provided indicates that Trump's first criminal arraignments occurred in 2023 (once in April in New York and once in June in Florida).

Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.\n> \n> \n> **b. Stand\\-alone software.** If you acquired the software as stand\\-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand\\-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software.

US](https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013cv0942-136-0) is whether the statue is a building or a sculpture. The government sought dismissal of the case because\n\n> The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does\n>  not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public\n>  display of pictures ... of the work, if the building in which the work\n>  is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.\n\ncontending \"that the sculpture is part of a much larger, unitary architectural work, namely the New York, New York Hotel \\& Casino\". The court found that the government had misconstrued the intent of that section of copyright law:\n\n> The addition of Section 120 was intended to *extend* copyright\n>  protections, however, not truncate them. Previously, architectural\n>  works had little protection because they were considered utilitarian\n>  and not subject to copyright protection. See Leischester v. Warner\n>  Bros., 232 F.3d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir. 2000\\).

In criminal law, \"should know\" is important because many crimes have a scienter requirement, but you will usually have a hard time proving beyond reasonable doubt that a person had actual knowledge of some fact. It is almost commonplace that people who are not fluent speakers of English \"know\" things that are untrue and that a \"reasonable\" person would know to be wrong, such as being confused about the referent of \"eye\" versus \"ear\" (tragic, in the context of \"\\_\\_\\_drops\"). A reasonable person would not judge a factual mistake as being dishonest, and in general would never impute evil motives (dishonesty) to what appears to be an incomprehensible response (e.g. saying \"Yes\" to the question whether the sky is green).
