Either way the assistance \\- either as evidence at trial or as intelligence given in confidence \\- should be substantial and verifiable to be eligible.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nThere is, as far as I can, no publicly available detailed statistics on these procedures, presumably the reason is that vast majority of the former cases go unreported and, despite [some being public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisting_Offender), there is a real risk of retribution to the informant in the latter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK legal system, which of the following is NOT a procedure similar to the American-style plea bargain?\n\nA) Basis of Plea\nB) Assisting Offenders\nC) Immunity from prosecution\nD) Deferred prosecution agreement\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) Basis of Plea is incorrect because it is mentioned as a procedure similar to plea bargaining in the UK, where a defendant can offer a written guilty plea to a lesser offense.\n\nB) Assisting Offenders is incorrect because it is described as an option under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, allowing minor-player defendants to assist prosecution in exchange for benefits.\n\nC) Immunity from prosecution is incorrect because it is mentioned as one of the potential outcomes under the Assisting Offenders procedure.\n\nD) Deferred prosecution agreement is the correct answer because it is not mentioned in the given information as a procedure similar to plea bargaining in the UK.

Is this legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Education level is not an FHA protected category. However, whenever you give one broad group preferential treatment over another, you'll raise eyebrows. Someone might argue, for example, that while your incentive does not explicitly mention a protected category like race or sex, it might disproportionately impact one group in a protected category over another.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court in 2015 addressed this question in *Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project*. They found (albeit by a 5\\-4 vote) that disparate impact could, under certain circumstances, be the basis for a discrimination claim under FHA. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact#The_Fair_Housing_Act) on this subject is informative.\n\nAs for your case, it really depends on what you are trying to accomplish with the policy, and what you reasonably predict it will do. For example, given that in most areas, white people more often have graduate degrees than black people, then if this policy did in fact end up advantaging white tenant over black tenants, someone might claim that you are in effect discriminating on the basis of race. I would not want to be on the defending end of that claim.\n\nIn general, if you want to be safe from FHA's wrath, you need to evaluate each applicant on their individual merits as a tenant, not their membership in some group. Whenever you treat one person differently from another person, you should have a reason that clearly derives from your business interests as a landlord, and you should write it down.\n\nLegal questions aside, it seems like a really bad idea to offer incentives like this. I can't imagine it achieving any legitimate business goal, and I can easily imagine it making tenants or applicants feel cheated and devalued. And when people feel cheated and devalued, even if they haven't legally been wronged, they often seek legal redress. Or slash your tires.\n\nThe fact that grad degrees would not be *required* under your policy isn't relevant. In the eyes of the FHA, any disparate treatment on the basis of a protected category is discrimination. The only real question here is whether this is disparate treatment on the basis of a protected category.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord wants to implement a policy offering special rental discounts to tenants with advanced degrees (Ph.D. or Master's).

The 2015 Supreme Court case Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project established that disparate impact claims can be valid under the FHA. Since advanced degree holders may disproportionately represent certain racial or ethnic groups, this policy could indirectly discriminate against protected categories. Additionally, the policy doesn't clearly serve a legitimate business interest for the landlord, making it more vulnerable to legal scrutiny. Options A and D are incorrect because they overlook the potential for disparate impact claims. Option B is incorrect because the policy doesn't explicitly discriminate against a protected category, but rather could face challenges due to its potential effects."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45447/usage-error-of-fact", "docs_id": 45447, "title": "Usage: &quot;Error of Fact&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a contractor asserts a series of false statement in a record, whether it is mistaken or intentional, is it incorrect to label the group of false statements \"Error(s) of fact\"? \n\nUpon looking up an example:\n\n\"An [error of fact](https://www.ridoutbarron.com/blog/2016/07/an-error-of-law-versus-an-error-of-fact.shtml) means that you think the **judge** had the wrong facts or interpreted them incorrectly.\"\n\nI realize that this phrase is normally applied to judge and seeking a phrase to apply to coin the contractor's assertions in a document that would be read by judge. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The term \"misstatements of fact\" would be far more conventional.

It is not a crime, but it could be a civil wrong, and if the recording resulted in damage to the tutor, the person making the recording could be sued. If A records B threatening violence against A and complains to B's supervisor, B might get fired and B could try suing. Under those circumstances the firing would be justified, so with unclean hands, B is unlikely to prevail in court. Alternatively, suppose B was doing nothing wrong; then B didn't get fired, and A didn't cause damage to B, so nothing to sue over. The question of whether there is a civil cause of action depends heavily on the facts of the case, so that it is possible but unlikely that B could sue A for making a secret recording. (I do not offer an opinion as to whether [GDPR](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/pdfs/ukpga_20180012_en.pdf) could provide a path for a suit against the recorder, there being insufficient case law regarding how the courts interpret the new language. It is also unclear whether secret recordings could be entered as evidence in a court proceeding, if such a recording was made \"in the public interest\").\n\nWith or without a recording, the first step would be filing an official complaint with the employer, outlining what wrongs the employee committed. It appears that you've done something like this and didn't get the result that you wanted. Perhaps you didn't present the case appropriately, for example you may have casually said to a supervisor \"Smith is bullying Jones\", when what Jones needs to do is file an official grievance. It is a virtual certainty that an employer would not terminate an employee simply because someone reported \"Smith is bullying Jones\": the aggrieved party would have to make an official accusation. In that context, making a surreptitious recording would only be useful for establishing that Smith threatened violence against Jones, if that is what happened, and Smith denies the threat. \n\nIf the employer does not take action, one would have to sue the school and the employee for some reason. The reason would have to be more specific than \"going after\" a person, or \"bullying\" (which now has a very broad range of applications). You would need to say exactly what wrong the tutor committed, and why you think it is an actionable wrong (your attorney would in fact be the one to identify the specific legal wrong).\n\nSince the legality of secret recordings in this situation is unclear, it is risky to make a secret recording, and you should get informed and paid legal advice from your attorney.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, a student is being bullied and threatened by a college tutor.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the developer's personal liability?\n\nA) The developer will always be personally liable for any lawsuits against the business, regardless of the business structure.\n\nB) By forming a limited liability company (LLC), the developer can generally protect personal assets from business liabilities, except in cases of intentional misconduct or criminal activities.\n\nC) The developer cannot be held personally responsible under any circumstances as long as the business is registered as a corporation.\n\nD) Personal liability only applies if the business is sued for copyright infringement, but not for other types of lawsuits.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most accurate statement. By forming a limited liability company (LLC), the developer can generally protect their personal assets from business liabilities. However, this protection has limits. The developer could still be held personally liable if they intentionally extract too much money from the company, leaving it unable to pay debts, or if they engage in criminal activities. In the case of this video-sharing platform, if the developer knowingly allows copyright infringement and doesn't handle it properly, it could potentially be deemed criminal, exposing them to personal liability. The other options are either too absolute (A and C) or too limited in scope (D) to accurately represent the nuances of personal liability in this situation."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91441/after-i-paid-deposit-and-booked-the-car-dealer-sold-it-without-notifying-me", "docs_id": 91441, "title": "After I paid deposit and booked the car, dealer sold it without notifying me", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Day 1: I live in MA, USA. Last month I booked my first car from a local, small dealer by paying $300 deposit and signed the contract agreement. I also notified him that I'm going to take loan so I won't be able to give him check immediately. (His behavior was little bit rude and kind of money\\-oriented.)\n\nDay 3: Dealer gave me a call saying it's ready for pickup. I told him that loan got approved which it did happen at that point and I asked for his help to get insurance suggestion. He asked me to come with check and then he'd help me, instead of helping on the phone.\n\nDay 8: Bank account and loan paperwork was ready expect I needed his details to put on bank's check for the loan. He avoided all my bunch of calls.\n\nDay 10: I called him again, he picked up and said he can't wait for a month. It is written in contract that after he notifies me, I have to give him full amount within 48 hours.\n\nContract agreement reads as follows:\n\n> In the event I fail to take delivery of the vehicle purchased by me within forty\\-eight (48\\) hours after I have been notified by you that it is ready for delivery and pay the total contract price in the manner indicated, my deposit in the amount of $300 may, at your option, be retained by you to compensate you in whole or in part for any loss sustained by you. Your right to retain my deposit shall be in addition to and not instead of any other right or remedy provided by applicable law including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the sale of the car or truck I agree to purchase. If the amount of my deposit exceeds actual damages sustained by you, you will promptly refund the difference to me.\n\n---\n\nI know that he's right according to the contract, but he never notified me before selling to other person.\n\nThis is legit scamming people because for someone taking loan, it is almost impossible to give him check within 48 hours.\n\nHow can I get my money back? Please help thanks in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's right in the contract\n--------------------------\n\n> In the event **I fail to take delivery of the vehicle** purchased by me **within forty\\-eight (48\\) hours after I have been notified** by you that it is ready for delivery **and pay the total contract price in the manner indicated**, **my deposit** in the amount of $300 **may**, at your option, **be retained by you to compensate you in whole or in part for any loss sustained by you**. Your **right to retain my deposit shall be in addition to** and not instead of any other right or remedy provided by applicable law **including**, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, **the sale of the car or truck I agree to purchase**. If the amount of my deposit exceeds actual damages sustained by you, you will promptly refund the difference to me.\n\nThe car was ready on day 3\\. As a result, the Customer was obligated to pay and take delivery of the vehicle until day 5\\.\n\nBecause the customer did not follow through with the purchase, the deposit is used to compensate the salesman in the amount that covers the costs of preparing the sale and having the car on the lot for those days that the salesman could not sell it to someone else.\n\nAt the end of day 5, the contractual obligation to hold the car for the customers in exchange for the deposit ended, and the other clauses of the contract (car for rest of payment) become void. The car salesman is in his right to sell the car because the actual sales contract has fallen through and the holding fee/deposit expired, as the very quoted paragraph shows.\n\nBased on the final sentence of the quoted portion of the contract, to get a part of the deposit back, one would need to establish that the losses are less than the contractually fixed amount of 300 USD. When I had my car at the workshop and could not get it back on the day it was done with repairs, I was also informed that holding my car for more than a day would incur storage fees of up to 15\u00a0\u20ac per day. Similarly, the last time I bought a car, I was told that the sale included a fresh inspection and oil. Those are costs to the seller and can be accounted for in the deposit. The inspection costs about \\~120\u00a0\u20ac for a new T\u00dcV certificate and exhaust check and the materials for an oil change come for about 70\u00a0\u20ac. This leaves about 70\u00a0\u20ac cover for the mechanic and salesman's wages for about one hour. That's 300\u00a0\u20ac, or about 330\u00a0USD today. As such, costs to prepare a contract and transfer, inspect the car for roadworthiness as well as storage fees most likely are reasonably assessed to be in the 300 USD area.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the contract and situation described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customer's deposit?\n\nA) The customer is entitled to a full refund of the $300 deposit because the dealer didn't provide sufficient time for loan processing.\n\nB) The dealer must return the deposit if the customer can prove that preparing the sale and holding the car for 48 hours cost less than $300.\n\nC) The dealer has no right to keep the deposit because they sold the car to someone else without proper notification.\n\nD) The dealer is legally entitled to retain the full $300 deposit regardless of actual costs incurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The contract states that if the deposit exceeds the actual damages sustained by the dealer, they will promptly refund the difference. This means that while the dealer has the right to keep the deposit to cover their costs and losses, they are not automatically entitled to the full amount if their actual expenses were less. The customer could potentially recover some of the deposit by demonstrating that the dealer's costs (such as inspection, oil change, storage, and administrative fees) were less than $300. Options A and C are incorrect because the contract clearly allows the dealer to keep the deposit if the customer fails to complete the purchase within 48 hours of notification, which happened in this case. Option D is incorrect because the contract does not guarantee the dealer the right to keep the full amount regardless of actual costs."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81851/guns-and-red-flag-laws", "docs_id": 81851, "title": "guns and red-flag laws", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a lot of talk lately about red\\-flag laws being used to take guns away from someone reportedly dangerous to himself or others.

What\n> if the gun was owned by a Trust with several trustees?\n\nThird party owners of property lawfully seized from someone else can recover it.\n\nFor example, I once took legal actions to recover a gun for a client that was in a gun repair shop that was seized in a criminal investigation because most of the inventory of the shop where it was being repaired consisted of stolen firearms and the primary business of the gun repair shop was fencing stolen property (a fact of which my client was completely unaware and shocked to discover). But, that was only possible once the trial was over because the guns seized were part of the evidence in that trial.\n\nA similar process applies when there is a civil forfeiture of property owned by a third\\-party.\n\n> Could the owner (personal or trustee) recover the gun from police\n> custody independently of a court finding on the suspect?\n\nSort of. But it isn't entirely independent, since the firearm might be needed as evidence or might need to be kept out of the possession of the person from whom it was seized to effect the red flag order while it was in place in a way that that the third\\-party owners would have to assure.\n\n> An example might be where a gun is confiscated via red\\-flag law, where\n> no crime has been committed, but the suspect won't get his day in\n> court for 6 months.

Each one is different. Many would provide a specific statutory procedure for how this issue would be handled.\n\nFor example, in some places, the proper means to regain possession of property held by law enforcement in connection with a criminal case is a motion filed by a third\\-party intervenor in the criminal case, while in others, the property process is to bring a civil action for replevin (a lawsuit to regain physical possession of particular items) against the law enforcement officer in possession or constructive possession of the property in question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a red-flag law case where a firearm is confiscated from a suspect but owned by a third party, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the recovery of the weapon?\n\nA) The third-party owner can immediately recover the firearm without any legal process, as long as they can prove ownership.\n\nB) The firearm must be held as evidence until the suspect's trial is complete, regardless of third-party ownership.\n\nC) The third-party owner would likely need to petition the court to regain possession, demonstrating that the red-flag order would continue to be enforced without the firearm present.\n\nD) Red-flag laws universally prevent any recovery of confiscated firearms until the order expires, even for third-party owners.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, in a red-flag law case, the third-party owner would probably have to petition the court to regain possession of the firearm. They would need to demonstrate that the red-flag order would continue to deny the suspect access to the gun even if it were returned to the true owner. This process acknowledges both the rights of the third-party owner and the intent of the red-flag order.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate recovery without any legal process is not typically allowed, even for third-party owners. Option B is incorrect because in red-flag cases, the existence of the gun itself is not usually evidence for trial, so it doesn't need to be retained for that purpose. Option D is too absolute; while red-flag laws vary by state, they generally do not universally prevent recovery by legitimate third-party owners, though they do require a legal process for such recovery."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41224/can-i-sue-my-appraiser-from-when-i-bought-my-home-in-georgia-a-few-years-ago-due", "docs_id": 41224, "title": "Can I sue my appraiser from when I bought my home in Georgia a few years ago due to an egregious error on the square footage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Both seller and buyer agreed to a purchase price with all the details agreed upon. \nThe financing was not an issue either. The only issue that created a problem was the difference in the square footage. My home appraisal from 2015 listed the property for 300 square feet more than the current appraisal. This has resulted in my appraisal coming in $15K less than needed. I actually agree with the new square footage \\#, and want to see if the previous appraiser can be held liable for misrepresenting the square footage to me. Can I sue the appraiser for the egregious error?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To be able to sue the appraiser, he would have to have a duty to you. If he was hired by a bank, his duty is to the bank and not to you. Assuming that you directly hired the appraiser, then you would have to check the contract for limits on his liability \u2013 a clause that says \"you waive your right to sue me for (certain) mistakes\". Now supposing that you haven't waived your right to sue, you almost certainly cannot sue for misrepresentation, unless for some reason you can prove that he knew that he was lying to you.\n\nYour best bet is arguing that his mistake was negligent. You would have to establish that the first figure was incorrect (a disagreement in figures does not establish which figure is correct). A discrepancy between county records and an appraiser's estimate can be explained by numerous non\\-negligence related facts (unpermitted modifications of the structure, for example). Suppose that the source of the discrepancy is inclusion of finished basement space in the earlier appraisal, or perhaps measurement error. Then you would have to prove that that error involved a lack of professional care, which implies certain professional standards (not just your feeling that the error is egregious). [This article](https://www.redfin.com/blog/how-to-calculate-the-square-footage-of-your-home) explains the ANSI guidelines. The standard tends to increase square footage because it is measured from the outside.\n\nThen you would have to establish that you were damaged by the earlier figure. The law doesn't allow you to sue because someone does something that bugs you, you have to have suffered damage. You don't say how you were harmed \u2013 I presume the problem is that the buyer's bank is not willing to lend that much money, where you relied on an earlier incorrect estimate of square footage in advertising the house and setting the price. You may have contributed to the problem by relying on that estimate when you knew or should have known from the government records that the size is something less.

Not asking when the insurance company will ask the driver for their money back, but when they are not going to pay? \n\nI couldn't find anything through Google. AFAIK for example the German rules are that the insurance doesn't pay if the car was not insured, if the damage was caused intentionally, and as far as the damage exceeds the insurance coverage, but has to pay in all other cases. \n\nBecause this was asked in a comment: The German insurance doesn't pay to third parties if the car isn't insured anymore, which happens after several payments are missed; they will also inform the police that there is an uninsured car. The policy doesn't matter, whether they have to pay to third parties is governed by law. They have to pay in case of negligence, gross negligence, but not for intentional damage. Since \"third party liability insurance\" is a legal requirement in many countries, intended to protect innocent third parties, you wouldn't expect the insurance policy to matter. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The British system of motor insurance is not the same as the German system, at least as you describe it. The law that applies is [Section 143 of the Road Traffic Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/143), which specifies that \"a person must not use a motor vehicle...unless there is in force...a policy of insurance that complies with the requirements of this Part of this Act\" (unless you provide your own third party insurance by depositing a large sum with the Court Funds Office: I do not believe this has ever been done).\n\nSo what the insurance company will cover depends on the policy provisions, providing that the policy is inclusive enough to meet the standards set out in the Act. As a matter of general agreement any large company will usually cover most expenses and seek to recover from the driver any payout they were arguably not required to make (such as where you provided false information); that is another (huge) question entirely, in which you say you are not interested here.\n\nAs an example, my car insurance will cover all damage caused to third parties where I or somebody named in the policy was driving unless (i) there is other insurance covering the same liability (ii) the victim was working with or for me (iii) acts of terrorism or (iv) liability caused by cutting, welding or use of blowtorches. (Note that all these exceptions do have legal definitions, either in the small print or in legislation. It may also be important that this is a comprehensive policy from which I have quoted only the relevant provisions; 'third\\-party only' policies are available but are, as a deliberate choice by the insurance companies, more expensive than comprehensive.)

I am asking because the USA is supposed to be a \"free\" country, and not a police country. \n\nUnder what circumstances do you have to follow 100% of an officer's commands? For example, a person gets pulled over while driving. Can the officer command you to open the window fully (lets say you opened just a little crack to give away license and insurance)? How about to step out of the vehicle (can you refuse to do so until their sergeant shows up \\- just so you won't get shot and/or accused of some trumped\\-up stuff?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In most US States (probably all of them) failure to follow the **Lawful** orders of a police officer is itself a crime, and is grounds for the officer to arrest the person, even if the person had not done anything wrong prior to that. \n\nThis obviously leads to the question: what orders are lawful? The officer has a pretty broad range of discretion. Ordering a person out of a car, or to roll down a car window, is pretty clearly lawful. Ordering a person to commit a crime would not be lawful. Neither would ordering a person to submit while the officer rapes or robs the individual be lawful. \n\nIn practice, the officer will usually think that all of his or her commands are lawful, and might feel threatened by any failure to comply. In which case, the officer might shoot. This might not be upheld later if the command was not lawful and/or the officer's fear was not reasonable, but that will do the person shot little good. It is usually wise to comply with any commend, unless it puts you very directly at serious risk. \n\nRemember you don't know what else has happed to the officer that day. Has the officer had a fight with his/her spouse that morning? Just been denied a promotion? Been turned down for a mortgage? None of that should matter, legally, but it will affect the officer's attitude, and can lead to escalation, even if the person stopped is in no way at fault.\n\nAn instruction to \"shut up\" is probably not going to provoke an officer to shoot if it is disobeyed, but it might help to escalate the situation. It is probably lawful, depending non the exact circumstances. As to the first amendment issues, that would probably come under the 'time, place, or manner\" regulations that may be applied to speech. And even if it is not held to be lawful, the time to contest it is in court, not during the stop. \n\nIf the officer feels safer with the window fully rolled down so that the officer could reach in, that is probably a lawful command.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Officer Smith pulls over a driver for speeding.

An order to fully roll down a car window is specifically mentioned as being \"pretty clearly lawful.\" While the driver may have privacy concerns, refusing to comply with this order could be seen as failing to follow a lawful command, which is itself a crime in most states.

Indeed, usually it will be more specific than city and state or province and will also identify a hospital or residence or other place where the birth happened.\n\nSo, for example, if a child is born to U.S. diplomats in Paris, France (in or out of the embassy grounds), the birth certificate will say that the child was born in Paris, France at Charles de Gaulle Hospital.\n\nBut, that child will still be a U.S. citizen in all likelihood, because that child's mother, and/or married father or unmarried father who acknowledges paternity, is a U.S. citizen (in all likelihood) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401 and 1409\\.

The embassy grounds are not considered U.S. soil for birth certificate purposes.

What I'd really hope to avoid is actually having to collect things like their Social Security Numbers, EIN's, etc, let alone any of the other compliance type issues that could arise.\n\nI'm wondering a couple of things.\n\nFirst: The need to issue 1099's doesn't actually arise until you're paying out $600 or more in a given year. Could I feasibly just let the program run, but only make the requirement of providing an SSN for tax purposes kick in when the affiliate is going to go over the limit? Ie, for the first $550, no SSN checks required, but after that, they need to provide this info to receive additional payments?\n\nSecond: If I only make payments through a service like PayPal, who I presume has crossed all the T's and dotted all the I's, does this alleviate my need to do any additional checks on people (not that I even know what checks would be made).\n\nThird: Going hand in hand with the only making payments through PayPal idea \\- If i accurately record payments to affiliates as Services provided, does PayPal take care of 1099's as part of their role? In that I would only have to report payments made to PayPal, and it would be on them to report payments made to the ultimate beneficiary?\n\nThis isn't a business that's been launched, but I'm trying to think out issues beforehand, and this is the biggest one I can think of \\- I would personally rather not have myself or anyone one on my team even be able to access anyone's SSN's, but if it moved forward, I would obviously want to do so in a way that was compliant with the IRS and any other regs.\n\nAny thoughts or guidance would be appreciated, unless it's \"contact an Accountant\" \\- I already know that's the most correct answer, I'm simply wondering if anyone else has gone down this road and can save me a little time and money on this, as this is still just idea phase, not operating business phase.\n\nMany thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As explained [in more detail here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/7939/10):\n\nThe [IRS instructions on Form 1099\\-MISC](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099msc/ar02.html) are pretty clear as to when and how you must file that. You don't need to file a 1099\\-MISC if total payments to an entity in a tax year are under $600\\. And if you don't need to file tax forms, you don't need to request a W\\-9\\. (If in doubt as to the entity receiving the money, you demand a W\\-9 from whomever is receiving a payment and use that as the basis of reporting payments.)\n\nFurthermore, if you transmit the funds using a payment settlement entity who will report the transaction on a 1099\\-K, then you don't need to report the payment on a 1099\\-MISC. (See \"Form 1099\\-K\" [ibid](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099msc/ar02.html).)\n\nPayPal is a payment settlement entity, so you don't need to worry about reporting payments you send through them ... with one big exception: PayPal does not report \"payments to friends and family,\" and so if you're using that to avoid their fees then the IRS would consider you liable for reporting those payments on a 1099\\-MISC.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner is setting up an affiliate program for their online service.

According to IRS instructions, businesses are only required to file Form 1099-MISC for individuals who receive $600 or more in payments during a tax year. For amounts below this threshold, there's no need to collect SSNs or issue 1099-MISCs. \n\nOption A is incorrect because SSNs are not required for payments under $600. \n\nOption C is partially true but overly broad. While PayPal (as a payment settlement entity) generally handles reporting via Form 1099-K, this doesn't apply to all payment types, such as \"friends and family\" transactions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because 1099-MISCs are not required for payments under $600, and payments properly processed through PayPal (excluding \"friends and family\" payments) are typically reported by PayPal, not the business owner."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1702/worst-realistic-effect-in-the-u-s-of-jslint-license", "docs_id": 1702, "title": "Worst realistic effect in the U.S. of JSLint license?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The [JSLint license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/master/jslint.js) specifies that code \"shall be used for Good, not Evil\".

Or, something else?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, likely descriptive but may be either depending on how the deed is drafted, and depending on whether it's in an exhibit that is incorporated by reference into the deed or not. However, what likely governs is not the description/prescription in any event; it is whether your deed allows for an easement and the board has approved it. \n\nMost master deeds for condominiums have what is called an \"Easement of Encroachment\" in the body of deed (usually shortly after the name, description of land, description of building, description of unit(s)), so that each unit has the benefit of an easement of encroachment in the event that said unit (meaning *any* unit) encroaches upon any portion of the common elements of the structure or another unit (encroachment on another unit is only for things like building settling that causes the building lines to move or change slightly \u2013 you can't bump out your closet a foot into your neighbor's room). This easement goes both ways, or vice versa, such that common elements may encroach upon the unit for a variety of different reasons like building maintenance and building settling; i.e., the whole has the same rights.\n\nThe part that is really relevant in your case, however, and is very typical language, is the part that typically states something like: *each unit has and is subject to an easement for the benefit of any other unit, to use and access such elements to encompass wires, ducts, pipes, conduits, cables or any other common elements located in, on, or within the right of any unit such that if improvements to a unit that are within your right under the restrictive covenants (the vote would decide that in your case) then those common elements may be changed to the extent that they do not materially and adversely affect another unit*. This does not mean that another unit does not like it. It means that it would materially change their unit in some way, like the shape of it, the water available to them, etc. You should check the master deed for this. Otherwise, the covenants control and you still should have the right to do this. You may potentially just need to amend the description of your unit. Even if an amendment needs to get filed with the registry of deeds, that is not a big deal.

However, the dissenting trustee claims the project cannot proceed without amending the Master Deed. Which of the following statements is most likely correct?\n\nA) The project cannot proceed without unanimous trustee approval, regardless of the Master Deed's contents.\nB) The chart in the condo docs is prescriptive, and the project cannot proceed without amending the Master Deed.\nC) The project can likely proceed if the Master Deed contains an \"Easement of Encroachment\" clause and the modification doesn't materially affect other units.\nD) The project can proceed without any considerations because the trustees approved it by majority vote.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key factor here is the likely presence of an \"Easement of Encroachment\" clause in the Master Deed. This clause typically allows for modifications to common elements (like plumbing) for unit improvements, as long as they don't materially and adversely affect other units. The trustee approval by majority vote satisfies the governance requirement, and the chart in the condo docs is likely descriptive rather than prescriptive. While an amendment to update the unit description might be necessary, it wouldn't prevent the project from proceeding. Options A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the situation, ignoring the importance of the Master Deed's contents.

This allows regulations to be made for particular sanctions regimes, in this case [The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/contents) and its several amendments, including three revisions this year. Under those regulations, the Secretary of State may designate individuals who are then subject to particular sanctions. A consolidated [list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list) is available for all individuals and organizations who have been named under any of the regulations, not just the Russia one.\n\nWorking backwards from the list, we see such names as Vladimir Putin, who has an asset freeze on the grounds that \\-\n\n> Vladimir Vladimirovich PUTIN is the President of the Russian Federation, carrying ultimate authority for the policy of the Russian government and Russian armed forces. In February 2022, PUTIN ordered Russian military forces to launch an invasion of Ukraine, undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\n\nThus, he has been named for the purposes of [regulation 11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/11), and the statement of reasons (required by [regulation 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/8)) refers to the specific grounds in [regulation 6](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/6) by which a person can be added to the list. In this case, those grounds are 6(2\\)(a)(i) as interpreted by 6(3\\)(a),\n\n> (2\\) In this regulation, an \"involved person\" means a person who \u2014\n>   \n> (a) is or has been involved in\u2014\n>   \n>  (i) destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\n>   \n> ...\n>   \n> (3\\) For the purposes of this regulation, a person is \u201cinvolved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\u201d if\u2014\n>   \n> (a) the person is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\n\nFor \"oligarchs\" who are on the list, the Foreign Secretary has specifically drawn attention to Gennady Timchenko, described as Russia's sixth\\-richest oligarch. The statement of reasons says:\n\n> Gennadiy Timchenko, hereafter TIMCHENKO is a major shareholder in Bank \"Rossiya\". Bank \"Rossiya\" is a key stakeholder in the National Media Group which supports Russian policy which is destabilising Ukraine. Following the annexation of Crimea, Bank \"Rossiya\" has expanded its bank branches and provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol; and offers support to military activities and the formation of major transport links and cards that allow the public to travel easily around the peninsula. Therefore, Bank \"Rossiya\" has supported the consolidation of Crimea into the Russian Federation by integrating the financial system following the annexation of Crimea. TIMCHENKO therefore is or has been involved in engaging in, providing support for, or promoting any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. Additionally, TIMCHENKO is associated with a person involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\n\nThese are the same regulation 6 grounds as for Putin, but with additional reasoning to draw the connection (also, a citation under 6(2\\)(d) for \"associated with\"). One reason for this text being required is to undercut any suggestion that the listing is because of \"guilt by association\". In judicial review, for which continue reading below, this kind of statement and the process that gave rise to it is powerful evidence against a suggestion that the Secretary of State was acting other than rationally.\n\nWe can now look back to the 2018 Act, which authorizes the 2019 Regulations and provides rules about how the Secretary of State can designate people. Detailed provisions in the Regulations trace back to rules in the Act about the shape of a sanctions regime; for example, the \"asset freeze\" of regulation 11 is within [section 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/3) of the Act on \"Financial sanctions\". There are also procedural safeguards around the making of regulations, mainly relating to Parliamentary approval, and around the designation of individuals. For example, a designated person can ask the Secretary of State to be removed from the list, and under [section 22(3\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/22) she must do so if the person doesn't fit the criteria by which they were originally included. That would include if they are no longer an \"involved person\", or if their designation were no longer deemed appropriate based on the purpose of the sanctions regulations.\n\nAs with other executive actions, judicial review is available (under Chapter 4 of the Act), which could bring in considerations of whether the Secretary of State acted within her powers, did so \"reasonably\", etc. Human rights grounds are also possible, in relation to procedural fairness (Article 6\\) or the right to enjoy property (ECHR Protocol 1, Article 1\\). Against those stand arguments on the public interest, UK compliance with international obligations, national security, the general integrity of the sanctions system, and so forth. It is plausible that if a claim reached this point, the Secretary of State would be able to show that the designation \\- as described in the statement of reasons above \\- was on sound policy grounds, was taken after a sober review of the evidence, and was proportionate in the circumstances.\n\nThere is not much case law on the 2018 Act, given its recency. One example is *R (Youssef) v Secretary of State* \\[2021] EWHC 3188 (Admin) in which an Article 6 claim failed. That was in relation to UN sanctions against Al\\-Qaida, which is a different position from the one here, but it has some force for understanding the current UK system. The present Act was created partially in response to the judgement in *HM Treasury v Ahmed* \\[2010] UKSC 2 against a previous version of the sanctions laws, and the 2021 case found that the new version was acceptable. The judicial review avenue and the requirement to give reasons are directly aimed at complying with Article 6\\.

The court does not automatically assume the debt is real (ruling out option A), nor does it typically contact the original creditor directly (ruling out option B). \n\nThe collecting company must present evidence to prove:\n1. The existence of the original debt\n2. Their right to collect on that debt (e.g., proof of purchase from Capital One)\n3. The current amount owed\n\nOption D is incorrect because in legal proceedings, the burden of proof typically falls on the plaintiff, not the defendant. The alleged debtor has the right to challenge the evidence presented but is not required to prove they don't owe the debt as a starting point.\n\nThis question tests understanding of legal procedures in debt collection cases, the concept of burden of proof, and the court's role in verifying claims."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3852/is-there-any-recourse-for-costs-and-consequences-of-police-detention", "docs_id": 3852, "title": "Is there any recourse for costs and consequences of police detention?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Police can detain a suspect for 48\\-72 hours (depending on the state) without filing charges. Note that this is before any judicial scrutiny occurs: I.e., not only are you (supposedly) presumed innocent, but you have not even been indicted and the prosecutor has not even decided whether to seek an indictment. So the standards for detention are extremely low.\n\nFurthermore, [there appears to be no consistent right to communicate with anyone during detention](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2274/you-have-the-right-to-one-phone-call-when-arrested-a-hollywood-myth). You can demand a lawyer if you are interrogated, but the police could instead choose to simply detain you without questioning.\n\nIt seems that the consequences of this to the detainee could be disastrous: Imagine you're a single working mother snatched by the police during your lunch break. Your employer and/or clients don't hear from you for 3 days. Your babysitter can't reach you when you fail to return home at the usual hour. You may miss deadlines for financial matters that could incur enormous direct costs.\n\nDo all of these costs have to be born by the innocent individual?\n\nDoes the state have any obligation to care for your dependents while you are detained?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, there is no recourse. An yes, the potential \"costs\", both personal, financial, social, can be high and are not compensable under an investigatory hold scenario; however, it doesn't usually happen like that. There is no investigatory hold that long without arrest. If the police want to talk to you but don't have enough to arrest you, you can leave any time. If you call your lawyer, he/she will come to the police station and tell the cops to release or arrest you.\n\nIf the police really want you to stay, likely there is probable cause and they can keep you anyway. The police can arrest you and keep you, without a warrant so long as there is \"probable cause\" to believe that a crime has been committed (by you). Once arrested without a warrant, this is what is usually referred to as an investigatory hold, where the law says you must be arraigned within 72 hours (some states it must be 48 hours, 1 day less than supreme court says is reasonable). During this time they can investigate their case against you and decide what, if any, charges they will bring.\n\nThere is no recourse for this, (in the event they bring no charges) unless you can establish that you were held for no reason (including not being falsely identified) and that it was only to intentionally deprive you of your right to liberty.

According to the information provided, there is generally no recourse for compensation in cases of investigatory holds, even if no charges are ultimately filed. The individual would bear the costs and consequences of the detention, including potential job loss, childcare issues, and financial penalties. The only exception would be if the detained person could prove that the detention was entirely baseless and intentionally done to deprive them of liberty, which is extremely difficult to establish. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the state is not obligated to compensate for losses during a legal investigatory hold. \n\nOption B is false because a lawsuit for unlawful detention would not succeed if the police had probable cause, even if charges are not filed. \n\nOption C is a common misconception; there is no guaranteed right to a phone call during detention. \n\nOption D accurately reflects the limited circumstances under which a person might seek recourse for damages resulting from detention without charges."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84050/would-a-tautological-law-have-any-effect", "docs_id": 84050, "title": "Would a tautological law have any effect?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any case where a law saying something like \"Any person who commits theft is guilty of theft\" would have any effect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> \"Any person who commits theft is guilty of theft\"\n\nThis is not tautological. \"Any person who commits theft commits theft\" or perhaps \"Any person who commits theft is a thief\" is tautological. But the hypothetical law as written makes theft something that someone can be *guilty* of, that is, theft is an offence and illegal. The exact consequences depend on other provisions and the legal system itself.\n\nIf a common law jurisdiction abandons common law offences in favour of a criminal code and such code does not contain \"any person who commits theft is guilty of theft\", then theft would be legal (or at least not criminalized by such code).\n\nTheft has to have an operable definition for the law to be effective, but the definition does not have to be explicit in the statutes when there are other sources of laws. The courts are meant to interpret the words in law reasonably, relying on ordinary definitions of expressions, the discernible intention of the legislature, history and social development.\n\nThere can be unconstitutionally (or otherwise unacceptably) vague laws, but in common law jurisdictions, at least the usual crimes like theft and murder have been interpreted by the courts over hundreds of years with a rich body of case law and legal literature.

In common law jurisdictions, courts can rely on existing case law, ordinary definitions, and legal tradition to interpret the meaning of theft, even if not explicitly defined in the statute. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the provision does have a legal effect by establishing theft as a criminal offense.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while some laws can be unconstitutionally vague, common crimes like theft have been interpreted by courts over centuries, providing sufficient clarity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in common law jurisdictions, an explicit statutory definition is not always necessary.

In Germany, copyright (or more precisely, *Author's Right*) can only be held by a *natural person*, which is a legal term of art that essentially means \"human being\".

It is my understanding that the process used by GitHub Copilot is roughly comparable to the process used here. With GitHub Copilot, there have been instances where significant snippets which are part of the training set have appeared in the output with only minor alterations. In this case, it is likely that the original author will have copyright over that portion of the output.\n\nHowever, *IFF* a human being were actually involved in *selecting* specific works, then there is probably a copyright based on the creative decision of selecting *this particular* work and rejecting all the others.
