They often contain quite a lot of personal information about name variations, addresses, DOBs etc. which is usually considered as PII (as soon as it allows identifying a person) and should fall into a regulation of GDPR and similar. However, this data is openly accessed and even aggregated by projects like OpenSanctions.\n\nSo here's the question \\-\\- is it a special exceptional case that data privacy rules do not apply to sanctioned person data, or is it a worldwide violation of data privacy rules (very unlikely)? In a former case, who is authorised to decide that this person's data can be accessed without a restriction?\n\nA more practical question would be, if let's say I want to collect some data about disqualified directors in the UK (<https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk>) or another country, should I apply technical measures in line with the regulation (GRPR for instance) to protect this data in my system (e.g. encrypt it at rest)?\n\nPlease advise if it's an off\\-topic \\& I should move this question to another hub.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a few different grounds under which PII can be handled. Perhaps the most discussed at the moment of GDRP introduction is consent, because of the wave of consent\\-seeking. But there are a number of other grounds. \"Necessary for contract execution\" is a trivial one, to deliver a pizza you'll need an address.\n\nThe relevant ground for sanctions lists is also pretty obvious in hindsight, you may process PII in order to comply with legal obligations. Note that this is still an integral part of the GDPR, not an exception to the GDPR. That means you need to apply all the basic GDPR rules. You need to explicitly store where you got the PII from, for which purpose, and you need to document how you're using it. \n\nNote that this might be hard \\- why do you need to **store** this data?

The general situation is that there is no general situation, and it is necessary to read the law of the country, contemplating for all objects whether their export is allowed or forbidden.

It turns out that paintings, boats and their parts that are older that 50 years old are on the list for Norway, but not Iraq.

You definitely want a lawyer as it is a $500 fine and/or 60 days in jail for your case (property damage, no injury or loss of life).\n\nThe good news is that if you can argue the case correctly, it's very easy to get a Not Guilty verdict. Under Florida Law, a Hit and Run must meet the following criteria to legally find someone guilty:\n\n> 1. Disputes as to the identity of the driver;\n> 2. Lack of knowledge that a crash occurred;\n> 3. Lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property;\n> 4. The failure to stop was not willful, but was dictated by circumstances;\n> 5. The defendant stopped as close as possible to the site of the accident;\n> 6. The other driver refused to receive identifying information\n> 7. The other driver became belligerent, necessitating that the defendant leave the scene to call police;\n> 8. The assistance rendered was \u2018reasonable\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\n\nGiven that you had no lack of knowledge that a crash occurred (2\\) AND lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property (3\\.) AND you would have stopped but for the circumstances of the event prevented you from recieiving knowledge of that the crash had occured (4\\) you already fail to meet 3 of the 8 criteria. This should be easy to argue in and of itself, but where you need a lawyer to assist is in criteria 7\\. While you were never fearing the other driver to such a degree that you needed to call the police, his behavior was interpreted by you as \"road rage\" and you had a reasonable fear to not wish to engage him. It's not rules as written, but it could be that the rules allow for leaving the scene because of the plaintiff's behavior and could be valid in other forms. I'll admit, this will vary wildly on the judge's own interpretation of that rule, BUT it's worth a try.\n\nKeep in mind with all of these, the Prosecution will be required to prove all 8 facts against you, while you only have to disprove one, to some level of doubt. As an armchair jury, I have no facts to support your story, but I have no facts to doubt it either. And when doubt happens, you must assume innocence.\n\nIt would help if you had any hint of the officers attitude at the time. Was he friendly? Dismissive? Distracted? What was the guy who hit you's attitude towards the situation? Was he constantly yelling at you and the officer? Was he quiet and separated?\n\nEither way, get a lawyer because 60 days of jail time and a $500 fine is not something you want to fight by yourself.

For any such *x* and *y* I can imagine that clause occurring in a *pre*nuptial agreement. And it would be enforceable under [contract law](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/contract-law/info) because I suspect that *marriage* is a form of *consideration*.\n\nBut after the marriage has been established, why would anyone unilaterally forfeit a right? I can only think of twothree reasons:\n\n1. The forfeit is mutual: I.e., both spouses agree to an identical clause. *Or*, the spouses agree to substantially equal clauses. (E.g., one spouse forfeits *y* if *x*, and the other forfeits *b* if *a*; where a\u00b7b \u2248 x\u00b7y.)\n2. One spouse requires the contract as a condition of continuing the marriage. However, **I am dubious that this scenario is enforceable**. I.e., if I one day say to my spouse, \"I'm divorcing you unless you agree to give up your marital right to *y*,\" I have a suspicion that such an \"agreement\" might not withstand an artful legal challenge for several reasons: The *consideration* I'm offering is something I already pledged. This is like demanding a contract renegotiation once a counterparty has undertaken work. It *seems* like something that would be ripe for estoppel.\n3. (Thanks to @ohwilleke for noting this one:) The spouse forfeiting a right stands to gain something in exchange. E.g., in order for one spouse to receive an inheritance, the other must disclaim any right to it should the marriage later be dissolved.

However, it notes that practical considerations often make it less likely for parties to agree to certain terms in a postnuptial agreement.

The exception to double jeopardy you're referring to applies to charges from separate sovereigns. When considering whether two entities can both charge someone, you trace back each of them to the sovereign power that gives them their authority. States are considered sovereign, as are Indian tribes with respect to crimes committed by Indians (although for certain serious crimes like murder, Congress arguably stripped tribal courts of jurisdiction with the Major Crimes Act). The United States is of course sovereign.\n\nThe military is *not* sovereign. Military charges are based on the sovereignty of the United States, so double jeopardy applies between military and civilian federal courts. Likewise, US territories (and DC) are not sovereign and have criminal jurisdiction based on the sovereignty of the United States, so territorial (and DC) charges are subject to double jeopardy with each other, with military charges, and with civilian federal charges. That said, double jeopardy only applies if the charges represent the same offense. The UCMJ has offenses with no civilian analog.

In this scenario, double jeopardy does not apply between the state court (California) and federal jurisdictions because they are separate sovereigns. However, the military court and U.S. federal court are both under the sovereignty of the United States, so double jeopardy would apply between these two.

Since then, the friend who owns the company has been dealing with me directly in regards to this matter, without a middleman.\n\nRecently, the owner has contacted me, unilaterally deciding that I have a month to remove my belongings from his unit, or he will remove and dispose of them himself, in addition to suggesting that he will begin to bill me during this time period as well.

There is no contract (implicit or otherwise) between the owner and you. The owner receives no consideration from you in exchange for storing your goods, and an essential element of contracts is an *exchange of considerations*. Thus, he has no obligation to continue storing your goods. \n\nAnother essential element in contract law is that the agreement \\-\\-meaning the conditions thereof\\-\\- be entered knowingly and willfully. Since the time of making the arrangement and up to now, you were reasonably unaware of the likelihood of an obligation to pay the owner. This preempts the owner's right to start billing you.\n\nIf anything, you would need to prove special circumstances to avail yourself of a viable claim of *promissory estoppel*. See [*Havens v.

The company owner has no legal obligation to continue storing the property for free, as there was no formal contract and no exchange of consideration, which is an essential element of a contract.

The company owner can request the removal of the property with reasonable notice but cannot dispose of it without following proper legal procedures.

For example, in Canada and the United States, registering a copyright creates presumptive proof that the copyright exists and is owned by the registrant. In Canada, breathalyzer results are conclusive proof of the blood alcohol concentration if certain conditions are met.\n\nSome of these regimes are not subject to challenge: they are legal facts even if they are not objectively true (e.g. the breathalyser results). Others create presumptions that can be overcome by contrary evidence (e.g. copyright ownership).\n\n### The default: present relevant evidence, including testimonial evidence\n\nBut outside of special regimes, **you prove a fact by introducing evidence**. The default is that **all relevant evidence that bears on a material fact is admissible**. Evidence is relevant when, if is were to be accepted, it would make the fact in issue more or less likely to be true. Evidence comes in many forms: testimony of the parties or witnesses, documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert opinion evidence.\n\nIf you are wondering, \"How do I prove X?\" Ask yourself, why do you believe X? Or, how do you know X? Or, how has the event X left its mark on the world? Whatever has led you to believe X probably is the evidence that you would want to introduce to the court to help prove X. Perhaps you saw X: you can tell the court you saw X. Perhaps you took a photo of X: you can present that photo in court. Perhaps you have a receipt for X: you can show that receipt in court. Perhaps X is a proposition about your own actions: you can tell the court about those.\n\n### Obtaining the evidence\n\nEvidence can be obtained from the other party during the discovery process, or from third\\-parties using subpoenas, subject to objections relating to relevance or privilege.\n\n### Not all (potentially) relevant evidence is admissible\n\nHowever, some evidence will be inadmissible despite it being potentially relevant. I will only present a few categories, some very general and some more specific:\n\n* hearsay (unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay exclusion),\n* privileged material (unless it is a case\\-by\\-case privilege or a discretionary privilege and the person seeking to admit the evidence demonstrates to the judge that it should be admitted),\n* sexual history evidence of a sexual assault complainant when it will be used to support an inference that the complainant is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject\\-matter of the charge or is less worthy of belief (this is because it has been recognized as *not* relevant for this purpose),\n* material that was obtained in contravention of the *Charter* and where the court has decided that the remedy for the *Charter* violation is exclusion of the evidence (in the United States, there is stricter, exclusionary rule),\n* there are many more.\n\nThere are also some meta\\-rules about the evidence that may be used to impugn a witness's credibility, themselves at trial to provide evidence, but for now I am leaving those out of this fairly summary answer.\n\n### Weighing the evidence\n\nThe trier of fact (the judge or a jury) then is to weigh all the admissible evidence, including by weighing the witness and party testimony according to its [credibility and reliability](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/85118/46948) after testing through cross\\-examination, to come to a conclusion on the ultimate question(s) at issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit, the plaintiff is trying to prove that the defendant forged their signature on a contract.

This means that when a landlord transfers their interest in a property (whether voluntarily or through foreclosure), the new owner takes the property subject to existing leases. The lease remains fully binding on both the new owner (such as a mortgagee in possession) and the tenant, with no automatic changes to the terms. This protects the tenant's rights and ensures stability in the rental market. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it would unfairly prejudice tenants' rights.

We immediately reported that over 50% of the jets were not working or working poorly, and were also not adjustable. Since then we've gone back and forth with the seller, with them insisting that they will only replace the jets if we pay several hundred dollars for a warranty trip fee, plus the cost of the jets and labor if they deem the problem not their fault.\n\nI'm unwilling to agree to the above because I don't believe the warranty trip fee is valid, as they have breached the initial contract by not delivering the spa in working order. So this is a contracts issue before a warranty issue (even if I accepted that a \"warranty trip fee\" is anything other than criminally unethical). Further, I'm unwilling to put the determination of whether they are at fault or not solely in their hands, as that gives them complete freedom to avoid responsibility. In any case, both they and the manufacturer are no longer responding to me.\n\nNormally in a case like this I'd look for the next closest authorized servicer, pay them to come out and do the repair, then sue the seller for the cost of said repairs. However, the next closest servicer is 82 miles away and won't go outside their area. And even if we could get the seller to respond, they will not come out unless we agree to the conditions noted above, which I won't agree to as I believe that would constitute a settlement and negate my right to sue for the charges back. So we're now in the position of owning a $6k spa that doesn't work right, and that cannot be serviced (because the seller will no longer respond).\n\nIn this case I'm unsure how to quantify the damages, as no amount of money will allow us to get a spa in working order as agreed upon in the original contract. Do we sue under breach of contract and demand the return of 100% of our money and for them to come take the spa? Is there some legal value placed upon a warranty that we can sue for? Do we hire a non\\-authorized servicer and sue for their cost plus the cost of any future issues caused by them being non\\-authorized? Do we sue under some theory of 'emotional suffering'?\n\nWhat is the appropriate way to quantify this case for submission to small claims, given that the courts cannot technically compel the seller to service our spa?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of issues here. One is whether they can charge a warranty trip fee: that would depend on what the contract says \u2013 such fees are possible (but may be prohibited by state law). Such a charge could be motivated by the manufacturer not compensating a dealer for warranty repair travel (also by granting a low number of hours of compensation for a warranty job). The second is whether you are at fault, the dealer is at fault, or the manufacturer is at fault: and, what evidence is there for that conclusion. A standard approach is to get an independent expert to look at the problem and determine what the probable cause of failure is \u2013 that may however be impossible. In that case, you are pretty much at the mercy of the dealer's employees, who hopefully will write up an accurate assessment of the problem. Especially if the manufacturer and seller are not responding, you can't count on ordinary business goodwill to ease the process.\n\nIf the seller can legally charge a warranty trip fee, then you can't legally force them to perform service without paying the fee. If they *can't* legally charge that fee, then you have a different problem, because they should have come and repaired the unit. They are not, however, obligated to replace the defective stuff or give a refund (without court order), assuming that your state does not have a spa lemon law (I've never heard of such a thing: lemon laws are about new vehicles).\n\nIf the dealer and manufacturer simply refuse to service your unit, the basic scheme would be to get it repaired by someone else (at whatever cost) and sue after the fact for damages \u2013 that's not at all a risk\\-free proposition. Alternatively, you could sue one or both for specific performance, i.e. get the court to force them to fix the problem, but as you know that is beyond the reach of small claims court. Or, you sue for a refund of the sale price (up to the state limit). The sale price should be easy to establish; dealer and seller refusal should be easy to establish (but be sure that you don't extrapolate from \"refuse to do in a way I want\" to \"refuse\"). Having the evidence in hand is mandatory. Evidence of non\\-functioning shouldn't be too hard, and you would also need to show that you are not the cause of the spa not functioning. If they have some fact in their possession that constitutes evidence that you are to blame, you have a right to see that evidence (through discovery), and they can do likewise to you.\n\nIf their refusal is based on your insistence that they drop the trip fee but they will do the work if you pay the fee, then you could do that, and if the fee is not legal, then you can sue to recover that amount. \n\nThere is nothing special about suing for a refund vs. suing for the cost of repair, in terms of what small claims court does.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchased a $6,000 spa that was delivered with over 50% of the jets not working properly.

This is not the case in Wisconsin (at least not usually). So my question is, are there any states/countries you know of where propensity evidence is allowed, whether generally or in exceptional cases?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThe following is in response to @ohwilleke's answer.\n\n> (2\\) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\nThe item *(...) such as proving motive (...)* catches my eye. If I understand correctly, the propensity evidence must suggest motive without invoking an argument reliant on character. Let me explain my (mis)understanding with an example:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for theft. They have a criminal history of theft. The prosecutors say that due to the propensity evidence, the defendant has a thieving character (or more extremely, has kleptomania), and thus, has motives for theft.\n\nIn the above example, the propensity evidence is inadmissible, because it argues **via** character, despite ultimately making a claim about motive.\n\nAn allowed example would then be:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for the theft of ancient Egyptian relics. The defendant has a criminal history of stealing ancient Egyptian relics. The prosecutors use this propensity evidence to suggest the defendant has a collection of Egyptian relics, and/or a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics.\n\nThe first suggestion is not a matter of character, but simply a claim about the defendant possessing a collection. The second suggestion is more borderline, as whether one is to view \"a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics\" as a part of their character, or as merely a non\\-physical possession/quirk is hard to say for me.\n\nSo, is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that propensity evidence can only be circumstantial evidence and that it is generally inadmissible.\n\nBut we should start by clarifying what \"circumstantial evidence\" means. It is not the opposite of legal evidence, but more like the opposite of direct evidence. Direct evidence is evidence that independently establishes a fact in question, while circumstantial evidence is evidence that gives rise to an inference that a fact in question is true. There is a misconception that circumstantial evidence is somehow inadmissible or inferior to direct evidence, but the truth is that the vast majority of evidence is circumstantial.\n\nSo if you are on trial for murder, direct evidence would include your confession, an eyewitness account of the murder, and surveillance video of you killing the victim. Circumstantial evidence would include things like the victim's blood on your clothes, a taxi driver's testimony that he dropped you off at the victim's apartment just before the murder happened, or surveillance video of you exiting the cab and entering the apartment.\n\nPropensity evidence is evidence that a person is likely to have acted one way in this case because they have acted that same way in the past. It is therefore never going to be direct evidence and always going to be circumstantial evidence, because it never explicitly says \"the defendant did it,\" but rather says \"the defendant did it before, so maybe he did it again.\"\n\nThe general rule is that propensity evidence is inadmissible. [Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404). It sometimes comes in anyway, though, for various reasons. If a defendant is facing trespass charges, for instance, a prosecutor would want to introduce evidence that the defendant has previously been convicted of trespassing. The defense will object that it's propensity evidence, but the prosecutor will respond that it's admissible if he's using it to establish something *other than* the likelihood that the defendant did the same thing again. If the prosecutor needs to prove that the defendant knew he was not allowed on the property, the trespass conviction is very strong evidence on that point.\n\nAnother common exception is in sexual\\-assault cases, where some jurisdictions allow this type of evidence. Indeed, Wisconsin is among the states that explicitly permit evidence of the defendant's previous convictions for certain sex crimes to demonstrate that he committed a sex crime again in the current case. [WI Stat \u00a7 904\\.04(2\\)(b)](https://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2012/chapter-904/section-904.04).\n\nLouisiana likewise allows propensity evidence to establish that the defendant has a history of \"sexually assaultive behavior\" or a \"lustful disposition toward children.\" [C.E. 412\\.2\\.](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.2.html) Likewise, the defendant may be able to introduce evidence that the victim previously consented to sex and is therefore likely to have consented to sex in the current case. [C.E. 412](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.html).\n\n**EDIT:**\nTo address your examples, then, I would say that that the first would probably not survive a Rule 404(b) objection, and the second one would stand a better chance. On the second one, the defense should argue that the court should allow evidence of the defendant's interest in Egyptology, but not evidence of the convictions, as that would allow the jury to consider his motive without being diverted into propensity territory. The prosecution should probably counter that the defendant's convictions show more than just the *existence* of a motive, but also the *strength* of that motive, as well as perhaps that the defendant had the prior knowledge and skill that would be necessary to pull off a museum heist. The judge could go probably rule either way without being reversed.\n\nI would clarify one point on how to analyze and characterize this evidence: Rule 404 deals with propensity evidence, i.e., evidence that is meant to demonstrate that a person acted in conformity with his character. Subsection (a) deals with establishing propensity through \"character evidence,\" which is evidence that the defendant's character or character traits are consistent with the conduct in question at trial; while subsection (b) deals with establishing propensity through \"other acts\" evidence, which is evidence that the defendant previously engaged in conduct that is consistent with the conduct at question of trial.\n\nBoth types of evidence \\-\\- character evidence and other\\-acts evidence \\-\\- are inadmissible to establish propensity, but they may be admissible to establish motive, plan, preparation, etc. So when your defendant's previous convictions are offered to prove motive to expand his Egyptology collection and not to establish propensity, the court could allow them into evidence not because they are *admissible* propensity evidence, but rather because they are not propensity evidence at all.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is on trial for the theft of a rare ancient Greek artifact from a museum.

While still related to prior acts, this use of evidence could be admissible under Rule 404(b) exceptions, as it demonstrates the defendant's knowledge, preparation, or plan, rather than simply suggesting a propensity to commit theft.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it still primarily suggests propensity to commit similar crimes, which is generally not admissible.\n\nOption D, while potentially admissible, is less likely to be allowed than option B because it doesn't utilize the specific details of the prior conviction that could be relevant to the current case.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates how prosecutors might use prior act evidence for a purpose other than showing propensity, making it potentially admissible under exceptions to the general rule against propensity evidence."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82161/does-a-company-own-third-party-freebies-given-to-employees-based-on-said-employe", "docs_id": 82161, "title": "Does a company own third-party freebies given to employees based on said employees&#39; status outside the company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a company paid the money for goods/services, and a special extra was provided to the employee on the virtue of the employee's life outside the company, who owns that something extra?

Are the monetary donations collected by the recipient subject to federal taxation according to IRS law? I have looked into this question in the past but did not find an explicit answer.\n\nAlso, if there is a clear answer, do states with personal income taxes do the same regarding website donations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Are the monetary donations collected by the recipient subject to\n> federal taxation according to IRS law?\n\n**Yes.**\n\nUsually, money received from an activity from third\\-parties with no personal relationship to you (assuming that \"you\" are not a tax exempt organization), are taxable income under [Section 61](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61) of the Internal Revenue Code as interpreted by case law, as a form of \"compensation for services\", under I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1\\), or as \"gross income derived from business\", under I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(2\\) (exactly which prong of I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a) it comes under isn't legally relevant for tax purposes in this situation).\n\nThis is also informed by [I.R.C. \u00a7 83(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/83) (which is a general rule even though the balance of the Code section applies mostly to equity compensation in entities), which states in the pertinent parts (material in brackets inserted for clarity):\n\n> If, in connection with the performance of services, property is\n> transferred to any person other than the person for whom such services\n> are performed, the excess of the fair market value of such property .\n> . . over the amount (if any) paid for such property \\[by the person who\n> receives the property], shall be included in the gross income of the\n> person who performed such services\\[.]\n\nBut, gifts are expressly excluded from income under [Section 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/102) of the Internal Revenue Code as interpreted by case law.\n\nOne point which the case law makes clear, however, is that an obligation to pay doesn't need to be a legally binding obligation to make a payment something that counts as income rather than a gift. The tax law instead looks at the substance of the interaction and the reality of how decent, well mannered people would act under circumstances in which they receive an uncompensated benefit.\n\nUltimately, whether are voluntary payment made through a private individual or business's website is taxable income or is not taxable because it is a gift is a case by case determination to be made in light of all of the relevant facts.\n\nFor example, if your mother donates $7,500 to your website on your birthday, even though all of your other \"donations\" are from third\\-parties whom you have never met in person in amounts from $5 to $100 and you have provided all of those other third\\-parties with some kind of service or benefit through your website (e.g. they were allowed to read free webcomics or listen to music you wrote and recorded without charge over the website), the donation from your mother probably counts as a gift, even though the other donations probably count as income taxable income.\n\nBut, in the absence for any reason for the donation other than gratitude for the performance of the services provided by the website, or for the conduct of the business that the website belongs to, the donation will generally be treated as income under Sections 61 and 83, rather than as a gift under Section 102\\.\n\nThe notion of a gift is normally limited by case law and suggestive related section of the Internal Revenue Code that illustrate its intended meaning in the case of gift loans and bargain sales made for donative purposes, to circumstances in which the person making the gift has received nothing in return for it. A donation to a website usually wouldn't meet this test to show a transfer's character as a gift.\n\nThe most familiar example, upon which there is a great deal of case law and authoritative guidance, is that tips paid to restaurant and hospitality industry workers are income rather than gifts, and are subject not only to income taxation but also to FICA payroll taxation. These tipping situations are closely analogous to voluntary payments made through a website.\n\nThere are a great many tax regulations, court cases interpreting tax law, and authoritative guidances from the IRS (such a revenue rulings) that address the basic concepts that I've set forth above. And, the income tax law authorities are further informed by the statutes and case law governing gift taxation, which is, as intended, interpreted to define a gift in a matter that dovetails more or less perfectly with the definition of a gift for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 102\\.\n\nAs the IRS [explains at its website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/gift-tax) discussing the gift tax for which the concept of a gift is defined consistently with the income tax concept of a gift:\n\n> The gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property by one individual to\n> another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return.\n> The tax applies whether or not the donor intends the transfer to be a\n> gift.\n> \n> \n> The gift tax applies to the transfer by gift of any type of property.\n> You make a gift if you give property (including money), or the use of\n> or income from property, without expecting to receive something of at\n> least equal value in return. If you sell something at less than its\n> full value or if you make an interest\\-free or reduced\\-interest loan,\n> you may be making a gift.\n\nDonations which are not income are gifts and there is a tax on gifts given (paid by the donor rather than the person receiving the gift). But, there is a $15,000 per donor per donee exception per year from gift taxation for gifts under the Internal Revenue Code, in addition to more than $12 million per lifetime per person exemption from gift and estate taxation for gifts in excess of this $15,000 amount (called the annual exclusion) and inheritances left at death. So, usually, if a transfer is treated as a gift rather than as income, no tax will be due.\n\nBut this part of this answer's short summary of the law is the top level conceptual framework for all of those other subordinate tax law authorities.\n\nAlso, this income is also subject to self\\-employment taxation, which is imposed in lieu of FICA on income which is not a wage, salary or employment\\-related tip. Often self\\-employment taxes are due on self\\-employment income even when no federal income tax is owed upon it.\n\n> if there is a clear answer, do states with personal income taxes do\n> the same regarding website donations?\n\nMost states and localities with a personal income tax start from the federal definition of income and modify that definition in ways that the taxing jurisdiction deems fit either to make sense (limiting the tax to income related to the state, for example, at least for non\\-residents), or to fit local policy preferences (e.g. exempting from income taxation, capital gains made in an investment in the state favored by state lawmakers).\n\nAlmost no states or localities have chosen to deviate from the federal definition of income for income tax purposes with respect to donations made to websites that are not non\\-profit entities.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John runs a personal blog where he posts free content about gardening.

Read the contract.\n\nThe contract might or might not address this specific situation. Before you approach your counterparty make sure you have a thorough understanding of what the contract stipulates your relative positions are.

If nothing, then fine. You might want to open the negotiations with that offer.\n\n### Also: Study common industry practice\n\nAlso, you should become familiar with how these matters are commonly dealt with in the publishing industry.

This approach aligns with the advice given in the documentation, which emphasizes two key steps:\n\n1. Read the contract to understand your position.

What is the current standing law with regard to non\\-disparagement clauses in contracts? I recall a recent law prohibiting them in terms of service agreements, but what about employment an other (e.g. severance) contracts? Are they legally enforceable? Does California have an anti\\-SLAPP law?\n2. What is the legal definition of disparagement in the context of a non\\-disparagement agreement? Is it like libel in that it is limited to untrue claims, or are any negative and business\\-impacting claims subject to it even if demonstrably true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: California has a law prohibiting non\\-disparagement clauses in consumer transactions.1 The rule tells us that any waivers of the rule are void. We also learn that the penalty is $2500 for the first violation and $5000 for each subsequent. The consumer can bring the lawsuit.\n\nNon\\-disparagement agreements are valid in employment and severance agreements. So, yes, they are enforceable as a matter of law. (But note that the NLRB and the EEOC have recently come out against certain *broadly* worded non\\-disparagement language.)\n\nCA has an anti\\-SLAPP statute.2\n\nThere is no \"legal definition of disparagement in the context of a non\\-disparagement agreement.\" If the term is not defined in the contract the court will likely apply the plain meaning rule. Generally speaking, the plain meaning of disparagement is speaking or writing about the subject in a negative light. As such the term \"disparagement\" will apply to negative speech, regardless of truth. In fact, most non\\-disparagement clauses will include a word like \"criticize.\" The thing is, false negative comments are already a tort which means that you can get sued for those even without the non\\-severance agreement. However, a non\\-disparagement agreement makes it easier for the plaintiff because they do not need to prove damages and they can include liquidated damages in the contract.\n\nThis might be confusing because *disparagement* is a tort recognized in CA.3 \n\n> A claim of disparagement requires a plaintiff to show a\n>  false or misleading statement that (1\\) specifically refers to the\n>  plaintiff's product or business and (2\\) clearly derogates that product\n>  or business.\n\nThe point is that the disparagement prohibited in employment contracts is not the recently\\-defined tort of disparagement but rather the plain definition of disparagement. The disparagement prohibited in employment contracts applies to true statements. (The caveat being that the definition is subject to a definition included in the contract.)\n\n---\n\n1**[Cal. Civ.

Now, if I wanted to sue a government official for violating the 1st amendment (which, to my understanding, does not have an implied cause of action similar to that of *Bivens*), how would that work?\n\nI'm generally very confused about how this all works and interacts with each other.\n\n**Bivens:**\n[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/\\#tab\\-opinion\\-1949369](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/#tab-opinion-1949369)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The case is [Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/#tab-opinion-1949369).\n\nLiability under *Bivens* applies to federal agents who violate a direct constitutional right in a similar way that state officials, or others acting \"under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory\" may be sued under [42 USC \u00a7 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) for any action that causes \"the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\". Section 1983 does not apply to persons acting under federal laws, and thus *Bivens* becomes a counterpart.\n\nIt is true that *Bivens* applies directly to the Fourth Amendment. But it quotes favorably *Bell v. Hood*, 327 U. S. 678 (1946\\), specifically the passages:\n\n> where federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief \\[*at page 684*]\n\nand\n\n> it is . . . well settled that, where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done. \\[*also at page 684*]\n\nNeither of these passages singles out the fourth amendment. Nor does the logic of *Bivens* depend on anything specific to the Fourth amendment, as opposed to the Fifth, the Sixth, or the First.\n\nI don't know if a case has been brought under *Bivens* alleging violation of these or other federal constitutional provisions granting specific rights to individuals. The logic of *Bivens* would require a firm and clear grant of rights, but, for example the Due Process Clause of the fifth is such a grant.\n\nIf the courts were to hold that a particular claim could not be brought under *Bivens* because the Supreme Court has not authorized such an extension of *Bivens*, then *Bivens* itself describes an alternate procedure. The opinion points out that:\n\n> \\[*at Pages 390\\-391*] petitioner may obtain money damages to redress invasion of these rights only by an action in tort, under state law, in the state courts. In this scheme, the Fourth Amendment would serve merely to limit the extent to which the agents could defend the state law tort suit by asserting that their actions were a valid exercise of federal power: if the agents were shown to have violated the Fourth Amendment, such a defense would be lost to them, and they would stand before the state law merely as private individuals. Candidly admitting that it is the policy of the Department of Justice to remove all such suits from the state to the federal courts for decision, respondents nevertheless urge that we uphold dismissal of petitioner's complaint in federal court and remit him to filing an action in the state courts in order that the case may properly be removed to the federal court for decision on the basis of state law.\n\nThis procedure the Court rejected in *Bivens* as unneeded, but it did not say that such a procedure could not be followed.\n\nI would think that the logic of *Bivens*should extend to the invasion, by federal officials (other than judicial officers), of any right explicitly and specifically granted to individuals under the constitution. But one can never tell how the courts will react when asked to extend a previous decision.\n\nThe *Bivens* did not **create**a cause of action, or at least it did not purport to do so. It simply held that the longstanding rights grantef under the Fourth Amendment could result in money damages even n the absence of a specific statute providing for such damages. The *Bivens* Court wrote:\n\n> \\[*at Page 403 U. S. 402*] The contention that the federal courts are powerless to accord a litigant damage for a claimed invasion of his federal constitutional rights until Congress explicitly authorizes the remedy cannot rest on the notion that the decision to grant compensatory relief involves a resolution of policy considerations not susceptible of judicial discernment. Thus, in suits for damages based on violations of federal statutes lacking any express authorization of a damage remedy, this Court has authorized such relief where, in its view, damages are necessary to effectuate the congressional policy underpinning the substantive provisions of the statute. *J. I. Case Co. v. Borak*, 377 U. S. 426 (1964\\); *Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen \\& Enginemen*, 323 U. S. 210, 323 U. S. 213 (1944\\). Cf. *Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States*, 389 U. S. 191, 389 U. S. 201\\-204 (1967\\)\n\nThe OP wrote in a comment:\n\n> What's the point of Bivens if causes of action still exist for amendments like the 1st Amendment, that are not part of Bivens? What's the difference between suing somebody under the 4th amendment through Bivens, and suing somebody under the 1st amendment?\n\nThis is merely a matter of terminology. If the US Supreme Court now recognizes a right to sue **for money damages** directly under the First Amendment, that will be called \"an extension of *Bivens*\". If it rules that such a suit would need a new law from Congress to authorize it (as Sec 1983 authorizes suits against state officials), that would be cal;led \"refusing to extend *Bivens*.

The fake Badal was actually Nirmal, the father of the murder victim, who of course recorded the whole conversation including the confession. He calls the police, and the credits roll.\n\nIt's a compelling movie but this struck me. Nirmal was deceiving Naina by impersonating a lawyer, which is a crime. But he had nothing to lose, he wanted to get justice for his dead son. And because he is not a police officer or official part of the prosecution in any way, this evidence wouldn't be inadmissible for being bad police practise, I would think ([this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8542/can-police-trick-you-into-a-confession-by-pretending-to-be-a-lawyer) says that the police cannot impersonate a lawyer to gain evidence, but Nirmal is not police).

Superior courts in the UK have been scrupulous in saying that each case turns on its merits.\n\nThe \u201ccircumstances in which the evidence was obtained\u201d are certainly suss and would not be permitted by a police officer who is required to warn the suspect and advise them of their right to silence. However, that is not sufficient to exclude the evidence.\n\nThe court also needs to consider whether it would have \u201csuch an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\u201d If the confession is the only evidence then admitting it would clearly be unfair. However, if the Crown has mountains of other evidence, then the confession may only have a small probative value.\n\nThere is no \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine in the UK\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFar more likely is that the Crown would not even seek to introduce the confession. It would just slow the trial and give the defence grounds for an appeal.\n\nInstead, they would use the confession to inform their investigation and get other evidence to convict.\n\nLegal privilege\n---------------\n\nIn England and Wales, legal advice privilege only applies where there is a lawyer present. If Badal is a lawyer, then the privilege attaches; if he isn\u2019t then it doesn\u2019t, irrespective of what he led Naina to believe. The same would be true even if Badal believed he was a lawyer but, for some reason, was not licenced in E\\&W.\n\nLitigation privilege is a broader concept and covers all advice, including from non\\-lawyers, where litigation (including criminal prosecution) has commenced or is reasonably likely. Based on the description, Naina has been committed to stand trial so everything she said is covered by privilege and is inadmissible.\n\nWhy bother doing this?\n----------------------\n\nMost criminals are not sophisticated and will often implicate themselves if you give them enough space without the police or others violating any rules.\n\nAnecdotally, I have a relative who was a psychologist for a remand prison \\- prisoners charged but not yet tried. At the start of every meeting with a prisoner they would say \u201cI work for the state, nothing you say is confidential and it can be used against you\u201d \\- they still had prisoners confess to crimes they weren\u2019t charged with, name accomplices, and tell where the loot was hidden.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK legal system, regarding the admissibility of a confession obtained through deception by a private individual (not a police officer), which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Such a confession would always be inadmissible in court due to the deceptive means used to obtain it.\n\nB) The confession would automatically be admissible as evidence since it wasn't obtained by law enforcement.\n\nC) The court has discretion to decide on the admissibility of the confession based on all circumstances and its potential effect on the fairness of proceedings.\n\nD) The confession would be protected by legal privilege and thus inadmissible, regardless of who obtained it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

If infringement can be proved, the copyright holder has two options:\n\n1. Recover \"actual damages\" *plus* any profits that were attributable to the infringement. So suppose Alice licenses her free software under copyleft. Bob uses it in violation of the license to create a product which he sells. Even though Alice was not going to make any money by selling the software herself (so her actual damages are zero), she can still recover whatever profits Bob made from his sales. She doesn't have to prove that she was damaged; all she has to do is show that Bob earned revenue attributable to the infringement (and then it is up to Bob to show how much of that revenue went to expenses instead of profit).\n2. Recover statutory damages. The law specifies statutory damages of $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, to be determined by the court; this can be increased to $150,000 if the infringement was willful, or reduced to $200 if the infringer had no reason to know he was doing so. Again, it doesn't matter that Alice didn't suffer any actual damages, and she doesn't have to prove that she did. It also doesn't matter whether Bob profited from his infringement in any way, and again Alice doesn't have to prove that he did.\n\nSo Alice certainly has options to make Bob suffer for his infringement even if she didn't suffer any financial damage.\n\nI don't know the situation for EU law, so I'll let someone else address it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under US copyright law, a software developer releases their code under a copyleft license.

You can obtain a [replacement card](https://oig.ssa.gov/report-fraud-waste-or-abuse/what-cant-oig-investigate) from SSA at any time, and they do not require a justification for a card (they do not investigate thefts). The local police can investigate, but will only investigate a theft (not a simple loss). Their interest would be in prosecuting the perpetrator (and possibly retrieving the stolen property). In the course of investigating, the police will ask (in some form) if you have a clue where it is, and if you do not admit that you know where it is, they can prosecute you, because that would violate your state's version of the false statement law (Washington example [here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.76.175)).\n\nThe physical card is not so important: loan applications etc. don't require producing a physical SS card: what they need is the number on the card.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John's ex-wife has his Social Security card and is not returning it despite his requests.

This is important, among other reasons, because the standing requirements of the federal courts do not apply with full force to state courts applying state law.\n\nOne important constitutional issue in this context would be who has standing to enforce such a duty, since standing is a matter of the subject\\-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n\nCurrent standing jurisprudence does not allow for \"citizen standing\" or \"taxpayer standing\" nor does it usually allow individual members of the U.S. House or U.S. Senate to have standing, nor does it usually allow one part of the Executive branch to sue another part of the Executive branch of the United States government. In most cases, this means that if the President's actions cause only generalized fiscal harm to the United States as a whole, that no individual could have standing.\n\nOne exception might be for a [*qui tam* action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam) in which an individual is deputized to act as a prosecutor for the United States government itself (with the relief obtained payable to the United States) in a civil action in exchange for a statutorily determined contingent fee related to the amount recovered. I'm not familiar with the constitutional dimensions of standing in such cases, which is mostly obscure at the outer limits because the existing statutes that authorize this have been upheld on a piecemeal basis with other their particular procedural details (including a right of the Justice Department to take over such lawsuits against private parties) and the fact that these suits are usually limited to suits against people other than government officials. It is closely related to the largely open question of whether, contrary to Justice Department policy, it is constitutional to bring federal criminal charges against a sitting President.

In 1789, the First Congress instructed the Secretary of State with the duty of printing new statutes at least three newspapers, and the current law puts it in the hands of the Archivist of the United States; in between, there have been variations.\n\nOn March 3, 1811, Congress passed [a law](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_2/11th_Congress/3rd_Session/Chapter_47) saying simply:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this act, and the act passed during the present session of Congress, entitled \u201cAn act to enable the President of the United States, under certain contingencies, to take possession of the country lying east of the river Perdido, and south of the state of Georgia and the Mississippi territory, and for other purposes,\u201d and the declaration accompanying the same, be not printed or published, until the end of the next session of Congress, unless directed by the President of the United States, any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nThis overrode the normal publication rules in order to hide the existence of the cited earlier law, and of its own existence. The proceedings in Congress also took place in secret session, including the signing of the bills by the President, James Madison. As the title suggests, the earlier statute authorized Madison to use military force to take possession of the disputed territory (which was also claimed by Spain), establish a provisional government there, and use $100k of newly appropriated funds to do so. A further law of 1813, with the same secrecy provision, extended the territory and gave $20k more.\n\nThese statutes were not published until 1818, after the war had ended and a further law reformed the publication of statute law in general. The supposed secrecy was also compromised in practice by the fact that the annexation of West Florida was widely known once it started happening.\n\nAs far as we know, Congress has not experimented any further with suspending publication of its legislative activity. It is allowed to meet in secret session, and the Constitution allows secret material to be omitted from the official journal. Nowadays, we know pretty well when secret sessions have taken place, even if we don't know what happened during them. It would be practically very hard for Congress to hide the fact that it had met and passed a law.\n\nThe closest modern counterpart is not a secret *act*, but the use of a \"classified schedule of authorizations\" or \"classified annex\" to direct spending on things that Congress does not wish to reveal. For example, in the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ103/PLAW-117publ103.pdf) (1068 page PDF), there are references like:\n\n* \"there is appropriated $125,000,000, for an additional amount for 'National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund', to remain available until September 30, 2024, which shall only be used for the acquisition and retention of certain materials, as specified in the classified annex accompanying this Act\"\n* \"The amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 101 for the conduct of the intelligence activities of the elements listed in paragraphs (1\\) through (17\\) of section 101, are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations prepared to accompany this division.\"\n\nThe second bullet point covers billions of dollars of total spending, but it is not revealed that we are spending $7\\.18bn on a project to explode the moon, or whatever. So in this appropriations case, your hypothetical is pretty real: Congress could pass emergency legislation authorizing spending on something, without revealing what the something was.\n\nOther kinds of laws would raise their own issues. For example, a secret criminal statute would very likely fall foul of the Constitutional prohibition on *ex post facto* laws. The concept of a secret law is in many ways objectionable \\- natural justice, interference with democratic accountability, etc. \\- which makes it politically difficult as well as legally questionable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In 1811, Congress passed a secret law related to the War of 1812. Which of the following statements best describes the nature and implications of this law?\n\nA) The law was permanently classified and never revealed to the public, setting a precedent for ongoing secret legislation.\n\nB) The law authorized the President to take possession of disputed territory and allocated funds for this purpose, but its existence and content were temporarily kept secret.\n\nC) The law was immediately published in newspapers as required by the 1789 statute, but its content was encoded to maintain secrecy.\n\nD) The law established a new procedure for Congress to pass all future wartime legislation in closed sessions without public disclosure.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In 1811, Congress passed a secret law that authorized President James Madison to take possession of disputed territory (specifically, the area east of the Perdido River and south of Georgia and Mississippi territory) and allocated $100,000 for this purpose. The law's existence and content were kept secret temporarily, with publication prohibited until the end of the next Congressional session unless directed by the President. This secrecy was maintained to avoid alerting Spain, which also claimed the territory in question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law was eventually revealed to the public in 1818, after the war had ended.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the law specifically overrode the normal publication rules, preventing its immediate publication in newspapers.\n\nOption D is incorrect because this law did not establish a new general procedure for all future wartime legislation. It was a specific instance of secret legislation related to a particular territorial dispute and military action.\n\nThis question tests understanding of historical precedents for secret laws, the balance between national security and public disclosure, and the specific circumstances surrounding the 1811 secret law related to the War of 1812."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71285/is-apple-scanning-user-content-for-child-abuse-a-violation-of-gdpr", "docs_id": 71285, "title": "Is Apple scanning user content for child abuse a violation of GDPR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to this [article](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/) Apple is scanning all the photos users have on their devices to detect possible child abuse.

They also left out audio messages from the bill. The changes prompted Sippel, who was negotiating on behalf of the Parliament, to sign off on the bill.\n\nSo YMMV, but insofar it looks pretty legal unless a court decides otherwise.\n\nIt seems Apple went public with their plan after this EU law was passed, so they probably took it into account.\n\n---\n\nFor what's that worth, there's [an analysis](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rhw8c/download) from someone at Cambridge (in the Compliant and Accountable Systems Group, Department of Computer Science and Technology) that:\n\n> EU law would\n> require that Apple obtain the consent of individual iPhone users for on\\-device scanning. This\n> consent would need to be opt\\-in, rather than opt\\-out; there would need to be a real\n> possibility for users to refuse consent; users\u2019 access to iCloud could not be made conditional\n> on giving consent to CSAM Detection; and users must be able to withdraw consent without\n> suffering loss of iCloud service. This may place a welcome brake on the deployment of on\\-\n> device CSAM detection in the EU. However, these barriers may be removed by future EU or\n> Member State legislation \u2013 just as similar potential barriers for automated CSAM detection\n> by certain messaging services have already been removed by EU legislation.\n\nSo it seems that there would be a way for Apple to do this \"device scanning\" even in the EU with user (clickwrap) agreement...\n\nThe paper enumerates the things than can be made implicit (bundled) in a GDPR agreement, and then goes on to argue that probably none of these apply to Apple's CSAM on device, and so they'll probably need a separate checkbox for CSAM... which the paper's author is pretty sure the users would not check.\n\n> Importantly, because consent must be specific, consent to one purpose (such as processing\n> to detect CSAM) can\u2019t be presumed from consent to another purpose (such as processing\n> for cloud backup). Nor can consent to processing to detect CSAM be \u2018bundled\u2019 with\n> consent to cloud backup. GDPR strongly indicates that \u2018bundling\u2019 \u2013 the practice of making\n> access to a service conditional on giving consent to processing that is not necessary for that\n> service \u2013 is not permitted. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> It is unlikely in the extreme that even minimally informed holders of CSAM would give\n> consent to Apple\u2019s CSAM Detection system.\n\nThe paper more tenuously (IMHO) argues then that Apple needs do the same for their server\\-side scanning in the EU, i.e. get explicit consent, because it's somehow tied to the on\\-device scanning via the iCloud account. (The author also makes their personal disapproval of CSAM in all forms more explicit towards the end of the paper.) But still that someone who disapproves of CSAM entertains that it might be deployed via clickwrap user consent (albeit with a separate checkbox) is noteworthy.\n\nIn this context I'll note (even though the paper doesn't), that there is a 2019 CJEU [decision](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/top-european-court-rules-pre-checked-cookie-consent-boxes-invalid) that pre\\-checking certain kinds of checkboxes (like for \"nonessential\" cookies) is not legal. I suspect\nCSAM will fall in this kind of category... so they won't be able to have the checkbox for it pre\\-checked, unless Apple does something more devious and make it so that image hashes become \"essential\" to something else that the user would more readily like to agree to...\n\nAlso, looking at a current (August 1\\) [Apple description](https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf) of their system, it seems they *only* plan to run the image hashing *on the device* (and upload a threshold\\-encrypted version of the result, so that only multiple, cumulative \"hits\" on several images would be detectable/decryptable on the server), which would basically make their system (as currently envisaged) inoperable without the local hash step. I've also looked at Commission's 70\\-page [impact assessment](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_STU(2021)662598) for their most recent proposal (the one discussed at the beginning of this answer), but it only discusses things like PhotoDNA and server\\-side hashing. So I guess they were unware that someone might plan to do \\[only] client\\-side hashing as part of a CSAM design.\n\nIf this goes to an EU court, I guess an issue will be *when* and why iOS would create those (threshold\\-encrypted) vouchers that contain the images hashes, e.g. if they'd be considered an essential part/step of an otherwise approved purpose...", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Apple's CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) detection system and its compliance with EU privacy laws?\n\nA) Apple's CSAM detection system is fully compliant with GDPR and can be implemented without any additional user consent.\n\nB) Apple's CSAM detection system is illegal under EU law and cannot be implemented under any circumstances.\n\nC) Apple's CSAM detection system may be legal in the EU, but would likely require separate, opt-in user consent that is not bundled with other services.\n\nD) Apple's CSAM detection system is automatically permitted under recent EU legislation allowing platforms to detect child abuse material.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided suggests that while recent EU legislation allows for some forms of child abuse material detection, Apple's specific CSAM system would likely face additional hurdles under GDPR. An analysis from a Cambridge researcher indicates that EU law would require Apple to obtain separate, opt-in consent from users for on-device scanning. This consent cannot be bundled with other services like iCloud, and users must have a real possibility to refuse without losing access to other services.

Option B is wrong because offers can only be withdrawn until they are accepted, and in this case, Person Y has already accepted. Option D is incorrect because signing the original contract as-is constitutes acceptance, not a counter-offer. A counter-offer would only occur if Person Y had made changes to the contract before signing."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15919/can-parents-throw-out-belongings-you-have-kept-in-their-house", "docs_id": 15919, "title": "Can parents throw out belongings you have kept in their house?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I moved away for school when I was 19\\.

You can try to get money by suing your parents. But suing your parents is rarely a good long term strategy.

I think the \"inhabitants registry\" (Einwohnermeldeamt) is not allowed to give you her first address in Spain (\"Zuzugsanschrift im Ausland\") (\u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45 Bundesmeldegesetz (BMG)).\n\nThe best option I see is a court auction (Zwangsversteigerung), more precise a \"Teilungsversteigerung\". If one of S's siblings want money for the land, he can ask for a court auction at the local court (Amtsgericht). The court will get S's first address in Spain (\u00a7 34 BMG) and if it cannot deliver its letter to S, there will be a \"public delivery\" (\u00f6ffentliche Zustellung) through a posting in court. It would take a while, but in the end the land could be yours.\n\nBe prepared that the cost for the court auction will be much higher than the 1000\u20ac. If you plan to take this way, ask a lawyer for detailed advice. Also you need one of S's siblings to participate in the process.\n\nIf the trees are really a danger for your house, the heirs could also have an obligation to remove them.
