I just received an email stating:\n\n> For the record, I need to advise that there would have been opportunity to extend your contract so this would be a resignation rather than redundancy matter.\n> \n> \n> On that basis, please can you submit your formal resignation to ...\n\nRegarding the \"there would have been opportunity to extend your contract\", all I can say is that my boss offered me the possibility of extending the contract \"for some time\" (less than a year), but for personal reasons I need to move to a different town. In any case, I never received a **formal** extension offer. Perhaps more importantly, because I rejected the \"extension offer\", my employeer will hire a replacement.\n\nNow, is this an unfair request, perhaps asking for myself to renounce redundancy (or other) rights? The [official information](https://www.gov.uk/fixed-term-contracts/employees-rights) in the UK government website about fixed\\-term contracts states:\n\n> Anyone who\u2019s worked continually for the same employer for 2 years or more has the same redundancy rights as a permanent employee.\n\nFurther on, regarding [ending a fixed\\-contract](https://www.gov.uk/fixed-term-contracts/renewing-or-ending-a-fixedterm-contract), it says:\n\n> If a contract isn\u2019t renewed\n> ===========================\n> \n> \n> This is considered to be a dismissal, and if the employee has 2 years\u2019 service the employer needs to show that there\u2019s a \u2018fair\u2019 reason for not renewing the contract (eg, if they were planning to stop doing the work the contract was for). ...\n> \n> \n> They **may be** entitled to statutory redundancy payments after 2 years\u2019 service if the reason for non\\-renewal is redundancy. \\[emphasis mine]\n\nSo, there seems to be a difference between dismisal and redundancy. In fact, the [official UK government](https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights) website regarding redundancies states:\n\n> Redundancy is a form of dismissal from your job. It happens when employers need to reduce their workforce.\n\nSo, it seems ending of fixed\\-contract **is not** per se reason for redundancy, specially given that the employer will hire someone for my position.\n\nMy questions now:\n\n* is my analysis correct? This is, am I not entitled to redundancy rights?\n* should I send a resignation message for a fixed\\-term contract, if it is evident the contract is to finish anyway?\n* if not, why would I be asked to do so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As I understand it, the legal distinction here is: \n\n**Whose choice was it that you not continue in your job?**\n\nIf the company was prepared to offer you an extension, until you told them that you were not interested, you are leaving of your own free will, and would not be entitled to redundancy rights. If your employer did not extend the contract when you would have been willing to continue, that is either a redundancy, or a dismissal of another kind. If you were dismissed for valid cause, you have no redundancy rights. if you were let go because of a lack of work, or because the employer decided not to have anyone doing that job, that I gather would be redundancy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An employee on a fixed-term contract in the UK is approaching the end of their contract.

In option A, the employee is choosing to leave despite an offer to stay. In option C, this would be a dismissal for cause, not redundancy. Option D is the employee's choice to leave early.

But state legislatures had the power to change that rule if they chose to.\n\nIn March 1790, Congress passed \u201cAn act to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\u201d which established that children born to American men abroad or at sea were still considered \u201cnatural born citizens.\u201d It also provided rules and procedures for those who immigrated to become citizens, providing:\n\n> That any Alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within . . . the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen.\u201d\n\nSuch would\\-be citizens had also to prove possession of \u201cgood character\u201d and swear an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. The details were changed from time to time, but the general nature of the requirements remained unchanged all through the 18th and 19th centuries. \n\nIn the 1844 New York case *Lynch v. Clarke*, a court held that a daughter born in New York state to Irish parents was considered a U.S. citizen, even though her parents returned to Ireland. \n\n> \\[B]y the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever were the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. . . . The term citizen, was used in the constitution as a word, the meaning of which was already established and well understood. The only standard which then existed . . . was the rule of the common law, and no different standard has been adopted since.\n\nSo that rule (*jus soli*) was not in practice changed much by the 14th, but it was made explicit and unchangeable except by later amendment. Laws on naturalization remain subject to Congressional action, and have been changed at various times.\n\nSee also [this question here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33056/what-is-the-meaning-of-and-subject-to-the-jurisdiction-thereof-in-the-14th-ame/33057#33057) and its answers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the effect of the 14th Amendment on U.S. citizenship laws?\n\nA) It established the first federal rules for naturalization and birthright citizenship.\n\nB) It eliminated all state laws regarding citizenship and made it solely a federal matter.\n\nC) It constitutionalized birthright citizenship and removed ethnic barriers to citizenship, while leaving naturalization laws subject to Congressional action.\n\nD) It granted citizenship exclusively to former slaves and their descendants, with no impact on other groups.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The 14th Amendment had a significant impact on U.S. citizenship laws, but it's important to understand its specific effects. Option C is correct because:\n\n1. It constitutionalized the principle of birthright citizenship (jus soli), which was previously based on common law and state practices.\n2. It removed barriers to citizenship based on national origin or ethnicity, most notably granting citizenship to African Americans, including former slaves.\n3. While it made these major changes, it did not completely federalize all aspects of citizenship. Naturalization laws remained under Congressional control and subject to change.\n\nOption A is incorrect because federal rules for naturalization existed before the 14th Amendment, dating back to 1790. Option B overstates the amendment's reach, as it did not eliminate all state involvement in citizenship matters.

According to Ontario tenancy laws, when a tenant provides an N9 form, they are required to give at least 60 days' notice, which in this case would extend to January 4, 2020.

A specific recording or text could be subject to copyright protection, but that site isn't obviously doing that. An analogous case arose in Paramount, CBS v. Axanar, where Paramount attempted to claim copyright ownership of the Klingon language (Paramount apparently saw the wisdom of the counterargument, which is why I use the past tense). A legal brief is [here](https://popehat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/035-1-Brief-of-Amicus-Curiae.pdf), explaining why that premise is \"meq Hutlh\".\n\nIn the case of Droidspeak, it is unclear what the basis of the \"translator\" is. Klingon stems from published grammar and dictionary (plus typeface) created as a work for hire, so there are limits to how much of the grammar and dictionary you can copy. We might assume that Droidspeak was similarly specified, and that this website implements the specification: anyone can then generate Droidspeak utterances, if they have the technical know\\-how. In that case, there is no copyright protection. Or we might assume that the sound derives from actual copying from the movies \u2013 that would be copyright infringement. (That is, original sounds are edited out as \"letters\" and automatically recombined by the program). A third possibility is that the squawks just resemble the movie squawks (and would not be infringing). So the answer depends on what the translator actually does.\n\nFrom the perspective of the person using the translator, the main concern would be whether a particular use is consistent with the terms of service. In this case, there are no terms, so you may do whatever you want with their tool (as long as you can legally do the thing without the website).

There are several possibilities:\n\n1. If the translator is based on a published specification of droid-speak (similar to Klingon), and implements this specification without directly copying sounds from the movies, it's likely legal to use.\n\n2. If the translator is cutting and recombining actual sounds from Star Wars movies, it could be considered copyright infringement.\n\n3. If the translator is generating sounds that merely resemble movie sounds without copying them, it might not infringe on copyrights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes definite copyright violation, which isn't necessarily the case. Option B oversimplifies the issue, as even sounds not directly copied from movies could potentially infringe on copyrights if they're based on copyrighted specifications.

In this case the device uses Bluetooth not WiFi, and it is not connected to the internet, so this should not apply... unless maybe?\n\nI'm definitely not planning to buy one of these (nor prank it) anyway, so I'm not focusing on any particular jurisdiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is legal for a manufacturer to sell a device which is capable of being misused. For example, a wifi\\-capable router can be sold even if it is \"open\" by default. A Bluetooth device has a shorter range than wifi, but in principle can connect to any other device. An owner's legal liability is not different given wifi vs. Bluetooth.\n\nWhether or not there is criminal liability for a third person who connects to the device also does not specifically depend on whether the device uses Bluetooth technology, as opposed to some other technology. [18 USC 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030) is the general federal law prohibiting \"unauthorized access\". In the case of a bed, two legal question arise: is it a [\"computer\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-599163109-692694671&term_occur=999&term_src=), and is it [\"protected\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-695191731-692694672&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:47:section:1030)? It is an electronic high speed data processing device which performs logical, arithmetic, storage and communications facilities, i.e. it is a computer (in the legal sense). It *probably* is not protected, because it is not \"used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication\", that is, it is not connected to the internet (unless it is). State laws tend to be broader, not having the \"interstate commerce\" limitation, so accessing the bed would violate [Washington's](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.90&full=true) analog of the federal law. However, under Washington law, the access is probably not \"without authorization\". That term is defined as\n\n> knowingly circumvent technological access barriers to a data system in\n> order to obtain information without the express or implied permission\n> of the owner, where such technological access measures are\n> specifically designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals\n> from obtaining such information, but does not include white hat\n> security research or circumventing a technological measure that does\n> not effectively control access to a computer. The term \"without the\n> express or implied permission\" does not include access in violation of\n> a duty, agreement, or contractual obligation, such as an acceptable\n> use policy or terms of service agreement, with an internet service\n> provider, internet website, or employer. The term \"circumvent\n> technological access barriers\" may include unauthorized elevation of\n> privileges, such as allowing a normal user to execute code as\n> administrator, or allowing a remote person without any privileges to\n> run code.\n\nOne question is whether there is any technological access barrier that the user circumvents (I don't know if it is possible to circumvent \"hidden mode\"). Since the term \"may include ... allowing a remote person without any privileges to run code\", and since playing music on speakers involves running code, then the remote user may be criminally liable. On the third hand, the language of that paragraph (\"technological access measures are specifically designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining such information, but does not include ... circumventing a technological measure that does not effectively control access to a computer\") clearly indicates a legislative intent to address deliberately overcoming active access barriers and not accidentally connecting to an unprotected, open system. Plus, the law also says that you are accessing the computer \"in order to obtain information\", but that is not the purpose of transmitting sound to speakers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A person connects to a Bluetooth-enabled bed base from outside the owner's house and plays loud music through its speakers at 3 AM.

Would such a contract have any effects? If the things he agreed to were enforceable but mine weren't, would he still have to do them even if I didn't?\n\nFor example, the landlord rented out a storage area to an extra person. He said he would somehow share the money to lower others costs, but the details were never clear and weren't in writing. When he did not share the money, I reminded him he had agreed to. His response was \"I will share it if you agree not to undermine my leadership or complain\" (these were literally the words he used). If I agreed to these terms what would happen? I give this example assuming undermining leadership isn't legally enforceable. Now that litigation has started, can I present this as evidence of some kind?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A promise that a court would not enforce by injunction can still be valid consideration and be part of a valid contract. Failure to carry out such obligations would lead to some measure of money damages, most likely. \n\nOn the other hand, provisions specifically barred by law, or against public policy, such as a promise to commit a crime, are void from the start, and form no part of a valid contract. Such provisions may be treated by a court as if they had just been left out, or if they were essential to the contract, or formed the sole consideration, the whole contract might be considered void.\n\nIf a term is too vague for a court to determine if it has been violated or not, the court may try to clarify it, or may just ignore it. Just what it would mean for a tenant to \"undermine the leadership\" of a landlord is not clear to me, at least. That might well be held to be \"too vague\".

What is the origin and meaning of such a practice?\n\nThis can help answer similar questions. For example, are there religious connotations connected to raising one's right hand?

See for example Genesis 14:22, or Exodus 6:8\\. Some other times when hands are lifted up in the Bible, it's an expression of power. These concepts are linked in that an oath involves appealing to divine power to witness what is promised (and to punish the speaker if they break it).\n\nThe story that it comes from forcing witnesses or the accused to display brands is false. While branding was used historically to mark certain criminals, these marks were not often on the palm of the hand, but could be on the cheeks or chest or elsewhere. Courts have never asked witnesses to remove their shirts while taking an oath. Even in the era when branding was used, checking for the marks would not be applied to all witnesses, but perhaps just to the accused.\n\nIn contemporary practice, raising the hand is optional, and the oath or affirmation is taken as \"good\" if the court is satisfied that the witness is taking it seriously. Raising the hand might be seen as a gesture of respect for the law and not necessarily any particular religious tradition. Raising the hand while affirming is not unusual, nor even a mixed signal: affirmation arose because of Quakers wishing to observe the Biblical command \"swear not at all\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The practice of raising one's right hand before taking an oath or making an affirmation in court has its origins in:\n\nA) Ancient Roman legal customs\nB) Biblical precedent and religious tradition\nC) Medieval European branding of criminals\nD) 18th-century Quaker practices\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Biblical precedent and religious tradition. The practice of raising one's right hand before taking an oath or making an affirmation in court can be traced back to Biblical references, such as those found in Genesis 14:22 and Exodus 6:8. This gesture is linked to the concept of appealing to divine power as a witness to one's promise or statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the practice is not specifically tied to ancient Roman legal customs.\n\nOption C is a common misconception. While branding was used historically to mark certain criminals, this practice was not the origin of raising one's right hand in court. The idea that it was used to display brands on the palm is false.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Quakers did influence the practice of affirmation as an alternative to swearing an oath, they did not originate the gesture of raising the right hand. In fact, Quakers sought to avoid swearing oaths altogether, following the Biblical command to \"swear not at all.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that in contemporary practice, raising the hand is optional and is seen more as a gesture of respect for the law rather than a strictly religious act.

The [most recent proposed update of the law](http://pmg-assets.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/NA_bills2017_bill06B-2017.pdf), slightly clarifies that issue saying (Chapter II)\n\n> (3\\) For purposes of subsection (2\\),\"unauthorised\" means that the\n>  person\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) is not himself or herself lawfully entitled to secure access;\n> \n> \n> (b) does not have the lawful consent of another person who is lawfully\n>  entitled to secure access; or\n> \n> \n> (c) exceeds his or her entitlement or consent, to secure access, to\n>  data, a computer program, a computer data storage medium or a computer\n>  system.\n\nStill, this does not clarify whether account\\-sharing constitutes limited permission to access the data.

If they could, do they not do it because they are unlikely to win or are there other reasons? Also I have very little background in law so please explain it in detail, I'm not even sure what the difference between the two are. Please stay on topic of the question. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a lawsuit would be unsuccessful in the United States, given the numerous barriers imposed by the First Amendment.\n\n1. First, a plaintiff can only win a defamation case if it proves that the defamatory statement was false. If a statement cannot be proven false, it is legally considered a statement of opinion, which is protected by the First Amendment. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1, 19 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/1) (\"\\[A] statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before there can be liability under state defamation law.\")\n2. Second, statements about public figures or matters of public concern can only be the basis of defamation liability if the plaintiff can prove \"actual malice,\" which means that the defendant either knew what he was saying was false or had a \"a high degree of awareness of . . . the probable falsity\" of his statements. [*Harte\\-Hanks Communs. v. Connaughton*, 491 U.S. 657 (1989\\).](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/657/)\n3. Even with actual malice regarding statements of fact, the defamatory statement is considered in context, not in isolation. So a newspaper headline that is incorrect would probably not result in liability if the full article was correct. And the question is not whether that statement of fact, considered in context, is literally false, but rather whether the \"sting\" or \"gist\" of the statement was false. [*Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper*, 571 U.S. 237, 247 (2014\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/12-315) (\"A statement is not considered false unless it would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\").\n\nFor example, saying \"John shot his wife\" would probably not be defamatory if John shot at his wife and missed, or if he beat her unconscious with a gun, or even if he stabbed or poisoned her. John's reputation is damaged because he tried to kill his wife, not because of the precise way he did it.\n\nApplied to video\\-game manufacturers, these rules effectively kill a defamation action.\n\nFirst, they have to prove both (a) that it's possible to say whether video games cause mass shootings; and (b) that video games definitely don't cause mass shootings. That requirement probably kills the case already, because that research doesn't exist. Even if it did, the manufacturers would then need to prove actual malice, meaning either that the defendant knew about that research, or that the defendant knew that what they were saying was probably false.\n\nI don't know how anyone could prove all that, and even if they did, they'd still have questions about the \"sting\" and broader context of the statements, making this case a serious loser.\n\nWhile I doubt that video games are causing mass shootings, I also doubt that the people who say otherwise believe they are correct. Generally speaking, the First Amendment protects people who make mistakes. [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*, 376 U.S. 254, 271\u201372 (1964\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/376/254) (\"Erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and ... it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need to survive.\")", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A prominent politician makes a public statement claiming, \"Video games are directly responsible for the recent increase in mass shootings.\" A major video game company wants to sue for defamation.

This relates to the first point in the documentation, which states that \"a plaintiff can only win a defamation case if it proves that the defamatory statement was false.\" The documentation further explains that proving this would be extremely difficult because \"that research doesn't exist.\"\n\nOption A, while important for proving \"actual malice,\" is not the most significant obstacle.

According to the documentation, electronic documentation, including emails, falls under the same rules as paper documentation during discovery (Rule 26 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Even deleted emails can often be recovered through e-discovery processes, typically conducted by third-party professionals. The statement \"everything on the internet is forever\" supports this idea. While the email headers alone provide some evidence, the full message content can likely be recovered through proper legal channels, making it strong evidence in a copyright infringement case.

This case established that a former Playmate of the Year could use Playboy's logo on her website for self-identification, even though she was advertising herself commercially. By extension, a graduate using their university's logo to identify where they studied would likely be considered fair use.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it's overly broad and doesn't account for fair use exceptions.

The OLC opinion could also probably be overridden by Congress in a law (that would probably have to overcome a Presidential veto), as the claim that the OLC decision is one that it is constitutionally required to arrive at is a weak one.\n* This does not preclude individuals or Congress from bringing suit against the President in a civil action, including a contempt of court proceeding in a civil action prosecuted by someone other than a federal government attorney.\n* This does not preclude Congress from impeaching the President and removing him from office.\n\nNonetheless, the Office of Legal Counsel opinion referred to by the Special Counsel certainly does significantly impair the extent to which a President can be punished for violating federal law as a practical matter.\n\n> This seems to directly contradict the \"no man is above the law\"\n>  principle outlined by the 14th amendment of the constitution.\n\nI'm not sure what makes you think that the 14th Amendment is relevant in this case.\n\nSection 1 of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution sets a minimum threshold for citizenship and sets for constitutional obligations that apply to U.S. states.\n\nSections 2\\-4 of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution govern issues particular to the Reconstruction era.\n\nSection 5 of the 14th Amendment gives Congress the authority to pass legislation enforcing the other sections.\n\nThere isn't really a \"no man is above the law\" concept expressly stated in the U.S. Constitution (in contrast, France has had such a provision since the French Revolution).

If they were illegal, **what are the potential legal consequences**? (We can ignore political consequences for this question)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Was International Law Violated?**\n\nWhen it used chemical weapons to kill large numbers of civilians in his own country, Assad's regime in Syria was violating its obligations under the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention), an international treaty obligation that [the regime acknowledged was binding upon it in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention#Syrian_destruction) when at U.S. insistence and with Russian supervision, the Assad regime purported to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles. \n\nIt was also an action violating generally recognized standards of the [customary international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law) of war that have been recognized since they were first clearly articulated in the [Geneva Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Protocol) of 1925 that took effect in 1928\\. This kind of action has also been recognized as a [crime against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity) under customary international law, and this principle is why international criminal tribunals set up after crimes against humanity occur are not considered to be applying *ex post facto* laws.\n\nAlso, since early on in the Syrian Civil War, during the Obama Administration, the U.S. ceased to recognize Assad's regime as the legitimate government of Syria. According to official U.S. policy, since 2012, the [Syrian National Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_Syrian_National_Council), and not Assad's regime, has been the legitimate government of Syria. So, rather than being an attack on a sovereign regime, this was an act in defense of a different sometimes allied regime recognized as legitimate, with whom the U.S. is not at war.\n\nMoreover, given that fact that the U.S. now has a artillery combat ground troop unit deployed in Northern Syria as of earlier in 2017, in support of a Congressionally authorized military action in the same theater of conflict, the U.S. has a legitimate interest in protecting its own troops, as well as those of allies it supports in the part of the conflict that it is involved in under the 2001 AUMF, from chemical weapons attacks in Syria by preemptively disabling the Assad regime's ability to deploy those weapons, even though they were not directed at somewhat nearby U.S. forces in their most recent utilization this week.\n\nSo, while there may not be entirely clear international legal authorization for this particular remedy for the Assad regime's clear violation of international law, there is not a clear prohibition on doing so either, and the general rule is that sovereign states have wide discretion to take military action in support of their perceived interests, particular when violations international obligations of the offender targeted for military action provide a justification for the use of military force under international law.\n\nThis is because the main way of punishing a violation of international war while a conflict is still pending is called a [reprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprisal) which the Syrian strike fits to a tee. \n\n> A reprisal is a limited and deliberate violation of international law\n>  to punish another sovereign state that has already broken them. . . .\n>  Reprisals refer to acts which are illegal if taken alone, but become\n>  legal when adopted by one state in retaliation for the commission of\n>  an earlier illegal act by another state.\n\n[Article XII(3\\) of the Chemical Weapons Convention](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1997/04/19970429%2007-52%20PM/CTC-XXVI-3.pdf) authorizes those remedies allowed under customary international law of which reprisal is one.\n\n**Did The President Have Authority To Make The Strike Under U.S. Law?**\n\nThis said, the harder issue is whether this strike was legal under U.S. law, and not international law, which really has no meaningful binding enforcement mechanism other than politics, diplomacy and domestic law anyway.\n\nWhile the U.S. does not recognize the Assad regime as legitimate, it is not actually at war with that regime because the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) from 2001 that has been the main legal authorization for the \"war on terror\" against ISIS, pretty clear does not extend to Assad's regime in Syria. ISIS has been declared to be a successor to a branch of the organization the launched the 9\\-11 attack upon which the AUMF declared war. But, the formerly legitimate government of Syria (Assad's regime) is very difficult to treat as coming within that definition.\n\nHowever, while Congress has not authorized the use of military force by the U.S. against the Assad regime in Syria in this manner, Congress has approved appropriations to fund and support anti\\-Assad rebels, even though it may have been a bit of a fiasco, which at least provides some tacit evidence of Congressional consent to some sort of involvement in the Syrian civil war by the United States government against Assad's regime.\n\nIn absence of an authorization of use of military force against the Assad regime, one alternative source of legal authority to make this strike is legislation (whose constitutionality has often been questioned, but has never actually challenged, was determined by the Justice Department to be constitutional in 1980, and which is arguably not justiciable) called the [War Powers Act of 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution). This Act, on its face, purports to give the President the authority to make limited use of military force for short periods of time. Specifically (per the link):\n\n> It provides that the U.S. President can send U.S. Armed Forces into\n>  action abroad only by declaration of war by Congress, \"statutory\n>  authorization,\" or in case of \"a national emergency created by attack\n>  upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed\n>  forces.\"\n> \n> \n> The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress\n>  within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and\n>  forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a\n>  further 30\\-day withdrawal period, without a Congressional\n>  authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war\n>  by the United States.\n\nThe question of whether this incident is within the scope of the War Powers Act is [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution#Syrian_Military_Action_in_2017) with U.S. Senator Rand Paul arguing the conditions triggering its use such as an attack on U.S. forces or the United States, have not been met. The issues presented by this incident under the War Powers Act are similar to those presented in the missile strike and follow up airstrikes made by the U.S. [in Libya in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution#Libya_intervention_in_2011).\n\nThere is also legitimate room for dispute regarding where the authority of the President as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces under [Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution](http://constitutionus.com/) ends, and where the power of Congress to declare war and to enact other legislation pertaining to the U.S. military under Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution begins.\n\nArguably, directing U.S. forces to make an isolated military strike from a location where they are already lawfully deployed in support of an AUMF authorized military mission in the region, in exigent circumstances, against a military force that is not recognized by the United States as the legitimate government of Syria, does not constitute a true act of war and is instead merely day to day management of the operations and discipline of the United States military that is within the Commander in Chief's authority, particularly when Congress has already tentatively recognized the Syria's Assad regime is an enemy of the United States in legislation short of an authorization for use of military force.\n\nMoreover, given that President Trump surely has majority support in both houses of Congress for this strike, the possibility that Congress may end up granting forgiveness rather than making much of the fact that he didn't ask for permission, may be mostly a formality in this case. \n\nGenerally speaking, even if this issue is justiciable (i.e. amenable to resolution through the court system), court action to enforce separation of powers questions must be authorized, at least, by a resolution of a majority of one of the two houses of Congress. Generally speaking, taxpayer standing or just plain U.S. citizen standing, does not exist to enjoin or seek a remedy from a separation of powers violation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of the U.S. airstrikes on Syria in 2017?\n\nA) The strikes were clearly legal under both international law and U.S. domestic law.\n\nB) The strikes were legal under international law as a reprisal, but their legality under U.S. domestic law is questionable due to lack of explicit Congressional authorization.\n\nC) The strikes were illegal under international law but authorized under U.S. domestic law by the 2001 AUMF.\n\nD) The strikes were illegal under both international law and U.S. domestic law, with no justification under either system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most accurate representation of the legal situation.

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Of course, you can ask the bank (or more precisely, one of its officers) to sign such a contract. But I strongly suspect they won't.\n\nThe bank's standard deposit contract will have been drafted and carefully reviewed by their legal counsel. It would be irresponsible of the bank to agree to be bound to any additional contract, especially one that was drafted by a customer, without similarly having counsel review it. Given the hourly rate that the bank's lawyers likely get paid, the cost of this almost certainly will far exceed the value of having you as a customer (particularly as, by your own admission, you are intending to be a rather unprofitable customer). \n\nSo if you insist on them signing any contract of yours as a condition of you opening an account, I expect they will just politely suggest that you look for another bank to do business with.\n\nI think most people would instead handle this situation by just carefully reading the bank's standard deposit contract, and verifying, to the best of their ability, that it really does obligate the bank to pay out the bonus and let you close the account without further fee. Then, if the bank doesn't do so in the end, they might complain to the bank's management, or to the regulatory agency which oversees the bank. In an extreme case, they might consider suing the bank, but the amount of money at stake here is probably not enough to make it worth the time and expense of a lawsuit.\n\nThere may also be applicable laws in your jurisdiction that forbid the bank from charging a fee to close an account; but you haven't said what your jurisdiction is, so I can't address that.\n\nI personally wouldn't think it likely that there is any \"catch\" here. The bank is probably expecting that most people, once they have had the account open for six months, won't bother to close it. And now that they have a relationship with this bank, they may think of it in the future when they want a mortgage, CD, investment advice, etc. So the bank may not mind if a few customers take the bonus and leave after six months, since this will (they hope) be compensated by the larger number of customers who stick around.\n\nAll that said, if you really don't trust the bank, then perhaps you are better off not doing business with them at all.

The account has a $25 monthly fee for balances under $5,000. A customer wants to ensure they can close the account after six months without additional fees. Which of the following is the most realistic and legally sound approach for the customer to take?\n\nA) Draft a personal contract for the bank to sign, guaranteeing no fees for account closure after six months\nB) Carefully read the bank's standard deposit contract and verify the terms regarding the bonus and account closure\nC) Open the account without reviewing any terms, assuming the verbal offer is legally binding\nD) Demand that the bank provide a notarized statement confirming the bonus terms and closure conditions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most realistic and legally sound approach. The documentation suggests that carefully reading the bank's standard deposit contract is the best way to verify the terms of the bonus and account closure. This allows the customer to understand their rights and obligations without requiring the bank to agree to additional terms.\n\nOption A is unlikely to be accepted by the bank, as they would need to have their legal counsel review any additional contracts, which is cost-prohibitive for a single customer account.\n\nOption C is risky, as verbal offers may not be legally binding and may not include all terms and conditions.\n\nOption D is unrealistic, as banks are unlikely to provide notarized statements for standard account offers, and this request might be seen as overly demanding.\n\nThe correct approach balances the customer's need for clarity with the bank's standard practices and legal considerations."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70895/using-deepfake-to-create-endorsment", "docs_id": 70895, "title": "Using deepfake to create endorsment", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The radio station I typically listen to regularly has some celebrity endorsement along the lines of\n\n> You are listening to *song name* on my favorite station *station name*\n\nWith the improvements of deep fakes also in the voice/audio sector I was wondering, what would be the legal restrictions to use a deep fake audio trained on publicly accessible voice samples from a celebrity to have a machine generated endorsement sounding like said celebrity?\n\nI did find some papers on the topic of deep fakes, however they were about images/videos and usually had the conclusion, that the situation at the moment is ambigous at best regarding copyright law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sound recordings can be, and new ones normally are, protected by copyright.

Use of such a recording without permission might well be copyright infringement.\n\nBut more clearly and directly, broadcasting a statement:\n\n> I am {performer} and you are listening to {song name} on my favorite station {station name }\n\nwithout authorization from the performer would in many jurisdictions violate the performer's right of publicity, giving the performer grounds to sue the station. It might well also be false advertising, implying that the performer had endorsed the station when s/he has not done so. That would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the broadcast was made.\n\nA suit over publicity rights or an action for false advertising would probably be simpler than a copyright suit in such a case.\n\nI think that most if not all such announcements are made with the consent of the performers involved, and are probably recorded directly by such performers. (For one thing it is usually in the performer's interest to cooperate with stations and networks that play the performer's work.)\n\nIf such announcements were somehow artificially synthesized, but with the permission of the performer, and of any owner of copyright in any recording used, I don't think there would be any legal problem.\n\nIf an AI was trained to create a good imitation of a person's voice with9ut diretly copying a recording, I am not at all sure if there would be any copyright infringemetn under current law. That may be an area where the law will need to change to respond to the technology. But if such an imitation were used **without permission** to make the kind of statements discussed above, the personality rights issue and false advertising issue would still be there. Those do not in any way depend on whether the announcement uses a copy of a recording or not, those are both about the use of someone's name and reputation without authorization.

However, the school's ability to punish may be limited by First Amendment and whistleblower protections, especially if the recording was used to expose misconduct. The school cannot pursue criminal charges for violating syllabus rules, and the recording's admissibility as evidence is not automatically negated by the syllabus prohibition. Therefore, option C is the most accurate, reflecting the complex interplay between school rules, state law, and constitutional protections."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4230/can-a-traffic-citation-be-issued-solely-off-of-witness-account", "docs_id": 4230, "title": "Can a traffic citation be issued solely off of witness account?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In general, one driver reporting the plates of another is not likely to result in a citation being issued. Even if a citation were to be issued, I'd assume the initial caller would be required to testify in court, thus turning it into you word against theirs\\-\\-an easily winning case. But what if multiple people call someone's plates in? I've read that officers are more likely to issue a citation in this case, but it seems there's an obvious exploitation. For example, a group of friends could conspire against a common enemy by all reporting their plates. Or let's say someone in a car with multiple people in it believes they have been cut off. Everyone in the car could then report the accused driver, getting him a ticket by default. Where is the line drawn and how possible are these scenarios to result in convictions? If taken to court, couldn't the accused driver simply say they weren't even on the road at the time? What's the point in witness based citations (without any proof but a testimony) even being issued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The citation could be written but it should be easy to beat. In the circumstance that you describe the accused could just say the he was not driving his car at the time. If the prosecution is a sham with all your friends saying you all saw this thing, then the defendant can bring all of his friends to say that he was at some other place. The benefit to having a cop on the scene is that the cop will get ID and positive identification. \n\nThe other thing the cop has is expert judgment. If a cop sees unsafe lane movement and writes a ticket, his testimony in court carries more weight than the \"it was **not** unsafe!\" testimony of the accused. Keep in mind, getting all of your witnesses to court on the same day, after continuances and other delays, and getting them all to tell the same story to overcome the presumption of innocence is no small feat. \n\nAll that to say, it's easier with police as witness.\n\nThere are two mechanisms which could get you where you want to go. Private prosecution and citizen's arrest. \n\nPrivate prosecutions are a part of history but not strictly unavailable at the state level. You could write up some charging documents to see if you can get your target indicted. \n\nCitizen's arrest is interesting because the rules are fairly unclear unless governed by a specific statute. There are two necessary parts of citizens arrest and the first part gets the attention. \n\nThe first part is the detention (arrest). The crimes for which a citizen can legally detain a suspect are likely defined by state statute. The second part is giving testimony about the witnessed crime. Let's assume that you see a felony happen and watch the perp walk into a gas station bathroom. You are prepared to arrest, do part number one, and then call the cops, to do part number two. But while you wait for the guy to come out of the bathroom a cop walks up. You explain the felony and the cop goes into the bathroom and arrests the guy. It's purely witness testimony that led to the arrest and the indictment (physical evidence \\- let's say there is none) and even the trial. \n\nYou successfully get the guy indicted and when you show up to testify you tell the story as you witnessed it. Now the accused gets to take the stand. \n\nWhen he takes the stand he says, \"it was the other guy.\" When asked, \"what other guy?\" He says, \"I was in the bathroom and a guy ran in and went into the stall. Then a cop came in and arrested me.\"\n\nReasonable doubt right there. How much more if it's a bunch of friends ratting on some lone driver? Police need evidence. Prosecutors need evidence.

The documentation highlights several challenges with witness-based citations:\n\n1. Lack of positive identification: Unlike a police officer on the scene, witnesses cannot provide definitive ID of the driver.\n2. Absence of expert judgment: Police officers' testimony carries more weight due to their training in assessing traffic violations.\n3. Burden of proof: It's difficult to overcome the presumption of innocence without solid evidence, especially when the accused can provide contradictory testimony or alibis.\n4. Logistical challenges: Coordinating multiple witnesses to appear in court and provide consistent testimony is complicated.\n5.
