You mention having a company email domain and associated email signature; that is certainly good practice and would go a long way towards creating a presumption that you were acting for a company. Also signing yourself with your job title or role (e.g. \"Joe Bloggs, Chief Bottlewasher\") makes it clear that you are speaking in your role as an employee.\n\nThe content of the communication also matters; if you use your company email address to order goods from a supplier that the company has used before then the recipient can reasonably assume that you are ordering on behalf of the company and a court is likely to agree.

I will focus on the United States.\n\nTo this day, it is legal in all 50 US states for a parent to strike a child as a means of discipline (\"corporal punishment\"), but laws generally include a requirement that the force used is \"reasonable\" in some sense. However, it is not legal for a parent to cause serious injury to a child. The line between \"reasonable punishment\" and \"serious injury\" seems to not be well defined, and may have shifted over time due to changes in law, court decisions, or prosecutorial discretion. So the answer may hinge on what you mean by the word \"beating\".

Since we are not privy to the letter from Hasbro, the best we can do is guess based on the degrees of freedom that exist under the law. The claim that this game was a \"parody\" is an affirmative defense that Mane6 would have to raise in response to a copyright infringement claim (we don't know if there were also trademark infringement claims in the letter).

However, because unemancipated minors cannot buy or sell property on their own, managing their stocks can be a hassle. For example, children need a guardian if they want to sell the stock.\n\nTo avoid these hassles, in many (most?) cases, the stock is owned through some legal entity that gives an adult control over that stock. These range from custodial IRAs to living trusts. In all of these, the stock belongs to the minor, but is managed by an adult. These entities differ in all sorts of ways, including when (if ever) the minor gets control of the stock, how the stock is taxed, what the stock can be used for, and so on.\n\nOne of the most popular entities is a [UTMA Account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utma.asp). These are named after the *Universal Transfer to Minors Act,* found at [Chap. 201A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201a) of the *General Laws of Massachusetts*. These are custodial accounts designed specifically to allow minors to hold property, including stock. These accounts simplify the management of the minor\u2019s stock, and offer some tax breaks. In Massachusetts, the custodianship *[generally](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201A/Section20)* terminates when the minor turns 21\\. At that point, she gets complete control of her stock.\n\nTo find out more about the advantages and disadvantages of the UTMA compared to other ways of holding property for children, see [here](https://www.thebalance.com/beginners-guide-to-ugma-and-utma-custodial-accounts-4060475), [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinefletcher/2019/12/12/why-utma-accounts-are-not-as-simple-as-they-seem/#74aeb79c7b34) and [here](https://southcoastestateplanning.com/when-can-my-child-get-the-money-in-the-utma-custodial-account-i-created-2/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, a 16-year-old wants to own shares in a company.

Option A is incorrect because minors cannot buy or sell property on their own. Option B is false, as it is lawful for minors to own shares. Option C is partially correct about needing a guardian, but the age is incorrect.

The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States.\n\n...\n\n> To hold that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United States, of citizens or subjects of other countries would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.\n\nIn short the phrase \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d excludes three and only three groups of people:\n\n* Children born to foreign diplomats here on diplomatic business, who have diplomatic immunity to US Law;\n* Children of members of an invading army that has occupied and controlled some part of US territory, born on that occupied area, who are obviously not subject to US Law (which has rarely happened in the US, although Guam was occupied during WWII, and parts of Alaska, and small parts of Maine during the War of 1812\\); and\n* Members of Native American tribes, subject to the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, who do not pay US taxes. (This was true when the 14th amendment was passed, but it no longer is. See section below on the act that changed it in 1924\\.)\n\nAny other person born in the proper US or in incorporated US territory is a citizen, no matter who his or her parents are or were.

Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe) the Supreme Court of the United States struck down both a state statute denying funding for education to children in the United States illegally and a municipal school district's attempt to charge an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student. The case upheld the same principle that the constitutional phrase \"within the jurisdiction\" applies to the children of people who had entered the US illegally.\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe):\n\n> Texas officials had argued that illegal aliens were not \"within the jurisdiction\" of the state and thus could not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected this claim, finding instead that \"no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful.\" The dissenting opinion also rejected this claim, agreeing with the Court that \"the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to immigrants who, after their illegal entry into this country, are indeed physically 'within the jurisdiction' of a state.\"\n\nThus the question of whether such aliens were \"within the jurisdiction\" of the US was very much at issue in *Plyler v. Doe*\n\n**EDIT:**\nSince the [Indian Citizenship Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act) was passed, all Native Americans born within the US have been citizens by birth, and the third class of exceptions noted in the earlier cases non longer exists. Prior to this act Native Americans were in many ways treated as foreigners by the US. They were not citizens by birth, and their tribes had some but not all of the attributes of independent nations.\n\nThe text of the law is:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all non citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.\n\n(End edit on Indian Citizenship Act of 1924\\)\n\n**Edit**: On reading through the decision of the case of *Wong Kim Ark* I find one more small exclusion: persons born on board a foreign naval ship, even though present in US waters in time of peace, are not citizens of the US because of their birth location. This is apparently not a usual case, but is premised on the ground that a military vessel remains the territory of the nation it belongs to. Such persons might of course be citizens by inheritance if one or both parents are US citizens, and the statutory conditions are complied with. (The term \"public ship\" in the 1800s was used to mean a national ship, that is a military ship.)\n(End edit on naval ships)\n\nI just learned that some parts of the State of Maine were occupied by the British during the war of 1812\\.

This option allows Alice to pursue the required details through official channels without prematurely involving law enforcement or the courts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using the insurance company's address is likely to be ineffective, as the claim needs to be made against the driver, not the insurer.\n\nOption C is not applicable in this situation, as paper forms N1 or N510 are intended for cases where the defendant's address is outside England & Wales, not for unknown addresses.\n\nOption D, while potentially valid given Bob's legal obligation to provide his address, is a more severe step that could unnecessarily escalate the situation.

The same shall apply to a person who commits sexual intercourse with a female under thirteen years of age.\n\nTherefore, someone who has sexual intercourse with another person while they are intoxicated may not be considered rape if the act did not involve violent force.\n\nIt is important to note that this definition has some limitations. For example, it does not account for victims who are violated while incapacitated in a medical setting, and it also does not consider the possibility of male victims.\n\nExample where rape charges requires non\\-voluntary intoxication:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere have also been attempts within the legal system to distinguish between people who were unknowingly drugged and those who voluntarily consumed a large amount of alcohol and became intoxicated.\n\n> The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a person can\u2019t be found guilty of sexually assaulting someone, who is mentally incapacitated due to intoxication, if that person became intoxicated by voluntarily ingesting drugs or alcohol.\n\nIn Minnesota, for example, there was a requirement for non\\-voluntary intoxication.\n\n[A Minnesota man can\u2019t be charged with felony rape because the woman chose to drink beforehand, court rules \\- March 26, 2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/26/minnesota-rape-alcohol/)\n\nHowever, the Minnesota legislator has recently amended their legal codex for this.\n\n[New Minnesota Law Is 'Significant Victory' For Survivors Of Sexual Assaults While Intoxicated \\- September 14, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/new-minnesota-law-is-significant-victory-for-survivors-of-sexual-assaults-while-intoxicated/)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In which of the following jurisdictions would a person be LEAST likely to be convicted of rape if they had sexual intercourse with someone who was voluntarily intoxicated and unable to give consent?\n\nA) Minnesota (prior to 2021)\nB) Japan\nC) Germany (after 2016)\nD) United States (federal law)\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Minnesota (prior to 2021): While this was previously true, the question asks for the current situation.

I note that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States) isn't afraid to have *pictures* of the Great Seal on the webpage about it.

The Onion did not immediately remove the seal, however, and I think we would have heard if they had been arrested.

Airpods cost about 150\u00a0\u20ac, so Sania is entitled to a Fider's reward of 7,50 \u20ac. Anything more would be at the discretion of Tam, accepting less is at Sania's discretion.\n\nDo note, that denial of the finder's reward at the moment that Sania hands over the item means, that they also deny their entitlement to the reward. In fact, it is upon Sania to demand the reward, and unless they do so, it is presumed that they do not want a finder's reward.\n\n**However** in making her entitlement to the reward known, Sania may not cross the line into coercion or blackmail (\u00a7\u00a7 240, 253 StGB). Should Sania say, without explanation \"I demand a payment of 100\u00a0\u20ac for the airpods\", that could be coercion, as she is not entitled to that. If she however says \"I am entitled to finder's reward of 7,50\u00a0\u20ac, and had expenses of 2\\.50\u00a0\u20ac to get the phone to you, therefore you owe me 10\u00a0\u20ac\" the picture is different \\- that is *exactly* the amount that the law says she would be owed. This is because atop the actual reward Sania can reclaim reasonable fees, such as the bus fare to get the phone to Tam under [\u00a7 970 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__970.html). Under \u00a7 972 BGB, Sania does not have to relinquish the item till the reward and expenses have been paid but also does not become the owner of the item.\n\n#### The Fundb\u00fcro\n\nTo evade a possible claim for \"Unterschlagung von Fundsachen\" (\\~conversion by not reporting a found item), the Fundb\u00fcro (Found item's office) exists when the owner can't be made out rapidly.

It is customary to store the lost items at the Fundb\u00fcro, but that is not required.\n\nTo gain the item from the Fundb\u00fcro, Tam will have to pay any required handling fees to the office but also gets notice of how much he should pay to Sania as well as her contact details.

Should Sania not have given her details, it is presumed that she did not want the finder's reward.\n\nIf Sania retained the item, the Fundb\u00fcro will inform Tam of the estimated finder's reward and contact details for Sania, so Tam can reclaim the item.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, Sania finds Tam's lost AirPods worth 150\u20ac on campus.

In this case, the AirPods are worth 150\u20ac, so Sania is legally entitled to 7.50\u20ac (5% of 150\u20ac).

Sania's entitlement to the reward is not affected by when she learned about the advertisement or when she claimed it, as long as she didn't explicitly waive her right to the reward at the time of returning the item.

Does this change the issue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend a good deal on there exact nature of the clips being reused. it will also depend, at least somewhat, on what country or countries the various parties are in.\n\n**General Principle**\n---------------------\n\nThe general principle is that a peerson's post on social media is protected by copyright, just as all original works are. It is a copyright infringement to copy and redistribute the, **unless** permission has been granted by the copyright holder (normally the author in the case of a social media post, as those are rarely sold) or an exception to copyright applies.\n\n**Permission**\n--------------\n\nThere are various ways in which permission might be granted. \n\nThe re\\-user might directly email (or otherwise reach out to) the original author and **ask**, and be granted permission.\n\nThe original author might have released some or all of his or her posts under a permissive license.\n\nSome social media might **require** that posts be released under a permissive license, or otherwise automatically grant such permissions. Remember that Wikipedia, for example, mandates that all posts and contributions be released under a CC\\-BY\\-SA license, although posters have the option to add an additional alternate license, or more than one. \n\n**Exceptions**\n--------------\n\nThe most obvious exception is Fair use, **if** the parties are (or at least the re\\-user is) in the US. People sometimes speak as if fair use is a world\\-wide legal rule. it is a very specifically US legal concept. Some other countries have a somewhat similar concept, known in English as \"Fair Dealing\". It is, i understand, rather moore limited than fair use. [This law.se question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/) discusses fair use in some detail.\n\nMost of the posts being reused here have no market, and so their re\\-use cannot harm the market. That would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-user uses the whole post, or a substantial part of it, that would weigh against fair use. If the re\\-user inserts significant comment on each re\\-used post, that would be analytical if not transformational, and would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-use is monetized, that would weigh against fair use somewhat.\n\nIn short, we cn't tell in general if fair use would apply to any particular post being re\\-used. it might or it might not. Specifics will control, and ultimately it is a judgement call to eb made by a court, if the matter comes to that.\n\n**Enforcement**\n---------------\n\nUnless the copyright holder for a given post files an infringement suit, or files a take\\-down notice, or complains to the host site, there will be no enforcement and no consequences. If a complaint or a take\\-down is filed, the host could remove the content, cancel the re\\-user's account, or both. If the user has monetized the re\\-use, ad revenue can be redirected to the copyright owner. \n\nIf the copyright holder files an infringement suit, and wins, there will be an award of damages, which might be quite small, or rather large. But with no market for the original, and probably little or no income from the re\\-use, low damages are more likely than high. And the original copyright holder would have filing fees, legal expenses, and possibly other expenses in advance.\n\nThere are firms with which one can register one's copyrighted work, who search for it being improperly used and take action, in return for a small up\\-front fee and a share of any damages recovered. But posters of general opinion on social media seem unlikely to use such services.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nSuch a \u201cSocial Media Reacts\u201d\\-video is somewhat risky, from a copyright perspective, but the **likely** negative outcomes are not large. Asking permission whenever possible, and trying to stay within the fair\\-use principles (if they apply) will reduce those risks.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A YouTube creator makes a \"Social Media Reacts\" video about a popular TV series, including screenshots of tweets and Instagram posts with their associated usernames and profile pictures.

While using others' social media posts without permission could potentially infringe on copyright, there are several considerations:\n\n1. Fair use may apply, especially in the US, depending on factors like the amount of content used, whether it's transformative, and its effect on the market.\n2. The creator may have obtained permission from the original posters or the social media platforms.\n3. Some social media platforms might have terms of service that allow for such usage.\n4. The risk of enforcement varies, as copyright holders would need to take action for any consequences to occur.\n\nSimply not monetizing (A) or giving credit (D) doesn't automatically make it legal. It's also not always illegal (B), as there are potential exceptions and defenses. The most accurate answer is that the legality depends on various factors, including fair use principles and whether permission was obtained (C)."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4909/is-there-a-way-to-prevent-an-irresponsible-pet-owner-from-getting-another-pet", "docs_id": 4909, "title": "Is there a way to prevent an irresponsible pet owner from getting another pet?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I hate to say it but I know someone who lives in an apartment and had a dog in the past and didn't get him groomed regularly.

Failure to groom regularly, while potentially a sign of neglect, is not explicitly mentioned as grounds for legal intervention.

We're concerned with the first condition for lawful data processing, and the second principle of data quality.\n\n> Data processing is only lawful if\n> \n> \n> * the data subject has unambiguously given his consent; or\n> * processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party; or\n> * processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; or\n> * processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or\n> * processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party; or\n> * processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by the third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection.\n> \n> \n> The principles of data quality, which must be implemented for all lawful data processing activities, are the following:\n> \n> \n> * personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully, and collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. They must also be adequate, relevant and not excessive, accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, must not be stored for longer than necessary and solely for the purposes for which they were collected;\n> * special categories of processing: it is forbidden to process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade\\-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. This provision comes with certain qualifications concerning, for example, cases where processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or for the purposes of preventive medicine and medical diagnosis.\n\nSo, let's say that someone has given their consent. It'd be at least a little questionable whether the inspection of private information could mean that they access *personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade\\-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life*.\n\nI'm a bit less clear on US laws, but you'd probably look for laws around Personal Identifying Information, as that's where a lot of focus has been.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the EU Directive 95/46/EC, which of the following is NOT a lawful condition for data processing?\n\nA) The data subject has unambiguously given their consent\nB) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation\nC) Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject\nD) Processing is necessary to maximize profits for the data controller\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The EU Directive 95/46/EC outlines several conditions under which data processing is considered lawful. These include obtaining unambiguous consent from the data subject (option A), complying with legal obligations (option B), and protecting the vital interests of the data subject (option C). However, processing data solely to maximize profits for the data controller (option D) is not listed as a lawful condition.

This depends on the place and date of publication. In many countries copyright now lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. Some countries use different rules. In the US, a work published before 1978 is in most cases copyrighted for 95 years. Works published after that are protected for 70 years after the death of the author. More complex cases are detailed in [this well\\-known chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain).\n\nWho holds the Copyright?\n========================\n\nFor most novels, copyright is initially held by the author(s). The author may sell or give away the copyright at any time. If the author does not transfer the copyright during life, it will pass with other property st the author's death. It may pass by will or by default (intestate) inheritance in the absence of a will. The author's surviving spouse children, if any, are often the heirs to any copyrights, but not always. Authors with many works still in print may have s \"literary estate\" set up to handle their copyrights.\n\nWorks with multiple co\\-authors usually have the copyright shared between all authors; in equal shares unless they agree otherwise. Any one copyright holder may license a derivative work such as a translation.\n\nA would\\-be translator of a work still under copyright must find the copyright holder(s) and obtain permission. If the holders cannot be found, no permission can be obtained, and any translation would be an infringement of copyright. The copyright holder could sue for damages after publication. Damages may be quite substantial in some cases. This varies by country and by the facts of the case.\n\nIn the US The [Federal Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)  will search its records to try to determine who holds a copyright. They charge a fee for doing so, and success is not guaranteed. Other countries may have similar services.\n\n**Addition**:\nThere is no automatic or guaranteed way to find who now owns a copyright. In some cases the owner does not even know that s/he owns the copyright. If the holder died without heirs the copyright may belong to the government (state government in the US).\n\nResearch into the author's life may reveal probable heirs. An obituary may list the author's children, if any.

If it is under copyright, the translator must then locate the current copyright holder(s) to obtain permission. This could be the author's heirs, a literary estate, or in some cases, the government. Simply translating without permission (option A) would be copyright infringement. The Federal Copyright Office can assist in searching for copyright holders but doesn't grant automatic permission (option B).

She said she was destroying all the mail and we would never receive it or any future mail at that address.

I asked what she was doing with all the mail she snatched back that didn't require a signature and she replied she was throwing it away. She then drove off.\n\nDid she do at least two crimes?: 1\\) steal property\n2\\) threaten to destroy property for the purpose of intimidation\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I cannot answer whether this particular person committed a crime or not. Only a court can answer that. I can give you general information about laws involving destruction of mail.\n\nUnder [18 USC 1703](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1703):\n\n> Whoever, being a Postal Service officer or employee, unlawfully secretes, destroys, detains, delays, or opens any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail entrusted to him or which shall come into his possession, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, or carried or delivered by any carrier or other employee of the Postal Service, or forwarded through or delivered from any post office or station thereof established by authority of the Postmaster General or the Postal Service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nSo it would generally be a crime to deliberately destroy or delay mail that was otherwise deliverable.\n\nIf a carrier took back mail that should have been delivered, that would probably count as \"detaining\" or \"delaying\" that mail. In the case at hand, though, I suppose the carrier might argue that when you refused to sign for the letter, it gave her reason to doubt that the addressee(s) actually lived there, in which case perhaps the mail should not have been delivered after all. So she might say that she took it all back to the post office for further investigation as to where or whether it should be delivered.\n\nDestroying the mail would similarly be illegal. However, based on other information in your question that is now removed, it appears that she did not actually do so. Merely *threatening* to destroy mail, if the threat is not carried out, does not seem to be a crime under this section. I don't know whether it might be prohibited by some other statute.\n\nCrimes involving mail are normally investigated by the [US Postal Inspection Service](https://www.uspis.gov/), not by local police.\n\nOf course, even if the behavior is not a crime, it may still be cause for the postal employee to be fired or otherwise disciplined.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A postal worker threatens to destroy mail after a resident refuses to sign for certified mail.

According to 18 USC 1703, it is a crime for a postal employee to destroy, detain, or delay mail that was intended to be conveyed. However, merely threatening to destroy mail, without actually doing so, does not appear to be explicitly criminalized by this statute. The postal worker's actions of taking back the mail could potentially be considered \"detaining\" or \"delaying\" if the mail was otherwise deliverable, but there might be justification if there was doubt about the correct delivery address. The threat itself, while unprofessional, is not necessarily a crime under this specific law. Additionally, mail-related crimes are typically investigated by the US Postal Inspection Service, not local police, making option D incorrect.
