[The document](https://support.avast.com/en-ph/article/170/#idt_055) states:\n\n> Each time you run a Network Inspector scan, you are prompted to select if the network you are currently connected to is Home or Public. Network Inspector scans for different issues and offers different solutions depending on the network type, so it is important to select the correct option:\n> \n> \n> * Home: Scan a private network that you own (such as your home network).\n> * Public: Scan a network that you do not own. This may be a public Wi\\-Fi network, or a work or school network that is managed by a separate network administrator.\n\nThe document does not detail what scans are different on a \"Home\" network, but it might well be that scans which would constitute unauthorized invasions are not run on \"public\" networks.\n\nCFAA\n----\n\nIn the US, anti\\-hacking l;aw is largely included in the [The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), which has been codified at [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030)The CFAA has been amended several times since 1984, each time broadening its reach.\n\nSection 1030 prohibits unauthorized access to a \"protected computer\" under any of several conditions, and also prohibits unauthorized obtaining of information from a \"protected computer\".\n\nProtected Computer\n------------------\n\nSection 1030 (e)(2\\) defines \"protected computer:\n\n> (e) (2\\) the term \u201cprotected computer\u201d means a computer\u2014  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (A) exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government;\n> \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (B) which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States; or\n> \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) that\u2014  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (i) is part of a voting system; and  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii)  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii) (I) is used for the management, support, or administration of a Federal election; or  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii) (II) has moved in or otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce;\n\nOriginally only subsection (e)(2\\)(A) was part of the CFAA, and the act onloy applied to computers owned or used by the US Federal government, or by banks and simialr financial institutions. The addition of subsections (e)(2\\)(B) and (e)(2\\)(C) has broadened the scope of the CFAA significantly. The development of the internet, so that almost all data on the internet has traveled or is likely to travel across state lines, means that almost every computer with an internet connection can be regarded as a \"protected computer\" under the CFAA, including most cell phones. The CFAA has thus become a general anti\\-hacking act.\n\nOffenses\n--------\n\nSection 1030 defies several offenses, which I summarize here: unauthorized disclosure of information obtained from a protected computer (subsection (a)(1\\)); obtaining information from a protected computer without proper authorization (subsection (a)(2\\)); unauthorized access to certain protected computers (subsection (a)(3\\)); fraud, that is using unauthorized access to commit fraud, further any fraudulent scheme, or fraudulently obtain any benefit or thing of value (subsection (a)(4\\)); transmitting malware (subsection (a)(5\\)(A)); causing damage, whether recklessly or not (subsections (a)(5\\)(B) \\& (a)(5\\)(C)); selling passwords and access codes (subsection (a)(6\\)); transmitting ransomware or threats to damage a protested computer or interfere with its operation (subsection (a)(7\\)).\n\nEach of these subsections has limiting language, and applies only when \\[*emphasis added*]:\n\n* > \\[(a)(1\\)] having **knowingly accessed** a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access and and by means of such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, **with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States**, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\n\nIt seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"knowing access\" or will result in obtaining such protected or restricted data, but if it does, one can avoid criminal liability under (a)(1\\) simply by nt disclosing any such data to any third party.\n\n* > \\[(a)(2\\)] **Intentionally** accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2014\n> (A) **information contained in a financial record of a financial institution, or of a card issuer** as defined in section 1602(n)\u202f\\[1] of title 15, or **contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency** on a consumer, as such terms are defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.\n\nIt seems even less likely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"intentional access\" or will result in obtaining such financial data. Note that data must be obtained by a perso0n con constitute a violation of (a)(2\\).\n\nHowever (a)(2\\)(C) also prohibits obtaining:\n\n> information from any protected computer;\n\nThis is the potentially broadest subsection. It contains no intent element, and no restriction on which computers it applies to. Even so, it applies only if information is in fact obtained (or under a later subsection there is an attempt to obtain information).\n\n* > \\[(a)(3\\)] **intentionally**, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer **of a department or agency of the United States**, accesses such a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, **is used by or for the Government of the United States** and such conduct **affects that use** by or for the Government of the United States; ...\n\nAgain, It seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute **intentionally** accessing a computer owned or used by the US Federal Government\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)] **knowingly** and with **intent to defraud**, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct **furthers the intended fraud** and obtains anything of value,\n\nIt is very hard to see how merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute acting with **intent to defraud**, nor how it will allow the person connecting the device to obtain anything of value fraudulently.\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(A)] **knowingly** causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, **intentionally causes damage without authorization**, to a protected computer;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(B)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **recklessly causes damage**;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(C)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **causes damage and loss**.\n\nAside from subsection (a)(2\\)(C), all the listed offenses require \"knowing\" or \"intentional\" action. Even (a)(2\\)(C) requires proof that the accused intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization. I am inclined to doubt that merely connecting a device with a publicly sold security product installed would be held to constitute intentional access to other computers on that network, and such intent would need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, just as any other element of any crime."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to constitute a violation when a user connects to a public network with an antivirus product that automatically scans other devices?\n\nA) The antivirus product obtains financial records from a nearby laptop.\nB) The antivirus product accesses a government computer and affects its use.\nC) The antivirus product scans nearby devices for vulnerabilities without obtaining information.\nD) The antivirus product intentionally causes damage to a nearby smartphone.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) This scenario could violate section 1030(a)(2) of the CFAA, which prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization and obtaining financial records.\n\nB) This could violate section 1030(a)(3), which prohibits intentionally accessing a government computer without authorization and affecting its use.\n\nC) This is the least likely to violate the CFAA because merely scanning for vulnerabilities without obtaining information or causing damage is not explicitly prohibited under the act.

While it's legal to sell items on credit (ruling out option C), it's crucial to have proper documentation and clear terms (ruling out option A). Simply creating an invoice without specifying important details like payment terms and consequences for non-payment (as in option B) leaves the owner vulnerable to potential issues.

As a shareholder, John is entitled to receive dividends in proportion to his ownership (35%) if and when the corporation decides to distribute them. However, corporations, especially C-Corps, are not obligated to declare dividends or distribute profits to shareholders. The company's board of directors has the discretion to decide whether to pay dividends or reinvest profits back into the business. \n\nOption A is incorrect because shareholders are not automatically entitled to a company's profits; they only receive dividends when declared.\n\nOption C is partially true but misleading.

The law's jurisdiction is limited to acts within Alabama's territory. Dr. Smith cannot be prosecuted in Alabama for an abortion performed legally in California, even if the patient is an Alabama resident.

The company was called `X Pvt.Ltd.` (this is the company that is registered). They were later called `Y` and now they are named `Z`. \n\nThey are funded by a reputed company named `G`, and `G`'s website shows that they are funding company `Y`. My offer letter mentions the company name as `Z (*)` and at the bottom of the letter, is the explanation of the asterisk, which goes like `X Pvt.Ltd. d/b/a Z`.

These include the exact terms of the verbal agreement, whether the business reasonably relied on the permission, and if the permission could be interpreted as a regular license rather than a casual allowance. The concept of estoppel may prevent the artist from revoking permission if the business has significantly relied on it.

As per contract law principles, parties can agree to various terms in a contract as long as those terms are not illegal. Requiring someone to friend a Facebook page or refrain from posting negative reviews (known as a non-disparagement clause) is not illegal, even if it may seem unusual or restrictive.

Of course there was a contract. There is a clause in the contract that states that the tenants are responsible of maintaining the quality of the items (listed) in the house and replacing them (unless there has been a fire). This is worded longer but has this information.\n\nWhen I was considering signing the contract, I read the clause and decided to ask the landlord what would happen if something breaks \"because is old\". The conversation was more or less as follows:\n\n> Seating in the Landlord's living room in his own house, me, my girlfriend, Landlord and his wife, reading the contract.\n> \n> \n> Me: About this clause, what would happen if something breaks?\n> \n> \n> Landlord: If it breaks... what do you mean?\n> \n> \n> Me: Well, if the thing is old, sometimes they just break. Would you pay for it in that case?\n> \n> \n> Landlord and wife, together: Yes, yes of course.\n> \n> \n> We sign.\n\nRecently something broke (after 1\\.5 years) and we called the landlord. After about a month of doing technicians etc the result ended in needing to buy a new one. While discussing moderately about how long is taking to fix thing my landlord told us that we shouldn't complain, because he is paying for it, and we should be the ones paying. While asking why he says that if he mentioned that he would pay for it he said \"you should have read the contract, its in the contract that it is your responsibility to pay for it\".\n\nIt seems that nothing bad will happen, but I am curious about the legal implication if he decides to make us pay for it.\n\nWe asked about it and he said it, but of course, its not literally written like that.

Or as it is not written is as if it didn't happened?\n\nWould this mean that a landlord could actually tell a lots of lies about a contract (for example to someone that has limited reading capabilities, or like me, someone that is not used to English law \"slang\" as its not their mother tongue) and \"cheat\" the tenant to sign?\n\nI guess one possible (and likely) answer to this is \"its the tenant responsibility to understand the contract, and the only things that apply are the ones in the contract\".\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not looking for real legal advice, just curious on how far the law extends here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is the tenant's responsibility to understand the written contract. Oral statements about the contract do have to be consistent with the written contract (that is, in the context where you ask the landlord what a particular clause means before signing \\-\\- not in the case where you are modifying an existing contract). If I were renting a room and the contract says \"Du m\u00e5 betale $1000 hver dag\", which I don't understand because my Norwegian is terrible, I would ask about this, and the landlord might say that it means \"You must pay $1000 every month\", which could be a decent deal. Actually, the clause says \"You must pay $1000 every day\". When the reality of the situation becomes clear, then it is obvious that we didn't have an agreement in the first place. Perhaps he mis\\-spoke, or his English is as bad as my Norwegian, but I would not be held to rate in the written contract, assuming that I could back up my claim that he gave me that interpretation: the lease would probably be voided, as not an actual agreement. The underlying principle is that there has to be a \"meeting of the minds\" where the parties understand what they will get and what they must give, and there was a demonstrable failure of understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, if I sign a contract without really reading it carefully, and there is a clause in English (which I speak) saying that I have to pay $1000 a day, but I didn't really think about the clause so that in a sense I didn't understand what I had agreed to, well, I may still be on the hook. (On the third hand, a court would probably say that's a ridiculous rent and void the contract on policy grounds). In general, \"not my first language\" is not a get\\-out\\-of\\-contract card, though attempts to trick people into signing documents in languages that they really have no understanding of won't be successful. Virtually nobody but a lawyer actually understands contractual language, yet contracts are enforced all the time.\n\nA contract can be explicitly modified by verbal agreement, or can be entirely verbal, but oral agreements face evidence problems, namely, what *exactly* did A and B say? It's scientifically well established that parties can be morally certain that the conversation went \"A\" (for one person) and \"Not A\" (for the other person). Using \"could\" rather than \"would\" in speech makes a huge difference in interpretation. There is a rule, the [parol evidence rule](http://articles.rollingsons.co.uk/2012/04/the-parol-evidence-rule.html), which essentially says that unless there is a good reason to not do so, the contract as written is what is enforced.\n\nEven if the conversation had been written into the contract, there's no basis in the contract for objectively determining whether a thing is old and \"just broke\". So even as an additional clause in the contract, it doesn't afford you a clear escape hatch. You might be able to prove with expert testimony that indeed the pipes had been corroding for a hundred years, and you could not have caused the pipes to burst."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of rental agreements in the UK, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding verbal agreements made prior to signing a written contract?\n\nA) Verbal agreements always supersede written contracts if there's a discrepancy between the two.\n\nB) Verbal agreements have no legal standing and can never be used to interpret or modify a written contract.\n\nC) Verbal agreements can be considered in interpreting the contract, but the written terms generally prevail unless there's clear evidence of misunderstanding or misrepresentation.\n\nD) Verbal agreements are only valid if they're recorded and attached to the written contract as an addendum.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, verbal agreements made prior to signing a contract can be considered in interpreting the contract, especially if they clarify ambiguous terms or demonstrate a clear misunderstanding. However, the parol evidence rule generally gives precedence to the written contract terms. Courts may consider verbal agreements if there's strong evidence of misrepresentation or a failure in the \"meeting of the minds,\" but this is not automatic. The written contract is still the primary document, and tenants are generally expected to understand what they're signing.

It *is* illegal to possess or receive certain kinds of pornography, namely child porn, under [18 USC 2252](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252) and [18 USC 2252a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) (there is a subtle legal difference between \"[child pornography](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256#8)\" and \"visual depiction (which) involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\"). In order to view anything on the internet, you have to first receive it, so there is potential criminal liability. These sections allows one affirmative defense, if one\n\n> knowingly possesses, or knowingly accesses with intent to view, any\n>  book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any\n>  other material that contains an image of child pornography that has\n>  been mailed, or shipped or transported using any means or facility of\n>  interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or\n>  foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was\n>  produced using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or\n>  transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any\n>  means, including by computer;\n\nbut also\n\n> (1\\) possessed less than three images of child pornography; and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) promptly and in good faith, and without retaining or allowing any\n>  person, other than a law enforcement agency, to access any image or\n>  copy thereof\u2014\n> \n> \n> (A) took reasonable steps to destroy each such image; or\n> \n> \n> (B) reported the matter to a law enforcement agency and afforded that\n>  agency access to each such image.\n\nA person's belief that the website was moderated is not a defense.\n\nThere are also state statutes, typically stronger, which outlaw possession of child porn. [Crabtree v. Kentucky](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-court-of-appeals/1609602.html) is an example of such a (successful) conviction. The court addresses the question of whether \"merely viewing\" can constitute actual possession: the court found that it did:\n\n> Crabtree urges us to consider that his merely viewing child\n>  pornography images before deleting them should not be deemed to\n>  constitute actual possession. After reviewing the facts of this case,\n>  we are not persuaded that this is a valid argument in light of the\n>  Ninth Circuit's definition of possession in Romm, supra: that the act\n>  of seeking out child pornography and exercising control over it\n>  constitutes criminal possession\u2014regardless of whether it is\n>  downloaded. Crabtree admitted to seeking out the material and to\n>  having it on his computer.\n\nIt would be impractical to try to review 50 states' worth of child porn laws plus the federal statute, but there is also a \u201cTemporary innocent possession\u201d defense, which is conceivably applicable to the situation where you click a link and surprise! In the above case, defendant had to click a link that indicated the nature of the contents, and had to confirm file\\-saving of a file whose name was indicative of its content. Such circumstances overrule the presumption of temporary innocent possession.\n\nA question raised in the comments is whether a porn\\-ambush could lead to a conviction. Suppose that a web page has a number of embedded child\\-porn images which are saved to a user's computer without his knowledge. As pointed out in [this report](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/sex-offense-topics/201212-federal-child-pornography-offenses/Chapter_02.pdf) of the US Sentencing Commission,\n\n> A conviction for receipt, however, requires proof beyond a reasonable\n>  doubt that a defendant *knowingly* came into possession of child\n>  pornography at the time that the image or video was received\n\nwith case law citations. The case of [US v. Kuchinski](https://openjurist.org/469/f3d/853/united-states-v-kuchinski), 469 F. 3d 853 is instructive, because defendant did knowingly seek out and download a number of child porn images, and was convicted. In 94 of those cases, he knew he was receiving child pornography; in over 10,000 other cases, such images were found in his system cache (this is relevant to sentencing). The court found that it matters that \"Kuchinski had no knowledge of the images that were simply in the cache files\", and the court concluded, in K's favor, that\n\n> Where a defendant lacks knowledge about the cache files, and\n>  concomitantly lacks access to and control over those files, it is not\n>  proper to charge him with possession and control of the child\n>  pornography images located in those files, without some other\n>  indication of dominion and control over the images. To do so turns\n>  abysmal ignorance into knowledge and a less than valetudinarian grasp\n>  into dominion and control.\n\nDo you know about the system cache, and do you know how to control it? If not, you might avoid the charge. \nIn other words, it depends on the circumstances surrounding the possession and the evidence of a *knowing* act, as well as the jurisdiction."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is browsing an adult website that claims all content is of individuals 18 years or older.

When you purchased an item, you would have to pay for shipping with United States Dollars. Additionally, the amount in credits of the item you bought would be deducted from you and added to the seller.\n\nIt was a \"virtual economy\", in a way, permitting users to buy and sell items for free by using so\\-called Listia Credits.

According to [Lexology.com](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a0243a6e-75e2-4dd3-9bb0-72a720837f85), \n\n> In 2013, FinCEN released guidance (the \"Guidance\") explaining its position on money transmission in the context of virtual currency. An individual or company involved in virtual currency transactions would be considered a money transmitter if (1\\) it acts as an \"exchanger\" or \"administrator\" in the transactions; (2\\) the virtual currency involved is a \"convertible virtual currency\" (CVC); and (3\\) the company facilitates the movement of funds between different persons or locations.\n\nPertaining to exchanging/issuing:\n\n> Importantly for app and game developers, an administrator is an entity that (1\\) issues a virtual currency and (2\\) has the authority to redeem the virtual currency. \"Issuing\" means putting a virtual currency into circulation, for example, by providing users virtual currency for free, in exchange for real currency, or as a promotion. Redeeming means withdrawing the virtual currency from circulation, whether in exchange for in\\-game/in\\-app items or features, real\\-world goods or services, or real currency, or otherwise.\n\nAnd more specifically, \n\n> An administrator would be a money transmitter, however, only if the virtual currency it issues and redeems is a CVC. FinCEN defines a CVC as a virtual currency that either (1\\) has an equivalent value in real currency or (2\\) acts as a substitute for real currency.\n\nBased on that, would you say that a company like Listia would be considered a \"Money Transmitter\" and that they are required to implement a BSA/AML program? Would companies building a similar marketplace today be considered as such?

This is typical of how capricious this field is, and how \"laws as written\" provide little practical guidance.*\n\nWith in\\-game virtual currencies, game platform developers want USD to turn into those currencies, and not become USD again. This solves the \"money transmitter\" problem.

You could redeem for purchases but not USD. (The problem came if the purchases were easily fungible to cash, e.g. Krugerrands, Bally's casino chips, or Visa gift cards). \n\n* Very often, this is scammish in that the \"great values\" are in fact cheap Chinese junk (if they sell iPads those are fairly fungible; selling unresaleable junk moves them even further away from being a money transmitter), and/or\n* they charge you retail UPS shipping, and handling too, while they *pay* UPS's best volume discount rate.\n\n**There is no substitute for having good legal advice and keeping up with the trends of what is happening in the in\\-game\\-currency field.

But you might want to check the actual legislative language of [the statute referred therein](http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=110525) and the prior or consecutive ones \\-\\-all pertaining to statutes of limitations\\-\\- so as to ascertain the accuracy of information in the first link (navigating through the bunch of LA two\\- or three\\-line statutes for *this* and *that* gets annoying).\n\n> They are desperate to get me to move out since it is a rent\\-controlled\n>  unit and I feel like they have done this to cause issues and force me\n>  to default on rent. Is this a legal practice?\n\nI am not knowledgeable of state legislation particular to *rent\\-controlled* units, but I highly doubt it is lawful for them to proceed that way. Other details you describe reflect that the company has been \\-\\-or is being\\-\\- malicious or grossly negligent. If so, strictly speaking, the company's conduct (1\\) ought to weaken its position or merits in trying to force you out, and (2\\) tends to contravene the *contract law* covenant of *good faith and fair dealing* (see below).\n\nIf your lease mentions any statutes regarding *rent\\-controlled* units, you may want to search for case law at [leagle.com](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch?crt=Louisiana) to see how the statutes are applied.\n\nWithout knowing the terms of your lease, I think your priority should at all times be the rent itself so as to avoid eviction.\n\n> Does the \"billing every two months\" in the lease have any hold on this\n>  issue if they breached their own lease?\n\nMaybe not. The repeated, yet sole, failure to send you the bimonthly billings falls short of landlord's *breach of contract*.\n\nFor your argument on *breach of contract* to prevail, you would have to prove that the landlord knowingly/deliberately let the water bills pile up *prior to* demanding you to pay everything at once. That would prove that the landlord is not meeting the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing* that is prerequisite in contract law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in a rent-controlled unit has been back-billed for 4.5 years of water utilities by their landlord, despite the lease stating that billing should occur every two months. The landlord claims they \"overlooked\" sending the bills. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's legal position?\n\nA) The tenant is not obligated to pay any of the back-billed amount due to the landlord's failure to bill every two months as specified in the lease.\n\nB) The tenant must pay the full amount immediately, as the landlord's oversight does not negate the tenant's responsibility for utilities.\n\nC) The tenant likely has to pay the back-billed amount, but may have grounds to challenge the landlord's actions if they can prove intentional withholding of bills.\n\nD) The statute of limitations has passed, so the landlord cannot legally collect any of the back-billed utilities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, the landlord can legally back-bill for utilities within the statute of limitations, which in this case is 10 years for breach of contract in Louisiana. However, the tenant may have a case against the landlord if they can prove the landlord intentionally withheld bills to cause issues or force the tenant out, as this would violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. The landlord's failure to send bimonthly bills alone does not constitute a full breach of contract, but intentional withholding could be grounds for challenging the landlord's actions. Options A and D are incorrect because the tenant is still liable for the utilities and the statute of limitations has not passed. Option B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for the potential legal recourse the tenant may have."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80389/can-a-father-not-have-responsibility-for-child-support", "docs_id": 80389, "title": "Can a father not have responsibility for child-support?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A high school classmate of mine was approached 5 years ago by a lesbian couple to father a child with one of them.

This would be based on your friend being the actual father, and the non\\-mother not having adopted the child (extinguishing the obligations of the father). Many states, but not Michigan, have adopted the Uniform Parentage Act which covers assisted reproduction, but even in those states, this does not constitute assisted reproduction. The \"agreement\" is legally invalid (surrogate parentage contracts are [unenforceable](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(az2hzlgpudqfozvvzec0a2n3))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName=mcl-act-199-of-1988)), and that, folks, is why you should hire an attorney rather than devising a legal theory on your own.\n\n[This article](https://www.icle.org/modules/books/chapter.aspx?chapter=13&book=2020553510&lib=family&partdisplayed=2&from=store) summarizes the various paternity laws of Michigan. Under the [Paternity Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(fhfblzdrgwa0cpysgkxqlykp))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-722-711), this may be a child born out of wedlock, if the child is\n\n> a child begotten and born to a woman who was not married from the\n> conception to the date of birth of the child, or a child that the\n> court has determined to be a child born or conceived during a marriage\n> but not\n> *the issue of that marriage*\n\nwhere the meaning of the last expression would have to be determined by the court. Probably the court would say \"this child is not the 'issue' of the marriage\", given legislative intent. Under the [Acknowledgment of Parentage Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(oj2s2t0izrcixpt0y53jirgj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-305-of-1996), unmarried parent can by signing a statement \"define\" the parentage of a child, but the statute is specifically limited to a man acknowledging paternity, and cannot apply to a lesbian couple.\n\nThe clearest statement of the law of parentage for lesbian couples in Michigan is [Lefever v. Matthews](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/siteassets/case-documents/uploads/OPINIONS/FINAL/COA/20210401_C353106_49_353106.OPN.PDF) where (just one year ago) the court held that both of two women were parents \u2013 but in that case, the eggs came from one of the women and they were implanted into the other woman. An important distinguishing feature is that in this case, the woman at a statutory disadvantage sought parental rights, whereas your question is about a legal parent seeking to avoid a legal obligation to the child. Courts generally do everything possible to protect a child's right to support by the parents. The prospects that an actual father could avoid that obligation are slim."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a verbal agreement between a sperm donor and a lesbian couple regarding parental rights and child support, which of the following statements is most accurate under Michigan law?\n\nA) The verbal agreement is legally binding and the sperm donor cannot be held responsible for child support.\nB) The sperm donor can be held responsible for child support, but only from the date the couple requests it, not retroactively.\nC) The sperm donor can be held responsible for child support, including retroactive payments, regardless of the verbal agreement.\nD) The non-biological mother in the lesbian couple automatically has equal parental rights and responsibilities as the biological mother.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Michigan law, verbal agreements regarding parental rights and child support are not legally binding. The court prioritizes the child's right to support from biological parents. In this case, the sperm donor, as the biological father, can be held responsible for child support, including retroactive payments, regardless of any informal agreement made. The case of Lefever v. Matthews doesn't apply here as it involved a different scenario of egg donation within a lesbian couple.

In mass gunfight scenarios where multiple parties claim self-defense, prosecutors often face significant challenges in proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Lack of clear evidence: As mentioned in the Waco 2015 case, video and forensic evidence may not conclusively show who fired the fatal shots or who initiated the conflict.\n\n2. Self-defense claims: When multiple parties claim self-defense, it becomes challenging to disprove these claims without clear evidence of who started the altercation.\n\n3.

They work on revenue share. If there is not enough revenue to where their share would be greater than or equal to minimum wage, is the company required to cover the difference? What if this is a full\\-time employee, opposed to a contractor?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone who is an employee as defined in the federal [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf) (FLSA), 29 USC 201 et seq.(or parallel state minimum wage laws) and is not within the scope of an exemption to the minimum wage law, must be paid minimum wage.\n\nThe relevant question is whether or not the person is an employee who is not exempt from the minimum wage requirement as defined in the FLSA. The question is a mixed issue of fact and law in which the characterization given to the relationship by the company and the person doing the work is one factor, but not the only or the controlling factor, in determining employee status.\n\nThe exact nature of the work governs whether the FLSA's minimum wage requirement applies or not. For example, \"employee\" is defined for puroses of the FLSA at 29 USC 203(e) to exclude \"any individual employed by an employer engaged in agriculture if such individual is the parent, spouse, child, or other member of the employer\u2019s immediate family\" and certain kinds of volunteers. Piecework pay is allows under certain limited circumstances by 29 USC 207(g) when the usual result is that reasonable workers earn the minimum wage. Tipped employees (which is a form of revenue sharing) also receive special treatment. Most of the exemptions are found at 29 USC 213\\. Most relevant to your question is 29 USC 213(a)(1\\) which includes an exception for an \"outside saleman\" who is paid on a straight commission basis, and 29 USC 213(a)(5\\) and (a)(6\\) which contain exclusions for certain farming and fishing occupations.\n\nStraight commission compensation without regard to the minimum wage is generally not permitted with regard to an employee who is an \"inside salesman\" (e.g. someone who works at a retail store in a mall or at a phone bank for a telemarketing company), or for anyone other than an outside saleman in non\\-agricultural jobs.\n\nIndependent contractor status generally depends upon the degree of control that the company has over the manner in which the work is performed, the assignability of the contract to do the work, and the extent to which the worker does work for many different companies on a contract basis while complying with employment related laws for the contactor's own employees (e.g. worker's compensation). The working for many different companies on a contract basis prong of the test is frequently controlling in practice. Six of the main factors considered by the Labor Department in determining independent contractor status are discussed in [Fact Sheet \\#13](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.htm).\n\nA true independent contractor may be paid on a revenue sharing basis without regard to minimum wage, although in practice, if this results in the independent contractor earning less than minimum wage, there will be strict scrutiny of the practice. Typical independent contractor arrangements that would be allowed would include an attorney working on a contingent fee basis, or an independent broker or realtor working on a straight commission bais. More often than not, a true independent contractor is someone you couldn't even imagine being an employee subject to minimum wage laws of the company in light of the overall relationship and often this will involve a business to business contract, rather than a business to a non\\-professional individual contract with only personal services involved.\n\nThere are some safe harbor provisions that if met can insure independent contract status, but it is very common for someone who legally is an employee to be misclassified as an independent contractor in an attempt (often futile if the matter is pressed by regulatory or tax officials) to avoid compliance with laws incident to the employment relationship."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup hires individuals to work as \"independent contractors\" on a revenue-sharing basis for their new app. These individuals work full-time hours exclusively for the startup, use company equipment, and follow strict guidelines set by the company. After the first month, it's clear that the revenue share won't equal minimum wage for most of these workers. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the startup's obligations?\n\nA) The startup has no obligation to pay minimum wage since the workers are classified as independent contractors.\n\nB) The startup must pay the difference to meet minimum wage requirements only if the workers request it.\n\nC) The startup is likely misclassifying these workers and must pay at least minimum wage, regardless of revenue share.\n\nD) The startup can avoid paying minimum wage if they reclassify the workers as \"outside salesmen.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, these workers are likely misclassified as independent contractors. The factors described (full-time work exclusively for one company, using company equipment, following strict guidelines) strongly suggest an employer-employee relationship rather than true independent contractor status. The Department of Labor considers multiple factors in determining employment status, including the degree of control exercised by the employer and the extent of economic dependence.\n\nIn this scenario, the workers would likely be considered employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). As such, they would be entitled to receive at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked, regardless of the revenue-sharing agreement. The startup cannot avoid this obligation simply by labeling the workers as \"independent contractors.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the classification alone doesn't determine the legal status. Option B is wrong because minimum wage requirements apply regardless of worker requests. Option D is incorrect because \"outside salesmen\" have a specific definition under the FLSA that likely wouldn't apply in this tech startup scenario, and misclassification to avoid minimum wage is not permissible."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90182/are-you-allowed-to-solve-an-exercise-from-a-book-more-than-seven-times", "docs_id": 90182, "title": "Are you allowed to solve an exercise from a book more than seven times?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Germany, apparently, you are allowed to make a \"Privatkopie\" at most seven times.

Like if you burn your mom a CD. Or gift your girlfriend a mix tape. Or copy a page of the book and hand out the excercise to your two study buddies.\n\nSo there was a [court decision](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie#Anzahl_der_Kopien) that \"more than seven\" was more than what you would normally consider a private copy covered by this fee. If you make more than seven copies of a cassette for example, it would be okay to assume that you no longer did that \"for a close friend\".\n\nObviously, copying something from a book as you describe, by writing it down with a pencil on a notepad, is in no way \"a lossless copy\". Even if you type it into an app, manually copying something into another medium is not lossless. Ever. It is also for your very personal use, you don't give it to anyone, not even close friends.\n\nSo yes, you can make as many copies as you like, for yourself. If one breaks, and you make another, that is fine. If one breaks every day and you need 700 over the course of two years? Fine. But if you made 700 exact copies to give them to your \"700 closest friends\", that is not how the law thinks \"closest friends\" work.

This number emerged as a compromise related to the invention of copying devices that could produce near-perfect copies. The law recognizes a distinction between such reproductions and manual copies made for personal study or use.\n\nHandwritten notes or manual digital entries in note-taking apps for personal study purposes (like copying math problems) are not subject to this limitation. These are considered \"manual copies\" and can be made as many times as needed for personal use. The key factors are that these copies are not lossless reproductions, are for personal use, and are not being distributed to others.\n\nThe \"seven copies\" guideline was established more as a reasonable limit for sharing with close friends or family members using high-quality reproduction methods, rather than as a strict rule for all forms of copying.

A finding of NCRMD is a special verdict that results in the accused being placed under the jurisdiction of the Review Board.1\n\nAssuming for the sake of analysis that such an outcome is made out in the circumstances that you've described (much would depend on the expert evidence), such an outcome would not necessarily lead to indefinite detention.\n\n[The options available are](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/rr06_1/p1.html#sec11):\n\n* absolute discharge;\n* conditional discharge; or\n* detention in custody in a hospital\n\nAnd even when in detention in a hospital, there is a regular review and the person is released when detention is no longer necessary for public safety.\n\nThe burden is not on the detained to show that the chance of a repeat is essentially zero. That would be a great exaggeration of the barrier to release and incorrectly reverses the burden. Instead, the Review Board must find evidence that there is a significant continuing risk to the public, at the time of the hearing, in order to keep the person in custody. **There is no burden on the accused or on anyone to rule out future occurrences with any certainty**.\n\n[Latimer and Lawrence explain](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/rr06_1/p1.html#sec11):\n\n> The Supreme Court of Canada further clarified in *[R. v.

In Canada, when a person is found NCRMD, they are placed under the jurisdiction of the Review Board. The Board conducts regular reviews to determine if the person still poses a significant risk to public safety. The burden is on the Review Board to find evidence of a continuing risk, not on the accused to prove they are no longer a threat. The Supreme Court of Canada has clarified that there is no presumption of dangerousness, and past offenses alone are not sufficient evidence of continued risk. Options A and D are incorrect because they place an unfair burden on the accused or assume indefinite detention, which goes against the principles outlined in R. v. Winko.

But when using Google Analytics configured in the way explained in my other post, the visitor is not tracked. At least not in a way which violates the GDPR.\n\nYou worry about the cookies. I also found [this article](https://www.humix.be/blog/configure-google-analytics-for-gdpr/) which also does and suggests to either:\n\n* change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, so it will be removed when the browser is closed. To do this, set the Cookie Expiration variable in your Google Analytics Settings to 0\\.\n* completely disable cookies. (GA does not require cookies). To do this, set the `storage` field to `none`:\n\n```\nga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', {\n  'storage': 'none'\n});\n\n```\n\nIf you do not disable cookies, cookies can be used for tracking, which is more general defined in the GDPR as profiling. Profiling is defined in [Art. 4 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) as:\n\n> \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;\n\n[Art. 22(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/) disallows profiling. Therefore in the settings menu from Google Analytics you have to disable data sharing and data collection.\n\nSo data will only be used for the analytics function. But because you have configured to Anonymize your visitors IP Address, the part of the IP address used for this, is no longer considered personal data. This is because approx. 250 other users share the same part of the ip address which is stored, so data is not distinguishable between those 250 users. \n\nThe anonymisation used by google is currently considered good enough. At least by the Dutch DPA. This might change if someone proves it is not good enough anonymized. \n\nNote that I am not a lawyer either, but I have read from multiple experts that analytics can be a \"legitimate interest\", the same way marketing can be a legitimate interest. This way configured the privacy impact is considered very low.\n\nIt is also very important to note that a [DPA](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-6/) consideres GA Google Analytics compliant. Even if a court would not agree in the future, you are acting in good faith if you follow those instructions, so you will probably not be fined. The DPA does currently not suggest to change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, or disable cookies completely.\n\nNote that the GDPR does not require doing anything to make it **technical** impossible to track someone. If a website has access to the data to track someone, but \"promises\" not to do that, that is fine. And rules regarding the usage of cookies in general, is not part of the GDPR, but (currently) part of the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002). Only the way to ask for consent for storing cookies is defined in the GDPR."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under GDPR, which of the following configurations for Google Analytics (GA) would most likely be considered compliant without requiring explicit user consent?\n\nA) Using GA with default settings, including full IP address collection and 2-year cookie expiration\n\nB) Using GA with anonymized IP addresses, disabled data sharing, and cookies set to expire when the browser closes\n\nC) Using GA with anonymized IP addresses, but keeping the default 2-year cookie expiration and enabling all data sharing options\n\nD) Completely disabling GA and not collecting any analytics data\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is not compliant as it uses full IP addresses and long-term cookies, which could be considered personal data under GDPR.\n\nOption B is the most likely to be compliant without explicit consent.

Upon return, the car has multiple issues including a non-functioning horn, broken reverse lights, and cracked windows. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding your legal rights in this situation?\n\nA) You have no legal recourse as lending a car implies accepting all risks of damage.\nB) You can only demand repairs for major structural damage, not minor issues like lights or windows.\nC) You can legally demand full repairs or replacement with a car of equal or better condition.\nD) You can only request partial compensation, as some wear and tear is expected when lending a vehicle.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the principles derived from English common law (which is assumed to be applicable in South Africa), when you lend a car to someone primarily for their benefit, they owe you a high standard of care. The borrower is responsible for the car's upkeep and is expected to return it in nearly the original condition. If they fail to do so, they could be liable for providing you with a new car of the same make or at least a car in no worse condition than when it was lent. Therefore, you can legally demand full repairs or replacement with a car of equal or better condition.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lending a car does not imply accepting all risks of damage. The borrower has a responsibility to care for the vehicle.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the high standard of care applies to all aspects of the vehicle, not just major structural damage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in this case, even ordinary wear and tear would be considered too much.

In this book furniture buyers and reporters and others are admitted to a complex of buildings housing offices and showrooms for a set of sales\\-related parties, as part of a major furniture show. One person P is apparently taking photos from a hallways of new furniture designs through windows into a closed showroom. Another person E comes from inside, and demands the film, threatening to \"stomp your camera\" if the film is not surrendered. P does surrender the film with an attitude that suggests that he felt he had been caught acting wrongly or even illegally.\n\nP was standing in a hallway to which he had apparently been lawfully admitted, and was not trespassing.

Transcripts are made when there is a sound recording only upon a request submitted to the court that then outsources the request to independent contractor transcriptionists.\n\nThis is a fairly recent development and there may be live stenographers (also known as court reporters) in some general jurisdiction courts still today in Colorado, but it is profoundly less expensive to tape record a hearing or trial and just transcribe them upon request at the expense of a party, than it is to have a live stenographer make a verbatim record of every hearing or trial. In limited jurisdiction courts typically only about one in a hundred cases is appealed, and in general jurisdiction courts typically about one in ten cases are appealed. The marginal cost of an audio recording that isn't transcribed, once the courtrooms are wired for sound, is negligible (perhaps $10 per day (or less) for storage media). The marginal costs of a live stenographer or transcriptionist per day is on the order of $240\\+, which adds up over the course of a year. In the limited jurisdiction court, live court reporting would cost about $24,000 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 1% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system). In general jurisdiction courts, live court reporting would cost about $2,400 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 10% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system).\n\nIn contrast, with sound recordings, the cost per day of trial actually appealed in limited jurisdiction courts would cost $1,240, and in general jurisdiction courts it would cost $340\\. These are judicial branch expenses small enough to be financed with court filing fees.\n\nDepositions prior to a trial are often handled by a live stenographer and sometimes handled by a videographer as well, but almost never conducted with sound only recordings in the absence of extreme circumstances like a blizzard that makes it impossible to secure the court reporter's attendance (in part because there is almost always a desire to have a transcript made and because the stenographer can confirm spellings and ambiguous sounding words with the deponents and counsel during breaks avoiding errors in the final product).\n\n> Are court proceedings ever filmed or otherwise visually recorded?\n\nDepositions and court proceedings are sometimes filmed. A video of a deposition can be presented to a judge or jury in lieu of testimony when the witness is not available or to impeach the testimony of the witness.\n\nIt is unusual in Colorado for court proceedings to be visually recorded. But, in Alaska, there is a state constitutional right to participate in most kinds of court proceedings and legislative hearings by video conference (because geographically, Alaska is about a third the size of the continental U.S. and thinly populated with large roadless areas), so I presume that in Alaska, court proceedings are routinely videotaped.\n\nSome courts in the U.S. do initial appearances and arraignments in many criminal cases by closed circuit television from the jail, before a judge in the court house, in order to reduce the need to transport prisoners from the jail to the court house for a perfunctory five minute hearing which is not evidentiary, and there may be video recordings of those proceedings as well.\n\nMany federal courts and some state courts do status conferences and similar minor procedural hearings by telephone conference call and those are usually audio recorded without a live court reporter.\n\nIn Colorado, all oral arguments in appeals (except those rare cases that are secret such as juvenile cases and rare cases involving the details of trade secrets) are live streamed and podcast over the Internet. Many other appellate courts (but not the U.S. Supreme Court) do this as well. But, transcripts of oral arguments at the appellate level are rarely considered in further appeals. The video (or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court hearings, previously transcripts only and now audio as well) are released for PR reasons and for public transparency, reflecting appellate court's role as law making institutions, not for the litigants themselves.\n\n> It seems that facial expression, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc.\n> are part of the body of evidence on which a judge or jury decides a\n> case. So is this type of record ever made available, and if so, when?\n\nA deposition or other videotape provided as evidence in a case at trial is part of the record on appeal that an appellate court may consider. And, a judge or jury may consider things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. in those cases.\n\nBut, video of the court proceeding itself is simply a basis for preparing a transcript that will become part of the court record. Appellate courts in common law systems are forbidden from considering things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. of witnesses testifying in a trial. This is part of the credibility evaluation function that is reserved entirely to the judge or jury who is the trier of fact in a case.\n\nThe only time a video of a trial court proceeding itself would be considered would be as evidence in a different trial arising out of events that took place in the courtroom itself.\n\nFor example, suppose that a court bailiff goes berserk and starts shooting jurors for no reason in the middle of a trial that was being videotaped. That videotape could be considered in a criminal trial of the court bailiff for assault with a deadly weapon or murder, or in a civil case brought by the jurors or their surviving next of kin, for battery or wrongful death. The appellate court of the criminal or civil trial of the bailiff could consider the videotape, but an appellate court considering an appeal of the proceeding that was being videotaped could not.\n\nThis is basically just a historical artifact. If videotape had been in existence at the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 CE, appellate courts in common law countries would no doubt have the right to review questions of both fact and law, rather than merely law as they do today.\n\nIn civil law countries, such as those of continental Europe, judges take notes regarding evidence, but there is no verbatim record of the proceedings and any assertion that the judge was mistaken about the facts is resolved by retrying the disputed facts over again in a second instance court proceeding, a process reflecting even more rudimentary court resources than those existing prior to tape and video recording were invented."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado's court system, which of the following statements is true regarding the use of sound recordings in place of stenographer records?\n\nA) Sound recordings are only used in federal courts, not state courts.\nB) Sound recordings are used in all court proceedings, regardless of jurisdiction.\nC) Sound recordings are used in limited jurisdiction courts and most general jurisdiction courts, unless parties pay for live transcription.\nD) Sound recordings are only used in appellate courts for oral arguments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, in Colorado, sound recordings are used in all limited jurisdiction court proceedings (such as misdemeanors and smaller money claims) and in most general jurisdiction court proceedings. The exception is when parties choose to pay for live transcription at their own expense. This approach is more cost-effective than having stenographers present for every hearing or trial, especially considering that only a small percentage of cases are typically appealed. Options A and D are incorrect as they misstate the use of sound recordings in Colorado's court system. Option B is too broad, as it doesn't account for the possibility of parties paying for live transcription in general jurisdiction courts."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89755/what-does-abetment-mean-within-the-context-of-prevention-of-corruption-act-201", "docs_id": 89755, "title": "what does &quot;abetment&quot; mean within the context of Prevention of corruption act 2018 (India)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Section 12 of the Act only states that abetment of any offence in the act is also an offence and is punisbable. Bribing is a separate crime within the act but then what does abetment mean in the context of this law then ? can encouraging someone to take or give bribes be considered abetment ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Abetment is to [abet](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/abetment)\n\n> To encourage or incite another to commit a crime. This word is usually applied to aiding in the commission of a crime. To abet another to commit a murder is to command, procure, counsel, encourage, induce, or assist. To facilitate the commission of a crime, promote its accomplishment, or help in advancing or bringing it about.\n\nSo encouraging someone to give or take bribes is abetment, and so would, say, conveying the bribe itself so they don't have to meet in circumstances where it would be noticed.\n\nPer the legal dictionary of the Free Dictionary."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of anti-bribery legislation, which of the following scenarios would NOT typically be considered abetment of bribery?\n\nA) Advising a colleague on how to discreetly offer a bribe to a government official\nB) Providing transportation for a manager to meet with a client who is known to accept bribes\nC) Expressing disapproval when overhearing plans to offer a bribe, but not reporting it\nD) Acting as an intermediary to deliver a bribe from one party to another\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) Advising a colleague on how to offer a bribe discreetly is a clear example of abetment. It involves counseling and encouraging the commission of the crime of bribery.\n\nB) Providing transportation with the knowledge that it's for a meeting where bribery will occur is facilitating the crime, which falls under the definition of abetment.\n\nC) Merely expressing disapproval without taking further action, while morally questionable, does not actively encourage or assist in the commission of bribery. It lacks the element of incitement or facilitation required for abetment.\n\nD) Acting as an intermediary to deliver a bribe is directly assisting in the commission of the crime, which is a clear case of abetment.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it's the only scenario that doesn't involve actively encouraging, assisting, or facilitating the act of bribery. While it may be ethically problematic to not report planned bribery, simply expressing disapproval without further action doesn't meet the legal threshold for abetment as defined in the context."}}
