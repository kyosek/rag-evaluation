(Or was it just Bacon's own view? The paper is not exactly clear on that.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Bacon's time, common law countries had a greater proportion of legal rules articulated in case law precedents, and a small proportion of legal rules articulated in statutes passed by the legislature than it does today.\n\nFurther, meaningful access to case law resources for litigants was much more difficult in Bacon's time than it is today. There were fewer secondary sources, few of those were comprehensive and organized at the top level by subject matter, you couldn't do word searches or key note searches, and even primary sources, consisting of statute books and case reporters, were limited in number, expensive, and hard to use.\n\nThe private sector working together with civil society institutions would subsequently produce in American law, the digests and the \"restatements\" of the common law rules that Bacon sought (neither of which are themselves binding precedent).\n\nCharacterizing the distinction as between a \"rule based\" system and a \"formless\" one is in my opinion not a description that furthers understanding. In many respects, the common law of Bacon's era has more black and white \"rules of law\" that could be applied umpire\\-like by judges arising out of an already substantial collection of case law precedents, than civil law countries whose statutory laws often stated \"standards\" that set for vague general principles without little guidance regarding how they are applied in particular circumstances (as opposed to more specific and unambiguous \"rules\"). Precedents provided clear guidance in common law systems in a lot of specific fact patterns (e.g. the working of the \"mailbox rule\" for contact formation), but civil codes lacked the same level of nitty gritty detail. In Europe, in contrast, lawyers had whatever late Roman Empire legal digests had considered, in summary form, but there was no elaboration or development of this in fact patterns present at the time the court was making decisions but not in Roman times.\n\nThe Napoleonic Code and other major civil codes of Continental Europe hadn't been drafted at the time that Bacon lived. But what it did have what a subject\\-matter organized digest of the holdings of legal cases decided in the Roman Empire during Emperor Justinian's reign which were functionally treated as binding statutory authorities by the Latin speaking educated elite starting in the Renaissance and \"early modern\" period in European history which is known in legal circles as the process of the [\"reception\" of Roman law](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Roman+Law%2C+Reception+of#:%7E:text=the%20assimilation%20of%20Roman%20law,countries%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages.&text=The%20reception%20of%20Roman%20law,the%2015th%20and%2016th%20centuries.) after it had been dormant for centuries, a process that Britain did not participate in itself.\n\nThe issue was not that the common law system of Bacon's time lacked legal rules, or that it was formless in the sense that there was not a clear, albeit, somewhat latent structure to those rules, although few people had access to the whole of the relevant authorities.\n\nInstead, what was missing in Bacon's time was a compact, comprehensive, statute\\-like, widely available authoritative statement of private law (the law governing the interaction of non\\-governmental parties) and criminal law, that could fit easily in a hefty volume or three (written in Latin) on a library bookshelf.\n\nThis meant, in practice, in common law systems, that it was much harder to deal with legal questions (both transactional and litigation issues) without the assistance of a highly trained specialist lawyer who had spent years learning the system, while in civil law countries, an educated individual who was literate in Latin without other formal legal training had much more of a fighting chance of figuring out what the law required and said, reducing (but not eliminating by any means) the benefits associated with having highly trained legal counsel.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Francis Bacon's time, which of the following best describes the difference between common law and civil law systems?\n\nA) Common law was entirely based on case precedents, while civil law was solely codified in statutes.\n\nB) Common law lacked any structure or rules, while civil law was highly organized and rule-based.\n\nC) Common law had more specific rules derived from case law, while civil law relied more on general principles from statutes.\n\nD) Common law was easily accessible to the general public, while civil law required specialized knowledge to interpret.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The passage indicates that in Bacon's time, common law countries had a greater proportion of legal rules articulated in case law precedents, which often provided clear guidance on specific fact patterns. In contrast, civil law countries relied more on statutory laws that often stated vague general principles or \"standards\" without detailed guidance on application to specific circumstances.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while common law relied heavily on case precedents, it wasn't entirely based on them, and civil law wasn't solely codified in statutes at that time.\n\nAnswer B is inaccurate as the passage argues against characterizing common law as \"formless\" or lacking rules.

My understanding is that there is an alternative system (\"statute law\"?) in which ambiguous legislation stands until courts produce outcomes which are bad or inconsistent enough to force legislators (via the democratic process) to rewrite bad laws or write new ones. If I've misunderstood please correct me.\n\nAnyway let's say the people favored switching to statute law (or however it is known). Could this be done?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are confusing a few concepts.\n\nOne is the distinction between what are known as \"common law\" jurisdictions derived from the English legal system, and \"civil law\" jurisdictions derived from one of the continental European legal systems that is ultimately derived from Roman law.\n\nAnother is the distinction between determining the meaning of ambiguous legislation, which all courts do by definition, and the power of judicial review, which overturns legislation which is invalid for some reason rather than merely trying to interpret an ambiguous provision.\n\nAmbiguous means \"unclear\" or \"capable of being interpreted in more than one way\" and every time every court encounters unclear legislation it must decide what it means, even if it is not invalidated.\n\nIn contrast, some judiciaries that have the power of judicial review and those that do not. Judiciaries that can declare a law to be invalid have the power of judicial review. Judiciaries that cannot declare a law to be invalid do not have the power of judicial review. Every state and federal U.S. Court at every level (not just the U.S. Supreme Court) has the power and obligation to declare that a law violated the U.S. Constitution. In many countries, no court, or only a \"constitutional court\" has the power to make declare legislation to be invalid by exercising judicial review.\n\nEvery time that a legislature passes a statute on a subject covered by common law (i.e. judge\\-made law derived from case decisions that serve as precedents), it shrinks the scope of common law relative to statutes. And, in principle, almost all of the common law could be replaced by statutes without all that much difficulty. But, in civil law countries, statutes are frequently comprehensive and are the sole source of legal authority about their subject matter superseding all case law, while in common law countries, statutes are often piecemeal tweaks to a common law background that is assumed by the statute.\n\nFor example, every civil law country would have a comprehensive statute setting forth the principles of contract law, while a typical common law jurisdiction might have a statute that declares that certain contracts must be in writing but does not comprehensively set forth the law of contracts in all circumstances.\n\nThere are some features of civil law countries, such as the absence of jury trials, which cannot be constitutionally changed to the civil law system, even in jurisdictions such a Puerto Rico and Louisiana in the United States which have civil law roots prior to joining the U.S. (at least in criminal cases and in the federal courts).\n\nThe power of judicial review (i.e. the power of courts to declare a statute unconstitutional and void) is also inherent in the U.S. Constitutional system of government and could not be removed without a constitutional amendment. There are common law countries, e.g., England, which did not historically have the power of judicial review, which was an innovation for a common law countries such as the United States when it was first invoked. (For what it is worth, India goes one step further; its Supreme Court asserts and exercises the right to declare portions of its own constitution to be unconstitutional.)\n\nThere are other aspects of civil law legal systems which would probably also be declared unconstitutional in the United States as well, such as the lack of a prohibition on the introduction of hearsay evidence in criminal trials which violates a provision of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights known as the \"confrontation clause.\"\n\nIt is unclear to me whether the principle that case law precedents have binding legal effect in future cases, which is part of the common law system that is absent in the civil law system, has a constitutional dimension or could be displaced by law.\n\nBut, most aspects of a civil law legal system could be adopted in the United States if the relevant legislatures so desired. Indeed, many aspects of the U.S. legal system have moved in that direction. For example, only a handful of U.S. states now recognize the concept of a \"common law crime\". Almost all states now only allow criminal sanctions for crimes codified by statute, which was not the case at the time of the American Revolution, when few crimes were codified.\n\nObviously, with a constitutional amendment, almost any change to the U.S. legal system is possible.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between common law and civil law systems, and their application in the United States?\n\nA) Common law systems rely entirely on judicial precedents, while civil law systems use only statutory law, with no overlap between the two in the U.S. legal system.\n\nB) The U.S. legal system is purely a common law system and cannot adopt any aspects of civil law without a constitutional amendment.\n\nC) Common law systems allow for judicial review of legislation, while civil law systems do not, and this is the primary distinction between the two in the U.S. context.\n\nD) The U.S. legal system, while primarily based on common law, has adopted some civil law features over time, and could potentially incorporate more without necessarily requiring constitutional changes in all cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate representation of the complex relationship between common law and civil law systems in the United States. The passage indicates that while the U.S. is fundamentally a common law jurisdiction, it has incorporated some civil law features over time. For example, many states now only recognize statutory crimes rather than common law crimes.

I am NOT going to name it because it is more powerful without the name. Let's say that in 2024, this party has lost the midterms.

[This page](https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/poll-watchers) is a starter list of legal resources. [This page](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/policies-for-election-observers.aspx) starts you on deconstructing this notion of \"poll watcher\". Colorado is one state that explicitly allows partisan observers, [here are the rules](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule8.pdf).\n\nNo person is compelled to be an observer, so I don't understand who you think might be abusing a poll watcher. Perhaps you are referring to the possibility that an election official will prevent an observer from doing their job. Or perhaps you are thinking that being a poll watcher abuses the intent of some law. Whatever you have in mind, there are laws in each state that say what is allowed and what is forbidden, so you have to address this at a local level.\n\nNo state has a requirement that observers must come from or swear allegiance to the majority party of that polling jurisdiction (e.g. county, or precinct). Any attempt by election officials, or anyone else, to block observers from the minority party would be rebuffed by the courts. The courts will not attempt to divine inner motivations for sending an observer. Most states allow partisan observers. [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf) distinguishes \"challengers\" and \"poll watchers\", and there are distinct rules and powers for the two sets. A crucial difference is that a watcher cannot legally challenge a claimed right to vote or a precinct board action, but a challenger can. There are rules of conduct imposed on both kinds of observers, one of them being that you cannot challenge a voter for the purpose of annoying or delaying the voter. This is a misdemeanor (a crime) under [MCL 168\\.727](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-168-727.pdf), and as a criminal prohibition, the state would have to prove intent beyond reasonable doubt.

Or you think that physical evidence is required by law. You might try clarifying the question.\n\nA prosecution can be dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice. Dismissal with prejudice means that the charge cannot be pursued again, whereas dismissal without prejudice allows re\\-filing the charges, and is basically a temporary delay. Dismissal with prejudice can occur especially when the defendants fundamental rights were violated, for instance with illegally\\-obtained evidence. Dismissal without prejudice may arise because the prosecution needs to gather more evidence. The fact that a prosecution had started with an intent to use certain evidence does not mean that the evidence is itself now inaccessible. So in principle, any evidence that would have been used in an earlier prosecution can still be used. In the case of a felony, it does not legally matter how much time has elapsed since the alleged crime and the prosecution. So on the face of it, there is still a viable prosecution.\n\nPhysical (forensic) evidence is not required to obtain a criminal conviction, all that is required is testimony that \"fully satisfies or entirely convinces \\[the jury] of the defendant's guilt\".

Among the items that I found in these boxes were:\n\n* A vacuum cleaner that makes noise, but doesn't have any suction\n* A Rubik's cube with half of the stickers missing\n* An old CRT monitor with an image partially burned in\n* Shelves from a refrigerator\n* Lots of magnets, mostly dull but a few good ones\n* Instructions on how to install a door bell\n* 4 copies of the DVD Battleship\n\nThis was very strange to find this box.

With abandoned property, you can do what you want. With lost property, it is legal to *ignore* it. \n\nIf you take it, you have the obligation to try to return it to the owner. If you don't do that, it's theft. If you don't take it, you have no obligation whatsoever. Put it somewhere where the loser (the person who lost it) is more likely to find it, for example on the street. Don't take anything. \n\nClarification for comments: There is a box. And the owner of the box is nowhere to be seen. That box is by definition lost or abandoned \\- it is abandoned if the owner got rid of it intentionally, it is lost if the owner is looking for it. We don't know. We can make guesses depending on the situation. \n\nNo matter whether lost or abandoned, you are legally absolutely fine if you just ignore it. You have no reason to try to return it to its owner. If you don't make it your business, it's not your business. \n\nBut if you decide you want the box, or bits of it, and it isn't abandoned (which is hard to know for sure), then you have to try to find the owner first, and if you don't find them, then you can keep it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John finds a box of miscellaneous items in his moving truck after relocating to a new apartment.

Hence, a club or premise opened only to serve its affiliates or members shall not be considered a public place for the purpose of this provision of law.\n\nHence, if a citizen of India is not denied admission purely on the basis of his/her religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, his admission to a restaurant or a hotel owned and operated by the government or private concerns may be prohibited as the rights of admission may be reserved with the management of the premises. \n\nJust to conclude you can sue the hotel for denying entry", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A privately owned restaurant in India has implemented a policy of not allowing single male customers, citing previous incidents of disruptive behavior. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this policy under the Indian Constitution?\n\nA) The policy is legal because private businesses have the right to refuse service to anyone.\n\nB) The policy is illegal because it violates Article 15(2) of the Indian Constitution, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in public places.\n\nC) The policy is legal because Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution allows for special provisions for women.\n\nD) The policy may be illegal, but only if it can be proven that sex is the sole basis for denial of entry.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because Article 15(2) of the Indian Constitution prohibits discrimination in public places (including privately owned establishments open to the public) based \"only\" on grounds such as sex. However, if the restaurant can demonstrate that their policy is based on factors beyond just sex (such as past behavior issues or safety concerns), it might be considered legal. The key is whether sex is the sole basis for denial of entry. Options A and C are incorrect because they oversimplify the constitutional provisions. Option B is too absolute, as it doesn't account for the nuance of the \"only\" clause in Article 15(2)."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64279/can-my-landlord-require-me-to-agree-to-third-party-terms-of-service-if-they-inst", "docs_id": 64279, "title": "Can my landlord require me to agree to third-party terms of service if they install a smart lock on my door during my lease?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in the middle of my current fixed\\-term lease and have always had a mechanical key\\-based lock on my apartment door.

The smart\\-lock maker's website says that any use of their product constitutes agreement to their terms of service.\n\nIs the landlord allowed to install this new type of lock? How does responsibility divide among myself, the landlord, and the smart\\-lock maker? My concerns are:\n\n1. Smart locks raise new reliability, security, and privacy risks versus mechanical locks. When I agreed to rent the apartment, mechanical locks were in use and no indication was given that they would be replaced. See [this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/02/03/smart-lock-for-your-home-has-pros-and-cons/4454848002/) on tenants who have objected to installation of smart locks.\n2. When the smart lock is installed, I will have no choice but to use it in order to access my apartment for the remainder of my lease. It seems unfair for me to be bound by the smart\\-lock maker's terms of service when my use of their product is non\\-consensual. If the terms of service are viewed as a contract, I see a few possible arguments:\n\nA. There is no meeting of the minds because I have no desire to use their product.\n\nB. The obligations imposed on me (and limitations on their liability) in the terms of service are void for lack of consideration because the ability to access my apartment, which the lock provides, is something I am *already entitled to* by my lease, i.e., it is being used to fulfill an *existing* obligation of the landlord.\n\nC. The landlord cannot require me to take on additional obligations to a third party in order to continue the enjoyment of the apartment promised by my already\\-signed lease, so the landlord must indemnify me from any such obligations.\n\nWhat are my rights and how can I assert them? If I cannot prevent the smart\\-lock installation, can I somehow establish that I am *not* bound by the terms of service despite what the smart\\-lock maker's website says? Would I simply wait until such time (if ever) that I have a dispute with the smart\\-lock maker, and then use my non\\-consent to argue that the terms neither protect them nor bind me? How strong would that argument be, and what if anything should I do now to document that non\\-consent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your lease states what your rights and obligations are: you cannot unilaterally change those terms, nor can the landlord. Providing a functioning lock on the door is a statutory obligation of the landlord, and the landlord gets to say what kind of lock is installed as long as the device functions, and isn't impossible for the tenant to operate. If the landlord replaces the lock with a no\\-security $10 entry door knob that yields to a screwdriver, they probably failed in their obligation to provide entry security. Failing such a concern, you don't have a legal right to refuse the landlord's choice of lock. You also do not take on the obligation to acquire the tools needed for installation, and so on. In short, you don't have a choice.\n\nSince you have no choice and you are not a party in this transaction (the landlord is not acting as your agent, he is satisfying a legal obligation that *he* has), the question of \"agreeing\" to someone else's transaction and contract is irrelevant. The landlord, as purchaser, must comply with the terms of the contract since he is a party to the contract.

The landlord is fulfilling their legal obligation to provide a functioning lock, and the tenant has no choice in the matter.

While the Federal Trade Commission Act of 2006 doesn't explicitly mandate identity verification for utility services, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and related FTC regulations do require creditors to verify the identity of applicants. Utility services, including gas, are considered extensions of credit. The FCRA, specifically section 605A(h)(1)(B), requires that creditors use \"reasonable policies and procedures\" to verify the identity of applicants to prevent identity theft. The FTC has interpreted this to apply broadly to credit applications, including utility services.

I'm just wondering what assurances the witness would have that, that conversation would not be used against him/her.\n\nSOURCE: [David SIegel's answer found here.](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74942/can-you-plead-the-5th-in-a-civil-case)\n\n> When the privilege is asserted in a court case, the Judge may question\n> the person asserting it in private, off the record, to determine\n> whether the fear of incrimination is reasonable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe a frame challenge is necessary, as the underlying assumption of the question, and in particular the material quoted from another answer, is, I understand, incorrect.\n\nThis assertion, in short, is that if an invocation of the 5th is challenged, or perhaps just \"hard to understand (the validity of)\", then the judge may privately question the one asserting the right for more specific details. And from there they may then make the determination of the whether the invocation is valid. I've heard this logic many times myself, and have had it enter my head as fact at some point or another. It seems one of those persistent folk tales about the legal world.\n\nMy best guess is this stems from how the limits of the 5th amendment protection on self incrimination are typically phrased within major decisions, or popular summations thereof (including but not necessarily limited to, or specifically implicating, wikipedia pages). The phrasing I am most familiar with is \"an invocation of the 5th is valid if the person has a reasonable fear that the answer may be used against them in a prosecution\"; perhaps modified, more accurately reflecting the jurisprudence, to add \"or as a link which could lead them to evidence that could be used in a prosecution against them\".\n\nThe mistake then arises in applying an everyday understanding of this phrasing: how else are you to decide if a person is being reasonable unless you question them? Maybe they've got a good reason, maybe they have a psychotic delusion, maybe they're just trying to mess with the court for their own amusement, etc. etc. Surely you have to investigate to find out.\n\nBut within American courts, the term \"reasonable\" in such a standard almost never invokes the everyday understanding like this. Instead, it refers to some abstract and generic entity. A \"reasonable jury\" is not a judgment made about the particulars of a given jury, but rather an artificial construct created within the mind(s) of the judge(s) composed of purely hypothetical and generically \"reasonable\" everyday people. And the legal standard to uphold that the \"reasonable\" standard has been met is not whether the particular person/jury/whatever at hand was acting reasonably in the usually understood fashion. But rather if such an imagined being/group/whatever could possibly act in such fashions.\n\nAs such, if a Judge is considering overruling an invocation of the 5th, they must invoke such an abstracted entity, within the context at hand, and see if they can construe one who reasonably invokes the protection. The judge may be able to use certain facts about the particular entity at hand, depending. If you are invoking the 5th and the record already shows you have an extensive criminal record, the court may consider that this reasonable abstraction also has an extensive criminal record; at which point it may become clear that such a person may wish to invoke the 5th so as not to incriminate themselves in other crimes. Even moreso if the context is a far\\-ranging federal grand jury investigation into organized crime, and the questions you invoked the 5th on regard your connections to events of established interest to this investigation. And this is done without actually further questioning the person, beyond what is already in the record. All the court has to do is imagine some reasonable person with a reasonable fear within the context at hand; if it can, the invocation of the 5th is generally to be sustained. No actual determination of the particular person's \"reasonableness\" is required, or really even permitted.\n\nAll of the latter hypothetical was essentially the fact of the matter in the case [Hoffman v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/479/). It is a very interesting and informative read, and I think fairly accessibly written (as long as one isn't too easily thrown off the rails by the citation formatting). It covers a great deal of how any potential challenges to the 5th are to be handled. And the short is as I have indicated above: an abstract \"reasonable\" person is constructed, with such construction informed by the circumstances and knowledge at hand, and judgement of reasonableness made from there. It specifically points out that courts should be mindful of the fact that some people earn a living by violating and evading the law, and they are protected by the 5th as thoroughly and strongly as anyone else is, so the courts should consider the question of whether it would be reasonable for such a person to have invoked the 5th when deciding if it should be upheld.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, how does a judge typically determine if an invocation of the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination is valid?\n\nA) By questioning the person privately to understand their specific reasons for invoking the 5th Amendment\nB) By considering if a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" in the given context could have a valid reason to invoke the 5th Amendment\nC) By evaluating the mental state of the person invoking the 5th Amendment to determine if their fear is psychologically reasonable\nD) By consulting with other judges to reach a consensus on whether the invocation is reasonable\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The explanation clarifies that judges do not typically question the individual privately about their specific reasons for invoking the 5th Amendment. Instead, they consider whether a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" in the given context could have a valid reason to invoke this right. This approach involves constructing an abstract entity based on the circumstances and available information, rather than investigating the particular individual's reasonableness. The judge must determine if it's possible to construe a scenario where a reasonable person would invoke the 5th Amendment protection in the given context.

The Constitution authorizes the President, \"on extraordinary occasions to convene both Houses, or either of them.\" I. 3\\.

The answer is likely to be different in other jurisdictions.\n\nIf inadmissible evidence is offered by the prosecution and admitted at trial, this is a ground upon which the defense can move for a mistrial (which due to double jeopardy amounts to an acquittal), or upon which the defendant can appeal the conviction of the jury, if convicted.\n\nAcquittals of a defendant at trial cannot be appealed by the prosecution.\n\nBut, to appeal, the error in admitting inadmissible evidence must be contemporaneously objected to by the defendant's lawyer (or the defendant if the defendant is not represented by counsel), or the admission of the evidence must be \"plain error\" (which is very rarely met on evidentiary issues). If the defendant's lawyer doesn't promptly say \"I object\" that ground for contesting a conviction is usually lost.\n\nEven then, the standard of review on appeal is whether the judge abused the judge's discretion in admitting the evidence, not whether the appellate court would have ruled the same way if presented with that evidentiary question.\n\nAlso, even if there is an error, a conviction on a particular count will not be overruled if the error was \"harmless\", which is to say that there is a reasonable possibility that admitting the inadmissible evidence caused the defendant to be convicted of that count. Often, if the evidence is overwhelming, or the inadmissible evidence wasn't that prejudicial, a conviction will be affirmed notwithstanding the admission of inadmissible evidence.\n\nSometimes harmless error is evaluated considering all of the errors at trial as a whole, rather than individually, in addition to all of the other evidence admitted at trial.\n\nIf an evidence issue can be foreseen and is central to the case (e.g. suppression of evidence of possession of drugs in a drug possession case), the issue of the admissibility of the evidence will often be resolved in a pre\\-trial hearing and subject to appeal then, prior to trial, rather than being resolved in the trial itself where the prosecution has no right to appeal, and the defendant risks conviction if the ruling goes against the defendant.\n\nIf the conviction is overturned on appeal, the usual remedy is to remand the case to the same judge to conduct a new trial with a new jury, in a manner consistent with the appellate court's rulings.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal trial, the prosecution introduces evidence that is later determined to be inadmissible.

As per the Belgian laws and as mentioned in our terms and conditions on the bookings page (see below link), we are obliged to warn the clients 3 times in writing and then we can start charging 8% interest from the day of third warning and start the proceedings of recovery.

The website never asked to activate my e\\-mail or my consent before finalizing the booking. They just sent an email notifying me that my trip has been booked, which as I earlier said I ignored.\n\nNow, my question :\n1\\. I travel quite a lot including EU and Belgium and I am little worried. Am I liable to pay them the money? \n2\\. Is it even legal to threat me for such payment?

Suggest that they send the SMS message, as it is likely to go to the correct person.\n\nThere is little you can do about people making typos.

As near as I can tell, this law essentially requires cities to draw council districts in such a way that the number of districts where the minority citizens\\-of\\-voting\\-age population (CVAP) forms a majority of the total district CVAP is roughly proportional to the total minority population as a proportion of the total population of the city. That is, the number of seats that *should* be \"allocated\" to minorities is determined by total population, but the determination of whether a given district *is* allocated to the minority is determined by the CVAP, not the total population. For instance, if a city has a 7\\-member council and 30% of the population is a minority group, two of the seats should be allocated to that minority; this means two districts must be drawn wherein the CVAP of that minority group forms a majority of the total district CVAP. (I am assuming here that other criteria for application of the law have been met, e.g., that there has been satisfactorily demonstration that the minority group is insufficiently represented.)\n\nWhat I am curious about is whether it can happen that it is impossible to draw such districts due to wide demographic disparities between the total population and the CVAP, and if so, what is supposed to happen under the law.\n\nTo take a random example, according to [data](https://www.census.gov/rdo/data/voting_age_population_by_citizenship_and_race_cvap.html) from the US Census, the city of Santa Maria has a total population that is roughly 71% Hispanic, while the CVAP is about 49% Hispanic. Supposing the city had a 7\\-member council, 71% would suggest there ought to be 5 out of 7 districts where Hispanics should constitute a majority to ensure proportional electoral representation. But because the Hispanic CVAP is only 49% of the overall CVAP, it could be difficult or impossible (depending on the geographical distribution of the population) to actually draw seven districts with equal total population while giving Hispanics a majority of the CVAP in 5 of them. (In fact Santa Maria has a 5\\-member council, but I'm just using these numbers to illustrate the kind of demographic situation I'm talking about.)\n\nSo what I'm curious about is, how is this sort of thing supposed to work? What happens if the demographics and the geography result in irreconcilable disparities between total population and CVAP? Or what happens if districts can technically be drawn to satisfy the requirements, but must be obviously and severely gerrymandered to do so? Has this question ever been raised?\n\nI'm not actually sure that the California Voting Right Act strictly requires that cities play off the total population and CVAP in this way, but that appears to be the basis for some of the decisions that have taken place (see e.g. references to CVAP [here](http://www.goldenstatenewspapers.com/patterson_irrigator/news/local_news/election-district-map-cemented/article_cbd53a54-0cd6-11e6-be7a-ab3d8817dcb8.html)). I would welcome an answer that clarifies the overall mechanics of exactly what cities must do to comply.\n\n(Also, just to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to make clear that I'm not asking this to try to cast doubt on the CVRA or its goals. The reason I'm asking is that the city where I live recently underwent a redistricting to comply with this law, and asked citizens to come up with district maps meeting the criteria outlined above. I tried my hand and found it rather difficult to do, and I wondered if other cities with larger population/CVAP disparities might have even greater difficulties in achieving proportional representation.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to the act:\n\n> Upon a finding of a violation of Section 14027 and Section 14028, the court shall implement appropriate remedies, including the imposition of district\\-based elections, that are tailored to remedy the violation.\n\nand\n\n> The fact that members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated may not preclude a finding of racially polarized voting, or a violation of Section 14027 and this section, but may be a factor in determining an appropriate remedy.\n\nI have no idea what an \"appropriate remedy\" would be, in this situation. I guess the law leaves it for the court to decide.\n\nIn practice, it might be difficult to demonstrate that racially polarized voting is occurring, if the minority is not concentrated anywhere. Also, the act says, as its main point:\n\n> An at\\-large method of election may not be imposed or applied in a manner that impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election, as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the rights of voters who are members of a protected class, as defined pursuant to Section 14026\\.\n\nIf switching to district elections would *not* improve the situation because appropriate districts are impossible to draw, then it's hard to say that the at\\-large method is, in fact, \"impairing the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election\".\n\nThis act does not specify how districts should be drawn, by the way. I did find [Election Code Section 22000](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2005/elec/22000.html), which says districts must be \"as far as practicable, equal in population and in compliance with Section 1973 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as amended, to the extent those provisions are applicable.\" There's actually nothing currently at that section of federal law, because it was moved, but it refers to the federal Voting Rights Act.

Collecting personal data because it might come in handy is not OK. Your suggested purpose is to identify stalkers or hackers. However, this is still fairly vague. What would you do with potentially identifying information?\n\nFor this answer, I'll assume that the goal is to collect enough information in order to file charges. Typically, an IP address is sufficient for this and the court can then subpoena the internet service provider for information on the subscriber for that IP address.\n\nDo you have a Legitimate Interest for such measures?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR requires that every processing of personal data has a \u201clegal basis\u201d. Consent of the data subject is the most famous basis, but is not useful here.\n\nInstead, we can consider whether this could be a *legitimate interest* (LI).\nArt 6(1\\)(f) GDPR provides three criteria for a LI:\nthe purpose must be legitimate,\nthe processing must be necessary for this purpose,\nand this interest must not be overridden by the rights and freedoms of the data subject.\nThis last point requires a balancing test between the different interests and rights:\nyour interest to make a police report, the stalkers interest in privacy.\n\nTo determine whether the purpose of collecting this data is legitimate, I think it is important to consider whether the threat posed by a stalker or hacker is real and current, or speculative. In a similar context \u2013 video surveillance \u2013 the EDPB writes in its guidelines 3/2019:\n\n> 20\\. The legitimate interest needs to be of real existence and has to be a present issue (i.e. it must not be fictional or speculative). A real\\-life situation of distress needs to be at hand \u2013 such as damages or serious incidents in the past \u2013 before starting the surveillance. In light of the principle of accountability, controllers would be well advised to document relevant incidents \\[\u2026] and related criminal charges.\n\nSo I do not think it is compliant to say \u201c*if* there are any stalkers, I want to gather any data about them\u201d. However, if there have been stalking or hacking incidents in the past which you haven't been able to pursue due to lack of evidence, then this would shift the balance of the LI test to your favour.\n\nIn general, the GDPR does recognize that security measures (cf. Recital 49\\) and data necessary to establish legal claims *can* be covered by a LI \u2013 but this doesn't absolve you from carrying out the balancing test.\n\nWhich concrete measures would be compliant?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nYou have suggested various measures in order to identify attackers. However, the GDPR will only cover measures that are adequate and necessary to achieve the stated purpose, see also the Art 5(1\\)(b) data minimization principle. Here, \u201cadequate\u201d means that that the measure is actually able to achieve the stated purpose. And you are only allowed to collect what is necessary for your purpose, not more.\n\nFiles with tracking pixels are adequate to disclose the attacker's public IP and will not yield unnecessary data. However, the same information could be obtained without tracking pixels by logging the IP in the web server's access logs when the attacker accesses a web page. Under certain circumstances, technologies like WebRTC might yield the visitor's real IP address even if they use a VPN.\n\nGoogle Drive might not actually yield any useful information \u2013 this approach might not be adequate. In particular, it will not log certain information from visitors that are external to the Google Workspace domain. The Drive Audit Log is also only available at higher Google Workspace subscription tiers and is not part of Google's B2C free tier. I don't buy the argument that the stalker would have given consent to tracking through the Google Drive user interface. \u201cConsent\u201d has a very specific meaning in a GDPR context.\n\nGoogle Analytics is quite unlikely to produce useful information. For starters, many browsers block such analytics outright. Even if the analytics work, the data is unlikely to enable identification. GA will not show you the visitor's IP address. The estimated location is derived from the IP address, but often extremely inaccurate (I've seen errors of \\~300km, due to network topologies of residential ISPs). Demographics information are an extremely rough estimate that relies on sharing visitor data with Google, which goes beyond what is necessary. This estimate will be too unreliable to assist with prosecution.\n\nWhat other compliance hurdles could there be?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSome of the data you would collect would fall under the scope of the ePrivacy directive. For example, you can only set cookies if this is strictly necessary for the service explicitly requested by the user, or when the user has given their consent. For example, this means your proposed Google Analytics solution would require the purported stalker's consent to properly work.\n\nSpeaking of using Google services, it should be noted that these involve processing of personal data in countries that do not offer an adequate level of data protection. The continued use of such services might not be compliant following the 2020 \u201cSchrems II\u201d ruling.\n\nI also have doubts how you could fulfil your transparency requirements in this context. Per Art 13 GDPR, the data subject must receive transparent information about what is being done with their data. Usually, this would be satisfied with a privacy notice that is linked from every web page. However, this will mean that your honeypot cannot be fully covert.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSome aspects of these proposed honeypots sound quite reasonable.\nFor example, keeping web server access logs for a short duration is likely to fall under a legitimate interest, likely to be permitted by ePrivacy, and likely to yield an IP address that could help with a useful police report.\n\nOther proposed methods such as misusing Google Analytics is less likely to work for technical reasons. All these methods must consider what is adequate and necessary for the actual purpose, and not just speculatively gather data.\n\nFinally, all of the compliance work should be done before the honeypot is set up. Done carelessly, such surveillance measures could be illegal which could backfire.\n\nThis answer has focused on stalkers because identifying those might be useful and possible. In contrast, professional hackers will know how to cover their tracks and will often be beyond the reach of the law. It is very good cybersecurity practice to detect attacks, and honeypots could be part of that. But in that context, it wouldn't be very useful to identify the persons behind an attack.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to set up a system to identify potential stalkers or hackers targeting their employees.
