I hope it is not off topic.\n\nThe French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is considering [granting apresidential pardon](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12130732/Hollande-mulls-presidential-pardon-for-Frenchwoman-convicted-of-killing-rapist-husband.html) to some French woman. My question is the following: how does the concept of presidential pardon have a justification in terms of separation between the executive and the judiciary?\n\nWhy, philosophically, a president or any elected politician would have a right to directly influence justice decisions as in the case of presidential pardon? What is the idea behind that? I expect that the reason may vary depending on the country where it does exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simple legal answer is that the President has this power because the law gives it to them.\n\nHistorically, the right of the head of state to grant pardons is a legacy of autocratic monarchical rule: this was a power that kings and queens had over their subjects. In France, this power ended with the monarchy during the French revolution but was reinstated by Napoleon, himself an autocratic monarch, and it has remained in the various incarnations of the French legal system ever since. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon) is an examination of the concept in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept of [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) is a much more recent concept. In particular, the tripartite separation into administrative, judicial and legislative power can be traced to [Montesquieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu) in his [The Spirit of the Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_the_Laws) in 1748\\. This Enlightenment point of view crept into many political systems, however, the specific expression of it reached full flower in the establishment of the United States. It is worth noting, that pardons at both state and Federal level are part of US law vesting in the Governor (or some other member of the executive) and the President respectively.\n\nThe tripartite separation is supposed to provide checks and balances with each arm of government serving to limit the power of the other two. In this context, it is perfectly reconcilable that the executive branch should have the power to intervene and correct \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary just as the legislative branch does by being able to change the law in the light of judicial interpretation of existing law. In effect, the executive can correct \"mistakes\" in individual cases looking backwards and the legislature can correct \"mistakes\" in general going forward (the do in fact have the power to make laws retrospective \\[backwards looking] and specific but they tend not to do so).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between presidential pardons and the concept of separation of powers?\n\nA) Presidential pardons are a modern invention designed to reinforce the separation of powers.\n\nB) The power of presidential pardons contradicts the principle of separation of powers and should be abolished.\n\nC) Presidential pardons serve as a check and balance, allowing the executive branch to correct individual \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary.\n\nD) The concept of separation of powers was specifically created to justify the existence of presidential pardons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Presidential pardons serve as a check and balance, allowing the executive branch to correct individual \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary. This aligns with the information provided, which states that in the context of separation of powers, it is \"perfectly reconcilable that the executive branch should have the power to intervene and correct 'mistakes' made by the judiciary.\" This power is part of the system of checks and balances between different branches of government.\n\nOption A is incorrect because presidential pardons are not a modern invention; they are a legacy of monarchical rule.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while pardons may seem to contradict separation of powers at first glance, they actually form part of the checks and balances system.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the concept of separation of powers predates the justification for presidential pardons in modern democracies and was not created specifically for this purpose."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36922/legally-enforceable-contract", "docs_id": 36922, "title": "Legally enforceable contract?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I told my landlord that I will only be living in the apartment for half a school year because of my early graduation.

However, in most US states, a landlord is required to use the best possible efforts to *mitigate damages* by re\\-renting the apartment, and you would be liable only for the difference, if any, between the rent under the lease you signed, and the amount which the landlord is able to collect from a new tenant. You can also seek out a substitute tenant. The landlord does not get to have double rent from you and from a new tenant.

In most U.S. jurisdictions, the concept of \"mitigation of damages\" applies in landlord-tenant law. This means that while the student may be liable for the rent under the terms of the signed lease, the landlord has a legal obligation to make reasonable efforts to re-rent the apartment. If successful, this would reduce the student's financial liability to the difference between their contracted rent and the amount collected from the new tenant, if any. The landlord cannot simply demand full payment without attempting to find a new renter. Options A and D are incorrect because giving notice or mentioning another potential occupant doesn't automatically release the signer from the lease.

Such query would return a strategy, or way to play the hand.\n\nI see two problems with this:\n\n1. These kind of software is prohibited by poker sites. In their terms and conditions they clearly state that players using software like this will be banned and have their funds confiscated. (e.g. <https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/prohibited/>).\n2.

There's a separate law (\"[Preisbekanntgabeverordnung](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1978/2081_2081_2081/de)\") that specifies that (under most circumstances) a shop must put price tags on their items.\n\nWhat margin constitutes an error is disputable.

In this case, the supermarket displaying bananas with a clear price tag is making a binding offer. The customer picking up the bananas to purchase is accepting this offer.\n\nOption A, while seeming like a clear price display, involves such a significant price difference (10 times the displayed price) that it could be considered a significant error, which Swiss courts have allowed sellers to correct in some cases.\n\nOption B is explicitly mentioned in the law as not constituting an offer.

For some reason he thought the upstairs neighbor might be plugged into his hot water. This morning he woke up and heard the neighbor's shower running. So went and flipped the valve on the hot water heater and sure enough the water stopped upstairs.

You have to prove someone knew about the fact that one condo resident was going to be paying for the other condo's hot water.\n\nMixed up plumbing and electrical systems are fairly common in apartment and condo complexes, especially ones that have been converted. Chances are high it's a mistake and was not done on purpose.\n\nIf you can find the original general contractor, he's going to say it wasn't him, talk to the plumbing contractor. Who will say I didn't do it, and my work is only guaranteed for five years, so talk to the plumbing inspector. He'll say he didn't see it, and besides, all those inspection records were thrown out ten years ago. The condo association may or may not have had oversight of the construction. Can you prove the neighbor knew about it and didn't tell the condo association? Can you prove the realtor who your dad bought through knew about it? Was there a home/condo inspection done \\- paid for by your dad or the seller \\- before the sale that might have spotted it? \n\nThe police aren't going to care; technically, it is a crime, in a way, but it's not like someone tapped into someone's cable TV or electrical power meter last week. This is a problem from years ago, more than likely from the original construction; so who is really responsible? The police aren't going to run that down.\n\nAnd, what are the damages? A few months of part of a power bill? Is it really worth a lawsuit and a lawyer? Against who? I can't see a lawyer jumping into it.\n\nIf you want to do something for whatever comes next, yes, collect evidence. Tell the neighbor he/she's on your hot water. Take photos and get a licensed plumber to take a look at it and give you an estimate for separating the water systems. That will document that the two systems are not separate. (Either call your own plumber or ask the condo association for the name of someone).\n\nThen, start with the condo association. They may be responsible for the inspections before the sale. At very least, the condo association may have to check off on the repairs. And, they may know more about it *(oh, yes, we've heard about that in a few other condos...)* You could bring it to everyone's attention at a meeting; it may be a common issue in the complex, and other residents may not know about it.\n\nIf, in fact, the neighbor doesn't have their own water heater, they may be more on the hook for expensive repairs than your dad.

Their right to enforce what you can and can't do doesn't come from radio\\-spectrum law; it comes from property and contract law.\n\nYou are on their property subject to a license that they give you to be there. One of the terms of that license is that you won't set up or operate a wireless network. No doubt there are other things you are not permitted to do; for example, you may not be able to sell goods and services. If you breach the terms of the license then you are trespassing and they are within their rights to have you removed.\n\nIn addition, if you are a student (or staff), this is probably one of the terms of your contract with the university. If you breach it, they can terminate your candidature (employment).\n\nContracts can impose obligations on you that goes beyond what the law obliges you to do.

The university's ability to enforce this policy stems from property law and contractual agreements, not from wireless spectrum regulations. As property owners, universities can set conditions for being on their premises. Additionally, students typically enter into contractual agreements with the university upon enrollment, which may include policies about technology usage. Violating these terms could be considered trespassing or a breach of contract, giving the university grounds for enforcement.

In other states, you are simply penalized if the person giving the order is a police officer. In those states where there is no statutory limit on police power to give commands, it depends on what the courts have ruled. In North Carolina, following [Glenn Robinson v.

Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Utah grant that power with no restriction, and Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan,\nMontana, Nevada, New Jersey, North\nCarolina and Vermont limit police command power to specific circumstances (traffic or emergencies). [This article](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/MooneyComment_6w54gon8.pdf) lists various cases in states that bear on the question \u2013 there is no clear and uniform law on the matter in the US. Some courts have limited the power to traffic related matters, others (where it is not part of the statutory law) have extended the power to outside of traffic stops.

The Supreme Court has established that race-based policies are constitutional only if they achieve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to do so. This has been most notably allowed in college admissions to achieve student diversity.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the government cannot freely allocate resources based on race, even if it benefits minority groups. Such actions must meet strict scrutiny.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct but overstates the restrictions. While private organizations indeed have more freedom to create race-based scholarships, government programs are not entirely prohibited from considering race. They can do so under the narrow circumstances described in answer C.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect.

Among other things, [section 143 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/13/section/143) (as amended) explicitly prohibits the unauthorised use of \"amplified noise equipment\" (including but not limited to loudspeakers and loudhailers) within Parliament Square and (the amendment) \"the Palace of Westminster controlled area\".\n\nWestminster Council provides a map in pdf format of the respective areas: [Appendix to Protocol for enforcement of provisions in relation to\nnoise nuisance in the vicinity of Parliament](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/media/document/controlled-areas-of-parliament-square-and-surrounding-areas).\n\nBefore the PRSRA 2011, [sections 137 and 138 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/138/enacted) gave the Home Secretary the power to prohibit the unauthorised use of \"loudspeakers\" in \"designated areas\" no more than one kilometre around Parliament Square.\n\n2. [Part 3 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/32/part/3/enacted) amends the Public Order Act 1986 in relation to \"public processions and public assemblies\", including clauses related to \"noise\".\n3. [Section 78 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/32/section/78/enacted) abolished the common law offence of public nuisance and created the statutory offence of \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\".

The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, as amended, explicitly prohibits the unauthorized use of \"amplified noise equipment\" (including megaphones) within Parliament Square and the Palace of Westminster controlled area. This is the most specific and accurate statement regarding legal restrictions on megaphone use in protests.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 does not specifically prohibit megaphone use in all protests across the UK. It introduces broader provisions related to noise in public processions and assemblies, but not a blanket ban on megaphones.\n\nOption C is partially true but misleading. While the common law offence of public nuisance has been abolished, it has been replaced by a statutory offence of \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022.

My understanding basically is that a notary is an unbiased 3rd party that observes a transaction and creates some legal documentation about it or a legal document of some sort, and then \"stores that at their office\". It sounds like they are independent contractors or lawyer\\-like people who work for themselves. It looks like you need to be [certified](https://www.nationalnotary.org/knowledge-center/about-notaries/how-to-become-a-notary-public) as well.\n\nGiven that, I'm wondering what happens if the notary passes on. I wonder who is in charge of their documents, the ones where they were the third party. Say Google and Space X had a notary called Foo Bar, and then Foo Bar passes on. I wonder if there is some state\\-structured system for passing their notarized docs to some other notary to take over, so Google and Space X would have some sort of *guarantee* that they would always have some notary to vouch for their contract for as long as the companies were in existence. Wondering what the protocol is here. It's not as if the notary's documents get dispersed to their children, or passed on to people according to an arbitrary will. I would imagine they'd need to be part of a highly structured system so that there is a chain of notaries that is unbroken and that is known to always be legally valid or something like that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This could vary by jurisdiction. I'll discuss California; its rules are explained in the [California Notary Public Handbook](https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/handbook/), which also includes relevant excerpts from the law. \n\nThe system is not as structured as you might think. Basically the \"documents\" consist only of the notary's *journal*, a log of all the official actions the notary has taken. So if, for instance, you go to sign a document before the notary, they will enter into their journal information such as your name, the date, how they verified your identity, and the type of certification they provided.\n\nSection 8209 of the California Government Code specifies how those documents get passed on when something happens to the notary:\n\n> (a) If any notary public resigns, is disqualified, removed from office, or allows his or her\n>  appointment to expire without obtaining reappointment within 30 days, all notarial records and\n>  papers shall be delivered within 30 days to the clerk of the county in which the notary public\u2019s\n>  current official oath of office is on file. If the notary public willfully fails or refuses to deliver\n>  all notarial records and papers to the county clerk within 30 days, the person is guilty of a\n>  misdemeanor and shall be personally liable for damages to any person injured by that action\n>  or inaction.\n> \n> \n> (b) In the case of the death of a notary public, the personal representative of the deceased\n>  shall promptly notify the Secretary of State of the death of the notary public and shall deliver\n>  all notarial records and papers of the deceased to the clerk of the county in which the notary\n>  public\u2019s official oath of office is on file.\n> \n> \n> (c) After 10 years from the date of deposit with the county clerk, if no request for, or reference\n>  to such records has been made, they may be destroyed upon order of court.\n\nSo if the notary quits being a notary while still alive, they send their journal to the county clerk. It doesn't get given to another notary. If they die first, the notary's personal representative (typically their [executor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor)) is responsible for doing so. If the journal needs to be examined, e.g. as evidence that you signed your document on a particular date, you would be able to get a copy of the journal page from the county clerk.\n\nThe journal does not necessarily have to be kept for more than 10 years after the notary's death, resignation, etc, so there is no guarantee that those records would be available in perpetuity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, what happens to a notary public's journal when they pass away?\n\nA) The journal is automatically transferred to another certified notary public.\nB) The journal is given to the notary's children or distributed according to their will.\nC) The personal representative of the deceased notary must deliver the journal to the county clerk where the notary's official oath of office is on file.\nD) The journal is immediately destroyed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the California Government Code Section 8209, in the case of a notary public's death, their personal representative (typically the executor of their estate) is responsible for promptly notifying the Secretary of State about the death and delivering all notarial records and papers to the clerk of the county where the notary's official oath of office is on file. This ensures that the records are preserved and can be accessed if needed. The other options are incorrect: the journal is not automatically transferred to another notary (A), it's not treated as personal property to be inherited (B), and it's not immediately destroyed (D).

According to Washington's Public Records Act, the existence of a contract involving a state agency (including a state university) is generally considered a public record and must be disclosed. However, the Act also provides for several exemptions and allowances for redaction.\n\nIn this case, the university must confirm the existence of the contract, as it cannot suppress this basic fact. However, given that the contract involves cybersecurity software development, portions of the contract may fall under exemptions related to security concerns (RCW 42.56.420). Additionally, specific technical details or trade secrets of the private company may be protected from disclosure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the contract's existence must be disclosed, the full contract including all technical details would likely not be released due to security and proprietary information concerns.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the university cannot refuse to acknowledge the contract's existence altogether.\n\nOption D is incorrect because involvement of a private company does not automatically exempt the entire contract from disclosure, especially when a public agency is involved.\n\nThis question tests understanding of public records law, exemptions, and the balance between transparency and security/proprietary concerns in government contracts."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8957/in-germany-who-appoints-prosecutor", "docs_id": 8957, "title": "in Germany, who appoints Prosecutor", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: in Germany who and how appoints Prosecutors? \n\nps.  \n\nI am looking at <http://iate.europa.eu/>'s translations, with entry 'EN Prosecutor':\n\nEN public prosecutor  \n\nDE Leitender Oberstaatsanwalt  \n\nFR procureur de la R\u00e9publique  \n\nIT procuratore della Repubblica \n\nEN public prosecutor's office  \n\nDE Staatsanwaltschaft  \n\nFR parquet / minist\u00e8re public  \n\nIT procura / pubblico ministero\n\nComments on translations are welcome too. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A quick Google search shows a quote from *Public Prosecutors in the United States and Europe: A Comparative Analysis*, by G.

This contract should outline how and which data is to be stored/processed, how (technical and organizational means) this data is being protected, that your contractor will notify you for data protection violations by the contractor or their employees and that any data is being deleted when the contract has been finished.\n\nDepending on a few circumstances, your current web hosting contract or T\\&C with your web host may already be sufficient to satisfy both BDSG and GDPR requirements.\n\nAt least from a German perspective, you and your web host have demonstrated implied conduct (\"konkludentes Verhalten\") of storing personal data according to BDSG: by offering web site storage, usually access to server log files and some email service as well, a German web host does offer contractor services according to BDSG and are most likely about to store personal information (server logs, email messages). Most web hosts also do describe their infrastructure in detail, so you've also some outline of their technical measures to protect your data. \n\nSo: if you as a German resident did sign a contract with a German web host company after September 2009, you've both most likely agreed by implication to have that web host company to store, process and use personal data as regulated by BDSG.\n\nIf\n\n* your legal advisor does not follow this idea of implied conduct to be \"safe enough\",\n* your specific contract may be too old to correctly meet BDSG 2009 requirements or\n* you've made your contract with a foreign web host who didn't consider to be possibly impacted by some German law,\n\nyou may want to have a specific agreement with your web host in order to satisfy BDSG and/or GDPR requirements.\n\nMost web hosts are used to inquiries regarding which standards or regulations they are compliant with and how those do relate to one's specific product (for example, a web host may be PCIDSS\\-compliant to handle credit card information in a safe way, but this won't cover your self\\-written PHP script running on their shared web hosting server farm. While those confirmations are certainly less than a \"written contract\", they do give you some idea of how serious the web host does take their job to secure your data. \n\nAs you've already noticed, web hosts today do offer a free \"data processing contract\" as an amendment to your existing contract to legally assure how they're storing and processing data.\n\nSuch a contract usually doesn't imply any obligations to you, but still may be important. Why: according to BDSG and GDPR, you're still responsible regarding your user's data. If your web host experiences a data breach and loses your user's data, your behavior of NOT having a written contract might be seen as \"reckless\" in a legal dispute. A written contract saves you from that and also offers you the opportunity to file a complaint against your web host for violating that contract in order to redeem for damages.\n\n**So in summary:** BDSG from 1st of September 2009 does already address your specific topics in a very similar way than the GDPR does, asking for a written contract.

Suppose that the University wants to hire a new professor of mathematics but can't find any qualified LDS candidates for the position, and so gives the job to Alice, knowing full well that she is an atheist. Some time into Alice's contract, the university finds Bob, who has similar qualifications as Alice but is an LDS member.\n\nCould the university terminate Alice's contract on purely religious grounds in order to give her professorship to Bob? (That is, assume that there exist no other grounds on which the university could justify a dismissal\u2014i.e., Alice has been maintaining satisfactory job performance, has not been violating the school's honour code, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on whether Alice is a \"minister.\"\n\nThis case plays on the tension between employment\\-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, and the First Amendment, \u201cwhich protects a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.\u201d [*Hosanna\\-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church \\& Sch. v. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n*, 565 U.S. 171, 188 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-sch-v-equal-empt-opportunity-commn).\n\nWe resolve the question by asking whether Alice is a \"minister,\" i.e., whether the religion has entrusted her \u201cwith the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith\u201d [*Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey\\-Berru*, 140 S. Ct. 2049, 2069 (2020\\)](https://casetext.com/case/our-lady-of-guadalupe-school-v-morrissey-berru). If so, she falls within the First Amendment's \"ministerial exception\" to employment\\-discrimination laws.\n\nBut the precise definition of that term remains rather squishy, so we don't really have a test that can give us a reliable answer. In *Hosanna\\-Tabor*, for instance, a teacher at a religious school brought an ADA claim after the school fired her after she missed a semester on disability leave. The court rejected her claims based on the religious character of her work, and the Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that she was a minister based on the job title she received (Minister of Religion, Commissioned), her own use of the minister title, the religious character of many of her job responsibilities, her religious training, and other factors.\n\nAlthough she was a minister who was replaced by another minister, the Court suggested that the outcome might be the same if she were not a minister. Noting that the school in that case \u2013 just like in your hypothetical \u2013 hired lay teachers only when ministers were not available, it rejected the argument that an employee falls outside the ministerial exception simply because there are non\\-ministers with the same job functions:\n\n> Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions\u2014particularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.\u201d *Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 193\\.\n\nAnd a few years later, the Court indicated that perhaps none of those factors from *Hosanna\\-Tabor* are actually required. Instead, it directed courts to ask whether the school \u201centrusts a teacher with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith.\u201d *Our Lady of Guadalupe School* at 2069\\.\n\nSo in your hypothetical, the courts would probably look to see whether BYU treats its professorships as ministerial positions. Although the answer could vary from one religious school to the next, it seems quite likely that the courts would treat BYU professors as ministers, given their Personnel Conduct Policy:\n\n> It is a condition of employment that all personnel (including student employees) act in accordance with university policies and the Church Educational System Honor Code, including the Dress and Grooming Standards, and refrain from behavior or expression that seriously and adversely affects the university mission or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\\-day Saints. Examples include behavior or expression that\n> \n> \n> * Contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy;\n> * Deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or\n> * Violates the Church Educational System Honor Code.\n> \n> \n> All personnel are expected to be role models of a life that combines the quest for intellectual rigor with spiritual values and personal integrity, and to conduct their work in a professional manner consistent with the values espoused by the university and the Church. Members of the Church in nonstudent positions also accept as a condition of employment the standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges. The university regularly contacts ecclesiastical leaders concerning the temple eligibility of all nonstudent personnel who are members of the Church.\n\nI couldn't find any cases applying the ministerial exception to Brigham Young, but given its expectation that employees act as \"role models\" for the church's \"spiritual values\" and conduct their work in a manner consistent with \"values espoused by ... the church,\" I would be surprised to see a court get in the middle of the school's decisions to fire Alice and replace her with a member of the church, even if she had not run afoul of those policies herself.\n\n> The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way.\n\n*Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 196\\.\n\nStill, Alice could have other bases for suing the school. Based on your tags, I'm assuming you're most interested in employment\\-discrimination claims. While those might be barred by the First Amendment, *Hosanna\\-Tabor* explicitly held open the possibility that a contract claim might still be viable. *Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 196 (\u201cWe express no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers.\u201d).\n\nSo if the school signed a contract agreeing to employ Alice for three years, she would have a strong argument that it had waived its right to discriminate on the basis of religion for that period.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Brigham Young University (BYU), affiliated with the Church of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), hires Dr. Alice Smith, a non-LDS member, as a mathematics professor due to a lack of qualified LDS candidates.

Your vehicle is comprised of things like brakes, ABS, fuel injection, gear box. Nowadays, these parts are operated by electronic controllers.\n\nThe physical path by which the controllers receive and transmit electronic signals is called a bus. (It performs the same function as the internal bus in your computer, which connects the CPU, memory, etc.) CAN is simply a protocol for how information travels on the bus. So it does all the things you'd imagine a protocol does (boring things like dictating message formats be 64 bits and exciting things like determining priority).\n\nProtocols are defined by standards. Prior to widespread implementation of CAN, there were other standards (four, I believe) used by various manufacturers. CAN is widespread, but it's important to note that it's only standard on lighter vehicles.\n\n> **40 CFR 86\\.005\\-17(h)(3\\)**\n> \n> \n> Beginning with the 2008 model year and beyond, ISO 15765\\-4\\.3:2001 \u201cRoad Vehicles\\-Diagnostics on Controller Area Network (CAN)\u2014Part 4: Requirements for emission\\-related systems\u201d, (December 14, 2001\\) shall be the only acceptable protocol used for standardized on\\-board to off\\-board communications for vehicles below 8500 pounds.\n\nThe statute goes on to discuss other standards for heavier vehicles.\n\nWhat's unique about CAN? It's faster, but more importantly, it's a protocol that doesn't require a central computer. All the controllers get all the messages. It's kind of like having a bunch of people in a room yelling things out: everyone hears everything. And that's what you want in a car. However, the messages have to be interpreted by the controllers themselves, and that requires a separate \"higher\\-layer\" protocol.\n\nElectronic components *need* CAN to function, and if you have a car with electronic components, you *need* CAN in order to make it run. On the other hand, a vehicle can run without OBD\\-\\-it's just a nice secondary feature to help diagnose system performance (and problems). It obtains access to component information like speed, RPM, fuel trim, etc. Likewise, that pesky \"check engine\" light gets activated by a diagnostic code.\n\n**CAN is not mandatory for OBD.** OBD is designed to use a number of different standards, and CAN is one of those (remember, light vehicles makes beginning with 2008 use CAN, but OBD is in use in other types of vehicles, too). At it's heart, OBD II is just another protocol: it specifies message format and the connector's pinout. In the best teaching document I've seen on the CAN vs. OBD subject, [Michael Wen](http://www.oneminuteinfo.com/2014/02/can-bus-obd-ii-explained-for-dummies.html) mentions you can often deduce which signaling protocol is in use by looking at the pins in the connector (remember, CAN should be standard for light vehicles after 2008, but you might see one of the other four formats in older vehicles).\n\n**How do OBD and CAN work together?** OBD sends messages over the CAN bus (that is, the vehicle bus with the CAN protocol). OBD basically queries components by sending specially formatted messages via the CAN bus. The components respond via the CAN bus. That information goes either to a warning light on the dashboard or to a diagnostic scanner attached to the connector.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between CAN bus and OBD-II in modern vehicles?\n\nA) CAN bus is mandatory for all OBD-II implementations since 1996 in the United States.\n\nB) OBD-II requires CAN bus to function, as it's the only protocol that can communicate with vehicle components.\n\nC) Since 2008, CAN bus has been the required protocol for OBD-II communications in light vehicles (below 8500 pounds) sold in the United States.\n\nD) OBD-II and CAN bus are completely separate systems that don't interact with each other in any way.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because CAN bus was not mandatory for OBD-II implementations in 1996.

This answer is focused on conceptual misunderstandings in the question itself.\n\n> Where does fault lie in the following situation; and what tickets if\n> any should be issued according to Illinois Motor Vehicle Code and why?\n> \n> \n> Again who is at fault or what %'s of fault should be applied and why?\n\n**Lawsuits v. Traffic Citations**\n\nIt is important to understand that whether tickets could be issued according to the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, and legal fault in a lawsuit arising from an accident involving a motor vehicle are two very different legal concepts.\n\nAlso, there isn't necessarily only one person at fault or only one person who has violated the Motor Vehicle Code.\n\n**Motor Vehicle Code Violations**\n\nViolations of the Motor Vehicle Code are analyzed one by one in a criminal or quasi\\-criminal traffic court proceeding where the issue is whether a fine or other punishment should be imposed for violating it. One person being cited does not mean that another person can't be cited as well. These proceedings would be brought by the \"People of the State of Illinois\" against each defendant by a government official at government expense.\n\nThe government also has no legal obligation to bring charges for every violation that could in theory be legally supported by the facts.\n\nThe outcome of the traffic court proceedings would be inadmissible evidence in a lawsuit arising out of the accident. Usually the police report will also be inadmissible evidence unless the police officer who wrote it is brought into court to testify in support of it, or the parties stipulate otherwise.\n\n**Civil Liability In A Lawsuit**\n\nIn a lawsuit, brought by the private lawyer for a person who has suffered damages from the accident (called a \"plaintiff\") must show that someone else was negligent, which means that they failed to act with reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent harm to others, that this caused their damages, and must prove their damages. Private lawyers for the defendants whom the Plaintiff seeks to assign fault to are usually paid for by the defendants' insurance companies and argue against their clients having liability.\n\nA jury hears all of the evidence and assigns a percentage of fault to each party including the plaintiff. If the person injured is found by a jury to be at least 50% at fault, then there is no recovery. If the person injured is found to be less than 50% at fault, then the other parties at fault have legal liability to the plaintiff based upon their percentage of fault. *See*\n735 ILCS 5/2\\-1116\\.\n\nNegligence in a lawsuit doesn't necessarily have to involve a violation of the Motor Vehicle Code. A jury can find, for example, that someone was driving too fast for the conditions despite not violating the speed limit, or stopped too abruptly, even if those aren't Motor Vehicle Code violations and can find a percentage of fault based upon that conduct.\n\nA violation of the Motor Vehicle Code does not automatically translate to fault either. Violations of the Motor Vehicle Code are a basis for a finding of fault, in what is called *negligence per se*, if the code section violated was intended to prevent the kind of accident that actually happened. Failure to use a turn signal, for example, will rarely constitute *negligence per se* in an accident where one car rear ends another car.\n\nThere are very simple cases where one can truly state with absolutely certainty that only one party is at fault for purposes of a negligence lawsuit.\n\nFor example, comparative fault is hard to argue in a case where a garbage truck hits and damages a building while the driver isn't paying attention and the building owner sues the garbage truck driver and his employer, although even then the issue of what damages should be awarded can be litigated. (Full disclosure: I litigated this case for a building owner until it had to be transferred to new counsel due to a merger of my law firm with another law firm that represented the other side in the case.)\n\nBut usually (at least in cases that go to trial) there is at least some colorable argument that more than one person involved failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances and if so, the jury must allocate fault percentages on a basis that it feels best allocates responsibility for the harm caused to a particular plaintiff by the accident as it sees fit in their good judgment using common sense. And, this allocation of percentage fault is almost impossible to overturn on appeal if there is any argument based upon any evidence introduced at trial that the people to whom fault were allocated indeed not totally without fault.\n\n**It is impossible to say, as a matter of law, what percentage of fault should be assigned to each at fault party when more than one party is potentially at fault.** This is question purely for the finder of fact (usually a jury, but the judge in a bench trial).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit arising from a motor vehicle accident in Illinois, which of the following statements is true regarding the assignment of fault?\n\nA) The judge always determines the exact percentages of fault for each party involved.\n\nB) A violation of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code automatically translates to 100% fault for the violating party.\n\nC) If the plaintiff is found to be 50% or more at fault, they cannot recover damages.\n\nD) The outcome of any traffic court proceedings determines the fault percentages in the civil lawsuit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because in most cases, it's the jury that assigns percentages of fault, not the judge. \n\nB is incorrect because violations of the Motor Vehicle Code don't automatically translate to fault in a civil lawsuit. They can be a basis for finding fault (negligence per se), but only if the violated code was intended to prevent the type of accident that occurred.\n\nC is correct.

The maxim \"nulla poena sine lege\" (i.e. \"no punishment without a prior penal statute\") was historically applicable to *civil* law systems, such as are found in continental Europe. In common\\-law systems, there was never a tradition in which a crime wasn't a crime unless it violated a penal law, because crimes themselves were traditionally defined by court precedent instead of by statute.\n\nIn US federal court, the only allowable common\\-law offense is contempt of court. This is due to a court decision (*United States v. Hudson*), in which the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have the constitutional authority to hear a case in which someone is accused of committing a common\\-law crime. Even so, and even though there is a federal contempt statute, the Supreme Court has ruled that contempt is an inherent power of any court, and statutes around it only regulate the power (but the power would be there even without a statute).\n\nAt the state level, some states have explicitly passed laws saying something is not a crime if it doesn't violate the penal code (although this doesn't necessarily apply to contempt); see section 6 of the California Penal Code for an example. In other states, like Florida, common\\-law crimes still exist; Florida has a statute saying that any common\\-law offense is still a crime unless a statute has explicitly covered that same subject matter (section [775\\.01](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.01.html)), and specifies a generic penalty for anything which is an offense at common law and not addressed by any Florida penal statute (section [775\\.02](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.02.html)).

Based on the information provided, law enforcement officials, including park rangers, generally have no legal duty to rescue individuals unless they directly caused the peril. The case of Castle Rock v. Gonzales established that law enforcement has broad discretion in choosing whether to act on information or not.

Law enforcement and prosecutors have broad discretion regarding which crimes they prosecute and for which charge. \n\nAbout 1% of people arrested for committing rape are female, and while some of those cases involve materially aiding and abetting a male perpetrator (e.g. by holding down a victim while the male perpetrator engaged in the act), some of those arrests involve the fact pattern that you describe. \n\nIn part, the low rate of female arrest for rape arises from the fact that women commit violent acts, in general, at a much lower rate than men. The low rate of female arrest for rape also almost surely involves underreporting of rapes committed by women against women, in part, because women are less likely to conceptualize what they have experienced as rape and, in part, because law enforcement is often insensitive or dismissive of these charges in many places.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the U.S. Department of Justice's definition, which of the following scenarios would NOT be considered rape?\n\nA) A woman forcibly penetrates another woman's vagina with an object without consent\nB) A man forces oral sex on another man without consent\nC) A woman gropes a man's genitals over his clothes without consent\nD) A person penetrates another person's anus with a body part without consent\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe U.S. Department of Justice defines rape as \"Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\"\n\nOption A involves penetration of the vagina with an object without consent, which fits the definition.\nOption B involves oral penetration by a sex organ without consent, which fits the definition.\nOption C involves unwanted sexual touching, but does not involve penetration.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the protection of the developer's interests?\n\nA) The company owner can legally create a new company and purchase the original company for $1, effectively negating the developer's equity.\n\nB) The developer should insist on retaining 50% ownership of the IP to prevent any potential loss of value.\n\nC) Directors of the company are legally obligated to act in the interests of all shareholders, preventing unfair transactions that would devalue minority stakes.\n\nD) The developer's NDA prevents them from taking any legal action to protect their equity stake.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Directors of a company have a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of all shareholders, not just the majority owner. This legal obligation prevents them from engaging in transactions that would unfairly benefit some shareholders at the expense of others, such as selling the company's assets for a nominal amount to a new entity. This protection is a key safeguard for minority shareholders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because such a transaction would likely be considered a breach of fiduciary duty or even fraud.

This feels extraordinarily aggressive.\n\nThis is very strange to me. It feels like a paintbrush manufacturer demanding royalties on all paintings done with their brush.

Additionally, the software is not based in an English\\-speaking country, which may have thrown the interpreted meaning of \"derivative product\", as opposed to simply \"product\".\n\nThe AGPL is indeed in almost all ways the same as the GPL version 3; in fact you can see this by `diff`ing the two documents. The only extension of the GPLv3 made for AGPL applies to software being run on a server. While it is indeed possible to include code in the final files, which might, in theory, constitute a significant portion of this program, that does not happen.\n\nThe AGPL is apparently also meant almost exclusively for software, though the wording does include the ambiguous phrase \"and other products\"; this concerned me as it felt as though it might apply to the resources created by the work.

The 3D mesh created using AGPL-licensed software is not considered a derivative work of the software itself. The AGPL's main addition to the GPL is related to software running on servers, not to content created by the software.

My general reply to that was that I was not agreeing to anything in the business certificate rather that I was simply notifying the town that I was doing business in it.\n\nEven when I suggested that I get my parent to be an officer as well (I really do not want to have to do this), the Town Clerk stated that they would probably deny that too since I am listed as an officer and a minor cannot be held liable. However, the Town Clerk said that they would have to check with the Town Council.\n\nIn the mean time, is there anything I can do? The state does not restrict any age ranges to start a business and it is just my town that is causing a problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are correct that the local government has no legal basis for refusing you a Business Certificate (and I'm not saying they do or don't), you can apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a writ of [Mandamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus). This is an order of the court that basically tells the government to do the job the law requires of them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A minor in Massachusetts is being denied a Business Certificate by their Town Clerk's office despite meeting all requirements and having the form notarized. If the minor believes the local government has no legal basis for this refusal, what legal action can they take to compel the government to issue the certificate?\n\nA) File a discrimination lawsuit against the Town Clerk's office\nB) Appeal to the state's Department of Business Regulation\nC) Apply to a court for a writ of Mandamus\nD) Petition the Governor's office for an executive order\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) Apply to a court for a writ of Mandamus. A writ of Mandamus is a court order that compels a government official or body to perform a duty that the law requires them to do. In this case, if the minor believes the Town Clerk's office is legally obligated to issue the Business Certificate and is refusing without proper legal basis, a writ of Mandamus would be the appropriate legal action to take.\n\nOption A is incorrect because discrimination lawsuits typically involve protected classes, and age discrimination laws generally don't apply to minors in this context. Option B is incorrect because there's no indication that a state Department of Business Regulation would have authority over local clerks in this matter. Option D is incorrect because the Governor doesn't typically have the authority to override local administrative decisions through executive orders in such specific cases."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25610/condo-contract-without-record-of-it-in-the-board-minutes", "docs_id": 25610, "title": "Condo contract without record of it in the board minutes", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Ontario, if a previous board entered into a contract and there are no minutes showing a vote to accept it, can the corporation get out of the contract? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a person with [ostensible authority](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Ostensible+authority) to bind the corporation does so then the corporation is bound. \n\nIf that person lacks the [actual authority](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Actual+authority) that is a matter between them and the corporation: it cannot be used as grounds to invalidate the contract with a third party. \n\nYou can see why it has to be that way because otherwise, every time you wanted to buy something you would have to make sure the person was authorised by their employer to sell it \\- your groceries, a coffee, a Boeing 777 ...", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: ABC Corporation's board of directors authorized its CEO, John Smith, to enter into contracts up to $500,000 without board approval.

This scenario illustrates the concept of ostensible authority. Even though John Smith exceeded his actual authority by signing a contract above his authorized limit, he likely had the ostensible authority to bind the corporation in the eyes of XYZ Inc. The lack of board meeting minutes approving the contract doesn't affect its validity with a third party acting in good faith.

But having an intention and be right at the start of doing the offense (details are complicated) is sometimes punished as an attempt of the offense (*Versuch*). This is defined in \u00a7 13 [*Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz*](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/owig_1968/) ([Act on Regulatory Offences](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/)).\n\n> \u00a7 13 OWiG (\\= \u00a7\u00a7 22\\-24 [*Strafgesetzbuch*](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/) ([Criminal Code](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/)))\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Whoever, in accordance with his understanding of the act, takes a direct step towards the realisation of the factual elements of the offence, shall be deemed to have attempted a regulatory offence.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) The attempt may be sanctioned only if expressly provided by law.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) If the perpetrator voluntarily renounces further execution of the act or prevents its completion, he shall not be sanctioned for attempt.

However, his voluntary and earnest efforts to prevent the completion of the act shall suffice if the act is not completed without his contribution or is committed independently of his earlier participation.\n\nIf you started the offense but stopped, so you don't fulfill offense, you don't get sanctioned, if you stopped **voluntarily** (*freiwillig*), \u00a7 13 III OWiG. (The details are more complicated.) This may be the case in your example, but beeing seen by a police officer is no reason for *Freiwilligkeit*. So you may have attempted the offence.\n\nBut an attempted offence gets only sanctioned if this is expressly provided by law, \u00a7 13 II OWiG. **This is provided for no traffic violation.** (But for some of the *Straftaten* in context of traffic, e.g. \u00a7 315b StGB *Dangerous disruption of road traffic*.)\n\nSo the answer to your question is a clear: **No**\n\nSpecific aspects of your case\n=============================\n\nI have searched the norms for your case, a red light offence for cyclist:\n\n* \u00a7 37 II Nr. 1, Nr. 2, Nr. 6 [*Stra\u00dfenverkehrsordnung*](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvo_2013/): the rules for traffic light\n* \u00a7 49 III Nr. 2 StVO: declaring violations of \u00a7 37 StVO as regulatory offences (legal basis: \u00a7 24 I [*Stra\u00dfenverkehrsgesetz*](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvg/))\n* Nr. 132a Anlage 1 [*Bu\u00dfgeldkatalog\\-Verordnung*](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bkatv_2013/): sets 60 \u20ac fine for red ligth violations of cyclists (legal basis: \u00a7 1 I BKatV)\n* Nr. 132a Anlage 1 BKatV: sets 100 \u20ac fine for red ligth violations of cyclists after at least one second\n* Nr. 3\\.2\\.19 Anlage 13 [Fahrerlaubnis\\-Verordnung](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/): sets fine of one point in *Fahreignungsregister* (driving ability register) for these offences (legal basis: \u00a7 40 FeV)\n\nIn none of these laws a sanction for attempt is defined.\n\nI'm not sure what you did after getting of your bike, you migth have violated the red ligth walking.

Therefore, trusting the attorney's judgment in the moment is the most appropriate action."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57467/is-exploiting-a-malfunctioning-self-service-checkout-theft", "docs_id": 57467, "title": "Is exploiting a malfunctioning self-service checkout theft?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Hypothetically, if a self\\-service checkout at my local Tesco were to be malfunctioning and selling items for half\\-price, and if someone were to exploit this to buy cheap goods, would this be considered theft under UK law?\n\nIn the Theft Act 1968:\n\n> A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.\n\nDoes the purchase of goods at half the marked price constitute *dishonest* appropriation? An argument that it doesn't might be that the self\\-service checkout has authorized the purchase and the requested amount has been paid, thus there is no dishonesty involved.\n\nHowever, the checkout is obviously not intended to operate this way, and the price shown by the checkout obviously doesn't match that of the displayed price in the shop. Does this mean that by knowingly still buying goods like this, the purchaser is being dishonest?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The word \"dishonestly\" is [defined in the act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2)\n\n> (1\\)A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another is not to\n> be regarded as dishonest\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law\n> the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a\n> third person; or\n> \n> \n> (b)if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have\n> the other\u2019s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the\n> circumstances of it; or\n> \n> \n> (c)(except where the property came to him as trustee or personal\n> representative) if he appropriates the property in the belief that the\n> person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking\n> reasonable steps.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another may be\n> dishonest notwithstanding that he is willing to pay for the property.\n\nThe prosecution thus must establish that defendant knows that he has no legal right, that is, it must be established that he knows that it is not a legal purchase. The simple act of purchasing in these circumstances provides no proof of the alleged dishonesty: the prosecution must add something else. For example, testimony that defendant declared \"Crikey! This machine is giving me half\\-off on everything, those suckers! I wish I had bought more\" *might* be sufficient to establish dishonesty. The \"intent\" of management in installing these machines is legally irrelevant, indeed management's intent is to reduce operating costs. It is management's responsibility to ascertain that the machines function the way they wish them to. It is not self\\-evident to the defendant that the machine is malfunctioning, but defendant *could* have actual knowledge that makes the transaction dishonest.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK law, if a customer knowingly purchases items at half-price due to a malfunctioning self-service checkout at a supermarket, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential for this act to be considered theft?\n\nA) The act is always considered theft because the customer is aware of the malfunction and is taking advantage of it.\n\nB) The act can never be considered theft because the self-service checkout authorized the transaction and the requested amount was paid.\n\nC) The act may be considered theft, but only if the prosecution can prove that the customer knew they had no legal right to purchase at the reduced price.\n\nD) The act is not theft if the customer intended to inform the store management about the malfunction after making their purchases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Theft Act 1968, for an act to be considered theft, it must involve dishonest appropriation. The prosecution must establish that the defendant knew they had no legal right to make the purchase at the reduced price. Simply using the malfunctioning machine is not enough to prove dishonesty. The prosecution would need additional evidence, such as statements made by the customer, to demonstrate that they knew their actions were not a legal purchase. Therefore, while the act could potentially be considered theft, it hinges on proving the customer's knowledge and intent, making option C the most accurate statement."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26218/interpretation-of-code-and-programs", "docs_id": 26218, "title": "Interpretation of &quot;Code&quot; and &quot;Programs&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've recently came across a paragraph in the [Merchant User Agreement](https://help.bigcartel.com/merchant-user-agreement) of [Big Cartel](http://bigcartel.com), specifically paragraph 5\\.2, called \"*Prohibited and Restricted Activities*\"\n\nThe paragraph states that offering the following is illegal\n\n> Code or similar automatic items, programs, or processes, such as automated software, data mining software, scrapers, and \u2018bots\n\n*I'm quite sure that this paragraph was taken into the agreement to forbid the selling of (automated\\-)bots, that are for example used in online games to \"farm\" experience and/or items, as well as data\\-miners/scrapers, that \\- for my understanding \\- grab information off the internet of from other data\\-sources, ie. corporate adresses from the web.*\n\n1\\) Regarding \"*Code or similar automatic items*..\" for my understanding as a software developer of 18 years, code is inherently not an automatic item nor is it similar to being automatic.
