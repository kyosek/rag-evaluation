That is, if the customers knew (or could infer) that such a subpoena has been served, they will likely be customers no longer.\n\nThe business regularly updates its [warrant canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) to maintain the customers' trust.\n\nNow, suppose the business has actually *been* served with a secret government subpoena, but elects to falsely maintain the warrant canary anyway. Or, rather, continuing to maintain the canary is actually part of the government order.\n\nShould the breach of trust be unveiled by the customers and the damage be quantifiable, would the customers have a case, possibly class action?\n\nMy doubt is that the business could possibly have this defense that it was acting at the orders of the government (which cannot be liable). Will that defense shield the business from any liability?\n\nEssentially, what the question drives at is whether there is any sense in a warrant canary in principle. If a business is *never* liable for lying in its warrant canary, then how can one possibly trust a warrant canary at all?\n\nRelated: [What is the legal status of \"warrant canaries\"?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/268/what-is-the-legal-status-of-warrant-canaries)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A warrant canary has always been a somewhat legally questionable technique. Australia, for one, has made them illegal in certain kinds of cases, passing laws that forbid disclosing the \"existence or non\\-existence\" of certain types of warrants issued to a subject. (See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary#Usage).)\n\nHowever, in the US, an order to falsely update an existing canary would probably fall afoul of the prohibition on compelled speech stated in *West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette* (the 2nd flag salute case) and *Wooley v. Maynard* (state cannot mandate a motto on a license plate that some find offensive). The case of *New York Times Co. v. United States* (the Pentagon papers case) might also be relevant.\n\nHowever, before asking if a government order would shield a business from liability for falsely updating a canary, one must fist ask if they would have any liability in any case. It is generally not a crime, or even a tort, to make a false statement unless it is under circumstances where the statement constitutes fraud.\n\nTo prevail, a plaintiff A would need to show that it reasonably relied on the statement from B, and suffered measurable damage from that reliance. It would also need to show that the person or firm B falsely updating the canary knew or should have known that the statement was likely to be relied on, and possibly that B intended A to rely on the false statement to A's detriment.\n\nIt is hard to see what actionable damage to A this might include, as being discovered in unlawful acts is not actionable.\n\nIf a court did rule that A was damaged by B's false statement, then the question of a government order might be raised. In general it is a defense against a civil lawsuit that one was complying with a valid law or government regulation or order. Of course, this could raise the further question of whether such an order was valid, which might have different results in different jurisdictions.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn short, this is a situation untested in any actual court case that I know of, and not highly likely to be tested any tiem soon. It involves several debatable issues, and any firm answer at this point must be speculation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tech company, SecureChat, uses a warrant canary to assure its customers that it has not received any secret government subpoenas for user data. The company is served with a secret subpoena and a gag order, which also instructs them to continue updating their warrant canary as if nothing has changed. A customer, believing the warrant canary to be truthful, continues using the service and later discovers their data was compromised due to the subpoena. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal action by the customer against SecureChat?\n\nA) The customer has a strong case for fraud against SecureChat, as the company knowingly made false statements that were relied upon.\n\nB) SecureChat is completely shielded from liability because they were following a government order.\n\nC) The customer likely has no case, as it's difficult to prove measurable damages from relying on the warrant canary.\n\nD) The customer can definitely win a class action lawsuit based on breach of trust, regardless of the government order.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate. While the situation is legally complex and untested, it would be challenging for the customer to prove actionable damages from relying on the warrant canary. To succeed in a fraud claim, the customer would need to demonstrate measurable damages resulting from their reliance on the false statement, which is difficult in this scenario. Additionally, being discovered in unlawful acts (if the customer's data revealed illegal activity) is not actionable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while SecureChat did make false statements, proving fraud requires demonstrating measurable damages, which is problematic in this case.\n\nOption B is overly broad; while following a government order can be a defense, it's not guaranteed to completely shield a company from all liability.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the success of a class action lawsuit is not guaranteed, especially given the complexities of the situation and the difficulty in proving damages."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86780/is-nanoblock-not-in-violation-of-legos-patents-because-their-product-is-incompa", "docs_id": 86780, "title": "Is Nanoblock not in violation of LEGO&#39;s patents because their product is incompatible with and not the same size as LEGO&#39;s product?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Nanoblock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoblock) is an interlocking brick toy similar to LEGO.\n\nThey have an [article](https://nanoblockus.com/nanoblocks-vs-lego/) on their website that describes their toy and compares it to LEGO.

Therefore it is very legal from a patent point of view to produce compatible bricks (and there are several companies that do).\n\nMore complicated is the trademark aspect. Lego tries to sue everyone that attempts to sell its bricks with the statement \"lego compatible\" or something similar, and the use of the name \"Lego\" as a name for the bricks in general is contested (sometimes successfully, sometimes less so), even though that is quite common in colloquial speech.\n\nThe [Canadian supreme court ruled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mega-bloks-wins-scoc-ruling-on-lego-trademark-1.555292)\n\n> \"Trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now\\-expired patents\"\n\nBottom line: You may produce lego\\-compatible bricks, but you must not name them like that.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. LEGO's patents on their brick design have expired, so patent infringement is not an issue for companies producing similar bricks.\n2. Companies can legally produce LEGO-compatible bricks without changing the size or making them incompatible.\n3. The main legal concern is trademark infringement. Companies must avoid using the LEGO name or implying official compatibility with LEGO products in their marketing.\n4.

You need to contact the copyright holder to get permission (and a license). That may be the authors themselves, or a journal if they have assigned the copyright to it.\n\nHowever, it might be more complicated, especially for commercial use. Since the authors of papers frequently use images created by others, sometimes correctly and sometimes not, you should explore a bit more. Perhaps the paper itself will have a citation of the figure and an indication of its source, and hence of its copyright holder. In that case, the authors may not be able to help you, since, at best, they probably also hold just a license. \n\nHowever, for some *academic* purposes and in some jurisdictions an academic work can be permitted to use a figure (or other things) without regard to copyright. This is called *fair use* and it varies around the world. But a commercial work won't be able (probably) to depend on the same exception to copyright law and you still have to find the copyright holder. \n\nMoreover, even if the authors have a proper license (explicitly), that license (a) may not be transferrable and (b) might be for non\\-commercial use only. \n\nAcademic copyright holders often (not universally) issue their work under a fairly permissive license but that is restricted to non\\-commercial use. Since they hold the copyright they can also issue additional licenses against it if they like, but need to do so explicitly. \n\nUltimately, to use the work of others you have to deal with the copyright question. It is further complicated by the fact that a figure may be considered under the law as a \"complete work\" even if it appears within another work. So, replicating it is less likely to fall under fair use rules \\- though they vary. \n\n---\n\nAnd, there is one other question you should ask yourself. Is your talk really a commercial use?

The arXiv license only grants arXiv.org the right to distribute the article, not the copyright itself. The copyright likely remains with the authors or their institution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because publication on arXiv doesn't automatically make the content free for any use, especially commercial use.\n\nOption B is incorrect because arXiv only holds a license to distribute, not the copyright itself, so they can't grant permission for other uses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while fair use might apply in some academic settings, it likely wouldn't cover commercial use, which is explicitly mentioned in the question.\n\nThe researcher should attempt to find the original copyright holder, which is likely to be the authors or their institution, and request permission for commercial use.

According to the documentation, police involvement in such a case would likely stem from potential criminal matters. However, the police themselves do not typically handle the investigation or filing of charges in cases involving minors. Instead, they would refer the matter to Child Protective Services (CPS) for investigation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because international kidnapping doesn't apply in this scenario, and immediate arrest without investigation is unlikely.\n\nOption B is incorrect because police do not handle deportation matters, and the situation described doesn't necessarily warrant deportation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because police do not directly file criminal charges. As stated in the documentation, if criminal charges were warranted after investigation, the matter would be referred to the prosecuting attorney's office.\n\nThe documentation specifically mentions that in such cases, \"CPS (Child Protective Services) would do an investigation and, if warranted, refer the matter to the jurisdictional prosecuting attorney's office.\" This process aligns with answer C, making it the most accurate response to the question."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88478/can-an-easement-be-removed-if-its-not-necessary", "docs_id": 88478, "title": "Can an easement be removed if it&#39;s not necessary?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are two easements across two parcels of my property.

The daredevil was jailed for breaching an injunction that had been imposed on The Shard in 2018 to prevent anyone from climbing it. This breach resulted in contempt of court charges, which is a criminal offense. The initial caution was for a separate offense, likely trespassing, which is why double jeopardy did not apply.

There is a [trio of cases](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/epic-systems-corp-v-lewis/) now being considered by SCOTUS, pertaining to the [Federal Arbitration Act](http://www.legisworks.org/congress/68/publaw-401.pdf) and its interaction with the National Labor Relations Act. Since the federal government doesn't get to totally write the law for everything, the FAA applies only to transactions covered by the Commerce Clause. As a result of [Allied\\-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/513/265/), that would include a state\\-internal suit against a local exterminator.\n\nIn general, the FAA states that an award can be vacated in US courts if the arbitration itself is corrupt (e.d. fraudulent), but not if the subject matter if the dispute is about fraud. Federal law preempts state law ([Southland Corp. v. Keating](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/465/1/case.html), 465 U.S. 1\\), so mandatory arbitration clauses are enforceable (unless the contract itself is invalid, e.g. duress, unconscionability). A state may not, however, declare that mandatory arbitration clauses render a contract unconscionable ([AT\\&T Mobility v. Concepcion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/333/opinion.html), 563 U.S. 333\\), as California had done in [Discover Bank. Laster v.

The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) generally upholds the enforceability of mandatory arbitration clauses, even in cases involving alleged fraud or deceptive practices. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled in favor of arbitration agreements, preempting state laws that attempt to invalidate them. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the presence of fraud in the underlying dispute does not typically invalidate an arbitration clause. \n\nOption B is too extreme, as customers can still pursue legal action through arbitration. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the Supreme Court has ruled that states cannot declare arbitration clauses unconscionable solely based on their prohibition of class actions (AT&T Mobility v.

Some people run super famous Twitter/social media accounts that represent some visage, likeness or purported being, that of which may not actually be subjected to a real, specific human.

It encompasses both aspects: considering irrelevant factors (or failing to consider relevant ones) and decisions so absurd that no reasonable authority could have made them. Importantly, it also captures the idea that mere disagreement with the decision's outcome is not sufficient for unreasonableness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests courts can overturn decisions based solely on disagreement with the interpretation of facts, which goes against the principle of not interfering with the decision-maker's discretion.\n\nOption B is partially correct about the process but oversimplifies by stating that the merits are entirely irrelevant, which isn't true in cases of overwhelming unreasonableness.\n\nOption C introduces a condition about \"fundamental importance\" that was not part of Lord Greene's explanation and is noted as irrelevant in the provided information."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1050/how-would-dr-richard-kimble-go-about-getting-himself-declared-innocent-at-the-e", "docs_id": 1050, "title": "How would Dr. Richard Kimble go about getting himself declared innocent at the end of The Fugitive?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I just finished watching The Fugitive.

One of the principles of justice is that there should be finality to the verdict. Kimble has gone from presumed innocent to presumed guilty \\- enough evidence would need to be gathered to demonstrate a clear and unambiguous miscarriage of justice.

If you are in doubt of something being CI, ask your client. Technically you should consider any information provided for the scope of your consulting work \"de\\-facto\" CI.\n\nBut they can't arbitrarily say something is confidential.

Technically anything that is known to the general public or publicly disclosed by the company is no longer considered CI.\n\nBut your first example may have some caveats.

The agreement doesn't explicitly bar Bob from mentioning the client (McDonald's), but it does require him to keep confidential information private. Bob wasn't directly employed by McDonald's, so he shouldn't represent himself as such.

Brady Disclosure gets its name from the landmark SCOTUS case *Brady v. Maryland* which ruled that it is a due process violation for the prosecution not to turn over all evidence collected INCLUDING exculpatory evidence (i.e. evidence that helps show the defendant's innocence as opposed to inculpatory evidence, which shows the defendant's guilt.).\n\nThis is also to the Prosecution's interest because the prosecutor is not interested in convicting people but by discovering the truth as to what happened. And because a conviction should only happen when the truth is so compelling that it is beyond a reasonable doubt, the prosecution's evidence is scrutinized much more rigorously than the defendant's.

Under the Brady disclosure rule, the prosecution is required to inform the defense about any deals made with witnesses, including immunity agreements. This disclosure allows the defense to challenge the credibility of the witness based on potential bias or self-interest. However, the existence of an immunity deal does not automatically render the testimony inadmissible. Instead, it becomes a factor that the jury can consider when evaluating the credibility and weight of the witness's testimony.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the prosecution is required to disclose such deals under Brady disclosure rules. Option B is incorrect because while the immunity deal may affect the witness's credibility, it doesn't make the testimony inadmissible outright. Option D is incorrect and contradicts the principles of Brady disclosure, which require the prosecution to turn over all relevant evidence, including information that might be favorable to the defense."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67848/does-a-company-have-to-buy-a-license-for-a-technology-if-the-technology-was-deve", "docs_id": 67848, "title": "Does a company have to buy a license for a technology if the technology was developed simultaneously?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does a company have to buy a license for a technology if the technology was developed simultaneously?

You can assume that this is in the U.S.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Before the AIA in 2012 both companies could apply for a patent and if one of the applicants thought they were both trying to patent the same thing they could initiate an interference proceeding. In that proceeding before the board, they each present their evidence as to date of conception and diligent effort from that point to the date of the first filing. The board decided which application went forward.\n\nNow the U.S. is with the rest of the world in first\\-to\\-file. It doesn\u2019t matter who conceived first unless one actually stole the idea from the other. There is a new derivation procedure to try to prove that. I don\u2019t think it has ever yet happened.\n\nOne of the \"simultaneous\" inventors could publish the invention, putting into the public domain. If published before the other's filing date, it would theoretically prevent the other from getting a patent.\n\nIn any case a patent owner can stop the other from making their product or charge a royalty. There is a narrow case under the AIA where one company has been using a process that another later patents and can retain a limited right to keep using that process but can\u2019t move or expand operations.

Under current U.S. patent law (post-AIA), what is the most likely outcome?\n\nA) Company X will be granted the patent due to earlier conception and diligent work.\nB) Company Y will be granted the patent due to earlier filing, and Company X must cease using the technology.\nC) Company Y will be granted the patent, but Company X can continue limited use under Prior User Rights.\nD) Neither company will be granted a patent as they developed the technology simultaneously.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Under the America Invents Act (AIA) of 2012, the U.S. adopted a first-to-file system. This means that regardless of who conceived the idea first or worked on it more diligently, the first company to file the patent application generally has priority. In this case, Company Y filed first on January 15, 2023, so they would likely be granted the patent.\n\nHowever, the AIA also introduced a provision for Prior User Rights. This allows a company that was using a patented process before the patent was filed to continue using it in a limited capacity. Company X, having developed the technology independently and presumably using it before Company Y's filing date, would likely qualify for Prior User Rights.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the U.S. no longer uses a first-to-invent system. Answer B is partially correct about Company Y getting the patent, but incorrect about Company X having to cease all use. Answer D is incorrect because simultaneous invention doesn't prevent a patent from being granted to the first filer."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44947/company-retained-my-card-details-after-payment-completed-and-suffered-a-breach", "docs_id": 44947, "title": "Company retained my card details after payment completed and suffered a breach.

A letter has been sent apologising for the delays in processing the request. It has a lot of fluff about how to stay secure, what they have done since, and apologising for a late reply due to the large number of requests (My original request was more than 30 days before the letter). It specifically doesn't answer the question of *why* my card details would have needed to be retained, nor does it admit explicitly that they should not have been. \n\nInstead, the letter includes an offer of \u00a3100 in \"apology\", and comes with a form requesting the \u00a3100 that will \"be final settlement of any and all claims I have out of or in connection with the matters referred to ... \\[in this letter]\"\n\nThis to me seems a clear \"get out of jail for \u00a3100\" attempt, relying on the fact that next steps and severity aren't known.

There is no reason yet for the company to believe that you have suffered more damages, and you do have reasonable options to prevent them (ask bank for a new card \\- that's not going to cost you \u00a3100\\).\n\nThe second observation is that the GDPR does not really affect the first observation. The GDPR itself does not give rise to additional civil claims or special damages. Yes, the GDPR states that the company is in the wrong, but parties can make agreements how a wrongful deed is made right again.

Just as your brother has to pay rent at the market rate. \n\nIf rent at market rate is $1,000 and the monthly cost (taxes, maintenance etc.) is $400, then your brother should pay $1,000 a month, the $400 is paid from rental income, and the $600 profit shared, so you get $300 and he gets $300\\.

If I recall correctly, in Canada, the relevant statute of limitations would be determined at the provincial level. Given that this was \"a couple of years ago\" realistically, it is probably not barred by the statute of limitations yet.\n\nAre Interest Charges Allowed.\n=============================\n\nGenerally yes.\n\nMost jurisdictions allow for pre\\-judgment interest at a statutory rate from the date due in the absence of a contrary agreement and if the provider's paperwork with you provided for another interest rate, that would apply instead. So charging interest is allowed.\n\nThe existence of a dispute wouldn't change this result, although it would, of course, mean that if some portion of the bill was disallowed in a later lawsuit that interest would be owed only on the portion that the court found was actually owed.\n\nThe Provider's Remedies\n=======================\n\n*A Lawsuit*\n\nIf these bills are not paid, they can sue.\n\nStatute of limitations, or errors in billing, or failure to seek reimbursement from the police as arranged with them, would all be legitimate defenses in lawsuit brought by the provider.\n\nGiven the modest amount allegedly owed and the existence of defenses, this might not be a very attractive one for the provider to choose to bring suit to collect.\n\n*Credit Reporting*\n\nOn the other hand, in lieu of suing, the provider could simply report it as a bad debt with a credit reporting agency through their collections company.\n\nThis would look bad on your credit (for up to seven years in the U.S., although you could insist on filing a rebuttal statement as part of your credit report, I don't know how disputes about credit reporting work in Canada).\n\nPaying them would almost admit that there was a late payment for credit reporting purposes, but also might prevent the incident from entering the credit reporting system at all.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A patient received medical treatment two years ago for injuries related to a crime, with the understanding that the police department would cover the costs.

The statute of limitations for medical bills typically ranges from 3 to 12 years in most jurisdictions, so it's likely not expired after only two years. The doctor's office has multiple options for pursuing payment, including filing a lawsuit or reporting the debt to credit agencies.

A state by state summary of the applicable laws as of January 2020 (which oversimplifies the situation in which there are additional distinctions not noted, some of which are differences in wording that could be relevant to how these statutes apply in the OP case) can be found [here](https://www.mylifetime.com/movies/you-cant-take-my-daughter/articles/how-parental-rights-for-rapists-vary-by-state).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30rZL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30rZL.jpg)\n\nAll of these laws are targeted at the case of a woman raped by a man who becomes pregnant, which is factually predominant, something that happens many thousands of times each year in the United States as a whole, and not at the case of a man who, in the course of being raped by a female, causes the female to become pregnant as a result.\n\nCases of men being raped that are handled by the legal system, and do not involve statutory rape, predominantly involve sexual interaction that is not reproductive, i.e. something other than a man involuntarily having vaginal sex with a woman, often prison rape by a same sex inmate or rape with an object, and also, as in other cases of rape, often doesn't result in a conception of a child due to random chance. Likewise, many women convicted of rape are convicted as co\\-participants in a crime that involves physical penetration of a victim by a man or an object, rather than sexual intercourse with the woman convicted of the crime. So, the number of cases that could potentially be litigated with respect to this issue is much smaller.\n\nIt is also worth noting that under U.S. criminal law, sexual intercourse procured by deception (other than deception regarding the person with whom one is having sex, for example, because of a blindfold or darkness, or deception regarding one's status as a medical practitioner making a medical examination, or as a law enforcement officer making a legally authorized cavity search) is not a crime and does not constitute rape.\n\nAlso, generally speaking, having sex consensually in a manner not intended to lead to conception, which, in fact, does result in conception with consent to the sex giving rise to conception (e.g. where there is an agreement to \"pull out\" that isn't performed due to the acts of one or both parties involved), will almost never be prosecuted criminally as rape, whether or not a jury with perfect knowledge of the facts of the interaction could convict under the law of the minority of U.S. states where this might be possible.\n\nAs @user6726 notes, the primary fact pattern related to the OP historically has involved instances of intercourse that are consensual in fact, but constitute statutory rape due to the age of the father which makes it impossible for him to legally consent, and in those cases, the default rule that the biological father of a child is recognized as the father for custody and child support purposes has been the predominant rule.\n\nBut much of that case law predates modern rapist\\-paternity statutes and there is an equal protection argument that those statutes should have a parallel construction, although to the best of my knowledge, there are no reported appellate cases that have tested that issue. It remains an open issue of first impression in most, if not all, jurisdictions that have adopted rape\\-paternity statutes.\n\nIn Minnesota, which had not adopted such a statute as of January 2020, being raped would not be a defense to a paternity, child custody, or child support claim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, regarding cases where a woman rapes a man and becomes pregnant as a result, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) All states have uniform laws that protect male rape victims from child support obligations in such cases.\n\nB) Most states have laws specifically addressing this scenario, exempting male rape victims from paternity rights and responsibilities.\n\nC) The legal landscape is varied, with many states having laws focused on female victims of rape, while the scenario of male victims impregnating their rapists remains largely unaddressed.\n\nD) Federal law uniformly requires male rape victims to pay child support if their female rapist becomes pregnant.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that the legal landscape across U.S. states is varied and primarily focused on cases where women are raped by men. Many states have recently enacted laws addressing parental rights for rapists, but these laws are typically designed for scenarios where the rapist is male and the victim is female. The scenario of a male rape victim impregnating his female rapist is not specifically addressed in most jurisdictions, leaving it as an open legal question in many places. There is no uniform federal law on this matter, and the treatment of such cases can vary significantly by state. Additionally, the information suggests that this specific scenario (male victims impregnating female rapists) is relatively rare compared to other types of rape cases, which has contributed to the lack of specific legislation addressing it in many jurisdictions."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92235/is-there-any-chance-for-a-parent-to-get-a-joint-custody-without-a-legal-status-i", "docs_id": 92235, "title": "Is there any chance for a parent to get a joint custody without a legal status in the U.S.?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: * Jan 2020 \\- I came from Outside of U.S. (foreign citizen) on a fiancee visa.\n* Mar 2020 \\- I married my ex\\-wife (she is a U.S. citizen).\n* Sep 2020 \\- I got my 2 year temporary green card.\n* Mar 2021 \\- Our daughter was born.\n* May 2021 \\- We decided to divorce.

According to the information provided, lying about stock positions or gains could potentially be considered a form of securities fraud. However, general encouragement to buy or hold stocks is likely protected speech. The subreddit itself and Reddit as a platform are not inherently engaging in illegal activity by allowing such discussions.

The Judge, Mr. Justice Horridge, was evidently not persuaded that this was an apology at all.\n\nMy question is about where to place the blame for how Hayes conducted the case.

Why does the European Council think it has the right to force ISPs to censor websites?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From comments, **Which laws allow the European Council to order ISPs to violate net neutrality?** is a more legally answerable question than \"Why does the European Council think it has the right to force ISPs to censor websites?\".\n\nEU law on net neutrality is contained in the \"Open Internet regulation\", [2015/2120](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120), principally its Article 3, in which we read (clause 3\\):\n\n> Providers of internet access services shall treat all traffic equally, when providing internet access services, without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used.\n\nThis goes on to add, with irrelevant words omitted:\n\n> Providers of internet access services ... shall not block ... specific content ... except as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, in order to comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law, to which the provider of internet access services is subject, or with measures that comply with Union law giving effect to such Union legislative acts or national legislation, including with orders by courts or public authorities vested with relevant powers.\n\nThis is a long\\-winded way of saying that other provisions of national or EU law *can* require content to be blocked. Paragraph 13 of the preamble explains it in more normal language \\- the net neutrality provision is not intended to give carte blanche to the publication of material which would otherwise be unlawful.\n\nIn the case of RT and Sputnik, [Regulation 2022/350](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0350) is an example of such a law, saying:\n\n> It shall be prohibited for operators to broadcast or to enable, facilitate or otherwise contribute to broadcast, any content by the legal persons, entities or bodies listed in Annex XV, including through transmission or distribution by any means such as cable, satellite, IP\\-TV, internet service providers, internet video\\-sharing platforms or applications, whether new or pre\\-installed.\n\nand also \"This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\" The Council is allowed to make such regulations by virtue of Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on \"restrictive measures\" against \"natural or legal persons and groups or non\\-State entities\", with certain procedural prior conditions too lengthy to discuss in detail.\n\nTherefore, if your country is a party to that treaty and has arranged for its direct effect in domestic law, then Regulation 2022/350 is binding and supersedes the general rules of Regulation 2015/2120\\.\n\nBy general principles of the primacy of EU law, the ban also overrides any contrary provisions of national law, including perhaps even a national Constitution. Since you are in Germany: under the \"Solange\" principle accepted by the Bundesverfassungsgericht, domestic courts would not review EU law by the standards of the human rights provisions in the Grundgesetz, since the EU institutions are held to be capable of providing their own parallel safeguard of essentially the same rights. This Regulation could therefore be challenged on the grounds of Charter/Convention rights, or compatibility with the Treaties, but not because of conflict with a national law on net neutrality (if there was one).\n\nThe preamble of the recent Regulations does acknowledge the human rights angle and claims to be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. While the ban does interfere with the freedom of expression, that right is subject to certain limits; and ECHR Article 16 explicitly reserves \"imposing restrictions on the\npolitical activity of aliens\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to EU law, which of the following statements is true regarding the ban on RT and Sputnik?\n\nA) The ban violates net neutrality rules and cannot be legally enforced by ISPs.\n\nB) The ban is enforced through Regulation 2022/350 and supersedes general net neutrality rules.\n\nC) The ban can be challenged in German courts based on the Grundgesetz (German Constitution).\n\nD) The European Council has no legal basis to impose such a ban on member states.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Regulation 2022/350 specifically prohibits the broadcast of content from RT and Sputnik, and it supersedes the general net neutrality rules established in Regulation 2015/2120. This regulation is binding and directly applicable in all EU member states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are net neutrality rules, they allow for exceptions based on Union legislative acts or national legislation that complies with Union law.\n\nOption C is incorrect because under the \"Solange\" principle, German courts would not review EU law against the standards of the Grundgesetz, as EU institutions are considered capable of safeguarding essentially the same rights.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the European Council does have the legal basis to impose such bans under Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which allows for \"restrictive measures\" against specific entities."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66692/what-is-the-age-of-consent-in-indonesia-15-or-18", "docs_id": 66692, "title": "What is the age of consent in Indonesia? 15 or 18?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found this question on a forum\n[https://www.livinginindonesiaforum.org/forum/general/laws\\-visas\\-money\\-matters\\-and\\-documents/52502\\-age\\-of\\-consent](https://www.livinginindonesiaforum.org/forum/general/laws-visas-money-matters-and-documents/52502-age-of-consent)\n\nWikipedia says 15\\.

Persuading someone is not necessarily nonconsensual. All the words describe nonconsensual activity except 'persuade'.\n\nAlso, one interpretation of this article is that all sex with girls under 18 is illegal. However, if that's the case, why not just make it simple and\n\n> don't have sex with girls under 18\n\n?\n\nIf all obscene acts with a girl under 18 are illegal, why doesn't the law simply say don't do obscene acts with a girl under 18?\n\nIf some obscene acts are legal, why does it say \"coerce, trick, bla bla bla, persuade\" girls to have sex with you if she is under 18?\n\nWhy does the law prohibit persuading girls to do obscene acts but does not prohibit the actual doing of the obscene act itself? Kind of weird.\n\nOf course the law says do obscene acts instead of having sex. I am not even sure what obscene acts include.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nActually, due to this, is age of consent in Indonesia 18 or 15?\n\nAny actual court cases will be great.\n\nIn the forum I sent someone actually asked this:\n\n> \"The exploitation\" and \"persuasion\" angle is not very clear to me. So\n> sex with a girl above 15 is legal unless you \"exploit\" or \"persuade\"\n> her to do so. Can anyone shows actual court cases?\n> \n> \n> It seems that actual court cases for this sort of thing is very few.\n\nSo if the law is to be read literally, it looks like having sex with a girl above 15 is legal unless you \"exploit\" or \"persuade\". Which is absurd.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Content Warning**: this post mentions rape / non\\-consensual sex and discusses (in some non\\-explicit detail) coercion of minors.\n\n---\n\nAs of Tuesday, March 1st, 2016, according to the [Indonesian Penal Code](https://www.ageofconsent.net/world/indonesia) (translated version; I cannot read Indonesian), Indonesia's age of consent is 16 years old (18 for homosexual acts). Indonesia also does not have close\\-in\\-age exemptions (for example, in Canada, the age of consent is 16 years old, but a 14\\-year\\-old can consent to a partner less than 5 years older, and a 12\\-year\\-old can consent within 2 years).\n\nI cannot verify this source but according to Wikipedia, which cites [this PDF](https://repositoryfh.unla.ac.id/browse/previews/1412), the age of consent could be raised to 18 years under the Child Protection Act arguing that sexual acts can cause bodily or mental harm and \"child\" is defined as anyone under 18 years of age. As an example, according to Wikipedia, a court case in 2009 ([Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/world/australian-gets-eight-years-in-bali-jail-for-underage-sex-20090226-8jaf.html)) saw this used to convict an Australian man.\n\n---\n\nThere is nothing weird about this law. I left this as a comment, but let me elaborate in an answer. Your misconception is that persuasion is an innocent and ethical thing. The harsh reality is that children are, on average, more ignorant than adults and lack judgement, foresight, and rationality at times, and there are disgusting individuals that will exploit this fact to get children to do things they otherwise wouldn't such as sex, or drugs. Additionally, age comes with a power imbalance \\- think a teacher using their power over a student to convince or coerce them into having sex with them. That is not strictly *violence*, nor telling lies, or \"forcing\" in the strict sense, nor trickery, but a reasonable individual would still consider that to be not real consent.\n\nThe fact is that children can only consent if it is entirely of their own accord and judgement and there is no extrinsic pressure forcing or persuading them to. In fact, I argue that *adults* are subject to this too and persuading or coercing an adult into having sex is also disgusting (but doing this to children is far more abhorrent). But since children are considered by law to lack the judgement to protect themselves against coercion and realize they should reject and get away from their persuader, the law instead protects them.\n\n> Persuading someone is not necessarily non\\-consensual.\n\nIt holds a high chance of being non\\-consensual, and consent is only considered real when it is a) not coerced, and b) the subject is *legally capable*; that is, not intoxicated, not a minor (by whatever the age of cosnent is), etc.\n\n> If all obscene acts with a girl under 18 are illegal, why doesn't the law simply say don't do obscene acts with a girl under 18?\n\nBecause sex with people between 16 and 18 is legal (in Indonesia) under the right conditions. Although I must say, since you word it as \"obscene acts\", then of course they're illegal. Obscene acts are, by definition, morally reprehensible and/or legally incriminating, so illegal things are illegal, is basically what you're saying. Just say \"having sex\" if you mean \"having sex\".\n\n> Why does the law prohibit persuading girls to do obscene acts but does not prohibit the actual doing of the obscene act itself? Kind of weird.\n\nThis makes no sense at all, and hopefully after reading my answer you understand why this makes absolutely no sense.\n\n> How in the earth anyone can have sex with someone without persuading? He walks the street and accidentally plug his penis in?\n\n... Rape? There are many ways to have sex with someone without persuading them that I don't think I have to list. Your main mistake is still conflating persuaded / coerced consent as real consent.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, persuasion is not some innocent matter of convincing someone in a friendly manner to have sex. It includes coercion, abusing one's power, exploiting a child's ignorance and limited judgement or foresight, and other reprehensible factors.

However, truly consensual sexual activity with those 16-18 may still be legal in some circumstances.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and potential consequences of this action?\n\nA) The officer must immediately pull over the vehicle after observing the initial speeding violation, as continuing to follow the driver is illegal.\n\nB) The officer can legally follow the vehicle and issue multiple citations for various traffic violations observed during this time, potentially resulting in increased fines.\n\nC) The officer can only issue a citation for the initial speeding violation, regardless of any additional infractions observed while following the vehicle.\n\nD) Following a vehicle without initiating an immediate traffic stop is only legal if the officer suspects a more serious crime beyond traffic violations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, it is generally legal for police officers in the United States to continue following a vehicle after observing an initial traffic violation. The officer is not required to execute a stop immediately and can observe and document additional violations during this time. This approach could potentially result in multiple citations and increased fines for the driver. The practice may vary depending on local policies and individual officer discretion, but it is not inherently illegal.

An application is considered filed when it is officially received by USCIS, not when it is mailed. (Of course, they wouldn't know the date it was officially received, until they receive the I\\-485 receipt, there will be uncertainty about when exactly it was filed. But when they do receive their I\\-485 receipts, it will be retroactively clarified.)\n\nIf their I\\-485s are received on or before May 15 (if that is the expiration date of their I\\-94s), they were not deportable at any point. If their I\\-485s are received after May 15, there will be a period of time (from after their I\\-94 expires until their I\\-485 is received) when they will be technically deportable, but it is extremely unlikely that they would be caught and put into deportation proceedings during a short overstay. (And even if they are put into removal proceedings, Adjustment of Status can still be filed in removal proceedings, though it's more complicated.)\n\nAs for the effect on their Adjustment of Status application, it makes no difference whether the application is received before or after May 15\\. Although being out of status at the time of filing makes one ineligible for Adjustment of Status in most categories (see [7 USCIS\\-PM B.3](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-3)), it does not apply in the Immediate Relative category (spouse, parent, or unmarried under\\-21 child of US citizen), as is the case with the applicants here.

The applicants are technically deportable from the expiration of their I-94 (May 15th) until USCIS receives their I-485 (May 20th). However, as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen, their brief period of being out of status does not affect their eligibility for Adjustment of Status. The USCIS policy manual explicitly states that immediate relatives may be eligible to adjust status even if they are not in lawful immigration status on the date of filing the adjustment application. While they are technically deportable during this brief period, it's extremely unlikely they would face deportation proceedings, and even if they did, they could still file for Adjustment of Status. This answer captures both the technical aspect of their temporary deportability and the practical reality that it doesn't impact their AOS eligibility."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59523/could-i-create-doubt-of-a-crime-by-having-multuple-people-suggest-but-not-actua", "docs_id": 59523, "title": "Could I create doubt of a crime by having multuple people suggest, but not actually claim, that they were the murderer?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say hypothetically I'm a member of some gang and just killed a member of a rival gang.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employee's rights and status?\n\nA) The employee has a legal right to return to work early, and the employer must accommodate this request.\n\nB) The employee is considered unemployed during the sabbatical and can claim unemployment benefits.\n\nC) The employee remains employed but on leave, and the employer is not obligated to allow an early return.\n\nD) The employer must allow the early return if the government's wage reimbursement scheme covers 80% of the employee's salary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The employee remains employed but on leave, and the employer is not obligated to allow an early return. The employer granted a specific leave period and made arrangements accordingly. While the employee wishes to return early, the employer is not legally required to accommodate this change. The employee's status is still \"employed,\" even though they are on leave. This means they cannot claim unemployment benefits, but it also doesn't prevent them from seeking temporary work elsewhere if their contract allows.

It generally covers a large\\-ish area; the name comes from the fact that back in the days of horseback travel, judges would literally ride around a circuit to hold court. The exact meaning depends on the court system.\n\nAt the federal level, the circuit courts are the main federal appeals courts. Each one covers multiple states (except the DC Circuit which just covers DC and the Federal Circuit which has subject\\-based jurisdiction). A circuit court normally hears cases before a 3\\-judge panel; that panel's decision is normally binding precedent in federal courts throughout the circuit, including on future panels of the same circuit. Panel decisions can be overturned by SCOTUS or by the circuit court sitting *en banc* (i.e. all the judges hear the case, not just 3 of them). Outside the circuit, a circuit court's decision is only persuasive precedent.\n\nAt the state level, what circuit courts do depends on the state. In many states that have them, they're the most important trial courts, handling large civil cases and felony criminal cases. Some states have lower\\-tier courts to handle minor issues, in which case they might allow an appeal from the lower courts to the circuit court. This appeal might be like a normal appeal (where the higher court looks at the record from the lower court and only considers whether the lower court got the law wrong), or might be a trial *de novo* (where the higher court throws out the lower court's decision entirely and tries the case itself from scratch). It really depends on the state. If a state's circuit courts are trial courts, they generally don't set much of a precedent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the federal court system, which of the following statements about circuit courts is NOT correct?\n\nA) Circuit court decisions are binding precedent for all federal courts within that circuit.\nB) A circuit court panel's decision can be overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States.\nC) Circuit court decisions are always binding precedent in other circuits.\nD) The Federal Circuit has subject-based jurisdiction rather than geographical jurisdiction.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is incorrect. Circuit court decisions are not always binding precedent in other circuits; they are only persuasive precedent outside their own circuit. \n\nOption A is correct because within a given circuit, the circuit court's decisions are indeed binding precedent for all federal courts in that circuit. \n\nOption B is correct as the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has the power to overturn any lower court decision, including those of circuit courts. \n\nOption D is correct because the Federal Circuit is unique among the federal circuit courts in that it has nationwide jurisdiction over specific subject matters rather than geographical jurisdiction.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the federal circuit court system, the concept of binding vs. persuasive precedent, and the jurisdiction of different types of circuit courts."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80897/can-you-be-charged-with-employee-theft-after-being-fired", "docs_id": 80897, "title": "Can you be charged with employee theft after being fired?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that a person, A, was hired by an employer, B, and then got fired a week later.

Suppose that A was fired on Tuesday, got the email Wednesday, and was charged with theft ([GS 14\\-74](https://law.justia.com/codes/north-carolina/2005/chapter_14/gs_14-74.html)) on the following Monday.

Do not talk to the police without your lawyer present. **Do not attempt to represent yourself in any kind of hearing.** Ignore any advice based on what seems fair or reasonable to someone on the Internet unless it is based on a real case in North Carolina or written by a real lawyer.\n\nThat said, it appears to me that you have at least two strong defenses. First, if you you returned the laptop (It will help if you sent it by registered mail or otherwise kept a receipt, although, remember, they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you kept it), that shows you had no \u201cintent to steal\u201d or \u201cpurpose to steal\u201d it, which is a necessary element of the crime. Second, according to [the University of North Carolina criminal law blog,](https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/embezzlement-vs-larceny-by-employee/) you appear to have been charged with the wrong offense (although I don\u2019t think that will actually help you if the prosecutor decides to bring the charge that matches what your former employer alleges you to have done). It cites a relevant North Carolina Supreme Court ruling on the difference between larceny and embezzlement, State v. McDonald, 45 S.E. 582 (N.C. 1903\\).\n\nI would focus on getting yourself cleared of these charges first. You can ask your lawyer if there is any recourse you might have against your former employer.
