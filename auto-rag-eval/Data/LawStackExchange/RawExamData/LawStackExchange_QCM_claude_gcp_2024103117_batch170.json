The law aims to protect rehabilitated individuals by treating them as if they had not been convicted and by criminalizing unauthorized disclosures of spent convictions. \n\nThe warning is actually directed at the prosecutor and other officials, not the defendant, to prevent them from disclosing information about potentially spent convictions to unauthorized parties.

Driver that him stated to police that it was her fault \\- no issues with fault as this is in police report.\n\nHe had an older car with body issues but the engine and maintenance was very well maintained. Meaning a junker that drove well. \n\nBluebook value is 2\\.5\\-3k. He has 4\\-5k in damages. The problem is that the other driver's insurance wants to give him 1400\\. Finding a car that runs similar to this car even with body damage is 4\\-6k and who really knows how it was maintained. \n\nSo my question is, legally is there anything this party can do to make the insurance company fix the car vs. handing over a check for the total loss? It is my opinion that he is in a much much worse predicament than before an accident that was not his fault. Not sure how someone can cause an accident and put the victim in a worse situation but I am not sure on the legal recourse. Please let me know what other info you need.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you take away insurance, the basic legal rule is that if one person wrongfully causes damage to another, the wrong\\-doer can be compelled to make the other part \"whole\", that is, undo the damage that they caused. If you have an item of property that would cost $3,000 to fix or repair, then you could be compelled to pay for that repair or replacement. Even if it is decided that the wrong\\-doing party is entirely liable for the damage, there can be disputes over what that amount of damage actually is. \"Bluebook\" is one means of standardizing value, but it is not an actual legal definition of what a given car is worth. Really, it just depends on whose evidence about value is most persuasive. An insurance company is motivated to pay the least, and the aggrieved party is motivated to receive the maximum. A jury can weigh the arguments and decide on a figure.\n\nIf indeed the cost of repair is objectively around $5,000 and the cost of replacement is similar, then a jury would most likely find that that is what the at\\-fault party is liable for. So the way to \"force\" an insurance company to increase their offer is to persuade them of two facts: that the costs really is about $5,000, and that you are willing to sue their client to recover that $5,000\\. An insurance company simply covers their client's liability, so if the damage is $5,000, you don't sue the insurance company to get more, you sue their client. You have no obligation to accept an offer from either the insurance company or from their client: but if you don't accept some offer, you will have to sue the client to get anything.\n\nBear in mind that in Missouri, they follow the theory of \"comparative negligence\" which means that if A is found to be 75% at fault and B is 25% at fault, A is liable for 75% of B's losses. The police report does not decide that, rather that is determined by the trial. The police report is relevant to determining who gets a ticket, if anyone: civil liability is determined via a lawsuit.\n\nPutting this all together, offering $1,400 may be a strategy \u2013 a simple solution where you just accept that sum and move on. A more complicated solution is to not accept that offer, making it clear that you intend to pursue the compensation that a court would award you. If you hire an attorney, they can give you practical advice on what a court is likely to award you, how much it would cost to take it to court, and of course they can write an effective letter to the insurance company making an appropriate counter\\-offer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a car accident case in Missouri where the victim's car (valued at $2,500-$3,000) sustains $4,000-$5,000 in damages, and the at-fault driver's insurance offers only $1,400, what is the most appropriate legal course of action for the victim?\n\nA) Accept the $1,400 offer as it's the only option available\nB) Sue the insurance company directly for the full repair cost\nC) Hire an attorney to negotiate with the insurance company and potentially pursue a lawsuit against the at-fault driver\nD) File a complaint with the Missouri Department of Insurance\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because accepting the $1,400 offer is not the only option and may significantly undervalue the victim's loss.\nB) is incorrect because the victim cannot sue the insurance company directly; they would need to sue the at-fault driver.\nC) is correct because hiring an attorney can help negotiate a fair settlement with the insurance company based on actual damages and, if necessary, pursue a lawsuit against the at-fault driver to recover full compensation.\nD) is incorrect because while filing a complaint might be an option, it's not the most effective way to receive fair compensation in this situation.\n\nThe correct approach involves hiring an attorney who can effectively negotiate with the insurance company, present evidence of the true value of damages, and if needed, pursue legal action against the at-fault driver to recover fair compensation.

Usually they'll get fed up and quit, but if they don't we can fire them for \"unsatisfactory performance.\" Never had an issue with constructive dismissals because we stack the \"evidence\" against them from the beginning. Many times we outright fabricate it.\n\t+ If they somehow get past this, we just deny them promotions for various reasons.\n* Create strict \"culture fit\" rules that DP applicants generally can't fit into, and pass them up based on \"not a cultural fit\" reasons.\n\nThese controls basically ensure DP applicants never really get a chance, and if they do, everything is stacked against them. It helps the companies save lots of money on accommodations, and prevents a significant amount of lawsuits.\n\nI've helped successfully defend against multiple EEOC lawsuits simply by showing the candidate was not qualified for the position, or didn't perform their job well enough.

There is not much traffic, so there is still plenty of room for the emergency vehicle to pass.\n\nA very similar situation occurred for both my wife and myself. In both instances, the ambulance stopped directly behind us and honked until we moved to the right\\-hand side of the road in spite of the fact that there was ample room for them to pass.\n\nIs there something in the policy for the drivers of emergency vehicles that simply prohibits them from passing traffic on any side but the left? I know in **extreme** circumstances, they can even carefully drive through oncoming traffic.\n\nIn a situation as mentioned above, should one simply cut across the road in front of the coming emergency vehicle?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using two states as examples:\n\nIn California, emergency vehicle operators are exempt from pretty much the entirety of the rules of the road ([VC 21055](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d11/c1/a2/21055)). They can pass you on the right if they want to. Department policy might say no, but that depends on department policy and the details of their emergency vehicle operation course.\n\nHowever, California law requires all drivers to pull to the *right* when an emergency vehicle approaches ([VC 21806](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d11/c4/21806)). Even though an ambulance driver legally could pass you on the right, you are required to pull right. According to [the BLM's emergency response policy for fire personnel in California](http://www.blm.gov/ca/dir/pdfs/2004/im/CAIM2004-021ATT1.pdf), this means passing on the right is heavily disfavored: the emergency vehicle operator doesn't know that the driver (who is clearly not paying much attention) won't suddenly notice them and comply with the vehicle code, cutting them off or running into them. Other policies/things which seem to reflect policies say similar things, and all make it clear that operators need to be careful that the car they're passing won't drive into them.\n\nIn Maryland, the law is a bit different. [Section 21\\-405](http://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/transportation/title-21/subtitle-4/21-405/) of the Maryland Code obligates drivers to move to the edge of the roadway. This means *either* edge, so on a divided highway you might pull left. On a non\\-divided road, you obviously pull right. In this case, the vehicle may end up passing you on the right, but again: they are going to be careful about it, and would rather you get out of their way so they don't have to worry that you'll suddenly see them and drive into them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An ambulance with its lights and siren activated is approaching from behind on a two-lane road.

In this scenario, it's safer to remain in your lane and allow the ambulance to pass on the right if there's sufficient room. Emergency vehicle operators are typically exempt from standard traffic rules and can pass on either side when necessary. Cutting across lanes abruptly (option B) could be dangerous. Pulling to the left (option C) is incorrect in most jurisdictions and could confuse other drivers. Maintaining speed and position without yielding (option D) is both illegal and dangerous. The best action is to slow down, stay in your lane, and allow the ambulance to pass safely on the right if there's room to do so."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52774/can-i-use-mario-or-other-similar-assets-for-a-banner-on-my-website", "docs_id": 52774, "title": "Can I use Mario or other similar assets for a banner on my website?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My graphic designer sent me a banner for a gaming website that has Mario on it.

[18 USC 832](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/832) forbids the possession of a \"radiological weapon\".

While the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, court cases like D.C. v. Heller and Hollis v. Lynch have established that this right is not unlimited. The courts have ruled that weapons not in \"common use\" for lawful purposes like self-defense are not protected. Given that nuclear weapons are explicitly illegal under multiple federal statutes (18 USC 831, 832, and 2332i) and are certainly not in common use, it's highly likely that these laws would be upheld as constitutional if challenged. The precedent set by cases involving less extreme weapons like machine guns suggests that restrictions on nuclear weapons would be viewed as constitutional.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Second Amendment has been interpreted to have limits. Option B is wrong because the \"common use\" doctrine would certainly not apply to nuclear weapons.

In other jurisdictions, different rules could apply.\n\nContext matters.\n\nThe usual penalty for spoliation of evidence (the technical term for what you describe) in a civil case is a judicial determination or jury instruction that the evidence destroyed would have established the relevant part of the other side's case had it not been destroyed. In all of these cases, your failure to take affirmative action to preserve the evidence once you knew that there was a bona fide likelihood that you would be sued could be held against you by making an adverse determination that the evidence would have been unfavorable to you and possibly also money sanctions. You could not be held in contempt of court for this if these events happened before a case was commenced.\n\nIn a criminal case, where you are a defendant, you have an absolute right to not incriminate yourself and do not have to take affirmative action to preserve evidence, although this right is limited to criminal cases and your failure to preserve evidence can still be held against you in a civil case.\n\nCertainly, in situation 4 you are a potential criminal defendant, so the 5th Amendment protection would apply.\n\nIn situations 1 and 2, where the precautions were not put in place to facilitate a crime, the 5th Amendment would protect you if you were a potential criminal defendant, but suppose that you are a bystander like a third party ISP representative. If you were a third party, at a minimum you would have to be put on notice of the police need for the evidence, would probably have had to have had the police ask you for the evidence, and of course, would have to be aware that the destruction was imminent and have the power to prevent that destruction. If all those conditions were present, you might be guilty of obstruction of justice (there are precedents for inaction knowing of the consequences in the fact of a police question amounting to obstruction of justice).\n\nIn situation 3, this kind of action pretty much amounts to being an accessory to some crime before the fact (unless someone was successfully deceived by a very elaborate story) and would likely make anyone involved part of a conspiracy to commit the crime that the destruction of the papers would facilitate.

The courtesy note suggests multiple sources for the photographs, which could potentially have separate copyrights. Although copyrights from 1934 would typically have expired by now, it's prudent to verify that no separate, unexpired copyrights exist for individual photos.

There may be specific laws prohibiting protests in a certain location (e.g. the floor of the House; on a military base) or temporary policies restricting the venue of a protest (such as a radius around a convention center when a political party is having its convention there). In the latter case, there is typically a \"free speech zone\", that is, public land set aside for such protests.\n\nThe First Amendment only protects peaceable assembly, and restrictions on assemblies are designed to prevent or limit disruptions. Disruptions certainly \noccur, but with a planned and permitted event, the police are in place to direct traffic and minimize the impact. Another valid concern is that even with advance planning and notice, certain events can turn very violent, in which case the authorities have to do something to mitigate the threat.\n\nIt is not at all clear these days whether the authorities tend to abuse their discretion in granting permits. Much as they may hate having a Nazi rally in Chicago, they could not forbid the rally. They may not be required to allow the rally at a specific time and place. There have been problems in the past with authorities holding that \"We don't want X in our town\", but I think it is generally understood that that is not legal. This does not mean that all authorities are welcoming of all forms of protest, and the limits are stretched and even broken, but what can you do? The answer is, sue them, which may lead to a further sharpening of the law. \n\nOne excuse for not giving a permit is that they require advance notice, perhaps of 2 weeks \u2013 many political protests take place within a day of some event. In that case, in response to current events, such deadlines are supposed to be suspended.\n\nAny fees imposed by the government have to be actual cost, and cannot include the cost of extra police to protect the protesters; any insurance requirements have to be affordable by the group, and must be waived if insurance can't be obtained.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A group plans to hold a controversial political rally in a public park.

The group must pay for extra police presence\n4. Banners are limited to 3 feet by 5 feet in size\n\nWhich of these requirements is most likely to be upheld as constitutional under First Amendment protections?\n\nA) The 3-day advance permit requirement\nB) The ban on helmets and shields\nC) The requirement to pay for extra police\nD) The size restriction on banners\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The 3-day advance permit requirement (option A) is the most likely to be upheld as constitutional. While the First Amendment protects the right to protest, governments can impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, including requiring permits for large gatherings. A 3-day notice is relatively short and allows for spontaneous protests in response to current events.\n\nOption B (ban on helmets and shields) may be seen as overly restrictive of personal safety measures and could be challenged.\n\nOption C (paying for extra police) is explicitly mentioned as unconstitutional in the passage, which states that fees \"cannot include the cost of extra police to protect the protesters.\"\n\nOption D (banner size restrictions) could potentially be challenged as an unnecessary restriction on free speech, especially if larger banners don't pose a safety risk.\n\nWhile all these restrictions might be challenged, the permit requirement is the most likely to withstand constitutional scrutiny."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/63900/is-the-prosecutors-fallacy-still-an-issue-in-cases-today", "docs_id": 63900, "title": "Is the prosecutor&#39;s fallacy still an issue in cases today?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm writing an article about the misuse of statistics in the courtroom. Of course one can not have this conversation without mentioning of the so\\-called \"[Prosecutor's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy)\". Most of the examples of this date back to the late\\-90s/early 2000s e.g Sally Clark, Angela Cannings etc.\n\nThe fallacy involves statistical reasoning in court cases. Basically, it is the error of assuming that the odds of a false positive are the odds of the defendant's guilt. So when the expert witness declares that the DNA test is 99\\.9% accurate, the prosecution tells the jury this means there is only 0\\.1% chance that the defendant is innocent.\n\nMy question is has anything actually been done to address the issue of prosecutors and unqualified expert witnesses giving misleading statistics in the courtroom? Or have lawyers more or less learned their lesson from these instances and are more careful about it now?\n\nMoreover, does anyone know of any other general practises that have been implemented to help prevent faulty scientific analysis from being presented in court?\n\n(I'm asking mainly about the English legal system, however please feel free to present anything relevant about the American system or any other).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This [article on the Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) is a reasonable intro\\-level presentation of the relevant case law for the US. This related to [\"Rule 702\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702), a rule governing the admissibility of evidence. The rule is based on, three Supreme Court rulings: Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; General Electric Co. v. Joiner; Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael. The main points of the rule are that the judge decides what is admissible (as opposed to judges letting anything be admitted and juries decide what they believe), and must determine that the expert testimony is relevant and reliable (it must be more likely than not that the expert's methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand). The court adopts the hypothesis\\-testing viewpoint, and proof/falsification is based on criteria for acceptance or rejection: is the theory generally accepted in the scientific community, has it been subjected to peer review and publication, is it even testable and has it been tested, is the (potential) rate of error acceptable, and does the supporting research exist independent of the proposed testimony.\n\nNeither prosecutors not defense attorneys testify, and there is little that can be done to limit the creativity of attorneys to ask questions that have the effect of making people believe that the question was a factual statement. Judgments of \"qualifications\" are extremely hard to make, however in some instances there are certification boards (typically, for any regulated industry such as mechanical engineering or medicine). Since I have no medical credentials, I doubt that any judge would allow me to testify as an expert witness on a medical question. Being a particle physicist is not a regulated industry at least in the US, so the criteria for expertise would be more subjective (judges aren't expected to know who the leading physicists are).\n\nThe general remedy for \"faulty scientific reasoning\" is cross\\-examination and competing testimony. That is, the \"other side\" needs a scientific consultant to point out the flaws in the reasoning. Word\\-of\\-mouth is one way that attorneys learn who to call, when scientific questions arise.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the Daubert Standard and its impact on expert testimony in US courts?\n\nA) It allows juries to decide what expert testimony is admissible without input from judges.\nB) It requires judges to determine if expert testimony is relevant and reliable before allowing it in court.\nC) It mandates that all expert witnesses must be certified by professional boards in their field.\nD) It eliminates the need for cross-examination of expert witnesses in court proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Daubert Standard, as described in the passage, requires judges to determine if expert testimony is relevant and reliable before allowing it in court. This standard is based on Rule 702 and three Supreme Court rulings. It shifts the responsibility of determining admissibility to judges, rather than leaving it entirely to juries. The standard does not mandate certification for all expert witnesses, though it may be a factor in some fields. Cross-examination is still an important part of the process to challenge expert testimony. Option A is incorrect as it contradicts the Daubert Standard's emphasis on judicial gatekeeping. Option C overstates the requirement for certification, which is not universal. Option D is incorrect as cross-examination remains a key tool for addressing potential issues with expert testimony."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61170/in-the-state-of-ny-if-i-have-no-income-but-i-have-a-house-do-i-need-to-pay-p", "docs_id": 61170, "title": "In the State of NY, if I have no income, but I have a house \u2014 do I need to pay property tax?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I need to pay property tax on the house, are there any exemptions, based on the fact that I have no income?\n\nIs it relevant what the tax assessment of the house is?\n\nWhen I look at houses in house search websites, I often see in the tax history something like:\nProperty tax for 2017: $2,000\n\nWhile for all the other years from 2000 to 2019, there is no info.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If I need to pay property tax on the house, are there any exemptions,\n> based on the fact that I have no income?\n\nNo.\n\nThere may be property tax exemptions for other reasons, but there is not a property tax exemption for lack of income.\n\nThe most common property tax exemptions in New York are listed [here](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/exemption/index.htm).

In the U.S. an \"[attornment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attornment)\" clause is a provision that requires a party to a contract to affirmatively declare upon notice from the other party if the attorning party claims that the other party is in breach of the contract or has unfulfilled obligations (with the attorning party waiving any claims for breach of contract not identified at that time). An \"attornment\" clause is normally found in a lease or secured promissory note and facilitates the transfer of the leased property or secured debt in a way that the new owner can know that there is no risk that it is already in default apart from the transferor's representation.

Isn't it entirely a state matter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The constitution delegates the power of selecting Electors to the states themselves, through whatever method the state legislature so chooses (today it is always through a popular vote, in most cases statewide but in two cases it is done also by district). Elections for the Senate and Congress are also specifically delegated as to be done however each state legislature so chooses. A right to vote isn't mentioned in the constitution until the suffrage amendments. These protected the right to vote independent of race, servitude, and gender. Moreover, they granted Congress the authority to legislate so as to achieve these ends. So there is federal power intersecting with voting, at least.\n\nThose probably aren't the bone of contention here, however. The claimed issue, as I understand it, is actually from the first part. The claim is that what is going on\u2014extending deadlines etc. via decisions of election boards, court orders, or whatever\u2014is a violation of the Constitution delegating control over voting to the legislatures. In the case of decisions by election boards (or similar thing), as the legislature in question will have of necessity passed legislation empowering the board to make such a decision on their own, it boils down to whether or not the legislature is held to have the power to delegate that power or not. There's no hard and fast rule for this: sometimes the US Congress has been held to have delegated too much, other times it's held to be just fine (and Kavanaugh, I think, seems inclined to think it has delegated too much in general and this needs to be addressed). For court orders, it becomes a question of whether the court has the authority to make such orders, or if this is an infringement of a power reserved to the legislatures.\n\nEither way, it becomes a constitutional issue: do actions of election boards, duly enacted by legislation, or court orders, (sometimes) run afoul of the Constitutional grant of this power to the state legislatures? Chief Justice Roberts appears to be trying to toe a line where he does not want to get involved with second\\-guessing state election boards and state courts, wanting to just let those stand as state matters reserved to them by the constitution. His problem, it would seem, is with what federal courts can do, and he seems open to reviewing decisions from federal courts that concern the exercise of state powers on elections. In other words, he seems inclined to let stand a state court ruling to extend a deadline, but may take issue with a *federal* court issuing such a ruling. Of course, there are now 5 other \"conservative\" justices besides Roberts, only 4 of which are needed to hear a case, so the ability for Roberts to get the court to go along with this apparent line of legal reasoning will be strongly dependent on his ability to convince at least two of those conservatives of the correctness, or at least wisdom, of doing so.

Such deductions are generally considered unlawful if they are not ordered by a court, part of a collective bargaining agreement, or expressly permitted by law.

The correct answer, C, accurately captures the nuanced situation described in the documentation. Even if the creator doesn't violate specific laws, they may face suspicion from authorities due to their association with these platforms. Additionally, by exposing the operations of dark web marketplaces, the creator risks retaliation from the parties involved in these markets, which law enforcement may not be able to protect against.

Some teachers, however, ignore this, and have students use their phones to answer questions in real time (via something like TopHat). \n\nNow let's say Alice has her phone out when she should not, and it is taken away by the teacher. It is returned sometime later. Then Alice's mother tells Alice's teacher that the phone is her property, not her daughter's, not the teacher's, that only Alice has permission to use it, and that if the teacher takes the phone away again, the mother considers it theft and (legal threat here). \n\n**Can the teacher/district take the phone anyway due to In Loco Parentis?**\n\nNote: For the record, the better solution for the district is to simply give detentions every time Alice violates the rule from now on, leading to eventual suspension and expulsion, but I'm far more interested in how much parenting authority a teacher/school can legally exert even when the actual parents are *clearly and conspicuously opposed to such exertion.* \n\n**Bonus Question: The phone is actually Alice's property, bought and paid for with money Alice earned at her job. Does this change the answer?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The school can confiscate a cell phone if you violated phone usage policy, because schools have broad powers to set student conduct policies. Searching the phone is a separate matter: a search requires reasonable suspicion and the search has to be narrowly related to that suspicion. As long as there is an actual policy and a violation of the policy, there seems to be no limit on confiscating phones.\n\nSchool authority over children in the US was historically justified by reference to the *in loco parentis* doctrine since [State v. Pendergrass](https://la.utexas.edu/users/jmciver/357L/19NC365.html), 19 N.C. 365, granting school \"the authority necessary for preserving discipline\", which is \"analogous to that which belongs to parents, and the authority of the teacher is regarded as a delegation of parental authority\". More contemporary rulings on the question of school authority, again in the domain of \ncorporal punishment,\nas articulated in [Ingraham v. Wright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/430/651/), 430 U.S. 651 find that \n\n> the concept of parental delegation has been replaced by the view \\-\\-\n>  more consonant with compulsory education laws \\-\\- that the State itself\n>  may impose such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary \"for\n>  the proper education of the child and for the maintenance of group\n>  discipline\".\n\nIn other words, the courts do not rely on the parental doctrine to justify school authority, instead they rely on what is reasonably necessary to achieve an end. Thus in [New Jersey v. T.L.O](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/469/325), 469 U.S. 325, *in loco parentis* was rejected as a rationale for an unconstitutional search, reasoning \n\n> If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the\n>  constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it\n>  is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising\n>  parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of\n>  their students.\n\nInstead, the court frames the test in terms of competing interests:\n\n> Against the child's interest in privacy must be set the substantial\n>  interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in\n>  the classroom and on school grounds.\n\nSince school authority to confiscate cell phones does not rest on acting according to the wishes of the parent, it is irrelevant that the parent approves of the child's actions. They may take the phone away, but it is not because of *in loco parentis*, it's because of necessity. It does not matter whose property it is; and it is not theft, because the confiscation was lawful.\n\n*In loco parentis* is not necessarily dead, see [Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/646/), 515 U.S. 646, where compulsory drug testing was justified, finding that\n\n> the Policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government's\n>  responsibilities, under a public school system, as guardian and tutor\n>  of children entrusted to its care...\n> \n> \n> when the government acts as guardian and tutor the relevant question\n>  is whether the search is one that a reasonable guardian and tutor\n>  might undertake\n\nIt is not part of a school's remit to promulgate the drug\\-free life, so drug testing cannot be justified by appeal to necessity. Disciplinary matters are squarely within the scope of what is necessary for schools, so disciplinary questions don't need to rely on *in loco parentis*. In the Vernonia case, the court still finds that the state has limited reach to override the rights of children \u2013 parents still have much broader rights to restrict children than the state does.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal basis for the school's authority to confiscate the phone?\n\nA) The school can confiscate the phone based on the doctrine of in loco parentis, which gives them the same authority as parents.\n\nB) The school cannot confiscate the phone because the parent has explicitly opposed this action, overriding the school's authority.\n\nC) The school can confiscate the phone based on the necessity to maintain discipline and enforce school policies, regardless of parental wishes.\n\nD) The school can only confiscate the phone if they have reasonable suspicion of illegal activity and conduct a narrow search related to that suspicion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Modern court rulings have moved away from the in loco parentis doctrine as the basis for school authority. Instead, schools can take disciplinary actions, such as confiscating phones, based on the necessity to maintain discipline and enforce school policies. This authority exists regardless of parental wishes, as it's grounded in the school's need to maintain an effective learning environment. The parent's opposition or claim of ownership doesn't override the school's ability to enforce its policies. Answer A is incorrect because it relies on an outdated interpretation of in loco parentis. B is wrong because parental wishes don't trump school policy in this case. D is incorrect because it confuses the standards for searching a phone (which does require reasonable suspicion) with the act of confiscation, which doesn't require suspicion of illegal activity."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8300/author-ownership-of-e-books", "docs_id": 8300, "title": "Author ownership of e-books", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We're a small not\\-for\\-profit group (but not yet a registered company) making a web app which allows people to write books, basically.

If not the only way I can think of getting around this is by using something like having a form on the html email that 'posts' the data to the landing page, but I'm not sure if that would work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first question is if you have the right to have this data in the first place. E\\-mail and name will typically be covered by contract reasons; you may need consent for other pieces of information if they are not needed to fulfill the contract or legal obligations. Other data may require the user's consent.\n\nSending to a user his own data is not an issue, as e\\-mail is usually considered a safe communication channel.\n\nA different issue is that, by using this mechanism, that data is going to appear in more places than needed. For example, in your server and firewall logs, that registers accesses to `https://business.lee-m123.example/login?email=mysecreteemail@gmail.com&name=DrDoom`, for example. These registers then become affected by the GDPR, and if the person asks you to provide which information do you have about them, you have to include them1.\n\nAdditionally, someone could object to the system on the grounds of data rectification. If a customer tells you \"My name is not Larry, but Lawrence (or, FWIW, Vanessa)\", the link will still fill the fields with the old name. I would say that you would be ok (it is not your data that is wrong), but a less technically savvy person may object and get upset and force you to do some work explaining your system without need; and in the best of cases it is a nuisance to your customer who will be correcting the name each time.\n\nFrom a technical POV I do not understand why you do not just send an ID in the parameters and then, when you get that ID, fill the forms with the data that you have in your database. And of course, keep that form protected2 with a password or whatever so nobody can just pass random IDs and retrieve your users data without proving that it is them.\n\n---\n\n1It would also become an issue if the user asks you to delete your records about him; you might be able to claim \"legitimate needs\" to keep the logs but it is still an unnecessary trouble.\n\n2Because you are already protecting that form from unauthorized access, AREN'T YOU?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company uses a system where customized emails are sent to clients with links containing personal data in query string variables (e.g., domain.com?email=larry@test.com&firstname=Larry).

It exposes personal data in server and firewall logs, which then become subject to GDPR requirements for data disclosure and deletion.\n2. It can lead to data rectification issues if the information in the URL becomes outdated.\n3. It potentially makes personal data accessible to unauthorized parties if the URLs are intercepted or shared.\n\nThe recommended approach is to modify the system to use a secure, unique identifier in the URL. When the user accesses the landing page, this identifier can be used to retrieve the necessary data from the server-side database. This method reduces exposure of personal data, simplifies compliance with data rectification requests, and can be more easily secured against unauthorized access.\n\nAdditionally, the company should ensure they have the right to process the data in the first place, typically covered by contract reasons for basic information like name and email. Any additional data may require explicit consent depending on its nature and use."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56935/legal-status-of-js-code-on-web-site", "docs_id": 56935, "title": "Legal status of js code on web-site", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Normally, every code, distributed to be run on user machines, come with a license.

Option B best meets these conditions because:\n\n1. It uses an official promotional image, ensuring the source is legitimate.\n2. It provides proper attribution to the studio, meeting the \"sufficient acknowledgement\" requirement.\n3. The image comes from an official source that has been \"made available to the public\" as required by the law.\n\nOption A fails because it lacks attribution. Option C is problematic because the original source isn't verified, potentially using an unauthorized copy. Option D is incorrect because fair dealing in the UK is more restricted than US fair use, and the source and legality of images matter.

If you stop paying the finance company, they will initiate legal proceedings against you to make good on your obligation, and that won't affect what the contractor does. It might not hurt you to write a formal letter (no phone calls) to the contractor stating that you require them to complete the job by some date certain, and hope that you won't have to take the matter to court. If you decide to write the letter yourself, you want to avoid saying anything that could be held against your interest, for example \"I don't care how crappy a job you do, I just want this job done!\": you need to be sure that what you say in a letter does not put you at a legal disadvantage. The best way to guarantee that is to hire an attorney to write the letter. If you want your money back (plus interest), you will almost certainly need to hire an attorney to write the letter.\n\nIt is possible that there is an arbitration clause in your contract, requiring you to settle disputes with the firm Dewey, Cheatham \\& Howe.
