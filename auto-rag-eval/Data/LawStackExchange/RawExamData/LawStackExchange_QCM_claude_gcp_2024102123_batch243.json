My apartment prohibits tenants from having firearms on the property, by the lease. in the United States, the \"right to bear arms\" is a constitutional right. (I understand there's disagreement about what that means, that things are more complicated than just that phrase, and etc.) So, theoretically, can an apartment 'infringe' on other constitutional rights as well, such as freedom of speech, as long as it's in the lease, and the tenant signs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Firstly, your \"apartment\" doesn't prohibit anything; Your tenancy contract does. A terminology nitpick, but one that can shed some light on what is actually happening.\n\n**TLDR:** Your right to bear arms isn't being infringed, its being traded away. An unreasonable trade may be invalidated by the courts. Firearms restrictions are far less likely to be voided than speech content limitations.\n\nYes, you have the right to bear arms(whatever exact meaning of that is). You also have the right to voluntarily agree to a binding agreement limiting that right, in exchange for a consideration.\n\nCompare a Non\\-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). You have the right to freedom in your speech: you also have the right to agree to binding limits on your freedom of speech, in return for consideration (such as money or access to information).\n\nEvery contract is structured in the same general way: Party A agrees to do or avoid doing certain things, in exchange for Party B agreeing to do or avoid doing certain things.\n\nSo, in essence, what the apartment contract says is, that you agree to do or not do some things (including paying rent), in return for your landlord temporarily granting you some rights(such as the right to reside(generally exclusive), the right to control the space, etc. ), and imposing some obligations on themselves (which vary from place to place). In your case, one of the things that you are trading is a limitation on your right to bear arms(note that you can still bear arms, just not on the property in question).\n\nNow one thing to note is that courts have the power to enforce contracts; they also have the power to void contracts, in part or in full, if they are illegal or \"unconscionable\". In general, restricting (the content of) speech is not reasonable (e.g. having a general noise level restriction is reasonable), so is more likely to be struck down than one restricting firearms on the rented property."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant signs a lease agreement that includes a clause prohibiting the possession of firearms on the rental property.

The tenant has voluntarily agreed to limit their right to bear arms in exchange for the right to reside on the property. This is not an unconstitutional infringement (choice A is incorrect) because the tenant is willingly entering into a contract that includes this limitation. The courts will not automatically void this clause (choice C is incorrect) as it is generally considered a reasonable contractual term. However, landlords cannot impose any restrictions they want on constitutional rights (choice D is incorrect) - courts can still void clauses that are deemed unreasonable or unconscionable.

According to the documentation, eviction is primarily a matter of contract law between the landlord and the individual tenant. Other tenants' complaints alone do not provide grounds for eviction. The landlord can only evict the smoking tenant if their behavior violates the terms of their specific rental agreement.

So, the generic legal rule is that you don't need to keep your dog on a leash until there is a legal provision requiring you to do so.\n\nThere was a trend to have general restrictive legal rules for dogs that were presumed to be dangerous a few years ago but several courts rightly pointed out that all such rules must be proportional, so couldn't impose too strict generalized, abstract rules without taking into account if a specific dog is actually dangerous or not. \n\nIn Schleswig\\-Holstein, a new [dog act](http://www.gesetze-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/t/1jem/page/bsshoprod.psml?pid=Dokumentanzeige&showdoccase=1&js_peid=Trefferliste&documentnumber=1&numberofresults=24&fromdoctodoc=yes&doc.id=jlr-HuGSHrahmen&doc.part=X&doc.price=0.0&doc.hl=1#focuspoint) (\"Gesetz \u00fcber das Halten von Hunden (HundeG)\" entered into force in January 2016\\. It contains differentiated rules, especially in its \u00a7 3, on when dogs are to be kept on a leash and when this isn't supposed to be required. In a nutshell, a leash is required in places where typically many people are, like public parks or pedestrian zones. This it not much away from the previous rules.\n\nFor walking dogs in a forest, there is still a special rule (which has precedence because of the *lex specialis principle*) in \u00a7 17 of the [forest act](http://www.gesetze-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/t/1jfl/page/bsshoprod.psml?pid=Dokumentanzeige&showdoccase=1&js_peid=Trefferliste&documentnumber=2&numberofresults=60&fromdoctodoc=yes&doc.id=jlr-WaldGSH2004rahmen&doc.part=X&doc.price=0.0&doc.hl=1#jlr-WaldGSH2004V5P17-jlr-WaldGSH2004V1P17-jlr-WaldGSH2004V2P17-jlr-WaldGSH2004V3P17-jlr-WaldGSH2004V4P17) of Schleswig\\-Holstein of 2004 (\"Waldgesetz f\u00fcr das Land Schleswig\\-Holstein\n(Landeswaldgesetz \\- LWaldG)\") according to which dogs in the forest are to be kept on a leash at all times. The reason behind this rule is probably that freely running dogs in a forest may easily hunt wild animals living in the forest. \n\nIf you don't obey these rules, you are typically committing an administrative offense (\"Ordnungswidrigkeit\"), so you could end up with a fine."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the laws in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in which of the following situations is it legal to walk your dog without a leash?\n\nA) In a public park on a quiet weekday morning\nB) In a busy pedestrian zone in the city center\nC) On a hiking trail in a dense forest\nD) On an empty rural road with no other people around\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect.

This is far more than directly identifiable information! The concept of identifiability is further explained in Recital 26:\n\n> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.\n\nSo indirectly linkable information can still be personal data. In your example, that ID can be easily re\\-identified with a particular person if you know who the secretary was between 2012 and 2014\\. It is quite likely that there are members in the club with this knowledge, or that this information can be gained from public sources like newspaper reports. Thus, you should assume that your member IDs are at most pseudonyms, but not anonymous. They are likely still personal data.\n\nHowever, it doesn't necessarily follow that you would have to erase everything. Art 17 comes with lots of caveats and exceptions. For example, if you are processing this personal data under a legitimate interest, and someone requests erasure, you might have overriding grounds to continue processing anyway. E.g. such a legitimate interest could involve security or auditability purposes. There might also be such a legitimate interest for keeping some history for the club, but there would have to be a decision based on the individual circumstances. Furthermore, you can of course retain data e.g. due to a legal obligation, or when this information is necessary for the establishment of or defence against legal claims.\n\nI understand your desire to keep some data around. Instead of asking \u201cdo I have to delete this?\u201d it might be more productive to consider \u201cunder which legal basis can I keep this?\u201d. I think you might have a legitimate interest, but you'd have to carry out a balancing test between the various interests and rights.\n\nA really problematic approach would be to hold on to de\\-identified data in the belief that it no longer were personal data. Such a belief is usually mistaken. True anonymization that meets the GDPR's definition is *really hard*, in particular because you would also have to prevent indirect identification, also by other actors than yourself. There are theoretical models that can help with anonymization, e.g. with k\\-anonymization methods you'd ensure that there are no unique records in the DB. But this can be tricky to apply correctly, so I'd recommend to only treat aggregate statistics as truly anonymous.\n\nIn 2012, the ICO has published an [anonymization code of practice (PDF)](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf). It is no longer up to date with the current legal environment (in particular since the GDPR has expanded the concept of identifiability), but it provides a good overview of both the difficulties of preventing re\\-identification and an overview of potential solutions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small club with 600 members wants to comply with GDPR's right to erasure.

According to the GDPR, personal data includes any information that relates to an identifiable person, even indirectly. In this case, the memberID could potentially be linked back to an individual through other means, such as knowledge of who held certain positions during specific time periods.

This requires an attorney to act on his client's behalf in a reasonably timely way, which the attorney in your hypothetical sounds like he is not be doing.\n\nBy failing to respond to correspondence from an opposing party, an attorney can weaken his client's position or even affirmatively subject his client to new obligations. I'm not sure exactly what kind of correspondence you're imagining, but any attorney worth his salt could come up with plenty of ways that failing to communicate with an adverse party could harm the client: subjecting him to new contract obligations under UCC 2\\-207, allowing a settlement offer to lapse, pissing off the opposing party enough to move ahead with a lawsuit, or pissing off the judge who eventually handles the case, who will be none too happy to see that one side was being intransigent.\n\nIf such a failure to communicate diligently and promptly was not reasonable, the lawyer could be subject to discipline.\n\nPractically speaking, though, none of this is likely very relevant for your purposes.

If you smack a car and caused $100 dollars of damage, that is what you owe. If, previously, someone else smacked the car and caused $1,000 worth of damage, they are liable to that extent \u2013 and not the sum of the two amounts. Liability does not transfer to \"the most recent person causing damage\".\n\nThis would include *reasonable* medical care, and in the context of a previous accident of some significance, the injured party is entitled to considerable leeway in investigative medicine, because they are in an already fragile condition and you may have cracked their eggshell\\-thin skull. Apart from the cost of the immediately post\\-accident checkup (if one is deemed necessary), your liability would depend on professional testimony regarding the second accident. If the nature of the second injury required an additional 4 weeks of medical care and time off work, you would be liable for those 4 weeks. If the second injury made the treatment more expensive by $50/week, you would be liable for that $50 from the time of the accident (so, $400 if the total time to recovery is 8 weeks \u2013 as you describe in the comment)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A driver, Alice, was involved in a minor rear-end collision with Bob's car.

It makes it possible to better determine the cause of injury and no surgery within 40 years is more good than bad to you.\n\nWhether you are single or divorced, how many children you have and how old they are is only relevant if you are dead, because in that situation, it determines who has a right to bring a wrongful death action or receive worker's compensation benefits in connection with your death.

Incidentally, the provision in question appears in multiple state penal codes (it was a traditional common\\-law rule), and they have all restricted its meaning.\n\nIn 1961, a California appeals court considered this issue in People v. Jones ([191 Call. App. 2d 478](http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/191/478.html)). The court ruled that\n\n> It is true that Penal Code, section 197, subdivision 1, does provide that homicide is justifiable when resisting an attempt to commit a felony.

Andrews](https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-134/state-v-andrews/) is relatively new case law. Has it ever been successfully challenged at the district court level?\n\nI'm aware of several cases where the state has seized a citizen's smartphone with a search warrant; then, citing *State v. Andrews*, has compelled said citizen to reveal their phone's password so that the phone's contents may be searched.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is: have there been any cases where the State's motion to compel a password under Andrews has been successfully challenged?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question is ill framed, but I'll try to reframe it and answer it.\n\n*New Jersey v. Andrews* is a decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court (its highest appellate court), which held that you do not have a 5th Amendment right to refuse to disclose a password that if disclosed might reveal incriminating password protected information. Andrews [attempted to appeal this to the U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.eff.org/cases/andrews-v-new-jersey) with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Freedom Foundation. But, [the U.S. Supreme Court denied Andrews' petition for certiorari](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/andrews-v-new-jersey/) (i.e. refused to take up the case, leaving it in force in New Jersey) on May 17, 2021\\.\n\nAs explained in [an amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-937/168713/20210211115141358_20-937_Amici%20Brief.pdf) to the U.S. Supreme Court in support of granting Andrews' Petition for Certiorari:\n\n> In an opinion dated, August 10, 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court,\n> based on *Fisher v. United States*, 425 U.S. 391 (1976\\), extended the\n> \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d doctrine to cellphones and held that the Fifth\n> Amendment to the United States Constitution does not protect an\n> individual from being compelled to recall and truthfully disclose a\n> password to his cellphone under circumstances where that disclosure\n> may lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence. *State v.\n> Andrews*, 234 A.3d 1254, 1274\\-75 (N.J. 2020\\).\n\nThe basic issue is that the 5th Amendment does not protect documents written by a potential criminal defendant from disclosure (and such a person can be forced to turn over those records or provide, for example, a physical key to a file cabinet to allow them to be obtained by authorities), but the 5th Amendment does protect a potential criminal defendant from having to testify in a way that would be self\\-incriminating. It isn't clear on which side of this divide a forced disclosure of a password lies.\n\nThe same amicus brief notes a law review article which stated that:\n\n> the Fifth Amendment law of compelled access to encrypted data as a\n> \u201cfundamental question bedeviling courts and scholars\u201d and \u201cthat has\n> split and confused the courts\u201d\n\n*citing* Laurent Sacharoff, \"[Unlocking the Fifth Amendment: Passwords and Encrypted Devices](https://fordhamlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/09_Sacharoff-203-251.pdf)\", 87 Fordham L. Rev. 203, 203, 207 (2018\\).\n\nNeither the federal courts below the U.S. Supreme Court, nor the courts of another state can overturn a ruling of the New Jersey Supreme Court, and all state courts in the state of New Jersey are required to follow the precedents of the New Jersey Supreme Court including *New Jersey v. Andrews*.\n\nThere is an unresolved split of authority on this legal issue at the national level.\n\nThree courts one step below the U.S. Supreme Court (including the New Jersey Supreme Court) have resolved it as New Jersey did, four courts one step below the U.S. Supreme Court have taken the opposite position, and at least one state (Florida) has an internal split of authority over the issue. Forty\\-five states (including Florida which is split at the intermediate appellate court level), the District of Columbia's local courts, and eleven intermediate federal appellate courts, however, have not yet definitively ruled on this emerging 5th Amendment interpretation issue.\n\nMassachusetts reached the same conclusion as New Jersey did in *Andrews*. *Commonwealth v. Gelfatt*, 11 N.E.3d 605, 615 (Mass. 2014\\). So did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. *United States v. Apple MacPro Comput*., 851 F.3d 238, 248 (3d Cir. 2017\\).\n\nIndiana has held that the 5th Amendment privilege prohibits the government from demanding that someone disclose a password that if disclosed might reveal incriminating information. *Seo v. State*, 148 N.E.3d 952, 958 (Ind. 2020\\). So did Pennsylvania. *Commonwealth v. Davis*, 220 A.3d 534, 550 (Pa. 2019\\). [Utah's Supreme Court](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/10/police-cant-demand-you-reveal-your-phone-passcode-and-then-tell-jury-you-refused) held that the 5th Amendment prohibits forced disclosures of passwords in October of 2021\\. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit also took this position. *In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Mar. 25, 2011*, 670 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2012\\).\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court had not addressed the issue (as of early 2021\\) and there was a split of authority over this issue in Florida's intermediate appellate courts at that time. *Compare Pollard v. State*, 287 So. 3d 649, 651 (Fla. App. 2019\\) and *G.A.Q.L. v. State*, 257 So. 3d 1058, 1062\\-63 (Fla. App. 2018\\) with *State v. Stahl*, 206 So. 3d 124, 136 (Fla. App. 2016\\).\n\nWhat often happens when there is a split of authority between a small number of state supreme courts and intermediate federal appellate courts, like the one present here, but not all that many states and intermediate federal appellate courts (often called \"circuits) have chimed in, is that the U.S. Supreme Court declines to resolve the split until more jurisdictions have considered the issue. Instead, the U.S. Supreme Court allows the law regarding that issue to \"develop\" and guide it in some future case in which the issue will be resolved.\n\nIf the lower appellate courts tend to clearly favor one resolution or the other, the U.S. Supreme Court will often take a case to ratify the clear majority view (although sometimes it contradicts that majority position instead). And, if the split remains fairly even after a large number of jurisdictions of taken a position, the U.S. Supreme Court may then step in an resolve the issue one way or the other.\n\nBut, there are many splits of authority on legal issues in U.S. federal law including constitutional law (probably hundreds) that have remained unresolved for a very long period of time, sometimes for decades, including some which are quite well developed.\n\nAlso, since this issue involves the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution in a very direct way, there is really nothing that Congress can do to resolve the split."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the legal debate surrounding compelled password disclosure and the Fifth Amendment, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The U.S. Supreme Court has definitively ruled that forced disclosure of passwords is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nB) All state courts are required to follow the New Jersey v.

I want to be sure before I actually write the thing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright does not protect ideas, but it does protect expressions of ideas. The idea of a creature looking like a cue of gelatin, that can surround and devour prey is not protected, but the specific description is protected by copyright. You may not use that description, or closely paraphrase it, without permission. If you do, that is copyright infringement.\n\nIn addition, one may not create a derivative work, that is a new work \"based on\" an existing (source) work, without permission (assuming the source is still in copyright). Imitating one monster is probably not enough to make the new work derivative. But if several monsters or characters are used, and their detailed point\\-by\\-point characteristics are imitated, that could well be enough. Using a recognizable major character from a previous works as the protagonist or as a major character will make the new work derivative. Using a clear and detailed setting from a prior work can also make the new work derivative, say setting a story in Minas Tirith from *The Lord of the Rings* or Los Eisliy Port from *Star Wars*.\n\nThe more distinctive details from the source work that are used, and the fewer original details that are added, the better the case that the new work is derivative. There is no clear bright line on what is a derivative work. It is a judgement matter, and will be decided by a court if things get that far.\n\nAlso, in some cases character names are trademarked. Using a trademarked name in such a way that a reader might believe the new work was endorsed or authorized by the makers of the source work may be trademark infringement. \"Gelatinous Cube\" is probably not trademarked (although I have not checked) but I am reasonably sure that \"Gandalf\" is. A disclaimer, noting the trademark owner and saying that the is no affiliation or endorsement can help avoid trademark liability, but it does nothing for copyright issues.\n\nIf a trademarked name is used to advertise or market the new work, that makes the case for infringement stronger.\n\nNote that trademarks are matters of national law. A term trademarked in one country may not be in another. Copyright on the other hand, applies world wide, although the details vary by country.\n\nUsing the basic idea of the Gelatinous Cube, but changing the details and the name, is not likely to be a trademark or copyright infringement, unless so may other details are imitated that the work as a whole is considered derivative."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author wants to include a creature similar to the \"Gelatinous Cube\" from a popular role-playing game in their original novel.

Creating a similar creature with a different name and unique characteristics, while maintaining only the basic concept, is generally acceptable. Copyright doesn't protect ideas, only specific expressions of ideas. \n\nOption A would likely infringe on copyright by using the exact name and closely paraphrasing the original description.

Many states make it illegal to set booby traps; for instance, California makes it a felony in [section 20110 of the Penal Code](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=20001-21000&file=20110). The definition of \"boobytrap\" in the code is \"any concealed or camouflaged device designed to cause great bodily injury when\ntriggered by an action of any unsuspecting person coming across the\ndevice;\" on the face of it, it is definitely not clear that a generic \"there are traps\" sign makes it not a boobytrap (whereas a sign *on* the trap announcing its presence probably would).\n\nIf a trespasser falls victim to a trap, that can be grounds for a successful lawsuit against the homeowner; see *Katko v. Briney* (an Iowa civil case). The duty of care to trespassers is low; there's no general duty to mitigate hazards. However, one part of the duty is generally that one may not lay a trap for trespassers (example: [report from Connecticut Office of Legal Research](http://www.cga.ct.gov/2002/rpt/2002-R-0365.htm))."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner, concerned about potential intruders, sets up various traps on their property and posts warning signs about their presence.

Many states have laws explicitly prohibiting booby traps, such as California's Penal Code section 20110. Even with warning signs, setting traps that can cause injury is often illegal.

It is only recently that SCOTUS has gotten involved in redistricting questions: [here is a summary](https://www.ncsl.org/research/redistricting/redistricting-and-the-supreme-court-the-most-significant-cases.aspx) of leading redistricting rulings. A recurring theme in these rulings has been the Equal Protection Clause, where certain redistricting plans (or non\\-plans) were found to violate that clause (especially ordering a state to redistrict when it refused to do so with the result being that population changes diluted the vote of those living in certain districts).

Such mandates are not common. Indeed I do not recall hearing of any such absolute mandates. But an employer could choose to impose one, and I have heard (and read) discussions of hospitals, for example, requiring COVID\\-19 vaccinations to be taken by employees when available.\n\nIf an employer mandates a vaccination, it is up to the employer to decide when, and if, an exemption is warranted. It is up to the employee to decide whether to comply by accepting the vaccination or refuse at the risk of being fired.\n\nI do not know of any law which would specifically require an employer to grant exemptions in particular circumstances. A law might exist, or be passed, requiring such exemptions.\n\nIf the employee had a particular medical condition which makes a vaccination si9gnificantly more risky for that employee than for an average person, and **if** that condition was considered to be a disability (not all or even most medical conditions are so considered) then the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would require the employer to offer a \"reasonable accommodation\" to the employee, if one is available. Exactly what accommodation is \"reasonable\" is a fact\\-based determination, and would depend on the reason for the mandate, the cost and burden of the accommodation on the employer, and the degree if risk to the employee with and without the accommodation. In some cases no accommodation is found to be \"reasonable\", and in such cases the ADA does not mandate any accommodation at all.\n\nThe ADA generally specifies whet must be done when an employee has \\\\ a disability, but dopes not specify exactly how a disability must be proved. A medical certificate is common, but njot invariable, iof an employer questions the existence o a disability.\n\nThe ADA would not require an exemption for a \"Religious/Philosophical\" objection. Soem state laws protect religious scruples in various particular employment situations. In some but not all states objections on such grounds for vaccinations otherwise required for school attendance are honored. The exact grounds accepted vary from state to state. A specific state would need to be listed for a more specific answer to be given, and I am not aware of any state that has such a requirement for exemption from a private employer's vaccine mandate.\n\n**Addition**: It seems from comments that some employers, such as hospitals and the military, already require vaccinations for some diseases. This seems reasonable to me, and does not change my answer otehrwise."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employer mandates COVID-19 vaccination for all employees.

According to the information provided, if an employer mandates vaccination, it is up to the employer to decide when and if an exemption is warranted, unless specific laws require otherwise. The ADA does not cover religious exemptions, and there is no universal requirement for employers to grant religious exemptions. While some state laws may protect religious objections in certain employment situations, this varies by state and is not a universal rule. Option A is incorrect because automatic exemptions are not required. Option B is not necessarily true, as the employer sets the criteria for exemptions.

It states:\n\n> The term \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United\n>  States\u201d, as used in this title, includes: \n> \n> \n> (1\\) The high seas, any other waters within the admiralty and maritime\n>  jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any\n>  particular State, and any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the\n>  United States or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by\n>  or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory,\n>  District, or possession thereof, when such vessel is within the\n>  admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of\n>  the jurisdiction of any particular State. \n> \n> \n> (2\\) Any vessel registered, licensed, or enrolled under the laws of the\n>  United States, and being on a voyage upon the waters of any of the\n>  Great Lakes, or any of the waters connecting them, or upon the Saint\n>  Lawrence River where the same constitutes the International Boundary\n>  Line. \n> \n> \n> (3\\) Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States,\n>  and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any\n>  place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent\n>  of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the\n>  erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful\n>  building. \n> \n> \n> (4\\) Any island, rock, or key containing deposits of guano, which may,\n>  at the discretion of the President, be considered as appertaining to\n>  the United States. \n> \n> \n> (5\\) Any aircraft belonging in whole or in part to the United States,\n>  or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the\n>  laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, district, or\n>  possession thereof, **while such aircraft is in flight over the high\n>  seas, or over any other waters within the admiralty and maritime\n>  jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any\n>  particular State.** \n> \n> \n> (6\\) Any vehicle used or designed for flight or navigation in space and\n>  on the registry of the United States pursuant to the Treaty on\n>  Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and\n>  Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies and\n>  the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space,\n>  **while that vehicle is in flight, which is from the moment when all external doors are closed on Earth following embarkation until the\n>  moment when one such door is opened on Earth for disembarkation or in\n>  the case of a forced landing, until the competent authorities take\n>  over the responsibility for the vehicle and for persons and property\n>  aboard.**\n> \n> \n> (7\\) Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to\n>  an offense by or against a national of the United States. \n> \n> \n> (8\\) To the extent permitted by international law, any foreign vessel\n>  during a voyage having a scheduled departure from or arrival in the\n>  United States with respect to an offense committed by or against a\n>  national of the United States. \n> \n> \n> (9\\) With respect to offenses committed by or against a national of the\n>  United States as that term is used in section 101 of the Immigration\n>  and Nationality Act\u2014 (A) the premises of United States diplomatic,\n>  consular, military or other United States Government missions or\n>  entities in foreign States, including the buildings, parts of\n>  buildings, and land appurtenant or ancillary thereto or used for\n>  purposes of those missions or entities, irrespective of ownership; and\n>  (B) residences in foreign States and the land appurtenant or ancillary\n>  thereto, irrespective of ownership, used for purposes of those\n>  missions or entities or used by United States personnel assigned to\n>  those missions or entities.

They are not subject to maritime jurisdiction. The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, as defined in 18 USC 7, does not include airports on land. Additionally, law enforcement at international airports is often provided by local authorities (such as county sheriffs or municipal police) in addition to federal agencies like the TSA.

I can do this because I installed the program at work and am not bound by the EULA\". Wrong. Case 2: you are installing software on behalf of a customer. It's not you that is bound by the EULA, it's the customer. Case 3: you work for the company that develops the software and holds the copyright, either fixing bugs or testing the security of the system by trying to crack it. In that case, you have special permission from the copyright holder that overrides whatever restrictions would normally from from the EULA.

In this scenario, the engineer likely has special permissions granted by the copyright holder (their employer) that would override typical EULA restrictions. While the EULA itself is still legally binding in general, the engineer's employment relationship and role in developing/testing the software means they probably have authorizations that go beyond what's stated in the standard EULA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because accepting a EULA as part of job duties doesn't automatically make it non-binding.

See [Texas Department of Housing \\& Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_8m58.pdf) and references cited therein. The idea is that an employer can be liable absent proof of intentional discrimination when a practice disproportionately affects protected classes of individuals, and the practice is not justified by reasonable business considerations. So it would depend on why this particular state of affairs in employment came about.\n\nThere is a test known as the [80% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact#The_80%25_rule) which attempts to quantify the notion of \"under\\-representation\" as evidence of discrimination. This test (not widely respected by the courts these days) might constitute evidence of discrimination, if a protected class is demonstrably under\\-represented. [The current standard](https://www.eeoc.gov//eeoc/meetings/archive/5-16-07/transcript.html) seems to be by comparison to random selection.\n\nIn [EEOC v. Sambo's of Georgia, Inc.](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/530/86/1370384/), 530 F. Supp. 86, the court found that a grooming policy had a disparate impact on members of a religion (Sikhism), and was thus contrary to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, although a requirement to shave does not obviously discriminate on the basis of religion. This points to an important element of a successful disparate impact claim, that there has to be a policy with a causal effect. In the above scenario, there is no proposed policy that has this effect. Note that the burden of proof is on the person suing for relief \u2013 they must have a theory of something the company does that causes this hiring pattern, a practice that is discriminatory.\n\nThe identified policy (whatever it might be) could be justified by a business necessity defense ([Griggs v. Duke Power Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/424/), 401 U.S. 424\\), by showing that the practice has a demonstrable relationship to the requirements of the job. That, b.t.w., would not excuse a racially or religiously discriminatory hiring policy for a factory manufacturing menorahs or kinaras.\n\nIf a company recruiting locally in Boise ID had a 75% black work force, it would be reasonable to suspect that something was up.

The company could potentially face a disparate impact claim due to the significant overrepresentation of Jewish employees compared to the local population. However, for such a claim to be successful, the plaintiff would need to identify a specific company policy or practice that causes this hiring pattern and demonstrate that it's not justified by business necessity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the 80% rule is not automatically applied and is not widely respected by courts. Option B is incorrect because discrimination claims can be based on disparate impact, even without intentional discrimination.

The employee was on paternity leave during the last year of their employment. What is the most likely legal status of this non-compete clause?\n\nA) The clause is fully enforceable, and the employee must wait one year before working for a competitor.\nB) The clause is void due to the employee's paternity leave status.\nC) The clause is enforceable, but the duration is reduced by the time spent on paternity leave.\nD) The clause is likely unenforceable under Ontario law, regardless of the paternity leave.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Non-compete clauses are generally considered unenforceable in Ontario, Canada. The province's courts typically view these clauses as an unreasonable restraint on trade and an individual's right to earn a living. While the paternity leave might be a complicating factor, it's not the primary reason for the clause's unenforceability. The fundamental issue is that such broad non-compete clauses are generally not upheld in Ontario, regardless of the specific circumstances of the employee's departure or leave status.

In the absence of an explicit definition in the contract, the general meaning of \"third party\" applies, which typically refers to entities not party to the agreement or their agents. However, the status of a consultant can be nuanced. If the consultant's contract with Company Y establishes an agency relationship, they might not be considered a third party.

The specific nature of the contractual relationship between Company Y and the consultant is crucial in determining their status. \n\nOption A is incorrect because employment status alone doesn't determine third-party status; agents can include non-employees.

The use of reasonable and moderate force by parents to correct or restrain a child is legally permitted under RCW 9A.16.100. However, healthcare providers may be reluctant to administer a vaccine to an unwilling teenager without additional legal backing, which is why a court order might be necessary in this situation.

Karo*, 468 U.S. (1984\\) (tracking device placed in barrel by authorities violated expectation of privacy).\n\nRFID signals are not \"public\" even if they are not encrypted with a private code because a device, such as the ones identified in the question, is necessary to receive them.\n\n> The Wiretap Act, codified by 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2511, is a federal law\n>  aimed at protecting privacy in communications with other persons.\n>  Typically, when you think of a \"wiretap,\" the first thing that comes\n>  to mind is someone listening to your telephone calls.

This scenario likely violates federal wiretapping laws, specifically the Wiretap Act (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2511). Even though the collection occurs passively in a public space, it still involves intentionally intercepting electronic communications using a device without consent. The expectation of privacy for RFID signals extends beyond what's visually observable in public, as established by cases like Katz v. U.S. and U.S. v. Karo. Additionally, if conducted by law enforcement, this would constitute an illegal search under the 4th Amendment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because public location doesn't negate wiretapping laws for non-observable electronic communications.
