According to the information provided, the outgoing Speaker's term ends at 11:59:59 p.m. on January 2nd. The new Congress traditionally convenes at noon on January 3rd, and the election of the new Speaker is typically the first order of business after some ceremonial procedures.

To be clear, this is not really about the money, but about the principle. I believe the landlord is attempting to take advantage, and many tenants more timid than myself would simply knuckle under and pay. I want to make the landlord understand she won't get away with treating people this way.\n\nThe DPS provides a dispute resolution service which the landlord is proposing to use, if I do not pay up the \u00a3150 she wants to replace the hob. The only circumstances I would pay up, rather than go to the dispute resolution, is if I were exposing myself to some significant risk by choosing the latter. \n\nIOW: is it plausible that the dispute resolution service would hand me a significantly bigger bill than this landlord is demanding? Is it likely that they could turn around and say 'she only asked for \u00a3150, but actually you have to pay her \u00a32000', or something like that? (for reference, the deposit is \u00a31200\\)\n\n\\*\\*Edit: A user asked why I would think that a bill of (say) \u00a32000 is a possibility. As it happens, I *don't* think that such a big bill is a possible consequence of going through the DPS resolution process. I am asking because my partner wants to just pay up and be done with it, because she is afraid of unforeseen consequences. I want to be able to reassure my partner that those fears are unfounded.\n\nThe point is, it commonplace for the DPS to look at the evidence and decide the landlord deserves more than the landlord asked for?\\*\\*\n\n**The background**\n\nI have recently moved out of rented accommodation. I am having a dispute with my landlord over the deposit, which is lodged with the DPS (I checked, it is).\n\nThe dispute is over a gas hob. The hob is controlled by plastic nobs, one of which I broke while cleaning.\n\nMy ex\\-landlord believes that this means the hob is now unsafe and unusable. She wants to replace the whole hob with a new one, and charge us for it.\n\nI think this is absurd, because:\n1\\) The hob was not new when I moved in two years ago, let alone now. Buying a new hob is not mitigating her losses.\n\n**edit: clarification regarding above \\-\\- I'm no lawyer. But it's my understanding that if the hob is indeed broken, I only have to pay what it was worth at the moment before it was broken. If it was only as good as a second hand hob going for e.g. \u00a340, then \u00a340 is what I have to pay. As I said I'm no lawyer, so please advise me if I am mistaken. I also believe, per number 2\\) below, that the hob can be economically repaired in any case**\n\n2\\) I do not accept that there is anything wrong with the hob apart from the absence of one plastic knob which could be easily replaced.\n\nThe landlord is also contending that one of the taps is 'jammed down' and can't be turned. I don't know what she means by that, except that I was able to turn them. One of them was stiffer than the others, but I do not think that is as a result of me removing and replacing the knobs to clean the hob.\n\nI asked the landlady who says the hob is unsafe, and she said 'the gas inspector'. She gave me his mobile number, but not his name or credentials.\n\nI strongly suspect she is getting advice from people who stand to benefit from fitting a new gas hob instead of repairing it. She says that cooker companies have advised her that no\\-one fixes gas hobs because it's too dangerous, which again I believe is ridiculous. A google search in my local area reveals a dozen companies who do this.\n\nOne other thing: the landlady has known for months that the knob was broken because this 'gas inspector' came round and looked at the hob. If it was indeed damaged by my act and unsafe, he would have known that then, and reported it to the landlady. In that case the landlady would have known that I was living with an unsafe appliance, and would have been breaking the law in a pretty serious way by not addressing that problem... right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The landlady is trying it on.**\n\nThe purpose of a deposit is to protect the landlord from being left out of pocket by:\n\n* damage to the property\n* rent arrears\n\n[Reasonable wear and tear does not constitute damage](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/tenancy_deposit_deductions_your_landlord_can_make). It seems unlikely that the stiff tap is as a result of damage.\n\nThe hob is not so clear cut: the landlady could argue that it was damaged, albeit by accident, and the cost of repair taken from your deposit.\n\nIf she insists that the only remedy is to replace the hob, she should make an appropriate deduction to reflect the fact that it is several years old and will be replaced by one that is new (thereby gaining her some value).\n\nIt would be reasonable for you to expect to see the written report from the gas inspector who has condemned the whole hob in that case.\n\nBut I find it hard to believe that:\n\n1. the plastic knob cannot be replaced\n2. doing so would make the hob unsafe, if the knob can be removed for cleaning\n\n> it's my understanding that if the hob is indeed broken, I only have to pay what it was worth at the moment before it was broken.\n\nYour liability is to **return her to the position she would have been in had the damage not occurred**. If that means replacing a removable plastic part instead of the whole hob, that would be a reasonable remedy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant accidentally breaks a plastic knob on a gas hob while cleaning.

In this case, that means replacing the removable plastic part (the knob) rather than the entire hob. The landlord should not profit from the situation by getting a brand new hob to replace an older one. Additionally, replacing just the knob is likely the most reasonable and cost-effective solution. The damage doesn't fall under normal wear and tear as it was accidental, but it also doesn't warrant replacing the entire appliance.

The documentation emphasizes that courts, as a public service, should run at a loss and be supplemented by taxes. It explicitly states that courts making a profit is considered an \"abomination\" and that when public services become sources of revenue, their primary purpose is compromised.

For Bob, while the travel authorization was not an exact repeat performance, it could be considered a reasonable alternative given the circumstances. The Act allows for consideration of \"the nature of the service\" and \"the purpose for which the service was to be performed.\" A court might consider this a reasonable attempt at repeat performance.\n\n2. For Charles, repeat performance is impossible as per section 55(3) of the Act, which states that \"The consumer cannot require repeat performance if completing performance of the service in conformity with the contract is impossible.\" Since the deadline has long passed, it's impossible to complete the original service as contracted.\n\n3.

This is made clear in s 21 of the [Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0108/latest/whole.html#DLM294165), which says \"the occupier...**may** seize and impound any stock trespassing on the land.\" A quick search finds no sections of the Act *requiring* an occupier to impound trespassing cattle. So it seems *Bob is free to send the cattle on their way,* at least under the *Impounding Act.*\n\nHowever, liability for cattle and cars is also covered by the *\"Animals Law Reform Act of 1989\\.\"* The two subsections of *\"[Section 5](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0097/latest/whole.html#DLM191765)\"* of that Act appear to broaden the class of people who could be held liable for damage \u201ccaused by an animal straying onto a highway.\u201d *Neither subsection explicitly mentions the owner.* Instead, both talk about the \"person\" who is liable. The first, s 5(1\\) says the part of the common law that \u201cexcludes or restricts\u201d \u201cthe duty that **a person** might **owe to others to take reasonable care**\u201d to prevent damage no longer applies in New Zealand. The second, s 5(2\\), says a court must determine \"whether **a person** is *liable...for damage* caused by an *animal straying onto a particular highway...*\"\n\nGiven that *Impounding Act* explicitly says \"owner\" not \"person,\" common sense suggests the use of the word \"person\" rather than \"owner\" in the *Animals Law Act of 1989* means that Act allows others besides the owner to be held liable for damages. Whether New Zealand courts agree, and whether they have interpreted the \u201cAnimal Laws Act\u201d in a way that would include Bob is a matter of fact that can only be answered by someone who knows New Zealand law.\n\n**Added: Something fun to read**\n\nLaw professor Robert Ellickson studied how people actually resolve disputes over wandering cattle in Shasta county in northern California.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Animals Law Reform Act of 1989, Section 5, uses the term \"person\" rather than \"owner\" when discussing liability for animals straying onto highways.\n\n2. This wording suggests that liability could extend beyond just the animal's owner.\n\n3. The Act states that a court must determine whether \"a person\" is liable for damage caused by an animal straying onto a highway.\n\n4.

According to the documentation, the existence of a state of emergency does not generally free individuals from their contractual obligations. Unless there is a specific clause in the lease addressing pandemics or states of emergency (which is unlikely), the student would still be obligated to pay the penalty as stated in the lease agreement. The documentation clearly states that changed circumstances, whether due to economic downturn, weather, or disease, do not typically release a person from their contractual responsibilities.

The only thing the snippet does is telling Google's servers when a conversion takes place and that somehow they do some cross\\-site tracking.\n\nIs running the Google Ads snippet something that visitors of my website should consent to, before I do this?\n\nMy assumption for now is that disclosing this in a privacy statement should suffice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are responsible for what data is being processed by your website. When you embed third party components on your website (e.g. iframes, scripts), you are at least jointly responsible with the third party providing these components. You are only responsible for what happens on the website (i.e. what processing is under your control), not for what the third party provider does with collected data on their services. However, note that information will be transferred to Google's servers regardless of whether the visitor has a Google account! The *Fashion ID* case is relevant case law establishing and explaining these points.\n\nSince you are (jointly) responsible, you need a legal basis for collecting personal data through the tracking snippet and sharing it with the third party (here Google). For example, the legal basis could be a *legitimate interest*, or could be *consent*. A legitimate interest requires that you balance this interests against the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject (the site visitor). If the data subject wouldn't reasonably expect this tracking, you cannot rely on a legitimate interest. Consent can always work, except that it is a freely given, informed opt\\-in \u2013 likely unsuitable for conversion tracking. Which legal basis to use is primarily your responsibility.\n\nYou argue that the tracking snippet does not collect personal data. However, this argument is not well supported. Under the GDPR, personal data does not only include directly identifying information such as an email address, but also any information \u201crelating\u201d to an identifiable person. Identification includes the ability to single out someone, e.g. by a browser fingerprint. For purposes of conversion tracking, Google will clearly try to collect data that allows the visitor to be singled out, thus collecting personal data. Furthermore, specific kinds of information are regulated by the ePrivacy directive. This includes \u201ctraffic data\u201d and \u201cinformation stored on a terminal device\u201d, regardless of whether this information is personal data under the GDPR. Under ePrivacy, such information can only be used as strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user (and conversion tracking is not strictly necessary), or when the user gives their consent. Depending on what information is collected by the tracking snippet and on whether you are subject to ePrivacy, you would have to collect consent anyway.\n\nThere is also the issue that Google Ads is an US\\-based service, and transferring data to the US is largely illegal since the 2020 Schrems II ruling. The US do not provide an adequate level of data protection, so that transfers would require additional safeguards. Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for Controller to Controller transfers are not sufficient by itself. Of course those extra safeguards are effectively impossible to implement and no one is doing this correctly, but it's worth considering that there is additional legal risk. Explicit consent can provide a legal basis for transfers even to a country with inadequate protections, but that mechanism is intended for occasional transfers.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n* you have wrongly concluded that no personal data would be involved\n* you are jointly responsible with Google for whatever data is processed by the conversion tracking snippet\n* you need a legal basis for sharing this data with Google\n* legitimate interest may be sufficient, depending on what data is involved (consider ePrivacy) and depending on the result of your legitimate interest balancing test\n* alternatively, you may require every visitors consent to track their conversions \u2013 unlikely to result in good data\n* additionally, such use of Google Ads may run into issues around international transfers due to the Schrems II ruling\n* this kind of stuff is difficult, and no one is really doing this correctly :/"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner wants to use Google Ads for conversion tracking.

In this situation, when the work was short, has been released to others, has limited literary value, transmits unprotected facts relevant to you, relates facts that may also be a matter of public record (the sale anyway), and you aren't trying to profit from the text of the press releases themselves just from the facts that they convey, the case for fair use is pretty decent even though this is a business use.\n\nUltimately, however, to be squeaky clean and avoid litigation, you can link rather than regurgitate the press releases, and can write your own statements about the facts in them from scratch.\n\nThis information is not privileged or trademarked. \n\nIf you didn't sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA) or if they were released to the public, they aren't subject to trade secret protection either.

But even so, they can cause trouble and some expense for the defendant.\n\nIn this case, it seems that the developer, who is also the copyright holder, has granted others the right to read the source code, but not to download it or run it. The developer (whom i will call D) has not asserted that the code successfully performs any particular function, and has not sold or delivered it to any particular customer or user.\n\nNone the less a reader R does download the code, compiles it, and runs the resulting binary, thereby arguably infringing D's copyright. R finds the code not to work as R had expected, and R sues D for damages on an implied warranty theory. Could R win such a suit?\n\nWell this may depend on the particular laws of the country or jurisdiction where R brings suit, and the question does not specify that.,\n\nIn the US one possibly relevant law would be the [Magnuson\\-Moss Warranty Act of 1975](https://www.findlaw.com/consumer/consumer-transactions/warranty-laws-and-the-magnuson-moss-warranty-act-.html) ut this act applies only to \"written warranties on consumer products costing more than $10\\.\" As D makes no charge for the code, and provides no warranty at all, the Act weill not apply to D.\n\nThe page [\"Be Wary of Warranties for Software Design \"](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2018/08/be-wary-of-warranties-for-software-design) from Jones Day discusses the California Commercial Code and the Song\\-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Act imposes an implied waranty if there is any express waranty. The page reads:\n\n> **Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose**  \n> \n> This implied warranty comes into play when the software supplier knows of the buyer's particular purpose for purchasing the software and knows that the buyer is relying on the supplier's skill and judgment to provide suitable software.\n\nSince there is no purchase here, this does not seem to apply.\n\nThe Jones Day page also reads:\n\n> **Implied Warranty of Merchantability**  \n> \n> This implied warranty, as its name suggests, promises that the software meets the standards of performance expected by merchants in the trade. Again, this implied warranty turns on industry standards and practice. Suppliers can disclaim this implied warranty or agree with purchasers to particular terms that will supersede it.\n> \n> \n> **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  \n> \n> Unless prohibited by the Act, the Code allows sellers to disclaim any express and implied warranty. Software suppliers may decide to provide a limited, exclusive, and express warranty (such as meeting a particular specification or industry standard) and then disclaim all other warranties. Disclaimers must be specific and conspicuous; state law and practice provides the important language and format for disclaimers. If the Act applies to a transaction, for example, the disclaimer must say that the goods are sold \"as is\" or \"with all faults.\"\n\nI see no obvious legal theory on which a suit for an implied warranty could be successful against D, but I have no way to know what provisions the law of R's jurisdiction might have.\n\nIncluding a disclaimer such as:\n\n> This code is posted for demonstration and discussion only. No right to download and run it has been granted. It is provided \"as is\".

Now, I have started looking for a job in the new country where LinkedIn profile seems to be a norm and having at least some amount of work experience listed being listed on it an informally known edict for getting a job or at least even an interview. \n\nSo to search for gainful employment, I had to mention in vague terms the technologies used (not mentioning exact algorithm or process), why used the technology (for example, worked on cloud service to scale services), and the fact I led two teams for various purpose there (for example, led a team of 4 for deploying automated solutions). \n\nNow I have been sent (over email as an attachment \\- even though in NDA it is mentioned any notices be sent by formal means i. by personal delivery, ii. overnight courier, iii. telecopy, iv. registered mail) \"cease and desist notice\" saying it blatant breach of non\\-confidentiality agreement and that:\n\n1. Remove all the information related to work from any public or non\\-public websites including any job sites.\n2. Complete removal of all intellectual property, documents, software code and/or any other information related to the work you performed for Company B while being employed with Company A. (...)\n3. Completely stop discussing about the work, our trade secrets, our technological approaches or anything that you performed for us while employed at Company B with any individual or any entity anywhere in the world\n\nThis was sent with a pdf attachment of my LinkedIn profile.\nI was given only 24 hours to respond to it (not enough time to consult any lawyers or such). And there was threatening wording in the lines of:\n`\"You will not receive another cease and desist letter from this office. Should you fail to produce a confirmation in writing within twenty-four (24) hours, a lawsuit against you will be commenced immediately in the County of Santa Clara, California regardless of where or which country you are currently residing and company will pursue maximum penalty for disclosing our competitive and intellectual property information publicly or non-publicly.\"`\nWhich I felt to mean doesn't matter where you go we will be vindictive if need be and make sure you stay silenced. \nI didn't want to antagonize them, comply with what they said and to have my energy rather be directed to sustain myself in a new Country than anything else. So removed all the details from the LinkedIn profile and sent a polite mail saying I removed the reference with pdf of the LinkedIn profile with details removed. \nBut then also get sent another email reply asking me to send a signed letter with compliance with remaining items too in the cease and desist letter including non\\-solicitation of the team (this addendum was not there in the letter at all).\n\nI actually don't want to sign anything further anymore (and more soever 24 hours of an unreasonable deadline suggests they want me to consult a lawyer and do so). \nI would greatly appreciate any advice on:\n\n1. How to protect myself now. What are the steps I should be taking.\n2. This is severely limiting my ability to search for jobs and find gainful employment to sustain myself in a new country.\n3. Leave even finding gainful employment, my mental peace and the constant cloud of legal threat is a bit stressing and taking a toll on my mental health.

Is there any legal recourse I can take that would help me so.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I just wanted to start working to make a living, so didn't pay heed to\n>  it any further.\n\nYou seem to have made the mistake of signing a contract, but not taking the obligations of the contract seriously. In both the US and India a contract is a binding obligation. Of course the laws about what is required and what is forbidden to include in a contract and how a contract may be enforced differ significantly between India and the US. \n\n> Which didn't make sense to me has to how it is enforceable for me as a\n>  resident in India.\n\nYou were in India, but the company was in California. In the contract you agreed that disputes about the contract would be governed by California law. You agreed to it, so you are now bound by this agreement, at least in the eyes of the Californian legal system. However, a Californian court has no power to enforce a legal judgment in India. Once Company B had a judgment against you in a Californian court, [they would have to file suit in an Indian court to enforce the judgment against you](http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/96840/Outsourcing/Outsourcing+Contracts+with+Indian+Suppliers+What+to+Expect+When+Enforcing+US+Customers+Rights+and+Remedies+in+India). \n\nTo me (not a lawyer) it's not clear that a Californian company would go to the trouble of an international lawsuit over the information contained in a resume on a Linkedin page. Just as you would find it inconvenient and expensive to defend yourself in California, the company would find it inconvenient and expensive to enforce judgment in India. There is a caveat here: if company B does obtain a judgment against you in California, and you ever want to work for a US firm again, there may be consequences for you."}, "answer": "Here is a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of the NDA signed by the employee in India for a US-based company?\n\nA) The NDA is completely unenforceable since the employee is based in India and not subject to US laws.\n\nB) The NDA is fully enforceable in India without any additional legal steps required by the US company.\n\nC) The NDA could potentially be enforced, but the US company would need to obtain a judgment in California and then file a separate suit in India to enforce it.\n\nD) The governing law clause makes the NDA automatically enforceable worldwide, regardless of the employee's location.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the NDA specifies California law as governing, a California court cannot directly enforce a judgment in India. As stated in the passage, for the US company to enforce the NDA against an employee in India, they would first need to obtain a judgment in a California court and then file a separate lawsuit in an Indian court to enforce that judgment. This process involves additional legal steps and expenses for the company, making enforcement more challenging but not impossible. Options A and B are incorrect as they oversimplify the situation.

Consequently, minimum wage laws are not engaged even if the professor is not exempt as teachers since he is not being required to do any work.\n\nIn the U.S., employers generally can do this (unless a work contract provides otherwise); in many circumstances, it is called being laid off (though the term has attracted a permanent connotation in parts of North America) or being suspended.\n\nAn indefinite unpaid leave can be considered constructive dismissal if the employer does not reasonably allow the employee to return to work. It may not be constructive dismissal if the unpaid leave is prescribed by binding employer policies or because the employee refuses to work (and the employer allows the employment relationship to continue).

It does not have any particular nuanced meaning.\n\nThe purpose of that presentation is to demonstrate that the requirements for written description in the US go far beyond literal support. That is, even if the claims are replicated in the description, that is not enough to satisfy the written description requirement (or indeed, the enablement or best mode requirements).\n\nIn fact, the presentation you link to includes a nice quote from *In re Kaslow*, 707 F.2d 1366, 217 US PQ 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1983\\):\n\n> The test ... is whether the disclosure of the application as originally filed \n>  reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter, rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language.\n\nLiteral support therefore does not have much place in US law.\n\nHowever, historically, countries inheriting their patent system from the UK had a requirement for fair basis, where the claims had to be fairly based on the description. For example, the now superseded [Patents Act 1949 (UK) s 4(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/87/section/4) provided:\n\n> The claim or claims of a complete specification must relate to a single invention, must be clear and succinct, and **must be fairly based on the matter disclosed in the specification**.\n\nThis was a low bar, and literal support (where the wording of the claims are identical to words in the description) would be sufficient (though not required). This gave rise to the practice of having consistory clauses, where the claims were literally copied into the summary of invention section. However, most (or possibly even all) countries have moved on to a support requirement now. Yet the practice of consistory clauses lives on.\n\nLiteral support also appears in some guise in European law. [Art 123(2\\) EPC](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2016/e/ar123.html) provides:\n\n> The European patent application or European patent may not be amended in such a way that it contains subject\\-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nThis is often imprecisely glossed as a requirement that the wording of an amendment must appear verbatim in the description as originally filed. That is, an amendment is generally allowable if it has literal support in the application (and does not otherwise impermissibly combine embodiments and the like). In practice though, literal support is only one factor for compliance with Art 123(2\\) EPC, and is neither necessary nor sufficient on its own."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In patent law, which of the following statements most accurately describes the concept of \"literal support\" and its significance across different jurisdictions?\n\nA) Literal support is a strict requirement in US patent law, where the exact wording of claims must appear verbatim in the specification to satisfy the written description requirement.\n\nB) In European patent law, literal support is necessary and sufficient on its own to comply with Article 123(2) EPC regarding amendments to patent applications.\n\nC) Literal support refers to the presence of claim language identical to words in the description, but its importance varies across jurisdictions and is generally not sufficient on its own to satisfy modern patent disclosure requirements.\n\nD) The concept of literal support originated from the UK's fair basis requirement and remains a critical aspect of patent law in all countries that inherited the UK patent system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately captures the essence of literal support while acknowledging its varying significance across different patent systems. The passage explains that literal support means the words of the claim are identical to words in the description, but its importance is limited in modern patent law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because US patent law explicitly states that written description requirements go beyond mere literal support, as evidenced by the quote from In re Kaslow.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while literal support is a factor in European patent law for compliance with Article 123(2) EPC, it is neither necessary nor sufficient on its own.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although the concept of literal support has roots in the UK's fair basis requirement, most countries have moved away from this approach, and it is not critical in all countries that inherited the UK patent system."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86794/access-to-information-from-supermarkets", "docs_id": 86794, "title": "Access to information from supermarkets", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a criminal investigation, do the police have access to shopping information / do the police do research that far?\n\nIn case of any police officer requesting data from recently bought products (for example walmart), can they get security camera footage of the time those items were bought?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In addition to compelling a store to produce evidence such as video footage, via a search warrant as described by bdb484, police can request access to information in the possession of such information.

As a precedent, I refer to the [Masterpiece Cakeshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission) decision, which allowed a cake shop to refuse to sell a wedding cake to for a same\\-sex wedding; they weren't forcing the couple to stop being gay. And it's not a civil rights violation, as being unvaccinated is not a protected class.\n\nIs my interpretation reasonable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that is not a \"reasonable\" interpretation of the order, but that's separate from the question of what will be enforced. Focusing on the word of the order,\n\n> No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID\\-19 vaccine by any\n> individual, including an employee or a consumer\n\nWhat does it mean to \"compel\" a person to do something? A court can compel a person to stay in jail for some period of time, and can order the police to use force to enforce that requirement \u2013 that's the classical example of compulsion. Nobody *except* the police can compel a consumer to do anything. All of the words of the order have to be given meaning, and it is not reasonable to say that \"compel\" is limited to \"actions backed up by police action\". The government does not separately compel \"consumers\" and \"employees\" to do things.\n\nIn order to sensibly interpret \"compel\" and \"consumer\", this has to interpreted as including things other than \"pointing a gun at a person\". The only sensible interpretation is one that includes denying service to those who do not comply. In addition, the series of \"Whereas's\" clearly indicate a ban on \"no shots, no service\" conditions. It remains to be seen in court whether this is found to be enforceable (via the \"failure to comply\" clause, exactly analogous to other emergency powers allowing restrictions on gatherings etc. previously)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the interpretation provided in the top answer, which of the following best describes the likely legal impact of Texas Executive Order GA-40 on the American Contract Bridge League's (ACBL) planned vaccination requirement for their national tournament in Austin?\n\nA) The ACBL can proceed with their vaccination requirement as it does not violate the executive order.\n\nB) The ACBL must cancel their vaccination requirement as it clearly violates the executive order's prohibition on compelling vaccination.\n\nC) The ACBL's vaccination requirement would likely be seen as violating the spirit of the executive order, but its enforceability remains uncertain pending court decisions.\n\nD) The ACBL can maintain their vaccination requirement as long as they provide an alternative option for unvaccinated individuals to participate remotely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer suggests that while the original poster's interpretation is not considered \"reasonable,\" the enforceability of the executive order remains uncertain.

The fabricator fails to pay me in the stipulated 30 days. Can I sue the fabricator in Maine, or do I have to file suit in California?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nIn the absence of additional jurisdiction establishing facts like a choice of forum clause in the contract or in person negotiations in Maine, the Maine seller would probably have to sue the California buyer in California.\n\nIf Maine does have jurisdiction to hear the case, for example, due to a choice of forum clause in the contract, the merits of the amount owed could be litigated to judgment in Maine. But, even then, if the buyer only had assets in California, the Maine judgment would have to be recognized in a California court (which is fairly quick, easy, and non\\-discretionary for the California court to do) and then the post\\-judgment collection activities would have to be conducted in courts located in California.\n\nIf the California purchaser went bankrupt, the bankruptcy case would also be in California in all likelihood.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nYou can always sue where the defendant is located, which is also the place of performance of the contract. This has a 100% chance of succeeding as to jurisdiction and venue (and could be done in federal court if one feared being hometowned by local counsel my familiar with California law than your lead Maine counsel).\n\nIn a consumer contract, you must sue where the defendant is located pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and a contrary contractual term is void as contrary to the controlling federal law.\n\nIn a business to business contact, however, the parties may include a choice of forum and choice of law clause in the contract that would be controlling, and the Uniform Commercial Code \"battle of forms\" provisions permit the seller's form to be binding in some circumstances even if that term is not in a document signed by the other side. This would be upheld if the forum had any meaningful connection to either of the parties. (Also, for what it is worth, once there is part performance of the contract due to the delivery of goods, the Uniform Commercial Code's statute of frauds no longer bars enforcement of the contract.)\n\nIn the absence of a choice of forum term in the contract, the analysis in the case of a Maine forum would be to determine whether California company had sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Maine in this transaction to have \"purposefully availed itself\" of the laws of Maine by doing business in Maine. This is a fact rich inquiry in which almost any fact that you can imagine about the transaction could be relevant.\n\nIn this fact pattern, the personal jurisdiction issue is less open and shut, especially if no one affiliated with the buyer has ever been present in the seller's state. The odds of a Maine court determining that it doesn't have jurisdiction are not zero but I'd hesitate to put an exact percentage on it.\n\nThe most factually similar case that I could locate held that Maine courts did not have jurisdiction over a similarly situated purchaser, where a headnote to the case explains that:\n\n> Where only contact between purchaser of spiral staircase and\n> manufacturer\\-seller arose from purchase, there was no indication that\n> purchaser ever set foot in or conducted any business in state, and\n> only affiliating circumstances were that purchaser ordered staircase\n> from manufacturer\\-seller, and he communicated with seller by telephone\n> and mail with respect to that order, district court lacked personal\n> jurisdiction over purchaser in manufacturer\\-seller's action seeking\n> damages from purchaser for breach of contract and conversion after\n> purchaser stopped payment on check for staircase but retained\n> staircase.\n\n*Architectural Woodcraft Co. v. Read*, [464 A.2d 210](https://casetext.com/case/architectural-woodcraft-co-v-read) (Me. 1983\\).\n\nSo, to successfully sue in Maine, one would have to distinguish this binding precedent of Maine's highest court with additional facts showing that the purchaser had a greater connection to the State of Maine than this one did.\n\nAnother worthwhile point to consider is that any determination that Maine did not have jurisdiction would be made very early in the case, with the matter full briefed and ready to rule upon or to call for a hearing upon within perhaps two months of service of process on the defendant. The issue probably gets resolved with a hearing if necessary within six months or so. Litigating jurisdiction is much cheaper than litigating the entire case, and if you lose in Maine you just refile in California (probably with acceptance of service of process by the lawyers who appeared on behalf of the California firm in Maine). As long as you aren't close to the statute of limitations, that isn't a huge deal, even though it is a bump in the road.\n\nAs a practical matter, one reasons that a Maine company might want to sue in California is that it removes one step from the collection process. If the Maine company gets a judgment against the California company in a Maine court (possibly removed to federal court), the judgment entered would then have to be registered in California before it could be enforced if the debtor only has assets in California. California has to recognize the judgment if it was entered with valid personal and subject matter jurisdiction in Maine (under the U.S. Constitution's full faith and credit clause), but it still involves an extra step that requires time and money, and if the debtor only has assets in California, subsequent collection of the transferred California judgment, by garnishment of bank accounts, garnishment of amounts owed to the debtor, placing judgment liens on real property, and using a writ of execution to attach tangible personal property of the judgment debtor and having the seized property sold to pay the debt, as well as service of interrogatories on the debtor regarding where its assets are located, would all have to be done in the California court system or in the federal courts of California.\n\nIf the judgment in Maine was entered by default, the judgment debtor could collaterally attack jurisdiction in the California enforcement proceeding. If the judgment in Maine was entered after the defendant in California contested jurisdiction (which consists of personal jurisdiction authority, service of process, and subject matter jurisdiction of the court in question) in Maine (which is the only way it could contest the merits if the Maine court found that it had jurisdiction over the California firm), however, it could not collaterally attack the Maine Court's jurisdiction in California during the enforcement proceedings.\n\nIn real life, a lawyer and client have to assess the risks and benefits and costs of each approach and decide how to handle it, based in part upon how they think that the defendant will behave in litigation. If the merits are likely to be contested and the defendant is easily collectible, fighting in Maine is more desirable to push for even if it isn't a sure thing. If the merits are a foregone conclusion but collection may be more involved, starting in California may make sense.\n\nAlso, if the merits are undisputed, often the case will end up in a debtor forum bankruptcy case before the judgment obtained in either location can be used to collect that judgment in the California courts. This is because companies that don't pay undisputed debts are usually unable to pay many creditors and not just one in particular.\n\nFurthermore while in theory, this case would present distinct issues of state law and federal law, Maine, like most states, takes the position that its state courts have jurisdiction over essentially all cases over which the U.S. Constitution allows it to assert jurisdiction, so the ultimate analysis pretty much boils down to one under federal constitutional law.\n\nSo, while you look to state court precedents first, those precedents are driven by U.S. Supreme Court precedents that greatly narrow the range of discretion which state courts may exercise in deciding these cases. As a result, the outcome is likely to be reasonably similar in pretty much any combination of two U.S. states, even though it wouldn't be precisely uniform and the determinations are highly amenable to being distinguished factually from each other.\n\nThe substantive law of the case, as opposed to the jurisdictional law, would be governed almost entirely by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code which while it is enacted separately as state law in each state is almost identical in every U.S. state. There might be a difference in the statute of limitations, and there might be civil procedure differences, however (although the civil procedure differences would be muted by the power of either party to remove the case to federal court if the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company based in Maine sells $100,000 worth of steel plates to a fabricator in California.

These are small programs that are run on your machine. By accessing the website you implicitly give permission for this to occur.\n\n(Aside: I'm not aware of any case law on exactly what this implicit authorisation covers. [CFAA case law](https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa) on \"authorised access\" suggests that this is going to be complicated if it ever becomes an issue).\n\nJavascript is supposed to be run within a limited framework which allows the website to control the rendering of the website and track how you use it. So they can track your mouse clicks when the browser window has \"focus\", but not clicks you make when accessing something else.\n\nLike all software, the Javascript programs and the web browser \"interpreter\" that runs them can contain bugs. Javascript has to work on lots of browsers, so its not surprising when things don't always work properly.\n\nComing on to [the CFAA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030), criminal penalties only apply to intentional access.\n\n> 5 (c) intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, causes damage and loss.\n\nSo if a website runs Javascript on your computer with the *intention* of crashing it, that is a crime. However if the crash is inadvertent due to ordinary programming errors then it isn't. In this case it is almost certainly innocent. To prove otherwise you would need to study the code they are sending in detail to see if it is doing something strange and unreasonable."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A user frequently visits a news website to read articles and post comments.

The question of liability only arises when there is some harm done and the court either determines that you are responsible (liable), or not. Until there is harm, there is only a risk. In general, you would be held liable if a child came on to your property, got in the pool, and drown, even if you had signs saying \"Don't get in the pond\". The general rule comes from [R.R. Co. v. Stout](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/84/657/), 84 U.S. 657, that in dealing with hazards that would be attractive to a child of \"tender\" years, you have a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the dangers of the attraction.\n\nWhat constitutes \"reasonable care\" is hard to define, except in the most tautological sense \"the care that a reasonable person would have\". Case law in your state may specifically address the question. As a general rule, you should get legal advice from lawyers, not from city engineers. The doctrine may be spelled out as more specific rule such as in Washington ([Schneider v. Seattle](https://casetext.com/case/schneider-v-seattle), 24 Wn. App. 251, the requirements are\n\n> that a condition or instrumentality existed which was dangerous in\n> itself and likely to or probably would cause injury to those coming\n> into contact with it;\n> \n> \n> that it was attractive or enticing to young children;\n> \n> \n> that plaintiff was incapable, by reason of his age, of comprehending\n> the danger involved;\n> \n> \n> that it was left unguarded and exposed at a place where children of\n> tender years were accustomed to resort, for play or amusement or\n> gratification of youthful curiosity; and\n> \n> \n> that it was reasonably practicable and feasible either to prevent\n> access by children or else to render it innocuous without obstructing\n> any reasonable purpose or use for which it was intended.\n\nThe record does not indicate the details of the injury, except that the area was in fact fenced with a cyclone fence. There may have been a gap in the fence, or the child (who was 10\\) may simply have climbed the fence (the latter seems likely since the ruling also invokes questions of contributory negligence \u2013 \"even if the child is held to be within the attractive nuisance doctrine, the question of his contributory negligence, in the light of all relevant circumstances, will have to be decided\"). FYI the final outcome was that the plaintiff lost the case.\n\nA gate is less of a precaution against trespass than an impenetrable fence, especially if the fence is solid wood and makes it impossible for the child to see the attractive nuisance. A locked gate a more of a precaution than an unlocked gate. Your reference to illegal means of entry is a bit misguided, because the doctrine say that adult trespassing standard don't apply to children, therefore you cannot assume that the child will always act in compliance with the law. A latch at the top of a 6 ft. tall gate cannot be defeated by a \"tender\" child wandering in a curious manner (unlike a latch at 3 ft.).\n\nAs I say, you have to research the specific liability states and case law of your state."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of attractive nuisance doctrine and pond liability, which of the following actions would likely provide the LEAST protection against potential liability for a homeowner with a backyard pond?\n\nA) Installing a 6-foot tall solid wood fence around the entire property with no gates\nB) Placing multiple visible warning signs around the pond area\nC) Installing a 6-foot tall chain-link fence with a locked gate\nD) Removing all fencing and relying solely on \"No Trespassing\" signs\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A provides the strongest physical barrier and visual obstruction, making it difficult for children to see or access the pond. \nOption B, while not a physical barrier, demonstrates an attempt to warn of danger. \nOption C provides a physical barrier with controlled access. \nOption D, however, offers no physical protection and relies solely on signage, which is insufficient under the attractive nuisance doctrine, especially for young children who may not understand or heed such warnings.

And alienated Americans resonate with this, as they have with so many fashions, fads and creeds, that that's what they wished themselves to really be.)\n\nIs it possible to (unlawfully) lie about one's race given the current US census race categories? In other words, has the 2018 govt. any power to prosecute for lying about race on a census? \n\nIf there are no lies, what purpose is served by having such a definition?  \n\nWhat's the value (who benefits) in making what used to be a fuzzy but more or less factual item about national and ethnic origins into a belief\\-based one, in effect making race into a religion.\n\n---\n\nThis is a spin\\-off of [What are the political benefits and inversely disadvantages, if any, of individually self\\-identifying as \u201cwhite\u201d in the United States?](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/31431/what-are-the-political-benefits-and-inversely-disadvantages-if-any-of-individu/31432?noredirect=1#comment116022_31432).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nYou can be prosecuted for lying about race on the census, but it takes some pretty specific and narrow conditions and isn't a concern for the vast majority of people.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nThere are two analytically distinct questions.\n\nThe first is whether you can lie on the census about race. The answer is \"yes\", you can lie on the census about race. You would do so by providing an answer that is insincere, which is to say, an answer that is not consistent with how you self\\-identify. If you believe yourself to be and identify as African\\-American, for example, but answer \"Alaska Native\" not because you identify as an Alaska Native, but because you want to screw with the census, then you have lied about race on the census.\n\nSimilar issues of sincerity have been addressed [by the U.S. Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/380/163/case.html) in the context of the much higher stakes issue of conscientious objector status for someone seeking to avoid the draft. A [2014 law review article](https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/questioning-sincerity-the-role-of-the-courts-after-hobby-lobby/) explores how courts test sincerity claims in practice.\n\nThe second is whether you can be prosecuted about lying on the census.\n\nThere is indeed a law that makes lying on a census form a crime.\n\nRefusing to answer either the short Census form or the longer American Community Survey form is a violation of federal law (Title 13, United States Code, Section 221\\). Refusing to answer is punishable by a fine of $100, while giving false answers carries a fine of up to $500\\. (As a practical matter, the Census says fines of up to $5,000 can be imposed under Title 18, Section 3571\\.)\n\nSo, again, the answer is \"yes\" you can be prosecuted for lying on the census, but due to the obligation of the census to maintain confidentiality, knowing that a crime was committed or proving that you lied would be hard unless you did something to waive that right to confidentiality.\n\nStill, the person about whom the confidential information is maintained by the census can waive this confidentiality. 13 USC 9(a)(3\\).\n\nIn practice, a prosecution for lying about race on the census would probably be most viable if, for example, you did a TV interview or posted a YouTube video in which you took video of yourself filling in the race item on your census form with an answer while stating that you didn't self\\-identify as this race but were just screwing with the government, and then showed yourself submitting that form.\n\nThus, while the prohibition against lying on the census about race is virtually toothless, it does have enough teeth to make it possible to prosecuted someone who openly and publicly defies the requirement to be truthful on the census and admits to doing so, which can still have some utility in discouraging some kinds of open revolts calculated at undermining the integrity of the census.\n\nAlso, even if you don't \"admit\" that you are insincere that isn't the end of the analysis. They can't dispute your self\\-identification with biological facts, but they can dispute that your answer is a sincere self\\-identification with either your own confession to the contrary or with circumstantial evidence that indicates you are lying (e.g. you fill out every other form before and after with a different answer and have a known animosity towards the census). If a jury believed beyond a reasonable doubt based upon circumstantial evidence that your answer was not sincere, it could find your testimony to be not credible and convict you anyway.\n\n> If there are no lies, what purpose is served by having such a\n> definition?\n\nThe vast majority of people, facing no negative consequences for telling the truth, if they have cooperated enough to fill out the form at all, will try to fill it out consistently with the instructions. And, a significant share of all census responses are provided by government employees whose duty and purpose is to try to provide a correct answer.\n\nAlso, most people comply with the laws even in the face of zero enforcement. For example, [it has been more than 40 years since the last person was prosecuted for not filling out a census form](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jan/09/us-census-bureau/americans-must-answer-us-census-bureau-survey-law-/), even though it is crime not to do so, in part, because most people try to obey the law. And, compliance with the burden of filling out a census form is quite high.\n\n> What's the value (who benefits) in making what used to be a fuzzy but\n> more or less factual item about national and ethnic origins into a\n> belief\\-based one, in effect making race into a religion.\n\nMany countries (not the U.S.) have a religion question in their census as well, and this isn't problematic where it is done, or in surveys asking questions about religion, although being clear on definitions can be important (e.g. in the case of a religious v. ancestral or ethnic v. self\\-identified definition of who is a Jew).\n\nI strongly suspect that the differences in how people respond to the question arising from a national or ethnic origin definition, and a definition based upon self\\-identification, are negligible at the statistical level. A century or so from now, when census records are made public, it will be possible to confirm this definitively by examining how the same individual's race was reported on half a dozen or more successive census forms. In non\\-census contexts, this shift in the definition has not produced any statistically meaningful differences in how people respond.\n\nAlso, if anything, the new definition based on self\\-identification may be more useful to researchers who are trying to examine socially coherent communities, and it makes the race data slightly more comparable to data, for example, on religion and on sexual orientation (from non\\-census sources)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding lying about race on the U.S. Census?\n\nA) It is impossible to lie about race on the Census due to the self-identification policy.\n\nB) Lying about race on the Census is a federal crime, but prosecution is extremely unlikely unless specific conditions are met.\n\nC) The Census Bureau actively investigates and prosecutes all cases of suspected racial misidentification.\n\nD) Individuals can freely choose any racial category without legal consequences, regardless of their sincere self-identification.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While lying on the Census is indeed a federal crime, the information provided indicates that prosecution for lying about race is extremely unlikely and would only occur under very specific circumstances. This is due to the Census Bureau's confidentiality requirements and the difficulty in proving that someone's racial self-identification is insincere.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it is possible to lie about race by providing an answer that is inconsistent with one's sincere self-identification.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the Census Bureau does not actively investigate or prosecute all suspected cases of racial misidentification.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while individuals have flexibility in choosing their racial category, this choice should be based on sincere self-identification.

Sarah loses her re-election bid and claims the revelation has permanently damaged her career. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences for John?\n\nA) John is protected from a defamation lawsuit only if he can prove he didn't intend to harm Sarah's career.\nB) John may be liable for defamation if Sarah can prove the article caused her to lose the election.\nC) John is protected from a defamation lawsuit, but may be liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nD) John is absolutely protected from a defamation lawsuit if the information about the DUI conviction is true.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Truth is an absolute defense to defamation lawsuits in the United States. Even if the truthful information results in career damage or reputational harm, the author is protected from a defamation lawsuit if the published information is factual. \n\nOption A is incorrect because John's intent is irrelevant if the information is true. \n\nOption B is false because the truth protects John regardless of the consequences to Sarah's career. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while there might be other potential legal issues in some circumstances (like breach of confidentiality), intentional infliction of emotional distress typically requires extreme and outrageous conduct, which publishing truthful information generally is not.\n\nThis question tests understanding of defamation law, the importance of truth as a defense, and the distinction between defamation and other potential legal issues related to publishing information."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36049/is-it-okay-to-commercially-use-youtube-videos-that-have-creative-commons-license", "docs_id": 36049, "title": "Is it okay to commercially use Youtube videos that have creative commons license?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes, more than one youtube channel upload the same video under different licenses.

For example, many pieces of software offer different commercial and non\\-commercial versions that may be functionally the same or different.\n\nIf you want to reuse the material and one of the licences allows your use case then you must abide by that licence. The fact that your usage breaches a different licence is irrelevant."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A popular educational video is uploaded to YouTube by multiple users. User A uploads it with a \"Standard YouTube License,\" while User B uploads the same video under \"Creative Commons.\" You want to use a 30-second clip from this video in your own YouTube content. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal use of this clip?\n\nA) You must obtain permission from both User A and User B before using the clip.\nB) You can freely use the clip without any restrictions since it's available under Creative Commons on one channel.\nC) You can use the clip under the terms of the Creative Commons license, regardless of the Standard YouTube License on the other channel.\nD) You cannot use the clip at all due to the conflicting licenses on different channels.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When copyrighted material is available under multiple licenses, you can choose to use it under the terms of any of those licenses, provided that the licensor had the right to offer that license. In this case, the Creative Commons license allows for more permissive use. The fact that the same content is also available under a more restrictive license (Standard YouTube License) on another channel does not negate your ability to use it under the terms of the Creative Commons license. However, you must still adhere to the specific terms of the Creative Commons license, which may include attribution or other requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because you don't need permission from both users; the Creative Commons license already grants permission for certain uses.\nOption B is incorrect because while you can use the clip, you must still follow the terms of the Creative Commons license, which may have some restrictions.\nOption D is incorrect because the conflicting licenses don't make the content unusable; you can choose to follow the more permissive license."}}
