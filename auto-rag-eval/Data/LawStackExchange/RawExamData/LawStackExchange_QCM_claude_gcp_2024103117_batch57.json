I am reading specifically in New York law and it seems unambiguous that the only damages allowed for a claim of negligent misrepresentation are \"out\\-of\\-pocket losses\" which can be zero even when a plaintiff has suffered measurable losses.\n\n**Consider this scenario:** Bob is an excavator. Alice approaches Bob and says that she has buried $1000 in a particular location. They enter a contract for Alice to provide the location of the money, Bob to excavate it, and the parties to split it 50/50\\.

It doesn't seem equitable for a tort to be recognized but offer no real remedy.\n\nI'm wondering if the problem is that I'm looking at a tort when there is another cause of action under contract law? Contract law appears to offer \"benefit of the bargain\" as a remedy for breach of contract, and in this scenario it does look like Alice breached the contract ... except that the breach was a negligent misrepresentation. Is there a cause of action for that under contract law even though it's explicitly a cause of action in tort?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What misrepresentation?\n-----------------------\n\nAlice said she buried the money there. That the money is not there now is not evidence that she didn\u2019t. it\u2019s evidence that something happened to it between then and now.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s not let the flawed example obscure the question.

There are torts that are similar like deceit and negligent misstatement.\n\nThe link provided is talking about fraud \\- the criminal equivalent of deceit (and the word fraud is often used when technically it\u2019s talking about the tort of deceit). The out\\-of\\-pocket rule applies to torts so Bob can recover his losses. Personal time invested is not an out\\-of\\-pocket loss as it represents an opportunity cost, so, Bob cannot recover what he or his excavator might have earned instead. He can recover his fuel costs and depreciation on the excavator as those are \u201creal\u201d out of pocket expenses. If Bob had been an employee of a plaintiff company, they could recover his wages but not what they might have sold his time for. That\u2019s just how it is with torts.\n\nMisrepresentation is a different beast. It\u2019s a contractural claim so the damages are the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d, in this case $500\\. However, this is only available if the misrepresentation was fraudulent (Alice knew the money wasn\u2019t there), Alice had no reasonable grounds for believing the statement to be true, or at the court\u2019s discretion. Further Bob must prove that it was this statement that caused him to enter the contract and that he would not have entered it otherwise.\n\nAlice\u2019s statement may give Bob more than one cause of action and it\u2019s up to him which he chooses to pursue. If he spent less than $500 on fuel he stands to get more with a misrepresentation claim but if his out of pockets are more than $500 he\u2019s better off with a negligent misstatement claim.

Yes such an arrangement can be made legally.\n2. Owners cannot be **evicted**. But a contract could provide for regular payments (rent) and that the right to use/occupy the property is contingent on those payments being made. It could even provide that if the payments are sufficiently behind, that a portion of that party's share would be forfeit to cover the amount due. It should probably not reduce the minor partner's equity by more than the amount of payments due. All this would need to be spelled out in detail in your contract.\n3. Property tax is a joint obligation of the owners. Your contract could specify who pays it or from what source it would be paid. One option would be for each party to pay into a fund (similar to an escrow account for a mortgage) from which the tax would be paid. Your contract should specify such an arrangement if it is wanted, and what happens if one party does not pay or is late. The government will not care about your agreement, they will want their tax money in full and on time, or they will charge penalties and/or seize the property, in accord with local law. Either owner could be liable for the full amount.\n4. Much the same applies to insurance, and to any utilities. All are joint obligations of the owners, and a contract may specify who is to pay and how, or how payment is to be divided, and what happens if someone does not pay as agreed.\n5. If you want the right to sell off parts of your share, your contract should cover this, and what notification , if any, is required. It may be that the law will require you to get your partner's consent, I am not sure. Will any new owner become a party to the contract? If so that probably needs the consent of existing parties but it may be possible to specify that such consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld\".\n\nI strongly suggest that you discuss with your partner in detail what options you both want, or are willing to agree to. Be sure that you have a \"meeting of the minds\". Having done that, take it to a local lawyer with knowledge of both real\\-estate law and partnership law, and ask that lawyer to draft a contract that implements your desires, as closely as the local law allows.

There is no contemplation that their presence will prevent the opponents from attacking in order to show mercy on their compatriots. Instead, the POWs are being used to deceive the enemy's automated systems that the attacking force is friendly despite the implausibility of that given their actions.\n\nIt is really more analogous to forcing a prisoner to write a misleading letter or make a misleading phone call, while under duress.\n\nWhile the use of fraud and deception in warfare may be dishonorable, usually actual war crimes involving POWs entail mistreatment of a POW or putting a POW in harm's way (even if presenting only a risk of death or injury).\n\nAlso, of course, much of the Geneva Convention's requirements regarding the treatment of POWs is a treaty imposed obligation, binding morally because both combatants at one point consented to it, rather than necessarily being a universal and mandatorily applicable component of customary international law. The fact that the Geneva Convention might be violated in some detail, if true, doesn't automatically make it a war crime in this context.\n\nIn the same vein, the Geneva Conventions make a distinction between the treatment of uniformed and non\\-uniformed combatants, but this distinction, established by a treaty agreed to by many nations, is not necessarily inherently relevant to determining if something is a war crime in a war with a non\\-signatory. It is a provision that relies of cultural meaning that is shared by the treaty signatories, but may not make sense vis\\-a\\-vis non\\-human sentient aliens.\n\nIn the same vein, one wouldn't think that in a war with intelligent dragons, the fact that the dragons were or were not wearing uniforms, when dragons customarily fight naked, was significant, unless the dragon nation agreed to the Geneva Conventions in a duly ratified treaty.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of interstellar warfare involving humans and alien species, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the application of the Geneva Conventions and the concept of war crimes?\n\nA) The Geneva Conventions automatically apply to all sentient alien species, and using captured alien combatants to bypass biometric security systems is definitively a war crime.\n\nB) The use of captured alien combatants to deceive enemy automated systems is equivalent to using human shields and is always considered a war crime under international law.\n\nC) The applicability of the Geneva Conventions to alien species is unclear, and the use of captured combatants for deception rather than as shields complicates the determination of whether it constitutes a war crime.\n\nD) Interstellar warfare is exempt from all Earth-based international laws and conventions, so the concept of war crimes does not apply in conflicts with alien species.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the complexity and ambiguity of applying Earth-based international laws to interstellar conflicts. The passage highlights that there is no clear moral consensus on whether sentient aliens are entitled to \"human rights,\" and the Geneva Conventions were created with human conflicts in mind. Additionally, using captured combatants for deception (as in the story) is different from using them as human shields, which further complicates the issue. The answer acknowledges that the applicability of the Geneva Conventions in this context is unclear and that the specific use of captives for deception rather than as shields makes it difficult to definitively classify the action as a war crime.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes the automatic application of the Geneva Conventions to alien species, which is not established. Option B is incorrect because it equates the use of captives for deception with human shields, which the passage distinguishes as different scenarios.

The characters (as art) are also copyrighted. If you have someone creating unauthorized derivative works (fan art), you don't get \"better\" rights than they do (which is approximately none). There are companies that do not object to fan art until they see it being used to generate a separate revenue stream from which they derive no benefit. \n\nThe copyright symbol is generally irrelevant for works in the USA published after 1989\\. All creative works of original authorship are copyrighted by rule, unless specifically exempt (e.g., works of the US government).

The program, Amped FIVE, was used for the drone footage. To do this, Amped FIVE employs interpolation algorithms. Because of this, a dispute broke out between the prosecution and defense. These debates ranged from what is an interpolation, to whether the program added colors. James Armstrong, the senior forensic imaging specialist responsible for producing these enhanced videos, was brought in the courtroom to explain the process. What followed was truly interesting.\n\nMy main concern was with how the defense went about justifying why the drone footage should not have been used. I admit I do not understand court procedures and several things had me scratching my head. I would like to preface this by saying I understand it is the job of the defense to protect Kyle Rittenhouse. However, I felt did not make the best case.\n\nWhen questioned about the algorithm, on multiple occasions the defense would ask Mr. Armstrong how the interpolation worked. However, every time he was asked, he could only provide them with what kind of interpolation was used. He admitted that he did not understand how it was programmed. And why would he? Interpolation is an incredibly complex process that requires advanced mathematics and computer science. Not only that but, companies purposely do not disclose this information to prevent people from reverse\\-engineering their products. These questions could only be answered by a computer scientist or mathematician who worked on the program. So why wasn't one brought in? Also, because of his ignorance, wasn't a majority of the questioning a waste of time?\n\nAnother problem arose when the defense was trying to explain interpolation, they used an example that oversimplified the concept so much that it seemed to no longer make sense. The red, purple, and blue pixel example was very flawed in how it was presented. I believe the example wouldn't even work for the nearest neighbor because it would not have turned the pixels in the middle purple. Although this was a poor example, the judge used this as a basis for his understanding of interpolation which worked in the favor of the defense. Also, the defense kept trying to make Mr. Armstrong admit things he did not feel comfortable with because of his lack of knowledge. They asked the same question about adding colors repeatedly and he could never answer. And the language they use like \"add\" and \"manipulate\" implies that the enhanced footage was deceptively altered to give the prosecution an advantage. Because of this, they tried to argue that the video was unreliable. Ironically, the defense submitted evidence that was altered similarly.\n\nLastly, why was a peer\\-reviewed process using an industry\\-standard program not allowed to be used? I am aware that the judge said the burden of proof is on the prosecution but didn't they already prove that the footage was perfectly suitable for use in the trial? The prosecution asked Mr. Armstrong whether the procedures were acceptable for forensic imaging.\n\nI guess to sum everything up, why wasn't this handled better by both the defense and prosecution. I felt like the discussion went nowhere and all parties were incredibly ignorant.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The defense has an opportunity to question the witness the prosecution had called to provide foundation for the evidence, and in this case the defense's perspective is that the prosecution was trying to introduce evidence that they had improperly digitally manipulated. Part of their questioning was trying to figure out how the witness had manipulated the image prior to offering it as evidence. It's the prosecution's burden to prove that the evidence they are offering is accurate, the defense's purpose in asking the witness questions he could not answer is to try to prove to the judge that the prosecution has not laid proper foundation for the evidence because it has been manipulated from its original form in a way the prosecution cannot explain or justify as remaining fair and accurate to the events captured by the original footage.\n\nThis case in particular had a lot of video evidence, and most of these issues were handled in *motions in limine* before the trial started. However, the drone evidence in question was dropped at the prosecutor's office after the trial started, so the prosecution did not really have time to hire and *voir dire* an expert witness on Amped 5 (keeping in mind that the defense similarly had little time to review and account for the new evidence in the middle of trial). Since the defense in this case were cross\\-examining the witness, they have some leeway to present an argument with their questioning like they chose to do with the red/blue pixel drawings.

By developing the code in a \"clean room\" environment without access to the original source code, the developer ensures they are not directly copying the previous work. Additionally, documenting the development process provides evidence that the code was created independently.

His discussion make it seem like AFA has reported correctly that the Alabama judiciary is taking a principled stand against the SCOTUS's decision in Obergefell.

If he thinks the probate judges are bound to deny marriage certificates to same sex couples, why is he concurring to dismiss, instead of dissenting?

I wouldn't even know what an answer to that question would look like.\n\nThere are many guiding principles of interpretation, the starting place of which is to attempt to implement the intent of the legislature (something known as the \"[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule_(law))\" of statutory interpretation in English common law) as expressed in the language of the statute to the extent that no other stronger interpretive principles apply.\n\nBut, basically, it is a problem to be worked out on a case by case basis in cases addressing alleged ambiguities in the meaning of a particular part of a particular statue. Most of the time, there is no ambiguity and so it isn't even recognized as an issue. What is ambiguous is frequently impossible to tell on the face of a statute until you are presented with facts in a case that create a context in which the meaning of a particular phrase or word or grammatical construction is unclear.\n\nStatutory interpretation is a bottom up process in a legal system like India's, not a top down process. Questions arise one case at a time and bubble to the top, the issues aren't foreseen and resolved in advance.\n\nSome of the other canons of interpretation which are buried in case law are to construe statutes in a way that makes them constitutional, to assume that there is not an intent to displace common law rules unless the text or comprehensive nature of a statute suggests otherwise, to give meaning of every part of the statute, to avoid absurd interpretations, and to consider legislative history when the proper interpretation is unclear.\n\nUltimately, statutory interpretation is not a mechanical problem like the order of operations in a mathematics equation. It requires a judge to employ good judgment and common sense to reach an interpretation that makes sense in the relevant context.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements best describes the approach to statutory interpretation in India?\n\nA) Statutory interpretation in India is primarily governed by a comprehensive set of rules found in the Indian Penal Code.\n\nB) The General Clauses Act of 1897 provides all the necessary guidelines for interpreting laws in India, leaving no room for ambiguity.\n\nC) Statutory interpretation in India is a bottom-up process, relying on case-by-case analysis and various interpretive principles developed through case law.\n\nD) India has a settled, top-down approach to statutory interpretation that is uniformly applied to all laws without consideration of context.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation indicates that statutory interpretation in India is not governed by a single comprehensive set of rules, but rather relies on a combination of some interpretive statutes (like the General Clauses Act) and, more importantly, case law. The process is described as \"bottom-up,\" where questions of interpretation arise one case at a time and are resolved based on specific contexts. Various principles of interpretation, such as the Golden Rule and other canons, are applied as needed. The answer emphasizes that this is not a mechanical process but requires judges to use good judgment and common sense in context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Indian Penal Code is not mentioned as a primary source for rules of interpretation. Option B is wrong because while the General Clauses Act provides some guidelines, it is not comprehensive or the sole source. Option D is incorrect as the process is explicitly described as bottom-up, not top-down, and considers context rather than being uniformly applied."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37463/is-revoking-citizenship-for-affiliation-with-a-terrorist-group-a-violation-of-in", "docs_id": 37463, "title": "Is revoking citizenship for affiliation with a terrorist group a violation of international law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In two very notable recent cases, [Hoda Muthana of the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/middleeast/isis-bride-hoda-muthana.html) and [Shamima Begum of the UK](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47299907) were stripped of their citizenships by their respective countries of origin while attempting to return after leaving years earlier to join ISIS.

Generally speaking, it is harder to find a legal grounds for disregarding the free exercise of religion than it is to find a legal basis to regulate otherwise free speech.\n\nFor example, commercial speech is subject to more rigorous regulation than private political and educational speech, which is why there are no private businesses taking anti\\-vax positions in their advertising.\n\nThe theory is that courts are not in a good position to make general determinations of the truth of policy positions or statements about general truths as opposed to what happened in a particular transaction or occurrence. This is in part because a ruling by the right court at the right time can preclude the correctness of its determination from being revisited indefinitely and from time to time, accepted conventional wisdom and scientific consensus at one time are revealed later on to have been wrong with more discussion and investigation. I think that this is unlikely to be the case in the vaccination area, but the whole point of the First Amendment's protection of these kinds of issues is that we can't know in advance what will continue to be widely accepted and what will turn out to be mistaken. \n\nBut, if someone in a medical diagnosis and treatment profession (e.g. M.D., D.O., physician's assistant, or nurse), were to advise a patient in a capacity as a medical care provider not to vaccinate, and as a result that person's child got sick from a disease that vaccination could have prevented, there probably would be medical malpractice liability.\n\nA somewhat similar issue arises when health insurance companies or government agencies set rules on providing care. In those cases, it isn't uncommon to have a physician or other medical professional placed on a committee or in an office such as medical director, with that person making the call and exposed to liability although not in the same way as a treating medical professional. A [case about a month ago](https://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/2019/03/these-practices-by-former-health.html) found malpractice by an insurance company's medical director (the company was United Health) to be a huge liability for both the medical director and the insurance company.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of anti-vaccination advocacy in the United States?\n\nA) Anti-vaccination advocacy is illegal and can always be sued as medical malpractice.\nB) Anti-vaccination advocacy is fully protected by the First Amendment and can never be challenged legally.\nC) Anti-vaccination advocacy is generally protected as free speech, but medical professionals giving individualized advice against vaccination may be liable for malpractice.\nD) Anti-vaccination advocacy is only protected when it stems from religious beliefs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage indicates that general anti-vaccination advocacy is typically protected under the First Amendment as free speech, especially when it's presented as educational or political communication. However, the text also mentions that if a medical professional (such as a doctor or nurse) advises a specific patient against vaccination in their capacity as a healthcare provider, and this results in harm, they could be liable for medical malpractice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because anti-vaccination advocacy is not universally illegal or always subject to lawsuits. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while anti-vaccination advocacy is generally protected, there are exceptions, particularly for medical professionals giving individualized advice.\n\nOption D is too narrow.

To clarify on the comparison to the Court of Cassation, though:\n\nA trial court is generally limited to considering the facts that are properly introduced by the parties, though a court may also take \"judicial notice\" of certain facts that are highly unlikely to be disputed.\n\nOn review, courts of appeal are generally limited to facts supported by the evidence in the trial\\-court record, though they may also take judicial notice of other facts.

But \\-\\- just as with legal determinations \\-\\- those reviews can happen with varying levels of deference.\n\nFor instance, if a case is tried to a jury, an appellate court will be exceedingly deferential to the jury's factual determinations, on the theory that the jury is best positioned to evaluate the evidence, gauge credibility, make reasonable inferences, etc. A judge who makes a factual determination based on in\\-court testimony will enjoy a similar measure of deference.\n\nBut if a court makes a factual determination based only on documents submitted in support of a motion, or otherwise lacks an opportunity to evaluate a witness in person, the appellate court will be more open to different interpretations of the evidence.\n\nLegal determinations are likewise subject to varying levels of deference.\n\nAt one end is the abuse\\-of\\-discretion standard. If a trial court determines that evidence is admissible or inadmissible, for instance, an appellate court will apply the abuse\\-of\\-discretion standard, which (to oversimplify) asks not whether the ruling was incorrect under the controlling law, but whether the ruling was reached without regard to the controlling law.\n\nOn the other end is *de novo* review, in which the appellate court gives virtually no deference to the trial court and undertakes its own independent legal analysis.\n\nPerhaps even more deferential is plain\\-error review, which asks (to oversimplify) whether the trial court's error is so apparent that it barely needs to be debated.

According to the information provided, only 14 states in the United States have laws that allow for the seizure of weapons from mentally unstable individuals under \"extreme risk protection orders\" (ERPOs). These states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all states require individuals to surrender firearms due to involuntary hospitalization. Option C is incorrect as there is no federal law that universally prohibits individuals with a history of mental illness from owning firearms.

Given that there are may IDE's around and that they all pretty much do the same thing and have very similar interfaces, I'm sure that the functionality alone cannot be copyrightable.\n\nI love the way Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE looks and feels. I'm referring to Visual Studio Desktop (not Visual Studio Code). I would like my program to look and feel the same, if not identically, at least very close.\nMy program would have nothing in common with Microsoft's product except for how it visually looks.\n\nTo be more precise, I'm interested in knowing if copying any of the following is permitted by copyright law :\n\n* Program layout : where various \"sub panels or plugins or widgets\" are positioned on screen.\n* Colors : specific shades of various colors and combinations there of, color palettes etc...\n* Fonts, however in this case, a user might obtain a font license for personal use, and configure the program to use that specific font, but it would be nice to integrate it.\n* Look and feel of various User Interface elements for example buttons are rectangles with text, an optional image, they have a specific width and height, a specific border size and color. Panels top bar have text on the far left, a specific fill pattern in the middle and on the right there is the \"pin\" button, and the \"close widget/panel\" button; the program editor / text editor visually highlights text with specific rectangles, and transparency patters.\n\nThe question is : How far can I go in copying the user interface before it becomes copyright infringement ?\n\nI'm asking because I've seen around many programs that emulate Visual Studio's look and feel, when opening them, a normal user would struggle to tell the difference.\n\nP.S.: I assume the answer is probably no, I can't copy everything and get away with it.\n\nHowever, how much can be copied before it becomes copyright infringement ?\n\n**Related question** :\nGiven the nature of the program I want to create, and the fact that it can be configured i.e.: its look and feel as well as graphical behavior can be changed in the settings menu; Would creating a program with a different default look and feel that can be configured manually to look exactly the same as Visual Studio be allowed (in copyright terms) ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\n**Functionality** in general is not protected by copyright, although it may in some cases be protected by a patent. As the question noted, there are many IDEs and creating another one generally similar to those is not a violation of anyone's IP rights.\n\nThe \"look and feel\" of a piece of software has been held by US courts to be protected by copyright.\n\n*Broderbund Software. Inc., v. Unison World, Inc.*, 648 F. Supp. 1127 (N.D. Cal. 1986\\), was a relativcly early case in which the visual display elements of a software program were held to be protected by copyright. In the decision it is said that;\n\n> On the \u201cChoose a Font\u201d screen, no mechanical or practical factor compelled \\[defendant] to use those exact words (\u201cChoose a Font\u201d). He could have written: \u201cSelect a Font,\u201d or \u201cIndicate a Typeface Preference,\u201d or \u201cWhich Type Style Do You Prefer,\u201d or any combination of these terms. . . .The bottom line is that the designer of any program that performed the same functions as \u201cPrint Shop\u201d had available a wide range of expression governed predominantly by artistic and not utilitarian considerations.\n\nAnother relevant early case was *Digital Communications Associates, Inc. v. Softklone Distributing Corp.*, 659 F.Supp. 449 (N.D. Ga. 1987\\). In this case, the Defendant \"oftklone intentionally set out to \"clone\" or copy the functionality and interface of the popular program *Crosstalk XVI* (I was a user of thwt program many years ago). The court wrote:\n\n> In the instant case, however, the arrange\\- ment of the status screen involves consider\\- able stylistic creativity and authorship above and beyond the ideas embodied in the status screen. It cannot be said that the idea of the status screen, i.e., using two symbol commands to change the operations of the computer program and reflecting that fact on a screen listing the computer program\u2019s parameters/commands with their operative values, could not have been expressed in a large variety of ways. The defendants have never contended that they could not have arranged the parameters/commands in a wide variety of patterns without hampering the operation of their program.\n\nand found copyright infringement on that basis.\n\nSection 310 of [*Copyrightable Authorship:\nWhat Can Be Registered*](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf) by the US Copyright office, says:\n\n> The U.S. Copyright Office will not consider the so\\-called \u201clook and feel\u201d of a work. Invoking a work\u2019s \u201cfeel\u201d is not a viable substitute for an objective analysis of the work\u2019s fixed and creative elements. See 4 MELVILLE \\& DAVID NIMMER, *NIMMER ON Copyright* \u00a7\n> 13\\.03\\[A]\\[1]\\[c] (2013\\) (criticizing the use of \u201cfeel\u201d as a \u201cwholly amorphous referent\u201d that \u201cmerely invites an abdication of analysis\u201d).\n\nThe question asks:\n\n> How far can I go in copying the user interface before it becomes copyright infringement ?\n\nThere is no clear bright line on this matter. The more one copies interface elements and choices from a specific source, the stronger the case for infringement is. Using elements and choices that have become common industry practice in multiple works froim multiple developers and companies is probably safe. Clearly and extensively imitating the visual appearance and interface of a single specific work of software might well be infringement.\n\nOne would be wise to consult a lawyer with experience in copyright law, and specifically \"look and feel\" issues, beforign publishing such a work of software.\n\nThis issue is discussed extensively in [*Look And Feel In Computer Software*](https://www.computerlaw.com/articles/look-and-feel-in-computer-software) (1993\\) by Jack Russo \\& Jamie Nafziger, published by Computerlaw Group LLP, which seems to be a law firm specializing in computer law.\n\n[*The Law of Look and Feel*](https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/90_529.pdf) by Peter Lee (Professor of Law and Chancellor\u2019s Fellow, University of California, Davis.) \\& Madhavi Sunder (Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of Law, University of California, Davis.) is a 60\\-page law review article dealing with this topic. There is far more detail in these publications (and many others to be found on the net) than I can summarize in an SE answer.\n\nConfigurable Interfaces\n-----------------------\n\nThe question asks whether the use of a configurable interface which could, but does not by default, imitate an existing interface would be infringement.\n\nI have not been able to find any case on point, or any discussion in a reliable source of this issue. Therefore, I am going to speculate.\n\nIf there is a single choice between overall \"themes\" or \"shells\" and one of them imitates the interface from a protected program without permission, that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped with that interface. It might or might not be infringement, depending on the details, as discussed above.\n\nIf there are many settings, but the program is shipped with instructions advising a combination of settings that imitate another interface (or the developer or distributor provides such advice to users), that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration. If the developer provides a few preset configuration files which control these interface settings, and one such file results in settings that imitate another interface, that would also probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration.\n\nIf there are many settings and there is no particular guidance or advice to a user on what combination to use, nor any predefined settings file, but users must discover (if they choose) a group of settings which imitate another interface, that is probably not infringement.\n\nI repeat that this section of the answer is based on general principals, but not on specific case law, nor on specific legal scholarship, and a court faced with this issue might rule otherwise.

This could be viewed legally as equivalent to shipping with that interface.\n\nOption D, while not directly implementing the copied interface, provides specific instructions to achieve it.

If the judge has to rule about his or herself, they will refer to themselves as \"The Court\" i.e. It is the opinion of the Court... which can be read as \"It is my opinion\"\n\nThe Jury must first be sworn in as they assess guilt... usually (Bench Trials, i.e. the Judge also does the jury's job are also possible, and the decision to one is the right of the Defendant. It's often referred to as refusing such a right.)\n\nAs the Prosecution is making the case and because you cannot defend against something without knowing what you're being accused of, the Prosecution will make the first opening remarks, followed by the Defense\\*.\n\nSince the Prosecution must go first so the defense can properly defend against the charges, the Prosecution gets to call it's witnesses first. Each witness is direct examined, then cross\\-examined (there is also a period of re\\-direct and re\\-cross). Each level can only ask questions related to those brought up in the prior questioning line (Cross can only ask questions about direct. Re\\-Direct can only ask about Cross. Re\\-Cross can only ask about Re\\-Direct).\n\nAfter all prosecution witnesses are called, the defense calls its witnesses and the order is held in the same manner (direct then cross).\n\nAfter this, both sides make closing remarks, and the defense will go first (they have had time to prepare remarks, as this basically sums up their defense. Given that it just happened, it's fresher in the jury's mind, so the Prosection will get the final closing remarks to drive his points home and answer the Defense's arguments.\n\nThis is followed by the Judge giving the Jury the final instructions, and the jury is sent to deliberate the guilt or innocense of the defendant. When they finish this, they will read their verdict.\n\n\\*Note that in the United States and most other Common Law or adversarial court systems, it is the right of the Defendant to not testify to anything... up to and including calling no witnesses and offering no rebuttal to his case... this normally doesn't happen as the prosecution needs to show some evidence in pre\\-trial that their accusations have merit and they aren't just accusing defendant because they do not like their face... there is a point in the trial where the defense may ask the judge to close the case because the Prosecution hasn't proven a damn thing (Right after the Prosecution rests), though the judge rarely carries the motion.

This is not what's at question here. At question here is the arrangement in which public IPs are masked by presenting traffic to site operators as appearing to originate from the veneer IPs of the VPN operators.\n\nThis allows (for example) users in a country A to route their traffic through a commercial VPN operator in a country B and access services in country B which are restricted to users from country A. This can be used to subvert both intellectual property restrictions on traffic and legal restrictions that site operators attempt to enforce by geography\\-based restrictions.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem that it would not be impossible to track all veneer IPs and identify them as such publicly. So a knee\\-jerk response to this question might be \"there is no need for such a law.\" However, while it may be possible to track all IPs used by a commercial operator of a VPN which engages *exclusively* in VPN business, it is not possible to track all IPs dedicated to VPN business by an operator which has many other forms of business.\n\nSo, for example, NordVPN's IPs can be identified as belonging to NordVPN, but IBM's or Google's IPs cannot be identified as used exclusively in their VPN business.\n\nSince there is a public policy interest (mentioned in the 3rd paragraph of this question) in knowing which IPs are VPN veneer IPs, Congress may decide to require commercial VPN operators to register those veneer IPs in a way which would make them clearly distinguishable from non\\-veneer IPs used by the same entities.\n\nWould that be constitutional? More specifically, is there any case law which may be relevant to deciding whether this would be constitutional?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a law would be constitutional\n----------------------------------\n\nThe US Congress could decide to require VPN providers to register the IPs that they provide to VPN customers. The use of such techniques would almost surely be considered \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and so Congress would have power under the Commerce Clause of the constitution to legislate concerning it.\n\nThere would clearly be a rational basis for such a law \\-\\- the question outlines such a basis. This is not an area subject to strict scrutiny. None of the previously established limits on the commerce power (and there are few) would seem to apply.\n\nState laws on this topic would probably be preempted by the *dormant commerce clause* if Congress does not act, and clearly preempted if Congress does act, unless Congress explicitly permits concurrent legislation.\n\nWhether Congress **should** act on this matter is a policy question not on topic on Law.se. Whether Congress **will** act is speculation. I can only say that I am not aware of any widespread demand for such action, or any proposed bills, on the topic.\n\nHowever, there is US caselaw to the effect that anonymous speech (or other communication) is protected by the First Amendment , and that laws effectively banning anonymous speech are not acceptable.

The proposed law would likely be constitutional under the Commerce Clause, as VPN services involve interstate and foreign commerce. The Commerce Clause gives Congress broad authority to regulate such activities. Additionally, state laws on this topic would likely be preempted by the dormant commerce clause, which prevents states from unduly burdening interstate commerce in areas where Congress has not explicitly legislated.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while there is case law protecting anonymous speech, the proposed law doesn't ban anonymity outright and there are other methods of anonymizing online activity.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment wouldn't allow states to enact conflicting laws in this case, as the dormant commerce clause would likely preempt such state actions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because regulating VPN services falls well within Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, given the interstate and international nature of internet communications."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19879/make-check-payble-to-contractor-or-contractors-firm", "docs_id": 19879, "title": "Make check payble to contractor or contractor&#39;s firm?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our condo association wants to hire a local firm to clean our gutters.

These bases now lie there, waiting for someone to discover them.\n\nMy question is: who becomes the owner of the ancient alien bases once they're are discovered? Is it the person or country that discovered them, the Antarctic Treaty signatories, or the aliens themselves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Antarctic Treaty doesn't establish ownership or sovereignty\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle IV of the [Antarctic Treaty](https://documents.ats.aq/ats/treaty_original.pdf) makes clear that the Treaty is *not* a renunciation by any contracting party of any basis of claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica. And \"\\[n]o acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica.\"\n\nSo, while the Antarctic Treaty establishes an arrangement for cooperative shared use of the areas, it is not about sovereignty or ownership.\n\nTerritorial claims\n------------------\n\nThere are (were) however [territorial claims to various areas of Antarctica](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/law-and-treaty/history/antarctic-territorial-claims/). These have not been resolved at international law.\n\nWho owns the centre of the earth?\n---------------------------------\n\nA traditional common\\-law property rule is that ownership extends to the center of the earth (see generally, John G. Sprankling, \"[Owning the Center of the Earth](https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/facultyarticles/131/)\"). Sprankling notes that this was never taken literally until after it was introduced by Blackstone and argues that its time is near an end. But in any case, I think the correct starting point is that the owner of the surface owns what's underneath, at least to an extent.\n\nWho owns the alien bases, and what would that mean?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nApplying Earth law, ownership of the alien bases would be disputed among those nations who are willing to assert territorial claims to the surface under which the alien bases are found. However, if these bases are cultural heritage property (which their age suggests they might be), the 1970 [UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property](https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural) could prevent the import, export, or transfer of any of the material from the bases. The \"owning\" country (if that is ever resolved) might have obligations under international law to preserve the bases. Further, if the dispute over the property results in armed conflict, the competing states could have obligations under the [1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict](https://en.unesco.org/protecting-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-convention) to avoid damaging the cultural property.\n\nIs Earth law the applicable law?\n--------------------------------\n\nIf we take this hypothetical at face value, it implies we are not alone and in relationship with other extra\\-terrestrial culture(s).

Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.\n\nDoes this mean that the courts can/will *never* challenge \"decision to prosecute\"?\n\n(Again, I am interested in **theory** and **logic** more than practicality).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A sufficient explanation would be that the ticketed driver was caught and the unticketed driver was not because the officer was already responding to a situation. Had the officer caught the unticketed driver, he would have ticketed him for the same offense. Courts would accept that it would be impossible for the officer to deal with both offenses at the same time.\n\nSelective enforcement is done properly when the prosecutor evaluates the risk verses reward of perusing a criminal prosecution against an individual based on the evidence, the nature of the crime, and the likely\\-hood of a conviction if it goes to trial. For example, while using illict substances is a crime, the government will usually only prosecute on that charge if they find your use while in possession with intent to sell (or in connection to another crime). In this instant, the high school stoner is not going to be as instrumental in the case as the dealer, who can lead to suppliers if he cooperates OR is removed from distributing in his territory if he does not.\n\nIf the stoner is picked up on a minor offense and carrying a small amount on his person, the police might arrest him for the crime but agree to not press charges if he gives them information to who the dealer who sold him the substance is. Again, the risk here is putting a small time criminal into jail at cost of society, when society would benefit more if that cell was housing the bigger fish (a criminal record can prevent getting certain jobs, which will more likely turn stoner high schooler into jobless loser, which would be a drain on public welfare in and of itself, and that's not including the possibility that joining in drug trafficking as a seller would fix his lack of income).\n\nConversely, in cases such as espionage, the death penalty is on the books but is rarely pursued in favor of lesser sentences. Here, the pay off is that they dangle the death penalty over the spies head unless he tells them about all his spying activities, which benefits the spy agency in filling in security gaps and potentially finding more spies.\n\nThe use of lighter charges in exchange for a guilty plea is also favored as trials are costly. If a criminal pleads guilty to a crime that the government has them dead to rights for, the prosecution will reward them with lighter offenses for saving their office the price tag of a full blown trial.\n\nAll this is on condition that selective enforcement is not used as a basis of discrimination, which is illegal for the prosecutors to do.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes a valid reason for selective enforcement in the criminal justice system?\n\nA) Prosecuting only individuals of a certain race or ethnicity to maintain cultural norms\nB) Focusing resources on prosecuting larger-scale criminals while offering plea deals to minor offenders\nC) Randomly selecting a percentage of offenders to prosecute to save time and money\nD) Always prosecuting every single offense, regardless of severity or circumstances\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B correctly describes a valid approach to selective enforcement.

This is commonly started by the crewman of the vessel who spots the body shouting \"Man overboard\" once... which triggers every crewman on the deck to also shout the same thing exactly once regardless of if they can see the man who is overboard (The idea is that the call is so all crew on the deck are not announcing the sighting but responding that they know there's an emergency situation in progress... and to muster to the appropriate situations). The boat's helmsman or pilot will then proceed to maneuver to recover the body in the water and bring it onboard the boat, (if traveling by sail, to then as soon as possible transfer to a motor powered vessel or to land which ever is quicker).\n\nAdditionally, should the boat have radio communication, the situation should trigger a mayday communication which will alert other vessels, regardless of purpose and local emergency services to the situation, with GPS tracking aiding all responders. Typically while underway at sea or in large bodies of water, all operators of watercraft are required to respond, regardless of actual purpose on the water (recall the famous \"Miracle on the Hudson\" incident where New York Ferry Operators were the actual first responders to get ALL passengers and crew off the crashed plane to land, where EMS and police services were waiting to deal with the survivors). Most boating licenses these days require a basic understanding of duties with maritime safety and if you come upon a situation while underway, you are a first responder automatically.\n\nRemove the question of water and say that there is person who you are unsure of if they are alive or dead on dry land. Under law, you cannot be held liable for anything you do in the course of saving a life so long as you are acting within your competency to do so, and do not take actions you are not licensed to do as part of training, oversight, and regulations dictate, you cannot be sued for medical injuries inflicted on someone in the course of saving their life (called \"Life over Limb\"... that if the only way to save an unconscious person from death is to amputate a limb, you're not liable for cutting off the limb in question, so long as you are trained to do this. To a lesser extreme example, if CPR is performed right, you will break the victims ribs... since it's a question of keeping the person alive, the temporary pain and handicap of broken ribs is seen as acceptable).\n\nAs a lifeguard (for pools, I wasn't certified for \"wilderness lifeguarding\" but the differences in this respect were minimum) your first thing to do when getting in the water to fish out a swimmer in distress was to get them back to the pool deck before life efforts could occur (there are a few times where you had to start the life saving efforts in water, but I can count them on one hand, and one of those incidents was only after confirming your victim was conscious and even then you still were moving to get them out of the water asap... it's just asap would be a little bit longer. We also weren't trained to pronounce death. If it was so serious that CPR starts, you do not stop unless another guard or EMS relieve you.).\n\nIn these situations, there is proper evidence gathering procedures that will be used to establish what happened. For example, the first responders will be fingerprinted and prints in the areas touched for life saving efforts will be noted as part of the evidence. Additionally, paramedics, EMS and first responders will often alert police to any items of note they saw around the victim that were disturbed in the process of life saving efforts. The police may collect evidence from you to rule you out as a suspect (by showing the evidence on the body was consistent with applied life saving techniques) and to identify evidence not related to you at all (a pink fiber on the body that doesn't match any of your clothes means the body came into contact with the fibers from another source).\n\nThis also establishes \"Chain of Custody\" when you call the body in and stay with it and allow minimum contact with it (many larger ships will store the body in a locked room to keep crew and passenger contact to a minimum). Either way, so long as you tell the police everything you did in rescue and recovery, this isn't tampering with evidence on the face of it. If something that is inconsistent with your story comes up, it's not necessarily incriminating either... in the heat of the moment in a rescue and recovery effort, tunnel vision can form and you aren't expect to recall everything you did. Police should know this and understand that you were cooperating in what for most of the world is an unusual situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A recreational boater discovers a floating body in a river.

The boater should:\n\n1. Retrieve the body: This is part of proper maritime rescue and recovery procedures, even if the person is deceased.\n2. Secure it on board: This preserves potential evidence and follows the \"chain of custody\" principle.\n3. Initiate a mayday call: This alerts other vessels and emergency services to the situation.\n4. Proceed to shore: This allows for the quickest handover to proper authorities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it goes against maritime protocol to leave a body in the water when it can be safely retrieved.\n\nOption C is insufficient as it doesn't involve the crucial step of body retrieval and could result in loss of evidence.\n\nOption D is also insufficient and could lead to loss of evidence or further movement of the body downstream.\n\nThe key principle here is that in maritime situations, boaters are considered first responders and are expected to take active steps in rescue or recovery operations.

If you signed a contract with bank A with a certain interest rate, bank A can sell that contract to bank B, but neither A nor B can change the terms (e.g. increase the interest charge). There might be some sketchy clause in the contract that you did sign which they think allows that to change the terms unilaterally under some condition (e.g. \"we reserve the right to sell thig contract to a third parts who may increase the interest by X amount\"), but such a clause would most likely violate law recarding unlawful acts in car sales (example from [Washington state](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.70.180)).
