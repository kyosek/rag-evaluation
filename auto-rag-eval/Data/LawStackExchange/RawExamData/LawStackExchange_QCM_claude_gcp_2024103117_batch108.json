What would happen if a woman got a D\\&E abortion outside of the state? Could she still possibly be sued? Does she have to be a resident of Arkansas to be sued?\n2. According to the article, this law will probably be challenged in court. Is it in effect yet?

Legislation takes effect 90 days after sine die adjournment unless there is an emergency or enactment clause. If a relevant provision of the law is struck down as unconstitutional, any suit dependent on the provision would be dismissed.\n\nResidency is not relevant, what is relevant is being subject to Arkansas jurisdiction, meaning \"being in Arkansas\". A non\\-resident traveling to Arkansas could not have a forbidden procedure in Arkansas, and an Arkansas resident can have a procedure allowed elsewhere if they are elsewhere. A spouse would not be able to get an injunction if, for instance, the wife traveled to Washington state for the procedure, because Arkansas courts have no jurisdiction over Washington state.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has previously taken action against companies engaging in such behavior.

One of my music tracks was licensed by a major Hollywood studio, and used in the trailer campaign for a major motion picture, so it received a lot of exposure online. On YouTube it received 21 million views. \n\nA person running a YouTube channel, with a Ukrainian address, ripped my music track from the internet, and synced it to their own video. I found it, and used the YouTube procedure to issue a copyright takedown notice. YouTube asked for proof that the music track is mine, I supplied that proof to them, YouTube accepted my proof, and took the infringing video down. \n\nSubsequently the owner of the video, in addition to sending me multiple abusive emails, has challenged my takedown notice using YouTube's counter notification process. YouTube have now sent me this notification:\n\n\"We have received the attached counter notification in response to a complaint that you filed with us. We're providing you with the counter notification and await evidence (in no more than 10 business days) that you've filed an action seeking a court order against the counter notifier to restrain the allegedly infringing activity. In most cases, such evidence would include a lawsuit against the uploader who filed the counter notification, which names the specific YouTube URL(s) at issue. If we do not receive notice from you, we may reinstate the material to YouTube.\"\n\nYouTube also included this statement from the owner of the infringing video in the counter\\-notification:\n\n\"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good\\-faith belief that the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located or, if my address is outside the United States, the judicial district in which YouTube is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.\"\n\nQUESTION 1\nSo it seems to me, that the video owner has said he will accept the jurisdiction of YouTube, which is the state of Californa So I don't have to try and bring a legal case in the Ukraine, which would be virtually impossible anyway. I could take action in California, which would likely be sufficient for YouTube to uphold my claim, keep the video offline, and uphold the copyright strike that I lodged. Is this correct, that I can take action in California and YouTube will accept that validity, because of the statement the copyright infringer has made about accepting that jurisdiction? \n\nQUESTION 2\nIf the answer to QUESTION 1 is yes, court action could be taken in California because the infringing party has stated he will accept that jurisdiction, is it then possible to inexpensively take the necessary court action that will satisfy YouTube's requirement for having \"filed an action seeking a court order against the counter notifier to restrain the allegedly infringing activity\". Would a small claims court action do the trick? I understand YouTube would be in the jurisdiction of San Monteo for small claims. Does anyone know\na) How much that would cost?\nb) Would the action be accepted by the San Monteo small claims court, if lodged by a company based in the UK?\nc) Would the small claims court accept a case against a defendant in the Ukraine, given the defendant already said they would accept the jurisdiction of the courts in YouTube's location?\nOn the San Monteo small claims court website I looked for an email address for someone to ask these questions to, but couldn't find one.\nThanks!\nR.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not obvious what the answer is. There are two fundamental questions \u2013 what will Youtube do in response to a particular action, and how can you put an end to the infringement? Youtube's response is driven by federal law, [17 USC 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512). There is some danger to Youtube that you could sue them for contributory infringement, and this law specifies the conditions under which they can be immunized against such a suit. Referring to the stage of the DMCA take down process that you are at, they will put the material back up\n\n> unless its designated agent first receives notice from the person who\n>  submitted the notification under subsection (c)(1\\)(C) that such person\n>  has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber\n>  from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the\n>  service provider\u2019s system or network.\n\nAs a prelude to filing such an action, the infringer must file\n\n> a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of\n>  Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address\n>  is located, or if the subscriber\u2019s address is outside of the United\n>  States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be\n>  found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the\n>  person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1\\)(C) or an\n>  agent of such person\n\nObserve that the person has to consent to *federal* jurisdiction, not state jurisdiction. \n\nSmall claims court is a state court (copyright small claims court does not yet exist). Under [28 USC 1338](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1338), \"No State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, or copyrights\". For the most part, [federal law preempts state law](http://ftp.documation.com/references/ABA10a/PDfs/1_1.pdf), but that guide might point to something about your case (an added right) that overcomes federal preemption. Supposing that that is the case, you might file a suit in state court over that added right: then, it is literally true that you \"filed an action seeking a court order to restrain\".\n\nYou could also just go ahead and file an action in [state court](http://copyrightsandcampaigns.blogspot.com/2009/08/can-you-sue-in-state-small-claims-court.html), because sometimes the court just does what it thinks is right, even if it doesn't have jurisdiction. Even if the suit is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, you will have \"filed an action seeking a court order to restrain\". However, Youtube may not be impressed, the way they would be if you picked Federal District Court.\n\nAt this point, your options (for getting the material taken down) require filing a suit against the infringer. You can file an infringement suit in the UK, but the material will probably be restored on Youtube until they eventually receive a court order demanding that the material be taken down. You can file a suit right now in the relevant federal court in California and notify Youtube, and they should leave the material taken down. Since you are not suing Youtube in small claims court and the infringer is also not in California, you could not sue in small claims court (*somebody* has to be in California) unless you are suing Youtube (and will lose because they cannot be sued, per safe harbor rules).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here is a multi-part exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based music creator finds their copyrighted work used without permission on YouTube by a user in Ukraine.

You can use all material in the public domain freely, as well as material that has an appropriate license. This is a [handy chart](http://fogbugz/default.asp?329677#2285982) of what is public domain in the US. If this is confusing, consult your lawyer. (I don't know what's in the NOW corpus, or whether it has old historical records.)\n\nIf the material you want to use is under copyright, you need to see if there is a license attached that allows general use. Many sites offer such licenses (typically a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license), and you need to read them to see if your use is allowed by the license. (You should look for \\-NC in the license description, which means the material may not be used commercially.) If in doubt, consult your lawyer.\n\nIf you can find the copyright holders, and there is no general license, you can always write to them, explain what you want, and ask about a license. This will probably cost some money.\n\nFinally, your use of these sentences might qualify as [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) if this is in the US. Fair use is on a case\\-by\\-case basis, so there's no sharp dividing line, but there are guidelines. If you're taking a relatively few number of sentences (compared to the size of the corpus) and using them as examples rather than for their meaning, it's more likely it would be held to be fair use.

This provision establishes that all German merchant ships form a unified fleet, similar to the concept of a merchant marine in other countries.

Even though the death was caused by a police officer (not one of the robbers), all participants in the robbery could be charged with murder under this law. This interpretation aligns with the case mentioned in the question, where teenagers were charged for a death caused by a police officer during their robbery.\n\nOptions A and B, while related to deaths during a felony, involve direct actions by the perpetrators.

For one thing, a ToS is probably not binding on the user based on a contract of adhesion such as \"by using this site you agree to...\". A specific act, such as clicking a checkbox that defaults to clicked or activating an \"I accept the terms\" button is probably required to make a ToS binding on the user.\n\nBut a host must do more that obtain an agreement to its ToS. Once it has actual knowledge of illegal content, a host must take action to remove or disable it, or else it may be liable as if it had posted the content itself.\n\nIt also depends what kind of \"something illegal\" is involved. The most common form is perhaps content that allegedly infringes copyright.\n\n### Safe Harbor\n\nIn the EU Article 14 of the EU [Directive on electronic commerce (Directive 2000/31/EC)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0031&from=EN) will apply (note that being a directive, rather than a regulation, 2000/31/EC) depends on implementation in national law, which may vary from one country to another.\n\nArticle 14 reads:\n\n> Hosting\n> \n> \n> 1. Where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service provider is not liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that:\n> \n> \n> (a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.\n> \n> \n> 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply when the recipient of the service is acting under the authority or the control of the provider.\n> 3. This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with Member States' legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement, nor does it affect the possibility for Member States of establishing procedures governing the removal or disabling of access to information.\n\nArticle 14 means that when a host obtains actual knowledge of infringing or otherwise illegal content, the host must promptly delete that content or disable access to it. Such knowledge could come via a takedown notice.\n\nAccording to the page [\"Copyright infringement and remedies in Germany\"](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cef58d76-21a2-4071-9abd-05b001388494):\n\n> One of the main situations refers to platform operators. Once they have been informed about a specific infringement on their platform, they are required to remove the specific infringing content and to implement measures in order to prevent future violations.\n\nSee also the Wikipedia article [\"Notice and Take down\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_and_take_down#European_Union) which discusses Article 14, and points out that it does not define a specific notice and take down procedure, unlike the US provisions of 17 USC 512 (which includes the DMCA notice and take down procedure, and the related Safe Harbor provisions). Since Article 14 clearly envisages some sort of notice procedure, but not specific procedure has been defined in the laws of most EU member states, including Germany, some people use the US DMCA notice format, as describesd in [this article](https://se-legal.de/intellectual-property-lawyer-in-germany/dmca-takedown-notice-in-germany-legal-advice/?lang=en). Such a notice may serve to give a German host \"actual knowledge\" and impose liability if the host fails to respond promptly.\n\nThere have been recent legal cases which affect the procedures in such cases, as reported in [\"Copyright 'safe harbours' for service providers need to be consistent\"](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/copyright-safe-harbours-for-service-providers-reform) from Pinsent Masons and [\"Germany: Time To Hit Pause: Copyright Infringement On User Generated Platforms \u2013 When Is The Platform Provider Liable For Damages?\"](https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/190122-copyright-infringement.html) from Morrison \\& Foerster LLP.\n\nThe Morrison \\& Foerster article reads:\n\n> Previous rulings by the CJEU have addressed both the application of the safe harbor principle set out in the EU E\\-Commerce Directive1 that shields hosting providers from liability for hosted unlawful third\\-party content of which they have no actual knowledge and, separately, the extent of infringement of copyright by hosting of, or linking to, copyright infringing third\\-party content under the EU Copyright Directive. But it is still unclear under which conditions the providers of the various online platforms that store and make available user\\-generated content, can rely on the safe harbor privilege applying to hosting providers to avoid liability, or whether they must not only take down the infringing content when they obtain knowledge of such content but also compensate the rightsholders of such content for damages for copyright infringement.\n\nThe Pinsent Masons article reads:\n\n> \\[A] ruling last year by a German court has highlighted an anomaly in the way 'safe harbour' protections ISPs enjoy under EU law apply in the case of copyright enforcement. It has confirmed that applications for blocking orders and injunctive relief are treated differently, despite the economic effect of those measures being the same.\n> \n> \n> The safe harbour protections stem from the EU's E\\-Commerce Directive. That legislation prohibits service providers from being put under any general obligation to monitor for illegal activity by users of their service.\n> \n> \n> In addition, where the service providers are mere conduits to infringing activity by others, they cannot be held liable for that activity unless and until they obtain 'actual knowledge' of the activity. At that stage, a service provider must act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information if they are not to be held liable themselves for infringement.\n> \n> \n> However, EU copyright law cuts into these 'safe harbour' protections. It makes clear that rights holders can apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe copyright.\n> \n> \n> In Germany, however, changes made to the Telemedia Act in October 2017 have spurred debate over the admissibility and the requirements of blocking injunctions.\n\n### Other unlawful content\n\nOther sorts of illegal content are possible, such as neo\\-Nazi propaganda and Child Pornography, which are criminal under German law. In theory Article 14 applies to such content as well as to alleged copyright infringements. But since these are serious crimes, the degree of promptness expected from a host will probably be greater.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA hosting provider will need, at the least, to respond to notices alleging copyright infringement or other illegal content, and provide an address to which such notices can be sent. A host might do well to implement the full DMCA takedown procedure. ToS provisions will not provide a shield against liability after a notice is sent to the host.\n\nA host may be required to block future access by those whose previous uploads have been found to be unlawful. This may require soem sort of log\\-in procedure.\n\nThus a simple ToS provision, as described in the question, particularly in the absence of any log\\-in mechanism, and of any enforcement of the ToS provisions, will not be enough to shield the host from liability for unlawful content posted by users.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner in Germany wants to set up a file-sharing service where users can upload and share files without creating accounts.

Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC requires hosts to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to illegal content once they have actual knowledge of it. Implementing a notice-and-takedown system allows the host to comply with this requirement and potentially avoid liability.\n\nOption C would likely increase the host's legal risk by making it impossible to prevent repeated uploads of illegal content by the same users.\n\nOption D, while slightly better than a passive Terms of Service agreement, is still insufficient. A simple checkbox may not create a binding agreement, and it doesn't address the core issue of responding to notifications about illegal content.\n\nThe correct approach (B) balances allowing user uploads with a system to promptly address potential legal issues when they arise, in line with EU regulations."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49106/new-internet-company-is-trying-to-make-me-pay-double-for-the-same-service", "docs_id": 49106, "title": "New Internet Company is trying to make me pay double for the same service", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been a customer of NewWave Communications as my home internet provider in Sour Lake, Texas for 10\\+ years.

They said that as long as I don't change my plan, I'm grandfathered\\-in at the price and service I'm getting, and that there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nYesterday, I received a letter in the mail (from NewWave) stating, \"The internet service I subscribe to is being discontinued, and my service is being moved to a *comparable* service or plan.\" Same thing they tried to tell me before. That *comparable plan* takes me from 1000 GB Data Plan ($42\\.74/mo) to a lower 300GB plan ($55\\.00/mo) and if I go over the 300GB, they will charge me an EXTRA $10/mo for every 100GB I go over. They note that my actual monthly data usage for the Oct\\-Dec months has been 701GB. In what world is that a **comparable plan**? \n\nI called the number on the letter, and they said that NewWave Communications is being bought out by Cable ONE, and that this new company is going to charge me TWICE the amount for a \"new\" plan that I've always had because this new company says my plan doesn't exist. Look, my internet is just fine the way it is. Nobody is coming out to my house and re\\-wiring anything, and I'm not asking for anything more other than to leave me and my bill alone. Shouldn't this \"new\" company honor the price that I've had for years? I mean, AT\\&T and Verizon don't offer unlimited plans to people anymore, but the people who got on those plans before they changed what they offer weren't forced to get another plan, right?

While it may seem unfair to the customer, ISPs typically retain the right to modify or discontinue plans, even for long-standing customers. The key factor here is what the customer's contract states. Most ISP contracts include clauses allowing them to change terms or discontinue services with proper notice. The acquisition by a new company doesn't necessarily obligate them to maintain all previous plans indefinitely. As long as the company provides notice as required by the contract, they can likely proceed with discontinuing the old plan. The customer's options are limited to accepting the new terms, negotiating (if possible), or finding a new provider.

If the property manager stated at some point that the apartment represented by the photos may not be the actual property, you may be out of luck.\n\nBefore confronting the property manager again, gather up all your emails, documents, photos and any other evidence \\- such as written descriptions of any phone calls and talks you had with the property manager before and after the move in \\- and talk to either a legal aid organization that specializes in rental aid (Google for your area in CO), or a lawyer who deals in leases and offers free initial consultations.\n\nOther than that, this site is not for specific legal advice, i.e. if you should sue the landlord to break the lease and move; that's your judgement and the advice of any legal representation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant rented an apartment sight-unseen based on photos and descriptions provided by the property manager.

The relevant portion is the state computer law claims, starting p. 22, which in the Nevada and California versions involves a law making unauthorized access a crime. These laws also provide a cause of action in case of damage caused by illegal access (that is, you can sue the person who broke into your system). On that basis (as well as copyright infringement, where the plaintiff prevailed), Oracle sued the defendant.\n\nAs the court noted, the core question is whether Rimini violated those laws by downloading the content (using automated tools in violation of the TOS).

Rimini Street focused on the interpretation of state computer laws, specifically the California and Nevada statutes regarding unauthorized access.

The court emphasized that \"taking data using a method prohibited by the applicable terms of use, when the taking itself generally is permitted, does not violate the CDAFA [California law].\" This ruling doesn't make all Terms of Service violations legal, nor does it broadly legalize all forms of data collection.

And I want this software to run on modern platforms like iOS / macOS / Android / Nintendo Switch / Steam / Playstation / etc. So I write a wrapper app/[virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)/[emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) (pick the term you like) that serves to run the ROM and also enable some networked [multiplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game) functionality and so forth.\n\nWill Nintendo most likely litigate because I used their proprietary (albeit retro/dated/discontinued) format?\n\nAnd if legal issues are likely to crop up, is it best to **(A)** contact Nintendo directly to work out some sort of licensing deal or **(B)** just make some other [8\\-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing) format that is very similar to (but just different enough from) the NES format?\n\nFrom a [retro gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrogaming) purist standpoint, certainly the look/sound/feel of the original NES format would be preferred over a format designed to recreate or approximate it.\n\nI understand that when I phrase a question as \"will... most likely...?\" it invites opinion\\-based answers. But even opinion\\-based answers would be appreciated because this question is based on a hypothetical scenario that has not happened. If someone could answer, for example: \"You're screwed because Nintendo can sue you based on *x* premise.\" or \"You can probably do this safely because of yada\\-yada clause in blah\\-blah law...\" that would still be helpful and I would accept it as an answer.\n\nNote: There is [a question similar to mine](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66646/), and the answer is essentially \"they'll probably sue you *if* you're making money from it\". But I'm not really satisfied with that, so I'm forming a slightly more detailed and more comprehensive question.\n\nIt is possible Nintendo has released some kind of official statement (and possibly even a licensing program) regarding this matter that I am just not aware of. In that case a link to this in the answer would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, should we take into consideration that if the game is published for Nintendo's current console ([Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch)), that Nintendo would stand to gain some profit from the release anyway and be less likely to complain about the intricacies of what technologies were utilized in the game's creation?\n\nFurthermore, modern games are usually made with a [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) such as [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) or [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)), and a license fee is usually owed to the creators of the engine by the game developers. The .nes format is not exactly the product of a game engine, but more like the product of low\\-level [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). Sure, there are authoring tools like [NESmaker](https://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/) that *might* sort of fall under the category of \"game engine\"... not really sure. And when you consider how low\\-level the coding for the NES is, it's not even clear to what extent the ownership of that technology can really be attributed to Nintendo. It may be the case that any .nes file I create is entirely mine, in the same way that any .psd file I make using [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop) belongs to me (not Adobe). But this kind of software law stuff is obviously not my area of expertise, which is why I am asking here.\n\nFinally, would releasing the .nes file for free possibly lessen the likelihood of becoming a target for litigation based on the premise that anyone can \"steal\" my game and run it on an emulator, but what customers are paying for with the app is essentially the convenience of running that file on their hardware of choice?\n\nThis is mostly a question out of curiosity, but as someone who appreciates retro games and is considering dabbling in game dev, I would like to know. Thanks.\n\n**Edit:** Come to think of it, there are titles such as [Namco Museum](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/namco-museum-switch/) being released on Switch and obviously were originally written for NES, so wrapping NES games for a modern console is a current practice. Whether Namco had to pay anything extra to Nintendo to release this title is anyone's guess. It is also possible in Namco's case that they had some existing license deal established from when they first released the games decades ago.\n\nRelated links:\n\n[Is It Legal To Develop Homebrew NES Games?](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5177)\n\n[Why people are still making NES games](https://www.eurogamer.net/why-people-are-still-making-nes-games) \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Emulators are legal. They've been legal since courts ruled in favor of [Bleem!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleem!), a commercial PlayStation emulator, in the 90s (though the company that made it still went out of business thanks to the lawsuit). Furthermore, [Micro Mages](http://morphcat.de/micromages/), an NES game developed in the modern age that received a physical cartridge release, is currently available on Steam and itch.io as a packaged emulator version. All three releases additionally come with a standalone copy of the game ROM that can be played in an emulator of your choice. There is also nothing illegal about making a game not licensed by Nintendo for such consoles (most famously done by the Christian game developer [Wisdom Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_Tree)); in fact, Micro Mages is not licensed by Nintendo either. Such games cannot use Nintendo trademarks, of course, but the only actions Nintendo has historically been able to take against distributors of such games otherwise is to stop doing or refuse to do business with them.\n\nNote the parody of the [Nintendo Seal of Quality](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Nintendo_Seal) on the Micro Mages box art: ![Micro Mages box art with parody of the Nintendo Quality Seal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Micro_Mages.png))", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer creates a new game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 2023 and wants to distribute it digitally on modern platforms.

Emulators have been ruled legal in court cases like the Bleem! case. Developers can create games for old consoles without licensing from the original hardware manufacturer, as long as they don't use protected trademarks.

I cannot pinpoint the line for you or tell you whether any particular action would lie on one side or the other, but I can describe the test.\n\nIn Maryland, there are \"five elements necessary to consider before applying the defense of necessity\" (*[Marquardt v. State](https://casetext.com/case/marquardt-v-state-5)*, 164 Md. App. 95, 135\\-36 (2005\\), citing *Sigma Reproductive Health Center v. State*, 297 Md. 660, 677\\-79 (1983\\)):\n\n1. The harm avoided \u2014 this need not be physical harm but also may be harm to property as, for instance, where a firefighter destroys some property to prevent the spread of fire which threatens to consume other property of greater value.\n2. The harm done \u2014 this is not limited to any particular type of harm but includes intentional homicide as well as intentional battery or property damage. An illustration is supplied:\n\n\\`\\[A]s where A, driving a car, suddenly finds himself in a predicament where he must either run down B or hit C's house and he reasonably chooses the latter, unfortunately killing two people in the house who by bad luck happened to be just at that place inside the house where A's car struck \u2014 it is the harm\\-reasonably\\-expected, rather than the harm\\-actually\\-caused, which governs.'\n3. Intention to avoid harm \u2014 to have the defense of necessity, the defendant must have acted with the intention of avoiding the greater harm. Actual necessity, without the intention, is not enough. However, an honest and reasonable belief in the necessity of his action is all that is required.\n4. The relative value of the harm avoided and the harm done. The defendant's belief as to the relative harmfulness of the harm avoided and the harm done does not control. It is for the court, not the defendant, to weigh the relative harmfulness of the two alternatives. To allow the defense the court must conclude that the harm done by the defendant in choosing the one alternative was less than the harm which would have been done if he had chosen the other.\n5. Optional courses of action; imminence of disaster. The defense of necessity applies when the defendant is faced with this choice of two evils: he may either do something which violates the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce some harm, or not do it and so produce a greater harm. If, however, there is open to him a third alternative, which will cause less harm than will be caused by violating the law, he is not justified in violating the law. For example, \"\\[a] prisoner subjected to inhuman treatment by his jailors is not justified in breaking prison if he can bring about an improvement in conditions by other means.\"\n\n*Marquardt* at 137:\n\n> in order for the defense of necessity to have been warranted in this case, appellant must have presented \"some evidence\" that there was a choice between two evils, that no legal alternatives existed, that the harm appellant caused was not disproportionate to the harm avoided, and that the emergency was imminent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John is walking down the street when he hears screams coming from a nearby house.

John's action of breaking in immediately to provide aid would likely be justified under the defense of necessity.

John's intention is to avoid the greater harm, the situation appears imminent, and there are no apparent less harmful alternatives that would address the emergency quickly enough.\n\nB) While calling 911 is a good action, waiting for emergency services might not be sufficient given the apparent urgency of the situation.

The federal [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_I) forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. So a business may not deny service for those *specific* reasons. In the Colorado case, there was a similar state law that also forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \n\nIf they deny you service because of your political views, or the way you dress, or because they just plain don't like you as a person, that's legal. If they deny you service because of your sex, or race, or on the other bases in the Civil Rights Act, that's illegal.\n\nObviously, since a business doesn't have to say why they're denying service, or could lie about the reason, this could make it hard for a plaintiff to prove that denial was in fact based on (e.g.) race. They might be able to do so by finding out about internal discussions within the business, or by showing a pattern of denial to customers of a particular race.\n\nIn *Masterpiece Cakeshop*, the baker made it easy by explicitly stating that he was denying service because of the customers' sexual orientation, or at least because of the same\\-sex nature of the marriage in question. This would appear to violate the Colorado state law. Had he just said no without giving a reason, it would have been harder for the plaintiffs to make their case. (A state commission held that the baker did violate the law, but the US Supreme Court reversed because, they said, the commission had improperly taken the baker's religion into account.)\n\nBut there is no such law that forbids discrimination on the basis of political views, so Alex Jones can't make a similar case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in the United States refuses service to a customer.

I\u2019m considering taking them to small claims, but there\u2019s a clause in our lease claiming a six month statute of limitations on damages (state law is 4 years) and another claiming that tenants can only pursue legal action within 30 days of terminating the lease.\n\nI think I\u2019ve got solid ground to take this before a judge, but I\u2019m no lawyer nor can I afford to hire one \\- any advice you could provide (examples or references would be amazing) would be greatly appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At the outset, I don't understand why people are voting to close this question. The question presents an interesting issue of contract law.\n\n> Can a Rental Contract Supersede State Law?\n\nNo, not in your situation. The doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) is decisive, and it favors your position unless you are the party who drafted the lease contract (which is unlikely in a landlord\\-tenant context).\n\nThe clause establishing a six\\-month statute of limitations is in conflict with the tenant's right (per the same contract) \"*to pursue legal action within 30 days of terminating the lease*\". That is, the contract creates an ambiguity.\n\nBecause the 30\\-day deadline has not expired \\-\\-by virtue of your lease not having been terminated yet\\-\\-, the doctrine of *contra proferentem* dictates the ambiguity is decided or solved by adopting the option that favors the party who is not the draftsman of the ambiguous contract.\n\nThere is one note of caution, though. You mention that the statute of limitations in CA is four years, and also that the habitability issues lasted four years. At first glance, the latter suggests that the CA statute of limitations might have expired anyway (depending on the exact dates when your claims \\-\\-specifically, your losses\\-\\- accrued). If that's the case, you need to be careful about what legal theory (or theories) to pursue. Some of these theories could be to proceed on the basis of:\n\n* *Breach of contract* by establishing that your losses accrued at the instant(s) the landlord failed to fix the issues;\n* *Unjust enrichment* accruing at the instant when the landlord refused to reimburse you for rent overpaid (assuming that reimbursement is consistent with the language of the lease); and/or\n* *Fraud*, if you are able to prove that the landlord intentionally misled you, and that your reasonable reliance on his representation(s) caused you losses.\n\nNote that although in California \"*there is not a standalone cause of action for 'unjust enrichment,' which is synonymous with 'restitution', \\[...] \\[unjust enrichment and restitution] describe the theory underlying a claim that a defendant has been unjustly conferred a benefit through mistake, fraud, coercion, or request. \\[...] The return of that benefit is the remedy typically sought in a quasi\\-contract cause of action.*\", [*Astiana v.

The lease agreement contains conflicting clauses (6-month limitation vs. 30 days after lease termination), creating an ambiguity. Under the doctrine of contra proferentem, this ambiguity is resolved in favor of the non-drafting party (typically the tenant in a landlord-tenant agreement). This allows the tenant to pursue legal action despite the restrictive clauses in the lease. Additionally, the 4-year statute of limitations in California law supersedes the shorter limitations in the lease agreement.

In the United States, visual depictions (such as drawings) of child abuse images is illegal provided they are ruled as obscene. This would make things like lolicon/shotacon (a type of cartoon child pornography) illegal in the United States (provided they are considered obscene), yet there are plenty of websites hosted in the United States that permit it to be posted in their website explicitly in their rules (4chan comes to mind), or just simply forbid real child pornography and say nothing about obscene cartoons. Yet, the FBI has never seized the servers of these sites, nor collected and disseminated to other countries IP addresses of those accessing such content, to arrest them like in [Operation Avalanche.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Avalanche_(child_pornography_investigation)) Why is that?

There's surely a legal recourse to actually do this. I understand Section 230 is a thing, but surely the websites have to comply with US law, so if they permit material that could be ruled obscene that wouldn't be the case, surely?\n\nNot only that, but some countries outright consider, obscene or not, cartoon child pornography illegal. What's stopping them from asking the US's assistance in raiding the servers like the US literally did in the case of [shutting down Megaupload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload#Arrests_in_New_Zealand)?\n\nIs it a matter of \"this is possible but will not be considered worth the effort and taxpayer money\"? Do you think that will ever change?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The ruling that allows the ban on child pornography is based on two SCOTUS decisions: *Miller v. Califorina*, which legally defined \"obscene\" and declared obscenities to be beyond the protection of the First Amendment (just an fyi, the definition includes that the material is lacking in \"serious scientific, literary, artistic, or political value\" which the courts usually don't hold a high threshold of quality above. Obscenity laws are also, per Miller, to be in the power of the most local levels of governance among a body of people (so while the U.S. cannot ban content on a web forum, the forum's own rules may).\n\nThe other case is law is *New York v. Furber* which held that there is a compeling government interest in protecting the physical and mental health and well being of a child and that the manufacture and sale of child porn leads to the abuse of children and tramautic memories of the experience that last for much of their lifetime that overrides any protection offered by the First Amendment, thus the material need not be legally obscene to make illegal.\n\nIt's that compelling government interest that forms the basis of the answer. Because that is the justification for the illegalization of child porn and as such it would not always fall to obscenity laws without the interest, there is a bit of a loop hole. To be illegal, the pictures in question must have a real child featured in the porn in question. Thus pictures depicting fictional characters in their entirety (such as cartoon depictions of children) and erotica (literature featuring sexual content) are not illegal under *Ferber* and must fall to *Miller* to determine if it is illegal.\n\nBecause *Miller* leaves the rules to the lowest level of community law possible, these pictures can be against the rules of many websites, 4chan is (in)famous for having next to no standards, this kind of material is perfectly legal on this site as far as higher levels of government are concerned and it falls to the moderation team of 4chan (such as they are) to limit the offensive content.\n\nIt is because these materials do not depict actual real children that they are legal. This is due to the fact that these works can just barely qualify as having an artistic or literary value (the bar is very very low as to what qualifies as \"merit\" under *Miller*). It's also acceptable to make pictures of a real child portraying a fictional character who in the story is a victim of child pornography, regardless of the work's depiction **so long as you aren't actually having the child actor strip on camera.** This can be done by giving the child flesh colored clothing that covers the areas deemed obscene and using shoot angles that depict the child's skin that is legally allowed to be exposed (to hid the fact that for legal reasons the child is legally dressed on the set. Other production tricks are to hire actors who are older than 18 years old, but look younger than they are and can play a kid.). So long as you are not actually making child porn (showing the \"no\\-no areas\" on a real child), you can make fiction works that depict fictional characters involved in such activities in artistic ways to make any statement you want on the subject matter.\n\nIn your two examples, Operation Avalance targeted sites that had materials such as pictures and videos that depicted actual children in pornographic situations. In the case of the Megaupload, the U.S. was requesting extradition for money laundering and racketeering in connection with the legal seizure of Megaupload following investigations into the site concerning digital piracy. I'm unaware of actual instances of child porn involved, but not saying it's not impossible. Extradition only works if the country requested (Here New Zealand) chooses to honor the request (the U.S. and New Zealand have an extradition treaty and very similar laws so extradition is both required per treaty when requested AND the accused person would face similar charges if the crime was committed in the requested country.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal precedents discussed, which of the following statements is true regarding the legality of cartoon depictions of minors in sexually explicit situations in the United States?\n\nA) They are always illegal under federal law.\nB) They are only illegal if they depict real children.\nC) They are legal unless deemed obscene under the Miller test.\nD) They are legal in all circumstances due to First Amendment protections.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the legal status of cartoon depictions of minors in sexual situations.

Option D is too broad, as these depictions can be restricted if deemed obscene. \n\nThe correct answer is C. As explained in the passage, cartoon depictions of minors in sexual situations fall under the Miller v. California obscenity test, rather than the stricter laws against child pornography involving real children (New York v. Ferber). Under the Miller test, such cartoons could potentially be deemed obscene and thus illegal, but they are not automatically illegal.

I'll also be calling the app name to be \"Students info.\"\n\nSay you wanted to create an informational app for students of Toronto University. Since the Toronto University name is trademarked, you have to respect their rights pertaining to the usage of the trademark. Since you don't list too many details, I'll try to give more of a general overview.\n\nThe registration and use of trademarks in Canada is governed by the [Trade\\-marks Act, RSC 1985, c T\\-13](http://canlii.ca/t/52dg3). Similar to copyright, the owner of a trademark is entitled to exclusive rights regarding its usage. However, there are exceptions to where usage of a trademark does not infringe on the owner's rights. \u00a720 outlines when a trademark is infringed, as well as two exceptions.\n\nRelevant to your case, is \u00a720(d):\n\n> **Infringement**\n> \n> \n> 20 (1\\) The right of the owner of a registered trade\\-mark to its exclusive use is deemed to be infringed by any person who is not entitled to its use under this Act and who\n> \n> \n> (d) manufactures, causes to be manufactured, possesses, imports, exports or attempts to export any label or packaging, in any form, bearing a trade\\-mark or trade\\-name, for the purpose of its sale or distribution or for the purpose of the sale, distribution or advertisement of goods or services in association with it, if\n> \n> \n> * (i) the person knows or ought to know that the label or packaging is intended to be associated with goods or services that are not those of the owner of the registered trade\\-mark,\n\nSince your app is intending to be associated with the trademark owner's institution, you would not be infringing a trademark.\n\nHowever, trademarks are fairly complicated.

This is because:\n\n1. The app is intended to be associated with the trademark owner's institution (Toronto University), which aligns with \u00a720(d) of the Trade-marks Act.\n2. The use is descriptive and helps target the intended audience without implying official endorsement.\n3. The trademark is only used in the store listing, not within the app itself.\n4.

As a general rule, signatories are bound by all terms of a contract, even those they fail to read.

Thus, the argument goes, rather than being a mere opinion, a credit rating is better described as a summary or compilation of presently existing material facts, from which presently existing material facts underlying the rating can be inferred, or if it is so discretionary that a credit rating doesn't really imply any underlying basis in presently existing material facts.\n\nThe methodology used by credit reporting agencies, the way business people use the credit reports of companies (especially in bond trading), the way that federal securities law regulation uses credit ratings of companies from this agencies, and securities fraud caselaw holding that statements that historically would have been considered opinion in common law fraud cases that imply facts are actionable for statutory securities fraud claims, all argue that credit reporting agencies should be exposed to liability because a credit rating from such an agency can be a misrepresentation (at least if it is far off the mark in light of objective methodological concerns).\n\nThe argument in favor of not holding credit reporting agencies liable for inaccurate credit ratings is basically that they have acted in reliance on long standing common law case law holding that there is no liability for statements of opinion, and that the credit reporting agencies didn't bargain for this potential liability when they issued their reports (for fees that were a tiny percentage of their potential liability).\n\nEven if civil liability is rare, a ruling that there is liability for an inaccurate credit rating essentially turns what was a zero liability risk line of business into a business where basically 100% of their work product could expose them to liability if a company with a good credit rating defaults, particularly because the credit reporting agency itself claims argue from historical records, that a credit rating disclosed a percentage likelihood of default, but recognizes that any company with any credit rating could default on its debts.\n\nIf credit reporting agencies knew that they were exposed to so much liability for their credit ratings when they charged fees to prepare them, they argue, they would have charged ten times a much or more for this work, in much the way that an attorney preparing an opinion letter on the law that exposes the attorney to liability if the opinion letter is wrong charges much more than their hourly rate for essentially guaranteeing that courts will treat a transaction as the lawyer claims that they should.\n\nCritics of this argument, however, say that it is possible in many clear cases to say that the rating itself clearly made a bad estimate of the probability of default and not just whether there would be a default or not, based upon the standards that credit reporting agencies use to assign the ratings in the first place.\n\nThe answer from @DavidSiegel notes that the First Amendment defense failed in many of these cases in preliminary motion practice in these cases. But those decisions didn't resolve those cases on the merits of the claims made, and I'm not aware of how these cases were resolved on the merits. I suspect that many settled, thereby not creating binding case law, but I don't know how they were resolved in the end.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the key legal issue in determining whether credit rating agencies (CRAs) should be held liable for inaccurate ratings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the 2008 financial crisis?\n\nA) Whether CRAs' ratings are protected by the First Amendment as free speech\nB) Whether CRAs' ratings are statements of fact or statements of opinion\nC) Whether CRAs charged enough for their services to justify potential liability\nD) Whether CRAs followed proper methodologies in creating their ratings\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key legal issue centers on whether credit ratings should be considered statements of fact or statements of opinion. This distinction is crucial because under common law, false statements of material fact can lead to liability, while statements of opinion generally cannot.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the First Amendment is relevant, it's not the central legal question in determining liability.\n\nOption B is correct as it captures the core legal debate: are credit ratings mere opinions (traditionally not actionable) or do they imply underlying facts that can be proven true or false?\n\nOption C touches on a consequence of potential liability but isn't the key legal issue in determining whether liability exists.\n\nOption D relates to the process of creating ratings but doesn't address the fundamental legal question of how these ratings should be classified under the law.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the tension between traditional views of credit ratings as opinions and arguments that they are more akin to factual statements due to their methodology and use in financial markets."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90293/is-there-a-practical-way-to-see-the-actual-rulings-reasons-considerations-that-r", "docs_id": 90293, "title": "Is there a practical way to see the actual rulings/reasons/considerations that resulted in the litigation bars in effect against vexatious litigants?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a register of bans available at [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vexatious\\-litigants](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vexatious-litigants), but it is just the barest list of names.

According to the information provided, while the government website only offers a basic list of names of vexatious litigants, more detailed information can be obtained through two main methods. First, the court orders are on file at the respective courts and, unless sealed, are available for public viewing. Second, online databases can be searched using terms like \"vexatious litigant\" or the specific names of individuals to find written reasons for the orders. This approach allows for accessing additional details about these cases, while respecting any legal restrictions on sealed records. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they either oversimplify the availability of information or incorrectly state the limitations on accessing such details."}}
