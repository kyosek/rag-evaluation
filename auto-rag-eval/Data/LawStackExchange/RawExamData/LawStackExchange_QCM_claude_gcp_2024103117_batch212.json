Currently, as discussed in the answer to [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42694/can-an-employer-force-all-employees-to-open-bank-accounts-in-the-employees-name), federal law and my state's laws allow this practice. Unfortunately for me, my religious leaders are discouraging me from engaging in direct deposit, and are encouraging me to avoid services like automatic bill pay that would allow third parties access to my banking. As stated in the question linked above, the viewpoint taken by the law has been that someone with an objection can just seek employment elsewhere. That is unfortunately not true for me.

Hence you should explore how you can attain your goal with negotiations or workarounds. Since it's not entirely clear what you specific objection is, we can only speculate. Here are some ideas.\n\nMost businesses prefer direct deposits because it's faster, cheaper, safer and lot less prone to clerical errors. \n\n1. You could setup a single use account that only receives the pay deposit and you move out the money immediately after deposit\n2. You can offer the employer to compensate them for the extra work and cost associated with cutting and handling a physical check\n3. You could offer to indemnify your employer against clerical mistakes, lost checks, delayed payments, etc.\n4. You can try to set up an escrow account that is handled by an \"acceptable\" and neutral 3rd party. This party can receive the money and move it per your instructions, so you don't have to handle it yourself\n\nMany employers will be willing to flex a little, if it's not too much work \\& effort for them and if you can articulate your need in a way that makes sense to them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An employee has religious objections to direct deposit and automatic bill pay services, but is struggling to find employers who will issue physical paychecks.

Insisting on this approach could lead to conflict and is not the most constructive solution.\n\nB) This is the correct answer because it addresses the employer's concerns about additional costs and administrative burden while respecting the employee's religious beliefs. By offering to compensate for the extra expenses, the employee shows willingness to compromise and makes it easier for the employer to accommodate their request.\n\nC) While creative, setting up an escrow account adds complexity and may not be feasible or appealing to most employers. It doesn't directly address the issue of physical paychecks and could introduce additional complications.\n\nD) Refusing job offers that don't provide physical paychecks is not a practical solution, especially given the prevalence of direct deposit and debit card payment methods.

Obviously to have consent to listen to the communication. As a party to the communication, you can give consent to yourself to record the communication. So it's not based on the law about secret recordings.\n\nThis does not preclude the possibility that there is a contractual basis for the lawyer's assertion, for example the firm's contract with the union might stipulate that you cannot record any communication with a member. There is no basis for the lawyer taking legal action against you, but he could take action against the union, or the union could take action against you (especially because of his action against the union). In that case, the question of whether it is \"legal\" depends on what you mean by \"is it legal\".

According to the Canadian Criminal Code, it is generally illegal to intercept a private communication without consent. However, the law states that if a private communication involves more than one person, consent from any one of those persons is sufficient for the purposes of the law. This means that if you are a party to the communication, you can give consent to yourself to record it, making the recording legal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not require consent from all parties, just one.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the definition of \"intercept\" in the law includes listening to a communication, so even listening without consent would be illegal.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while organizational policies may create contractual obligations, the legality of recording is primarily determined by the law, not just by organizational policies.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances in Canadian law regarding private communications and the concept of consent in recording."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41701/is-arbitrary-age-based-pricing-legal-in-canada", "docs_id": 41701, "title": "Is arbitrary age-based pricing legal in Canada?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Canada, can a company price its services based, arbitrarily (that is, even if the user's age has no demonstrable impact on the company's costs), on the age of the user ?\n\nSo for example is a pricing list like this legal:\n\n* 18\\-25: $119/year\n* 25\\-32: $160/year\n* 32\\-40: $200/year\n* 40\\+: $500/year\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is not a blanket prohibition on the practice you describe, which economists would call \"age based price discrimination\", although there could conceivably be some set of facts in which this is the case.\n\nIn economics, \"price discrimination\" is the practice of finding ways to charge more for the same good or service, for someone who can afford to pay more, and to charge less for the same good or service, for someone who can afford to pay less, and a substantial share of all business practices that superficially seem weird exist in the economy as a form of price discrimination.\n\nThis is why there are \"happy hours\" (people who can take early afternoons off are often more price conscious in addition to fixed costs of the business being ameliorated when volume is higher), matinee pricing at movie theaters, Tuesday afternoon discounts on oil changes, weird pricing for commercial flights, and so on. It is also why, for example, most wine producers make many kinds of wine at different price thresholds even though economies of scale would make it more cost effective to produce just one of each kind of wine.\n\nCertainly, there is not an obligation for the price charged to be proportional to or reflect the costs of product a good or service, although there are certainly goods or services, like all you can eat buffets, or life insurance, where both cost and willingness and ability to pay are related to age.\n\nFor example, movie theaters and restaurants frequently have discounts for kids and seniors.

While there's no blanket prohibition on such practices, they may be regulated in specific industries.

That same law says \"A city which has established a municipal liquor store may continue to operate it notwithstanding a subsequent change in population\", and \"A city which established a liquor store prior to July 1, 1967, may continue to own and operate it\".

Who\n> does this apply to? Or is this just some guideline or established\n> advice to avoid problems (which ones)?\n\n**Legal Ethics Considerations**\n\nThere are circumstances when commenting publicly on litigation violates the ethical rules for lawyers related to trial publicity *See* Rule of Professional Conduct 3\\.6 (the numbering system for professional conduct rules for lawyers is uniform nationally in the U.S. although the substance of the rules can differ in detail from state to state \\- [Colorado's rule](https://www.cobar.org/For-Members/Opinions-Rules-Statutes/Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/Rule-36-Trial-Publicity) is fairly typical). Mostly this rule calls for avoiding statements that could prejudice a jury unless the other side has already done so and those statements need to be rebutted. This rule states (in its Colorado version):\n\n> (a) A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the\n> investigation or litigation of a matter shall not make an\n> extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should\n> know will be disseminated by means of public communication and will\n> have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an\n> adjudicative proceeding in the matter.\n> \n> \n> (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 3\\.8(f), a lawyer may state:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited\n> by law, the identity of the persons involved;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) information contained in a public record;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) that an investigation of a matter is in progress;\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation;\n> \n> \n> (5\\) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information\n> necessary thereto;\n> \n> \n> (6\\) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved,\n> when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of\n> substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and\n> \n> \n> (7\\) in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1\\) through (6\\):\n> (i) the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the\n> accused; (ii) if the accused has not been apprehended, information\n> necessary to aid in apprehension of that person;(iii) the fact, time\n> and place of arrest; and (iv) the identity of investigating and\n> arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation.\n> \n> \n> (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 3\\.8(f), a lawyer may make a\n> statement that a reasonable lawyer would believe is required to\n> protect a client from the substantial undue prejudicial effect of\n> recent publicity not initiated by the lawyer or the lawyer's client. A\n> statement made pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to such\n> information as is necessary to mitigate the recent adverse publicity.\n> \n> \n> (d) No lawyer associated in a firm or government agency with a lawyer\n> subject to paragraph (a) shall make a statement prohibited by\n> paragraph (a).\n\nStatements such as \"We believe we acted correctly, but this will be decided in court\" are allowed and are not terribly uncommon. But, making a comment about something that can be easily inferred from the publicly available documents filed in court provides little or no positive advantage for a litigant.\n\nAlso, one doesn't have to say much to create at least a colorable Rule of Professional Conduct 3\\.6 issue that a mediator can raise in settlement talks, or that a judge can be forced to analyze. Even if the claim of unethical trial publicity ultimately doesn't hold water, it still muddies the waters and distracts lawyers and litigants from dealing with the substance of the dispute.\n\n**The Risk That A Statement Will Be Used Against You**\n\nUsually, the main concern is similar to the concern about talking to police: Anything you say can and will be used against you at trial.\n\nFor example, this week former President Trump's [public statement about his knowledge of classified documents](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/trump-tape-classified-document-iran-milley/index.html), which are the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation of him, seriously harmed his position legally. (His statement was made quite a while ago in a semi\\-private forum, but at a time when the possibility of a criminal investigation still should have been on his radar screen.)\n\nIn the civil rape\\-defamation case against him (as noted, for example, in [this Law.SE answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92362/9517)), Trump's decision to continue to speak publicly about matters that were the subject of active litigation against him in an earlier case resulted in an extended statute of limitations and an opportunity to refile the case without having to worry about Presidential immunity from liability for statements he made while in office.\n\nIt isn't just former President Trump that does things like this, but his conduct provides good textbook examples of what lawyers worry about when their clients talk about cases that are being litigated.\n\nSocial media statements about pending cases by litigants [routinely provide powerful evidence against them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewarnold/2018/12/30/heres-how-social-media-can-be-used-against-you-in-court/?sh=38a9dd946344) in trials.\n\nSome clients (particularly politicians and many senior executives of big and medium sized businesses, but also more ordinary people with big egos) are \"forces of nature\" who can't resist running their mouths, usually to their detriment, when given the least leave to do so. It is easier to teach them to say \"no comment\" across the board about pending litigation, than to transmit the depth of understanding necessary to comment without saying something potentially harmful. Lawyers spend many hours and sometimes days preparing their clients for depositions for a reason.\n\n**Avoiding Annoyance To Opposing Counsel, Parties, And Judges**\n\nMaking a comment about pending litigation has the potential to aggravate opposing counsel and can emotionally influence non\\-lawyer opposing parties with whom a negotiated settlement will be reached 90%\\+ of the time (only about 1\\-2% of civil cases go to trial, but some are resolved by default judgments or on motion practice as opposed to by settlement).\n\nIt can also irritate a judge who frequently prefers to be out of the public spotlight when necessary, even when the statements made aren't prohibited, and judges in the U.S. have lots of discretionary authority.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A law firm is representing a high-profile client in an ongoing litigation case.

Risk of statements being used against the client: Any public statement can potentially be used as evidence in court, which could harm the client's case.\n\n3. Potential to irritate judges, opposing counsel, or parties: Public statements can negatively impact relationships crucial to the litigation process.\n\n4. The difficulty in controlling the message: It's often easier and safer to maintain a \"no comment\" policy than to risk saying something harmful.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are some circumstances where lawyers can make limited statements about a case.

Which, at first glance, feels like a good argument; if you can demonstrate that a given algorithm, under a variety of different conditions over a period of months, has fewer accidents than a normal human then it makes sense to use that algorithm instead.\n\nHowever, the thing that gets completely glossed\\-over in that argument is the fact that there is a single point of failure in that entire system: effectively, all the cars are using the same driver. So, if the software is fine for a few months, everything's fine, but if the image recognition software performs very, very poorly on an overcast day and one day it's overcast, or if a software update is pushed out which contains a regression, suddenly millions of people all die in one day.\n\nIn other words, an AV won't necessarily improve statistics; it will simply change their distribution, because there's effectively one driver for all those cars. So, when that one driver has an off day, all the passengers have an off day.\n\nThis is effectively the same model the pharmaceutical industry has been dealing with for its entire history, and as a result some pretty solid testing guidelines exist to minimize risk; first the new drug / algorithm is tested for a while with a small group of volunteers in a double\\-blind fashion (such that everyone is told they're getting the new thing, when half of the group are not), then larger and larger groups are tested under more varied conditions to see whether uncommon but serious flaws emerge, and to determine whether the placebo is actually more helpful / less dangerous than the new treatment.\n\nIs there similar legislation in place to regulate these AVs' navigational software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The federal guidelines (from NHTSA) are [here](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/AV%20policy%20guidance%20PDF.pdf): these are not currently hard regulations (but they aren't just talking points). Manufacturers must certify that their product complies with safety standards, which is true of brakes as well as self\\-driving systems. Federal vehicle safety regulations are generally framed in terms of a functional requirement, like \"doesn't, by design, crash\".\n\nThey list (p. 28\\) a set of specific things that an HAV should be able to do, such as \"merge onto the freeway\", \"deal with a roundabout\", taken from California, with a suggestion that this is a minimum set, to be expanded. The HAV guidelines indicate that the future regulations will have a very finely tuned set of designations ranging from zero to full vehicle intervention in the driving process, and requirements for recording and reporting all sorts of events of concern. The latter is important in establishing that some system (for whatever reason) is in fact unsafe. Regulation starts by articulating a desired end and a means of determining whether desires have been met, and later when there turns out to be a really big problem, Congress may decide to limit what manufacturers can do, e.g. they could pass a law forbidding the use of Windows ME as the OS underlying an HAV, which would authorize a specific regulation from NHTSA.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current regulatory approach to autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the United States?\n\nA) There are strict, legally binding federal regulations that all AV manufacturers must follow, similar to pharmaceutical drug trials.\n\nB) There are no guidelines or regulations in place for AV safety, leaving manufacturers to self-regulate entirely.\n\nC) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued guidelines that manufacturers are expected to follow, but these are not yet hard regulations.\n\nD) Each state has its own set of binding regulations for AV safety, with no federal involvement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

I think there must be some kernel of truth in it, or I wouldn't have heard multiple credible people say that.\n\nIf it's never legally permitted for a landlord to do this in the UK, was it ever? When did it stop being the case? If it is allowed, what circumstances is it allowed under?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ultimately *yes*, this can and does happen, but there are a few steps necessary before the bailiffs come to your door.\n\nIn times gone by, the common law recognized a right to \"distrain for rent\", meaning that a landlord could come round to the tenant and seize some property as security (up to the value of the rent owed). If the rent is not then paid within a certain time, the goods could be sold. Various additional provisions of law covered the circumstances around forcing entry, breaking open locked cupboards, and searching *off* the premises for goods which the tenant had concealed. There were also special\\-case rules about what could be seized, such as a statute of the seventeenth century saying (among other things) that landlords could not harvest growing crops, but could take already\\-cut sheaves.\n\nSubsequent reforms for the protection of tenants have made it so that landlords cannot do this at their whim. They first have to go to the County Court for a judgement that there is an unpaid debt. (In fact, this and subsequent steps can happen with any debt.) On that basis, they can apply for a \"warrant of control\", under which an \"enforcement officer\", commonly called a bailiff, will take charge of collecting the money owed. There are quite a few steps and rules here, but the basic position is the same in terms of being able to take your stuff. And it is not the landlord walking around making those decisions, but a court\\-appointed officer.\n\nThe previous common\\-law \"distress\" process is now totally abolished, for most tenants by the Housing Act 1988, and for everybody in 2014, because of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 section 71, which simply states\n\n> The common law right to distrain for arrears of rent is abolished.\n\nCommercial property has its own legal regime since that Act, but previously functioned in the same way.\n\nSo landlords can no longer seize your property on their own, but they can go through a few hoops and ask a court to do it. They also do not get to keep the specific property, but just get the money. As mentioned above, this is the general avenue for what happens when a court orders you to pay money, and you don't do it. The High Court has its own enforcement officers who are able to deal with larger amounts of money, as well as enforcing evictions.\n\nIn Scotland, the same basic pattern applies but different words are used, and some of the detailed rules are different. \"Attachment\" is when a sheriff officer (\\= a bailiff) comes round to value your possessions and auction them off if you don't pay. There is also \"arrestment\" which is taking money out of your bank account.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, which of the following statements best describes the current legal situation regarding landlords seizing tenants' property for unpaid rent?\n\nA) Landlords can directly seize tenants' property at their discretion if rent is unpaid.\nB) Landlords must obtain a court order before any seizure of property can occur, and the process is carried out by court-appointed enforcement officers.\nC) The common law right of \"distress\" still allows landlords to seize property for unpaid rent without court involvement.\nD) Landlords are never allowed to seize tenants' property under any circumstances, even with a court order.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The passage explains that while landlords could previously seize tenants' property directly under the common law right of \"distress,\" this practice has been abolished. Now, landlords must first obtain a court judgment for the unpaid debt. They can then apply for a \"warrant of control,\" which allows a court-appointed enforcement officer (bailiff) to seize property to cover the debt. This process ensures that landlords cannot seize property at their own discretion and that there is legal oversight of the process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because landlords can no longer directly seize property without court involvement. \nOption C is incorrect because the common law right of \"distress\" has been abolished. \nOption D is incorrect because while landlords themselves cannot seize property, court-appointed officers can do so following the proper legal procedures."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32124/copyright-status-of-an-authors-letters-published-posthumously", "docs_id": 32124, "title": "Copyright status of an author&#39;s letters published posthumously?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am writing Lovecraftian horror short fiction.

So \u00a72635\\.502 expressly does not apply to the VP.\n\nThe \"why\" part is more challenging. The statutory authority invoked for these regulations is [5 USC 7301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7301), [7351](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7351), [7353](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7353), [5 USC App](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5a/compiledact-95-521), acts passed by Congress.

Such a regulation would be within the authority given the president in 5 USC 7301, which simply says that \"The President may prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch\".

Lawyers are allowed in this forum, unlike the Small Claims division which is oriented towards *pro se* parties (i.e. people without lawyers). Small claims can consider only claims up to $4,000 against defendants in the county where the lawsuit is brought, and attorneys are now allowed in small claims court. ([Source](https://isc.idaho.gov/overview.pdf))\n\nEven if you can be in the Small Claims division of Magistrate's Court, the enforcement of a judgment if you win requires technical court documents which are essentially the same as those for collecting a judgment from any other court.\n\nEven when Zoom participation is allowed in a court, usually the main trial can't be conducted entirely remotely so someone needs to be in the courtroom representing you for the trial. (The only U.S. state where there is an actual right to participate in a civil court trial remotely is Alaska.)\n\nA lawyer will also often be more effective at negotiating a settlement, with or without a mediator, which would avoid the need for a trial at all, and mediations these days since COVID are routinely conducted remotely. Mediation is often required before a case goes to trial.\n\nIf you are owed more than $10,000, you probably need to hire a lawyer to pursue your case in District Court (outside the Magistrate's Division). ([Source](https://isc.idaho.gov/overview.pdf))\n\nIt is also possible in District Court (not the Magistrate's division) in some cases to resolve the case in \"motion practice\" based upon submitted papers, rather than in a hearing.

If the amount owed is less than $10,000, the property owner should hire a lawyer to pursue the case in the non-Small Claims Magistrate Division of the District Court. This is because:\n\n1. Small claims court in Idaho is limited to claims up to $4,000, not $10,000 (eliminating option D).\n2. Small claims court is oriented towards pro se parties and doesn't allow attorneys, which may be disadvantageous in this complex situation.\n3. The property owner cannot easily resolve this issue without being physically present, as even when Zoom participation is allowed, the main trial usually can't be conducted entirely remotely (eliminating options A and C).\n4. A lawyer can be more effective in negotiating a settlement, handling technical aspects of the case, and potentially resolving the issue through motion practice without a hearing.\n\nThe complexity of the case, including potential misappropriation of funds and the need for discovery processes, further supports the need for legal representation rather than attempting to navigate small claims court from abroad."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73482/staying-in-u-s-while-waiting-for-i-130-and-i-485-application", "docs_id": 73482, "title": "Staying in U.S while waiting for I-130 and I-485 application", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am an international student (with F\\-1 visa) living in the U.S. and I have recently filed the I\\-130 and I\\-485 forms together.

You are in the Immediate Relative category (spouse, parent, or unmarried under\\-21 child of US citizen), and you thus don't even need to be in status at the time of filing I\\-485\\. In other words, you could have stopped going to school years ago, and still be eligible to file I\\-130 and I\\-485 now.

So even if your I\\-485 is denied or abandoned, you would not have accrued \"unlawful presence\" for the purposes of determining whether you trigger a 3/10\\-year ban if you leave the US.

I believe it is a de facto policy that is followed in practice, but ICE always theoretically has the power to initiate deportation proceedings against you.

The man promptly lodges an application for an emergency injunction against the local/state animal control services, seeking to prohibit the confiscation and destruction of his dogs.\n\nPrior to this application being heard by a judge, an animal control officer arrives at the property and is then shot dead. During the ensuing police standoff, the man declares that he was acting in self defence, that he will peacefully surrender if the emergency injunction he applied for is approved and a copy of the approval is delivered to him by his lawyer, and that he is willing to die fighting to protect his dogs. In the interests of preventing unnecessary bloodshed, the judge approves the injunction, and the man does surrender peacefully.\n\nAt the resulting trial, he advances the following arguments:\n\n1. Any intruder on his property has unknown intentions, and must be assumed to be there to murder him and his family. If he had been present, the initial intruder would have been shot dead by the man, and it would have been self\\-defense. As such, the intruder being killed by his dogs was self\\-defense \\- the dogs were simply the weapon he used to defend the lives of his family, no different than an autonomous killer drone.\n2. The dogs should not be destroyed because they were acting in accordance with their training to defend the property from intruders, and once you cross the property line, you have forfeited your right to continue living \\- and they pose no additional danger to the community beyond that he himself does.\n3. The animal control officer was there to kill his dogs. His dogs were members of his family, and he was acting in self\\-defense to protect the lives of his family.\n4. Even if that argument doesn't fly, he was still acting to defend his property (his dogs), so it was still self\\-defense.\n5. Once the threat to the lives of members of his family (and/or property) was averted, he peacefully surrendered.\n\nWhat would likely result at trial? Would he be able to successfully argue self\\-defense? Would he be able to save the life of his dogs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. That is not a valid assumption. Many states have laws that let you presume someone is a threat to your life if they *forcibly* enter your *house*. Simple trespass on your land does not let you reasonably presume someone is a murderer. An autonomous killer drone is not a comparison you want to make: those may be illegal entirely, and are likely to seriously hurt any claim of justifiable force.\n2. \u201cYou forfeit your right to live when you set foot on my property\u201d is not justifiable. If the dogs are trained to be a hazard to the community, that\u2019s an argument *in favor* of having them confiscated and destroyed.\n3. Dogs are not people. Under normal circumstances, they cannot be protected under self\\-defense or the defense of others. Those doctrines only apply when a *person* is in danger.\n4. Deadly force is sometimes allowed to protect property, but this tends to be strictly limited. To start with, you can only ever use force to prevent *illegal* damage to property. If your concern is \u201cthis animal control officer will destroy my dogs within the scope of their duty,\u201d that\u2019s not protecting against an illegal use of force. Deadly force in defense of property is also normally limited to particular crimes that are inherently dangerous, like arson, robbery, or burglary. Even in Texas, simple theft only justifies deadly force during the nighttime. Deadly force is also not justifiable if there were reasonable other options. Shooting an animal control officer is unlikely to be the only way to temporarily stop them from destroying a dog.\n5.

She appealed her conviction on First Amendment grounds, but the D.C. Circuit affirmed. Although the First Amendment would protect someone who hated the American government and went on the radio to denounce the American government, it does not protect those who commit the act of treason, even if speech is their weapon:\n\n> There is no question in our mind that words may be an integral part of the commission of the crime if the elements which constitute treason are present; that is, if there is adherence to and the giving of aid and comfort to the enemy by an overt act proved by two witnesses, with intention to betray, though the overt act be committed through speech. ...\n> \n> \n> While the crime is not committed by mere expressions of opinion or criticism, words spoken as part of a program of propaganda warefare, in the course of employment by the enemy in its conduct of war against the United States, to which the accused owes allegiance, may be an integral part of the crime. There is evidence in this case of a course of conduct on behalf of the enemy in the prosecution of its war against the United States. The use of speech to this end, as the evidence permitted the jury to believe, made acts of words. The First Amendment does not protect one from accountability for words as such.\n\n[*Gillars v.

The D.C. Circuit Court affirmed her conviction, stating that while mere expressions of opinion or criticism are protected, words spoken as part of a program of propaganda warfare in the service of an enemy during wartime can constitute an overt act of treason. This makes her speech an integral part of criminal conduct, thus placing it outside the realm of First Amendment protection. \n\nOption A is incorrect because her broadcasts were not classified as obscenity. Option B is wrong because \"fighting words\" typically refer to face-to-face confrontations likely to provoke immediate violence, which doesn't apply to radio broadcasts.

The purpose for having a legal marriage through the government is simple: When people decide to be romantically involved in a permanent way, they require certain legal protections in case that arrangement goes bad, in which case specific guidelines are followed to handle various situations between two people in this situation together. \n\nNowhere in that legal process does the sex of either of these two people matter in any way shape or form legally speaking. Am I wrong? \n\nSo someone, please explain to me, a straight guy (therefore non biased) by the way, why the legal system of the US goverment (previously) decided States could base the qualification for *legal* marriage, on the sex of the people wishing to be married, a position that is in every way shape and form culturally and religiously founded, with no business being included in the law?\n\nI find the distinction no different from our legal system, not too long ago, similarly deciding the people of different skin color couldn't be free.

It seems like the only reason the change came was due to media pressure and coverage, and our legal system should protect minorities before such coverage is had, for example for the past decade and longer. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first thing to note is that your question is kind of the wrong way around. US states are sovereign and generally have the ability to make any kind of laws they want, *unless* they violate some specific tenet of federal law or the US Constitution. \n\nYou suggest, for instance, that arguments which are \"culturally founded\" have no place in the law, but that's just your opinion, and there isn't generally anything preventing a state from making law based on such things, should its elected legislature see fit to do so. (Indeed, one could argue that nearly all laws are in some sense \"culturally founded\", since they are based on some notion of what kind of behavior is or is not appropriate, and those tend to be culturally based.)\n\nSo legally speaking, the states aren't, by default, obligated to give any sort of justification for the laws they made. The burden of proof is on the other side. Someone seeking to overturn those laws would have to convince a court that the laws violated some specific provision of the Constitution (or another superior law). If they couldn't convince a court of this, the law would stand.\n\nFrom what I have read, before the US Supreme Court's 2015 legalization of same\\-sex marriage in [*Obergefell v. Hodges*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges), the previous precedent was set in 1971 by the Minnesota Supreme Court in [*Baker v. Nelson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Nelson). The [decision](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14283825888588258352&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) itself is quite short and is worthwhile to read. Quoting Wikipedia's summary, the plaintiffs claimed that Minnesota's restriction of marriage to opposite\\-sex couples violated several provisions of the US Constitution:\n\n> * First Amendment (freedom of speech and of association),\n> * Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment),\n> * Ninth Amendment (unenumerated right to privacy), and\n> * Fourteenth Amendment (fundamental right to marry under the Due Process Clause and sex discrimination contrary to the Equal Protection\n>  Clause).\n\nThe Minnesota court determined that none of the plaintiffs' objections were valid. Again, I'll refer you to the decision for the details, but the court mainly focused on their Fourteenth Amendment arguments (the others may have been addressed by the trial court, whose opinion I can't find online). They wrote:\n\n> The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the state's classification of persons authorized to marry. There is no irrational or invidious discrimination.\n\nThey specifically rejected any analogy to bans on interracial marriage, which had been held unconstitutional in [*Loving v. Virginia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia):\n\n> But in commonsense and in a constitutional sense, there is a clear distinction between a marital restriction based merely upon race and one based upon the fundamental difference in sex.\n\nBaker appealed to the US Supreme Court, but his appeal was [dismissed](http://www.scribd.com/doc/21017674/Baker-v-Nelson-409-U-S-810-1972) \"for want of a substantial federal question,\" without any further explanation. (Nobody quite seems to understand what they meant by that, but [here](http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/headnotes/much-supreme-court-explain-opinions/) is an essay discussing the situation in a little more depth.) The effect of the dismissal was that the Minnesota court's decision became binding precedent upon the whole nation \\- laws against same\\-sex marriage didn't violate those provisions of the Constitution. And that was how matters stood for 44 years until *Obergefell*. (Of course, there was nothing to stop individual states from deciding to allow same\\-sex marriage, and some in fact did so in the meantime.)\n\nYou have suggested that laws against same\\-sex marriage were *religiously* motivated. This might suggest an argument that they would violate the [Establishment Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause) of the First Amendment. The plaintiffs in *Baker* didn't raise that point, so it wasn't considered in the Minnesota court's opinion.

If so, what are the limitations of that defense?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is \"yes\".\n\nThere is U.S. Supreme Court authority that supports this position, In particular, *United States v. Laub*, 385 U.S. 475 (1967\\), *Cox v. Louisiana*, 379 U.S. 599 (1965\\), and *Raley v. Ohio*, 360 U.S. 423 (1959\\), stand for the proposition that a defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance upon authoritative assurances that he will not be punished for those actions.\n\nIf the U.S. Department of Justice (or a U.S. Attorney with jurisdiction over the place the offense was committed) (hereinafter DOJ) says this, people who reasonably rely on that pronouncement can't be prosecuted until a different policy is announced and people who acted in reliance on the previous DOJ position are given a reasonable opportunity to change their conduct in response to the newly announced policy. The statement does have to be a publicly announced policy (or a policy personally communicated to the defendant or his counsel), and not just a *de facto* reality in terms of prosecutions not being brought in the past, or a secret, unannounced policy (or, for example, an unofficial and offhand statement of the U.S. Attorney General at a party that does not amount to a policy statement).\n\nOf course, the defense doesn't protect you if the DOJ says it won't prosecute if you do X, but you do X times Y which goes beyond the safe harbor created by the DOJ pronouncement.\n\nFor example, the DOJ might say that they will not prosecute conduct involving marijuana offenses that is legal under state law, if it does not violate any other laws, and also meets certain conditions found in federal law (e.g. no offenses within 1000 feet of a school) that the DOJ chooses not to refrain from enforcing.\n\nBut, if the DOJ then publicly says that it will start enforcing federal law without exceptions on July 1, 2021 and has rescinded its prior policy, a reasonable time in advance, then this defense ceases for conduct after that date. What constitutes reasonable notice would depend upon the facts and circumstances.\n\nThe DOJ can also reach a binding agreement not to prosecute a particular instance of conduct by a particular person irrevocably in connection with plea bargaining type agreements, with respect to offenses of which the DOJ has jurisdiction (but not necessarily prosecutions by a different government such as a state government or the government of another country, for which the DOJ is not an authorized representative).\n\nFor example, suppose that a mail carrier is killed by a resident of a home claiming to have acted in self\\-defense in Denver, Colorado. The DOJ could reach an irrevocable agreement with the resident to accept a plea bargain to a misdemeanor charge of not paying the tax due on the sale of the firearm from a non\\-compliant gun shop, dismissing forever the charge of murder of a federal post office employee. But that agreement would not bar the District Attorney in Denver from bringing murder charges twenty years later under state law prohibiting murder of human beings in the State of Colorado. For the defendant resident to prevent that from happening definitively, an agreement from the State of Colorado's District Attorney in Denver, or the Colorado Attorney General, would also be required.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: The Department of Justice (DOJ) issues a public statement that it will not prosecute individuals for possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use in states where it is legal.

Which of the following is the most accurate assessment of John's legal situation?\n\nA) John has no defense against federal prosecution because federal law supersedes state law and DOJ statements.\n\nB) John can successfully use the defense of reliance on the DOJ's statement, but only if he can prove he was aware of the specific statement at the time of possession.\n\nC) John has an absolute defense against prosecution based on the DOJ's statement, regardless of any subsequent policy changes.\n\nD) John likely has a strong defense based on the DOJ's statement, but this defense could be limited if the DOJ had publicly rescinded its policy with reasonable notice before John's arrest.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate assessment of John's situation. Based on the Supreme Court cases cited (United States v. Laub, Cox v. Louisiana, and Raley v. Ohio), John likely has a strong defense against prosecution due to his reliance on the DOJ's public statement. This principle allows individuals to rely on authoritative assurances that they will not be punished for certain actions.\n\nHowever, this defense is not absolute. If the DOJ had publicly announced a change in policy with reasonable notice before John's arrest, his defense could be limited. The key factors here would be whether the DOJ rescinded its policy, how they communicated this change, and whether enough time had passed for individuals to reasonably adjust their behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the legal principle of reliance on government statements. Option B is too restrictive; John doesn't need to prove he was specifically aware of the statement, only that it was a public policy. Option C is too absolute; the defense can be limited if the policy is changed with proper notice."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53688/student-wearing-political-shirts-in-school", "docs_id": 53688, "title": "Student wearing political shirts in school?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say a student wore a shirt in a New York school that said \"I\u2721\ufe0fJQ\", and the school principal ordered him to stop wearing it because it was offensive and he complied.

This question, and all details of the hypothetical case at hand, merely arose from a discussion I recently had, and the law surrounding it intrigued me.*\n\n**Facts of this hypothetical case**\n\nJoanne is the mother of Jordan, who is fourteen years old. She is a single mother after she left her ex\\-boyfriend, because he abused her. She's a manager at her local supermarket. She is also a content creator on the platform OnlyFans, where she makes large sums of money posting explicit content of herself. Jordan was unaware, until a certain point, that her mother had an OnlyFans account.\n\nOne day, at school, Jordan's peers reveal to him, in brutally humiliating fashion, that they have discovered his mother's OnlyFans account. Not only that, but an unknown source has leaked some of the content she uploads there. This leads to intense bullying. For a fortnight, Jordan is too embarrassed to speak about it to anyone. However, he eventually opens up to his mother about the bullying, and that it has been caused by her content on OnlyFans. He pleads with her to, at the least, engage in what he considers damage control, and delete the account, and that the extra money isn't a necessity. Despite this, Joanne refuses and continues to upload and sell content on OnlyFans.\n\nThe onslaught of teasing and bullying against Jordan continues. After around a month, he musters the courage to discuss his plight with his teachers. Much to his disbelief and frustration, the teachers say that, while they have noticed \u2018unusual\u2019 behaviour towards him, in class, for a while now, and while that behaviour may have indicia of bullying, they don't have enough evidence to take any action that would make a difference. In fact, they find the entire ordeal incredibly awkward themselves (though this they do not explicitly mention).\n\nAround a month and a half have elapsed since the first instance of bullying, and the bullying has not ceased. Jordan contemplates moving schools, but he convinces himself that it's futile, because, to him, everyone around his age in his town knows about his mother's OnlyFans account. Ultimately, after an acrimonious argument with his mother, in which he pleads one more time for her to delete her OnlyFans account, and she refuses, Jordan takes his own life.\n\n**Questions of law**\n\n1. In England and Wales, could Joanne be found guilty of gross\\-negligence manslaughter?\n2. Does any American state have a statute under which Joanne would be liable for her son's death?\n3. In any jurisdiction, could anyone but Joanne, in light of the aforementioned circumstances, face liability for Jordan's death?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses, and I apologise in advance if you find either the hypothetical or the questions asinine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does any American state have a statute under which Joanne would be\n> liable for her son's death?\n\nProbably not. None of the mother's conduct seems like a basis for a homicide prosecution.\n\nSuicide is only prosecuted, in states that allow it to be prosecuted at all, for conduct with a calculated purpose to cause a suicide, or encouragement of someone to commit suicide. These facts don't show that. There is no intent to cause suicide and there is no encouragement of the son to commit suicide by on the mother.\n\nA survey of selected laws on point by the Connecticut Legislative Research Service can be found [here](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0197.pdf).\n\nThe case law and related legal theory is reviewed and analyzed in [this law review article](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/american-criminal-law-review/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2019/01/56-1-The-Puzzle-of-Inciting-Suicide.pdf) with the following abstract:\n\n> In 2017, a Massachusetts court convicted Michelle Carter of\n> manslaughter for encouraging the suicide of Conrad Roy by text\n> message, but imposed a sentence of only fifteen months. The conviction\n> was unprecedented in imposing homicide liability for verbal\n> encouragement of apparently voluntary suicide. Yet if Carter killed,\n> her purpose that Roy die arguably merited liability for murder and a\n> much longer sentence. This Article argues that our ambivalence about\n> whether and how much to punish Carter reflects suicide\u2019s dual\n> character as both a harm to be prevented and a choice to be respected.\n> As such, the Carter case requires us to choose between competing\n> conceptions of criminal law, one utilitarian and one libertarian. A\n> utilitarian criminal law seeks to punish inciting suicide to reduce\n> harm. A libertarian criminal law, on the other hand, justifies\n> voluntary suicide as an exercise of liberty, and incitement of suicide\n> as valuable speech. Utilitarian values are implicit in the\n> foreseeability standards prevailing in the law of causation, but\n> libertarian values are implicit in the reluctance of prosecutors to\n> seek, and legislatures to define, homicide liability for assisting\n> suicide. The prevalence of statutes punishing assisting\u2014but not\n> encouraging\u2014suicide as a nonhomicide offense reflects a compromise\n> between these values. These statutes are best interpreted as imposing\n> accomplice liability for conduct left unpunished for two antithetical\n> reasons: it is justified in so far as the suicide is autonomous and\n> excused in so far as the suicide is involuntary. This explains why\n> aiding suicide is punished, but less severely than homicide. Yet even\n> these statutes would not punish Carter\u2019s conduct of encouragement\n> alone.

While Joanne's actions are unlikely to result in criminal charges related to her son's death, and the teachers' inaction probably doesn't rise to the level of criminal liability, the bullies could potentially face criminal charges depending on the specific circumstances and applicable state laws. Some jurisdictions have laws against bullying or harassment that leads to suicide, especially if there's evidence of intent to cause severe emotional distress or encourage suicide. However, this would depend on the exact nature of their actions and the laws of the specific state. Options A and B are incorrect because neither Joanne's conduct nor the teachers' inaction typically constitute criminal offenses in such scenarios. Option D is too broad, as it incorrectly assumes all parties would be exempt from criminal liability, which isn't necessarily true for the bullies."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86374/when-need-i-to-display-consent-and-should-deprecated-consents-be-stored", "docs_id": 86374, "title": "When need I to display consent and should deprecated consents be stored?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When the law requires consent screen to be displayed for user?

Since you have a duty to prove that you received valid consent, it may be necessary to keep longer\\-term records.\n\nConsent is one legal basis among many\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhen processing any personal data within the scope of the GDPR, it is necessary to have a \u201clegal basis\u201d.\n\n* Clearly, you can process data for the purpose of fulfilling a contract with the user, such as providing a service that the user requested.\n* And using the data as legally required is also fine, for example keeping financial records for tax purposes.\n* Some processing activities are not core to providing the application's service, but might be necessary for a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d. This requires conducting a \u201cbalancing test\u201d where that interest is weighed against the interests and rights for the user. For example, keeping security logs is typically covered by a legitimate interest.\n* Finally, some activities are not strictly necessary and cannot be reasonably expected by users. Then, it is necessary to ask the user for their consent. For example, you might need consent for sharing data with an ad network. Or for loading an embedded YouTube video (but I repeat myself). Many applications can work just fine without ever having to ask for consent.\n\nIn some cases, consent is legally mandated in order to alert the user. Such consent is often necessary when dealing with \u201cspecial categories\u201d of data, such as health information.\n\nConsent is also mandated when storing or accessing information on the user's device, unless this is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user (and thus expected by the user). This is known as the \u201ccookie law\u201d, but it applies to any technical means to access/store information, and also applies if the information doesn't qualify as GDPR personal data.\n\nWhen trying to obtain valid consent, a number of criteria must be fulfilled. Consent is a freely given, specific, and informed indication of the data subject's wishes. You can't coerce the user. You can't make access to a service conditional on unrelated consent.\n\nDemonstrating that you obtained valid consent\n---------------------------------------------\n\nImportantly, it is *our* responsibility as a data controller to demonstrate that you obtained valid consent. I would separate this condition into two parts:\n\n* existence: demonstrate that you obtained consent from that user\n* validity: demonstrate that you obtained consent in a valid manner\n\nFor demonstrating validity, you might save snapshots from the consent flow of our application, showing that the user was sufficiently informed and that they could decline consent without detriment. You should be able to reproduce what the user was told at the time.\n\nFor demonstrating the existence of consent, it is common to keep explicit records: when did who give consent, with which version of the consent flow? When was the consent withdrawn? Sometimes, this is done by storing a history of consent\\-related events, and retaining them for later auditing.\n\nYou don't have to go overboard here. You can decide how you can demonstrate consent appropriately given the circumstances of your applications.\n\nRelation between consent and technologies like OAuth or device permissions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome technologies impose consent flows. For example, mobile OSes and web browsers will ask the user for consent before microphone or location access is granted to an app/website. OAuth authorization flows will generally ask the user for consent to authorize some third\\-party application to perform some actions.\n\nSuch technological flows may be part of a GDPR consent flow, but are not sufficient to achieve GDPR consent. For example, the user might not have sufficient information from the consent flow alone in order to make an informed decision.\n\nIt is also possible that the user has to go through a consent flow for technical reasons, even though you don't need consent from a GDPR perspective.\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* [Art 7 GDPR \u201cConditions for consent\u201d](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/)\n* [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en)\n* [UK ICO guidelines on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent) (technically only UK GDPR, but often more actionable than EDPB advice)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is developing a mobile app that uses location data for its core functionality.

So, if the officer is defending the flight deck, and they are sued for damages resulting from their actions, the plaintiff will not win (assuming the law is correctly applied). But this law says nothing about whether or not they can be prosecuted for a crime. In any case, the officer in your example does not appear to have been defending the flight deck, so this law wouldn't apply at all.\n\nIn your example, the officer's defense against a murder charge would probably be based on *defense of others*.

The clause limits eligible education to undergraduate and graduate studies leading to a degree at accredited institutions of higher learning. This effectively restricts the Trustee's ability to pay for other forms of education, such as elementary or high school, that might be included in the broader definition.

In the event that a user posts a copyright image that they do have have permission for on a community forum, how to the website owners protect themselves from a claim?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the USA, you are covered by the DMCA act, which you should most definitely read. \n\nI can't sue you and your website for copyright infringement unless I first send you a DMCA takedown notice. (Of course I can sue, but I will lose). \n\nIn the DMCA notice I have to tell you who I am so that you can contact me, I have to tell you under perjury that I am the copyright holder or an agent of the copyright holder of some work, and that I believe your website is infringing on that copyright. You then have the choice to remove the material, which means I cannot sue you for copyright infringement because you acted on my DMCA notice, or you can refuse to remove it and I can include you in a copyright infringement lawsuit. By not acting on a DMCA notice you take full responsibility. \n\nIf you remove the material, you should inform the person who uploaded it. That person can decide to be Ok with the removal (and hope they won't get sued for copyright infringement, and they usually will be fine), or they can send you a counter notice. That counter notice would tell you that the uploader believes he or she isn't infringing any copyright.

For example, on ebay/aliexpress there are offers to buy Microsoft Office for 2 USD or Adobe PhotoShop for 3 USD. For me, it cannot be true and probably licenses are illegal. But another person argued that it does not matter until software works and in worst\\-case he will lose that 2\\-3 USD.\n\nMy question is not about if this kind of software is legal or illegal (probably not). My question is about the legal responsibility of a person who lives in the western world (USA/European Union) and bought these things.\n\nIf a person truly believed that this license is legal when he was buying software. If the person did not know that license is illegal. Will it lead to any legal consequences for him? What will be the worst\\-case scenario? Will he go to jail or he will have to just delete this software and lost 2 USD?\n\nUPDATE 1:\n\nPlease only consider the case when the person bought it and installed it successfully on his own PC for personal use only. He really uses it and it works fine. He did not give it to someone else. He did not share it. He did not put it on the Internet. Only 1 installation to 1 home PC for personal use.\n\nDo not consider companies, the question is only about personal use. Everything related to business is much more complicated.\n\nAlso, situation, when the person bought the software but did not install/use it, does not make any sense. Do not consider it.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nAs I understand from answers and comments, basically there is no difference from the legal point of view between buying and installing $2 license or downloading/installing from crazy sites for free (for example Microsoft Office, which normal price from vendor Microsoft is $150\\).\n\nLet's say there are 2 situations:\n\n1. Normal person, has no much knowledge in IT (waiter in the restaurant, construction worker, etc.). The person wants to buy Microsoft Office for home use. He just wants to write a nice CV to get a better job. He saw Microsoft Office a few times in his current job and wants to have it at home. He has no idea who much it really cost. What he did: Google \"buy cheap Microsoft Office\", open ebay/aliexpress, click buy, download, install. done. everything works for him for $2\\. He also read on the seller side or contacted the seller, that this license is legal and the whole page of explanation why it is so cheap. What did he do wrong?\n2. IT Professional who knows how much is it. He was using it for 20 years in the office, etc. He buys/downloads it from ebay/aliexpress for $2 and pretends that he has the legal license and did not know that it is fake, but of course, he knows that 95% it is not.\n\nIs there any difference between these 2 cases from the legal point of view or worst\\-case Legal consequences will be the same? Or what would be \"worst\\-case Legal consequences\" and \"most probable Legal consequences\" in case if it will be revealed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, it is possible that the software is in fact legal. Copies of older versions bought in bulk for resale but never sold are sometimes sold at large discounts because no one will buy them at more normal prices. And there are other scenarios (such as OEM licenses) under which these might be legal. In that case, there is no problem for anyone.\n\nIf these are not legal, they may not come with a valid product key. In that case, they may not install properly, and the purchaser would have nothing of value. Or they might come with a valid, but non\\-unique key. In that case, they might install, but not provide product support if any is ever needed.\n\nIn either of these cases, the seller is probably committing copyright infringement, and could be sued should the copyright holder become aware of it. It is possible that the seller is even committing criminal copyright infringement, but even if that is so, prosecutions are rare. But the purchaser is not committing infringement. The purchaser did not make any copies, nor distribute any. Thus the purchaser could not be sued, much less charged with a crime.\n\nMany large companies have agreements with software vendors not to use pirates software, and under these regularly check their networks for unauthorized copies of software. If an employee installs unauthorized software on a company machine such checks may find it, in which case it may be deleted and the employee may be in trouble with his or her boss.

The worst-case scenario for the purchaser is likely losing access to the software if it's found to be illegitimate.
