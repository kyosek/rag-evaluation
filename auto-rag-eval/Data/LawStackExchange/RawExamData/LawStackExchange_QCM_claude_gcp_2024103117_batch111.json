Saying that people should buy a stock and hold it because it harms specific short sellers of that stock is probably not fraud \\- US law protects speech which is not false statements of fact in almost all contexts. However, specific statements about how much someone has made investing in the stock could be illegal if the statements are untrue (looking specifically at the person claiming they turned $600 into $130,000 in 16 days).

You also can't just copy their code used to create the outputs, but you can reinvent that wheel.\n\nIn some cases, the underlying real facts could be assembled by the sweat of the brow, as you might get from a digital Norwegian phone book, or from the list of approved names (a government document). It is not possible to generate *exactly* what the webpage generates without copying the (protected) code \u2013 the data is part of the code. Not everything generated by the website is a \"fact\", for example the Central Asian town name generator is based on a creative rule of the author's invention, and the \"Central Asian town\" Torakol is not a real fact, it is a creative invention.\n\nI conclude that with a lot of effort, you could legally construct code that functions like the original page does, and does not copy its embedded databases.

Anyone who receives a copy of some GPL licensed software will be able to use it under that license forever, as well as doing anything the license allows, such as distributing it to anyone else they choose.\n\nThe GNU GPL cannot be modified\n==============================\n\nWell to be precise you cannot modify it and call it the GPL or claim any association with the GNU project, but you can borrow some of its clauses to use in a license called something else. From the GPL FAQ:\n\n> [**Can I modify the GPL and make a modified license?**](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ModifyGPL)\n> \n> \n> It is possible to make modified versions of the GPL, but it tends to have practical consequences.\n> \n> \n> You can legally use the GPL terms (possibly modified) in another license provided that you call your license by another name and do not include the GPL preamble, and provided you modify the instructions\\-for\\-use at the end enough to make it clearly different in wording and not mention GNU (though the actual procedure you describe may be similar).\n> \n> \n> If you want to use our preamble in a modified license, please write to \\< licensing@gnu.org \\> for permission. For this purpose we would want to check the actual license requirements to see if we approve of them.\n> \n> \n> Although we will not raise legal objections to your making a modified license in this way, we hope you will think twice and not do it. Such a modified license is almost certainly [incompatible with the GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatIsCompatible), and that incompatibility blocks useful combinations of modules. The mere proliferation of different free software licenses is a burden in and of itself.\n> \n> \n> Rather than modifying the GPL, please use the exception mechanism offered by GPL version 3\\.\n\nThe GPL3 exception mechanism allows you to add certain additional exceptions to the license, but you could not add one which would allow you to make the license revocable.\n\nCopyright holders can always change how they publish their works\n================================================================\n\nNow while a Free/Open license is irrevocable for those who have already received a copy of the work, copyright holders can always change how they publish their own works. You don't need to add anything to the GPL to do this! You can begin by publishing it under the GPL, and then later start publishing it under an additional license, including a non\\-Free/Open license. You can stop publishing it under old licenses if you want. But none of those changes affect the people who already have your software under a Free/Open license.\n\nNote that if you are not the sole copyright owner for your software (if you have accepted contributions from others), you will need to get everyone's approval before changing the license, unless they have signed a [contributor license agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) with you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer wants to license their project under the GPL but retain the ability to change the license in the future.

While the developer can change how they publish future versions of their software, including under different licenses, they cannot revoke the GPL for those who have already received the software under that license. \nOption D is unnecessary, as the ability to change future publishing doesn't require a new license.\n\nThis question tests understanding of license irrevocability, the limitations of modifying the GPL, and the rights of copyright holders in publishing their work."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14055/are-contracts-legally-bound-when-acceptance-is-mailed-or-only-once-received", "docs_id": 14055, "title": "Are contracts legally bound when acceptance is mailed, or only once received?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Kumaran develops novel lampshades.

This rule states that an acceptance is effective once posted, not when it is received. In this case, Bobby posted his acceptance letter immediately after receiving Kumaran's offer on 7 May, well before the 14 May deadline. Even though the letter arrived on 16 May, after the deadline and after Kumaran attempted to revoke the offer, the contract was already formed when Bobby posted his acceptance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because under the posting rule, Kumaran's attempt to revoke the offer on 15 May came too late - the contract was already formed when Bobby posted his acceptance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the posting rule makes the time of posting, not the time of receipt, the crucial factor.\n\nOption D is partially true but not the most accurate answer.

While they must represent their client's interests, they are not obligated to follow instructions that may compromise their professional integrity or duty to the court. The barrister must use their professional judgment to balance these competing obligations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because barristers are not required to follow client instructions exactly, especially if they conflict with their duty to the court.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the barrister has some autonomy in strategy, completely ignoring the client's wishes would be unethical.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because disagreement with a client's approach does not automatically necessitate withdrawal from a case. The barrister should attempt to advise the client and find an appropriate strategy first."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78284/the-legal-basis-of-banning-rt-and-sputnik-in-europe", "docs_id": 78284, "title": "The legal basis of banning RT and Sputnik in Europe", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the legal process whereby the proposed bans of RT and Sputnik are supposed to be put into practice? Why does the European Council think it has the right to force ISPs to censor websites?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From comments, **Which laws allow the European Council to order ISPs to violate net neutrality?** is a more legally answerable question than \"Why does the European Council think it has the right to force ISPs to censor websites?\".\n\nEU law on net neutrality is contained in the \"Open Internet regulation\", [2015/2120](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120), principally its Article 3, in which we read (clause 3\\):\n\n> Providers of internet access services shall treat all traffic equally, when providing internet access services, without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used.\n\nThis goes on to add, with irrelevant words omitted:\n\n> Providers of internet access services ... shall not block ... specific content ... except as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, in order to comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law, to which the provider of internet access services is subject, or with measures that comply with Union law giving effect to such Union legislative acts or national legislation, including with orders by courts or public authorities vested with relevant powers.\n\nThis is a long\\-winded way of saying that other provisions of national or EU law *can* require content to be blocked. Paragraph 13 of the preamble explains it in more normal language \\- the net neutrality provision is not intended to give carte blanche to the publication of material which would otherwise be unlawful.\n\nIn the case of RT and Sputnik, [Regulation 2022/350](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0350) is an example of such a law, saying:\n\n> It shall be prohibited for operators to broadcast or to enable, facilitate or otherwise contribute to broadcast, any content by the legal persons, entities or bodies listed in Annex XV, including through transmission or distribution by any means such as cable, satellite, IP\\-TV, internet service providers, internet video\\-sharing platforms or applications, whether new or pre\\-installed.\n\nand also \"This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\" The Council is allowed to make such regulations by virtue of Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on \"restrictive measures\" against \"natural or legal persons and groups or non\\-State entities\", with certain procedural prior conditions too lengthy to discuss in detail.\n\nTherefore, if your country is a party to that treaty and has arranged for its direct effect in domestic law, then Regulation 2022/350 is binding and supersedes the general rules of Regulation 2015/2120\\.\n\nBy general principles of the primacy of EU law, the ban also overrides any contrary provisions of national law, including perhaps even a national Constitution. Since you are in Germany: under the \"Solange\" principle accepted by the Bundesverfassungsgericht, domestic courts would not review EU law by the standards of the human rights provisions in the Grundgesetz, since the EU institutions are held to be capable of providing their own parallel safeguard of essentially the same rights. This Regulation could therefore be challenged on the grounds of Charter/Convention rights, or compatibility with the Treaties, but not because of conflict with a national law on net neutrality (if there was one).\n\nThe preamble of the recent Regulations does acknowledge the human rights angle and claims to be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. While the ban does interfere with the freedom of expression, that right is subject to certain limits; and ECHR Article 16 explicitly reserves \"imposing restrictions on the\npolitical activity of aliens\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under EU law, which of the following statements is correct regarding the ability of the European Council to order Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block specific content?\n\nA) The European Council has unlimited power to order ISPs to block any content without legal justification.\n\nB) ISPs are required to treat all traffic equally under the Open Internet regulation, with no exceptions allowed.\n\nC) The European Council can order ISPs to block specific content through regulations that comply with EU law, even if it conflicts with general net neutrality rules.\n\nD) National courts have the final say on whether ISPs can be ordered to block content, regardless of EU regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, while the Open Internet regulation (2015/2120) generally requires ISPs to treat all traffic equally, it allows for exceptions \"in order to comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law.\" The European Council can create regulations, such as Regulation 2022/350, which can require ISPs to block specific content. These regulations, if properly enacted under EU law (such as Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), supersede the general net neutrality rules. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the European Council's power is not unlimited and must comply with EU law. Option B is incorrect because exceptions to net neutrality are allowed under specific circumstances. Option D is incorrect because EU law has primacy over national law in member states, and national courts generally cannot override EU regulations."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66692/what-is-the-age-of-consent-in-indonesia-15-or-18", "docs_id": 66692, "title": "What is the age of consent in Indonesia? 15 or 18?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found this question on a forum\n[https://www.livinginindonesiaforum.org/forum/general/laws\\-visas\\-money\\-matters\\-and\\-documents/52502\\-age\\-of\\-consent](https://www.livinginindonesiaforum.org/forum/general/laws-visas-money-matters-and-documents/52502-age-of-consent)\n\nWikipedia says 15\\.

Persuading someone is not necessarily nonconsensual. All the words describe nonconsensual activity except 'persuade'.\n\nAlso, one interpretation of this article is that all sex with girls under 18 is illegal. However, if that's the case, why not just make it simple and\n\n> don't have sex with girls under 18\n\n?\n\nIf all obscene acts with a girl under 18 are illegal, why doesn't the law simply say don't do obscene acts with a girl under 18?\n\nIf some obscene acts are legal, why does it say \"coerce, trick, bla bla bla, persuade\" girls to have sex with you if she is under 18?\n\nWhy does the law prohibit persuading girls to do obscene acts but does not prohibit the actual doing of the obscene act itself? Kind of weird.\n\nOf course the law says do obscene acts instead of having sex. I am not even sure what obscene acts include.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nActually, due to this, is age of consent in Indonesia 18 or 15?\n\nAny actual court cases will be great.\n\nIn the forum I sent someone actually asked this:\n\n> \"The exploitation\" and \"persuasion\" angle is not very clear to me. So\n> sex with a girl above 15 is legal unless you \"exploit\" or \"persuade\"\n> her to do so. Can anyone shows actual court cases?\n> \n> \n> It seems that actual court cases for this sort of thing is very few.\n\nSo if the law is to be read literally, it looks like having sex with a girl above 15 is legal unless you \"exploit\" or \"persuade\". Which is absurd.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Content Warning**: this post mentions rape / non\\-consensual sex and discusses (in some non\\-explicit detail) coercion of minors.\n\n---\n\nAs of Tuesday, March 1st, 2016, according to the [Indonesian Penal Code](https://www.ageofconsent.net/world/indonesia) (translated version; I cannot read Indonesian), Indonesia's age of consent is 16 years old (18 for homosexual acts). Indonesia also does not have close\\-in\\-age exemptions (for example, in Canada, the age of consent is 16 years old, but a 14\\-year\\-old can consent to a partner less than 5 years older, and a 12\\-year\\-old can consent within 2 years).\n\nI cannot verify this source but according to Wikipedia, which cites [this PDF](https://repositoryfh.unla.ac.id/browse/previews/1412), the age of consent could be raised to 18 years under the Child Protection Act arguing that sexual acts can cause bodily or mental harm and \"child\" is defined as anyone under 18 years of age. As an example, according to Wikipedia, a court case in 2009 ([Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/world/australian-gets-eight-years-in-bali-jail-for-underage-sex-20090226-8jaf.html)) saw this used to convict an Australian man.\n\n---\n\nThere is nothing weird about this law. I left this as a comment, but let me elaborate in an answer. Your misconception is that persuasion is an innocent and ethical thing. The harsh reality is that children are, on average, more ignorant than adults and lack judgement, foresight, and rationality at times, and there are disgusting individuals that will exploit this fact to get children to do things they otherwise wouldn't such as sex, or drugs. Additionally, age comes with a power imbalance \\- think a teacher using their power over a student to convince or coerce them into having sex with them. That is not strictly *violence*, nor telling lies, or \"forcing\" in the strict sense, nor trickery, but a reasonable individual would still consider that to be not real consent.\n\nThe fact is that children can only consent if it is entirely of their own accord and judgement and there is no extrinsic pressure forcing or persuading them to. In fact, I argue that *adults* are subject to this too and persuading or coercing an adult into having sex is also disgusting (but doing this to children is far more abhorrent). But since children are considered by law to lack the judgement to protect themselves against coercion and realize they should reject and get away from their persuader, the law instead protects them.\n\n> Persuading someone is not necessarily non\\-consensual.\n\nIt holds a high chance of being non\\-consensual, and consent is only considered real when it is a) not coerced, and b) the subject is *legally capable*; that is, not intoxicated, not a minor (by whatever the age of cosnent is), etc.\n\n> If all obscene acts with a girl under 18 are illegal, why doesn't the law simply say don't do obscene acts with a girl under 18?\n\nBecause sex with people between 16 and 18 is legal (in Indonesia) under the right conditions. Although I must say, since you word it as \"obscene acts\", then of course they're illegal. Obscene acts are, by definition, morally reprehensible and/or legally incriminating, so illegal things are illegal, is basically what you're saying. Just say \"having sex\" if you mean \"having sex\".\n\n> Why does the law prohibit persuading girls to do obscene acts but does not prohibit the actual doing of the obscene act itself? Kind of weird.\n\nThis makes no sense at all, and hopefully after reading my answer you understand why this makes absolutely no sense.\n\n> How in the earth anyone can have sex with someone without persuading? He walks the street and accidentally plug his penis in?\n\n... Rape? There are many ways to have sex with someone without persuading them that I don't think I have to list. Your main mistake is still conflating persuaded / coerced consent as real consent.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, persuasion is not some innocent matter of convincing someone in a friendly manner to have sex. It includes coercion, abusing one's power, exploiting a child's ignorance and limited judgement or foresight, and other reprehensible factors. Consent cannot be given if the individual is too young, impaired, unable to legally give consent, or coerced into it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the documentation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the age of consent and laws around sexual activity with minors in Indonesia?\n\nA) The age of consent is 15 years old, and any sexual activity with someone 15 or older is legal.\n\nB) The age of consent is 16 years old, but persuading or coercing anyone under 18 into sexual activity is illegal.\n\nC) The age of consent is 18 years old, and any sexual activity with someone under 18 is strictly prohibited.\n\nD) There is no clear age of consent, but sexual activity with minors is only illegal if force or deception is used.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that as of 2016, the age of consent in Indonesia is 16 years old.

It generally covers a large\\-ish area; the name comes from the fact that back in the days of horseback travel, judges would literally ride around a circuit to hold court. The exact meaning depends on the court system.\n\nAt the federal level, the circuit courts are the main federal appeals courts. Each one covers multiple states (except the DC Circuit which just covers DC and the Federal Circuit which has subject\\-based jurisdiction). A circuit court normally hears cases before a 3\\-judge panel; that panel's decision is normally binding precedent in federal courts throughout the circuit, including on future panels of the same circuit. Panel decisions can be overturned by SCOTUS or by the circuit court sitting *en banc* (i.e. all the judges hear the case, not just 3 of them). Outside the circuit, a circuit court's decision is only persuasive precedent.\n\nAt the state level, what circuit courts do depends on the state. In many states that have them, they're the most important trial courts, handling large civil cases and felony criminal cases. Some states have lower\\-tier courts to handle minor issues, in which case they might allow an appeal from the lower courts to the circuit court. This appeal might be like a normal appeal (where the higher court looks at the record from the lower court and only considers whether the lower court got the law wrong), or might be a trial *de novo* (where the higher court throws out the lower court's decision entirely and tries the case itself from scratch).

The 9th Circuit itself could overturn the panel's decision through an en banc review.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because en banc review is not automatic.

Suppose that A was fired on Tuesday, got the email Wednesday, and was charged with theft ([GS 14\\-74](https://law.justia.com/codes/north-carolina/2005/chapter_14/gs_14-74.html)) on the following Monday. Suppose that B called the local police and made a complaint, and a warrant was issued for A's arrest on Tuesday. The laptop has already been mailed back by then.\n\nIs such an arrest lawful?

Do not talk to the police without your lawyer present. **Do not attempt to represent yourself in any kind of hearing.** Ignore any advice based on what seems fair or reasonable to someone on the Internet unless it is based on a real case in North Carolina or written by a real lawyer.\n\nThat said, it appears to me that you have at least two strong defenses. First, if you you returned the laptop (It will help if you sent it by registered mail or otherwise kept a receipt, although, remember, they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you kept it), that shows you had no \u201cintent to steal\u201d or \u201cpurpose to steal\u201d it, which is a necessary element of the crime. Second, according to [the University of North Carolina criminal law blog,](https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/embezzlement-vs-larceny-by-employee/) you appear to have been charged with the wrong offense (although I don\u2019t think that will actually help you if the prosecutor decides to bring the charge that matches what your former employer alleges you to have done). It cites a relevant North Carolina Supreme Court ruling on the difference between larceny and embezzlement, State v. McDonald, 45 S.E. 582 (N.C. 1903\\).\n\nI would focus on getting yourself cleared of these charges first. You can ask your lawyer if there is any recourse you might have against your former employer.

Because U.S. mortgages generally can't be ported or assumed by new owners, U.S. fixed rate mortgages are paid off, on average, every ten years, even though the home owner could choose to live in the same home and keep the mortgage for thirty years. This limits, in practice, the risk that U.S. banks face when they allow customers to lock into a low thirty year fixed interest rate. (U.S. reformers tend to focus on making loans assumable and limiting the availability of prepayment penalties and wouldn't even dream of trying to establish portable mortgages.)\n\nSimilarly, while U.K. law does not require pre\\-payment penalties, the economic bargain involved in a U.K. mortgage has banks relying on people not pre\\-paying their loans or paying pre\\-payment penalties in order to establish the creditworthiness of the bank to regulators and third parties.\n\nSo, while it might be possible in theory to allow an assignable version of a U.S. mortgage which is tied to the property and not the person, in the U.K., one would have to simultaneously change other aspects of the transaction and the way that banks estimate their cash flow to meet their own obligations, for this change to work, something that would probably require regulatory cooperation to work in practice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key difference between UK and US mortgage practices regarding portability and fixed-rate terms?\n\nA) UK mortgages are always portable, while US mortgages can never be transferred to a new property.\n\nB) UK mortgages typically offer longer fixed-rate terms than US mortgages.\n\nC) UK mortgages are generally portable and can have long fixed-rate terms, while US mortgages are typically paid off when a property is sold, limiting the bank's long-term interest rate risk.\n\nD) US mortgages always require pre-payment penalties, whereas UK mortgages never do.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key difference highlighted in the passage is that UK mortgages are generally portable (can be transferred to a new property) and can have long fixed-rate terms. In contrast, US mortgages typically must be paid off when a property is sold and cannot be ported or assumed by new owners. This practice in the US limits the banks' exposure to long-term interest rate risks, as even 30-year mortgages are, on average, paid off every 10 years due to property sales or refinancing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while UK mortgages are often portable, it's not always the case, and US mortgages aren't categorically non-transferable.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest that UK mortgages typically offer longer fixed-rate terms than US mortgages. In fact, it mentions that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are common in the US.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage states that UK law does not require pre-payment penalties, and it doesn't mention that US mortgages always require them."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46814/how-to-reconcile-opposing-legal-answers", "docs_id": 46814, "title": "How to reconcile opposing legal answers?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [A fraud in the terms of use](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46745/a-fraud-in-the-terms-of-use) has two opposing answers: one said it **was** a fraud, while some said it was **not**.\n\nHow do I reconcile those answers?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Law is more like sport than mathematics\n---------------------------------------\n\nYou don\u2019t know how it will turn out until you play the game.\n\nIf a case goes to trial it\u2019s because at both sides believe they can win.

(copyright? theft?)\n\nFurthermore, say said person contributed vastly more than the others, will his claim be justified / more justifiable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One possibility is that the person submitting the thesis can have their degree revoked. This is not strictly a legal matter, rather it is a matter between the student and their university, where the university can, after a process, revoke the degree. The grounds would be a violation of university rules pertaining to requirements for the degree, specifically the part where the student must submit a thesis representing \"independent research\". The exact wording of the requirement is obviously institution\\-dependent, and of course no university requires completely autonomous and isolated research and writing in the production of a thesis. It would be rather off\\-topic though fascinating to collects anecdotes on variation between institutions on what degree of collaboration is deemed acceptable. From the legal perspective, the student whose degree is revoked could attempt to sue the university for the revocation, since the student has a property interest in the degree, but generally university proceedings are held by the courts to be valid.\n\nAnother way to \"claim\" a work as your own is with respect to copyright. In that case, though, there has to be more than vague collaboration, there has to be actual co\\-authorship. The basic legal idea is that when multiple authors write a work, they jointly own the work (the work is called a \"joint work\"). The basic definition of a joint work under 17 USC 101 is \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\". Sharing of ideas or lab results doesn't make something a joint work, there has to be actual co\\-writing.\n\nThe US Copyright Office interprets that as meaning that authors have equal rights to the work (an undivided ownership share): in other words, any author can grant permission to publish, and a copyright license of transfer of rights does not have to be agreed on by both authors. However, profits are to be shared equally among the authors, in the same way that joint partners in a business venture share the profits of their business. This is so even if one author writes 90% of the work and the other one writes 10%.\n\nThis can then lead to a legal problem between the publisher and the non\\-signatory author. Typically, when a work is published, the publisher obtains from the contributor either a license to reproduce, or else a transfer of copyright, which allows the publisher to reproduce the work. Such agreements typically contain a clause where the contributor warrants that they have the right to transfer / license and that they are the sole author, or else the co\\-authors have been identified in the agreement (in which case the publisher pursues each author to get a signature on an agreement form). And there is almost surely an indemnification clause, saying that the contributor will indemnify the publisher against any infringement claims. Which is another way of saying, if it turns out that the contributor does not have the right to fully assign copyright to the work and the publisher gets sued, the contributor must cover the publisher's legal costs and possible losses from a judgment.

The university has the right to revoke Alice's degree for violating the rules of independent research, which is not strictly a legal matter but an institutional one. Courts generally uphold such university proceedings. Additionally, if Alice published the thesis claiming sole authorship, she likely signed agreements with the publisher warranting that she was the sole author or had permission from co-authors.

However the property manager has recently stated that we are responsible for *all* maintenance items under $200\\. That sounds very much at odds with my understanding of \"real estate law\" (aka the landlord is always responsible for basic wear and tear), and didn't sound like anything I read in the lease so I looked it over. There are two clauses in the lease related to maintenance:\n\n> **TENANT TO MAINTAIN; USE OF PREMISES;**\n> \n> \n> TENANT shall be responsible for the cost of all minor repairs and\n>  damages to the PREMISES due to the default, negligence, or willful\n>  misconduct of TENANT or TENANT'S family or guests, including \\[long\n>  list of perfectly reasonable things]. TENANT to alert the LANDLORD to\n>  any declining conditions inside and outside of the PREMISES included\n>  but not limited to \\[another list of things].\n\nThis seems perfectly normal and reasonable to me. Farther down it says:\n\n> **Maintenance:** The Tenant agrees to properly maintain the home and complete, at his own expense, all daily maintenance EXCLUDING furnace/AC, water heater, appliance replacement and major repairs. The tenant is responsible for the cleaning of all clogged drain lines. If the home is located within a community governed by a Homeowners Association, Tenant does hereby agree to abide by the rules and bylaws of said Association (*Exceeding $200 maintenance threshold contact owner/landlord*)\n\n(emphasis mine). That last bit \\- `Exceeding $200 maintenance threshold contact owner/landlord` \\- is what the PM pointed to as establishing that I am responsible for *all* maintenance under $200\\. That is not at all how I understood that sentence. The reason is because this is a section talking about *daily maintenance*, i.e. the regular things that need to happen to keep a house running \\- changing air filters, light bulbs, snow removal, etc... and that the $200 threshold only applies to items such as these. However the PM believes this means that I'm instead responsible for any maintenance under $200\\.\n\nTo pick a specific example, the basement just lost all power. An electrician just left and determined that there is a wiring issue in the walls and a new wire needs to be run. From the perspective of the PM, if the electrician charges less than $200 it is my responsibility because of this clause in the lease.\n\nI can't decide if I simply misread this lease because of my own expectations on the division of duties between tenant and landlord (aka the landlord is *always* responsible for all normal wear and tear \\- such as a wire breaking somewhere in the walls), or if the PMs understanding of this clause is completely at odds with basic property management law and therefore incorrect. Obviously though I need to figure out which is the case so I know how to respond. If I signed a lease I shouldn't have because I misread an important clause, then I'm going to have to eat this one and let it be the cost of learning an important lesson...

There is [a law](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=39159), the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (KRS 383\\.500 to 383\\.705\\) which states limits on residential leases (otherwise, the matter would be governed by the terms of the contract and common law). The state didn't enact those laws as enforceable in the state, it \"made them available\" for cities, counties and urban\\-county governments to adopt unmodified (or not).

The contract is executed on a blockchain, but Alice later discovers that Bob obtained the Bitcoin through illegal means. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of this contract?\n\nA) The contract is fully enforceable because it was executed on a blockchain.\nB) The contract is void due to illegality and cannot be enforced.\nC) The contract is voidable at Alice's option due to misrepresentation.\nD) The contract is enforceable, but a court may modify its terms to exclude the illegally obtained Bitcoin.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The contract would be void due to illegality. One of the fundamental principles of contract law is that contracts involving illegal activities or consideration are not enforceable. In this case, the Bitcoin obtained through illegal means taints the entire agreement. This falls under the category of reasons why a contract would be void, specifically the \"illegality\" ground mentioned in the documentation. Even though the contract was executed on a blockchain, the underlying illegality prevents it from being enforceable in a legal context. Options A and D are incorrect because they assume the contract could be enforceable despite the illegal element. Option C is incorrect because while misrepresentation could be a reason for a contract to be voidable, the presence of illegality makes the contract void ab initio, not merely voidable."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19035/protecting-self-from-unknowingly-posting-copyrighted-material", "docs_id": 19035, "title": "Protecting self from unknowingly posting copyrighted material", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Someone is getting me to make them a Facebook page. They are giving me the material. They also want me to edit (Photoshop) some images for them. I'm worried that I may be breaking copyright. If I get them to sign a contract agreeing that all material they provide me, they own the copyright for, and they agree to indemnify me, are these two things enough to protect me if someone makes a claim that I posted copyrighted material? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright Primer\n----------------\n\nIf **you** make a copy (or a derivative work like a Photoshopped photo) of a copyrighted work without the commercial copyright owner's permission then **you** are *prima facie* guilty of copyright infringement. Further, if you do not give attribution to or deal in a derogatory way with the holder of any moral copyright, you are breaching their rights as well. The commercial and moral copyright holder(s) may or may not be the same people.\n\nIf you are alleged to have infringed copyright you may be able to avail yourself of a fair dealing/use defense, however, in the circumstances you describe this is unlikely to be successful. Basically, what you are describing is **not** fair dealing/use.\n\nIt is unlikely that what you are proposing would be considered *criminal* infringement so you would not be subject to criminal sanctions like gaol time or fines.\n\nYou are open to being sued by the copyright (commercial and/or moral) holder. If you can prove innocent infringement (i.e. that you made all reasonable efforts to determine who the copyright holders are and sought their permission) then your damages are limited to an accounting of profits (i.e. you have to pay them the profit you made by breaching their copyright).\n\nIn the contract with your client you can require them to provide you with an indemnity against defense costs and damages: this means you can sue them if you get sued. Of course, if they have no money this doesn't really help. You can also take out insurance against this, however, their liability will be excluded if you breach the terms of your insurance contract.\n\nWhat you need to do\n-------------------\n\n1. Find the copyright owner. For photos, the commercial copyright holder is usually the photographer or the photographer's employer: **it is not the subject of the photograph!** For text, the commercial copyright holder is usually the author or their employer. The moral copyright is usually held by the photographer/author unless they have assigned their right to someone else.\n2. Get and document their permission and publish in accordance with the permission given (including attribution etc.).\n3. If you cannot determine the copyright owner, you may be able to determine if the works are public domain. In general, anything created before the 20th century is public domain: things more recent than that are harder to be definitive about. Some author's such as the US government (but most other governments *do* claim copyright) specifically renounce copyright \\- all their works are public domain.\n4.

The client provides images and text to be used on the page, including some photos that the client claims to own. The designer edits these photos using Photoshop before posting them. Later, it's discovered that one of the photos was actually copyrighted by a professional photographer, not owned by the client. Who is primarily liable for copyright infringement in this scenario?\n\nA) The client, because they provided the copyrighted material\nB) The web designer, because they edited and posted the copyrighted photo\nC) Facebook, because the infringement occurred on their platform\nD) The original photographer, for not watermarking their work\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The web designer is primarily liable for copyright infringement in this scenario. According to the copyright primer, if you make a copy or derivative work (like a Photoshopped photo) of a copyrighted work without the copyright owner's permission, you are prima facie guilty of copyright infringement. The fact that the client provided the material does not absolve the designer of responsibility. The designer should have taken steps to verify copyright ownership before using and modifying the images.\n\nWhile the client may also bear some responsibility, especially if they falsely claimed ownership, the act of editing and publishing the copyrighted work makes the designer the primary infringing party. Facebook, as a platform, generally has protections against liability for user-posted content.

According to the documentation, as a general rule, a 401(k) is not held up by pending disputes with the former employer. This means that the ex-employer/plan administrator should not be able to withhold the 401(k) funds indefinitely.

The doctor cannot legally share patient health information with the employer without the patient's explicit authorization. This unauthorized sharing of medical information violates patient confidentiality and privacy rights protected by HIPAA. \n\nThe company is also at fault for orchestrating this scheme and attempting to obtain protected health information without proper consent.

The court in that country would interpret the license agreement according to its own rules of contract construction and any relevant local legislation.

You do not make any financial transactions or impersonate anyone (you use the name John Doe for example), and you are old enough to use the site in real life. Aside from permanently banning you from using their services (for violation of Terms of Service), can they legally do anything else? Are they likely to legally do anything else?\n\nWhat if you were not old enough to use the site originally, but are now (say, you created an account at age 12, which is generally not old enough to use websites, but are now eligible)? What if your use of false information allows you to create multiple accounts in violation of the Terms of Service, but this does not lead to any damages? For example, suppose a social media site wants to prevent duplicate accounts, so it searches for users with the same name, birthdate, and IP address, but since you used your real name and birthdate on one and false information on the other, the social media site assumes these are different users.\n\nAssume that this process never required making a fake ID.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are three main aspects to this:\n\n1. **Its their website, and their terms of service**. They can enforce those terms, or change them (in some appropriate manner). **You have no recourse if they remove you, block you, or delete your account, for example**. That's the measure that you would probably have, virtually every time.\n2. **To claim damages, or litigate beyond just website access control**, requires a legal claim. But there's a catch there. To claim damages, **they need to show *actual damage*, which they wish to be compensated for**. If you misused their website but no actual harm can be shown, the total damage claimable is zero, whether or not you followed their rules. Merely entering dishonest information isn't by itself harm. So they would have to show they suffered damage/harm because of that, which is directly attributable to your behaviour, was foreseeably harmful etc, or similar. They also need to consider legal costs, and ability to enforce, especially if you are in a different country.\n3. **If for some reason the computer use was also illegal**, then a criminal act could be committed and they could notify law enforcement. For example suppose you did this in the little known country of Honestania, where the law says that to prevent trolling and online abuse, anything posted on social media under any but your own legal name is a crime. Or suppose you'd been banned from the system and ignoring/evading such a ban was criminal computer use or criminal trespass due to the forbidden/unauthorised access (which can happen in several places).
