It may be discouraged, but it's the license you've got, so you've gotta follow it.\n\nGenerally, licenses still carry the right to attribution for their authors, so you still need to have a method to attribute them within your application. It's courteous, and within the spirit of open source as well. You don't have to provide a full copy of the license to the end user, but saying that \"This picture is licensed under the MIT license\" would be sufficient. \n\nYou may have fun reading this as well: [Do I need to include the full text of the MIT license in the UI of my app?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6466/do-i-need-to-include-the-full-text-of-the-mit-license-in-the-ui-of-my-app/6501#6501)",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the proper use and attribution of these icons?\n\nA) The developer must include the full text of the MIT license within the user interface of the commercial product.\n\nB) No attribution is necessary since the MIT license is designed primarily for software and source code, not images.\n\nC) The developer should include a brief attribution stating \"This icon is licensed under the MIT license\" somewhere in the product or documentation.\n\nD) The developer must obtain separate permission from Jenkins CI to use the icons in a commercial product, as the MIT license doesn't cover commercial use.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the MIT license is often associated with software and source code, it applies to all files distributed as part of the licensed project, including images and icons. The license requires that the copyright notice and permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. However, for practical purposes, especially with visual elements like icons, a brief attribution stating that \"This icon is licensed under the MIT license\" is generally considered sufficient. This approach respects the spirit of open source and provides necessary attribution without the need to include the full license text in the user interface. Options A and B are incorrect as they either go too far or not far enough in terms of attribution. Option D is incorrect because the MIT license explicitly allows commercial use without requiring separate permission."

Morrison, the crime of child luring applies when communicating with a person \"who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 18\" for the purpose of facilitating certain sexual offenses. This means that the actual age of the person is not the determining factor; what matters is the accused's belief about the age. Therefore, even if the person is actually an adult pretending to be a minor, it can still be a crime if the accused believed they were communicating with a minor. The law does not require the involvement of law enforcement or an actual attempt at a physical offense, as it aims to criminalize conduct that precedes such attempts."

In the case of a family member entering another's room without permission, it would likely not be considered criminal trespass unless there was such intent. The law doesn't automatically consider it trespass just because permission wasn't granted, especially among family members living in the same property. Option A is incorrect as it overstates the case. Option B is too broad and inaccurate. Option D introduces a condition (property damage) that isn't necessary for trespass under Singapore law."

I am wondering how much impact the bias of a judge can have on criminal sentencing in the U.S., because it seems that judges aren't always very objective.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, there are limits on judicial sentencing discretion, which differ from state to state. For example, mandatory minimum sentences are common for certain crimes. Sentences may also be computed based on a statutory point system considering the nature of the crime and the person convicted (first\\-offender; multiple offender), so the judge looks the answer up in a table provided by the legislature. [Here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.94A&full=true#9.94A.505) is the Washington state statute, which also grants [limited permission](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.535) to deviate from the norms (and a long list of justifications, i.e. mitigating circumstances). First degree homicide is subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of 20 years, but second degree murder is not subject to that minimum.

In the U.S., judges do have some discretion in sentencing, but it is not unlimited. Their sentencing decisions are constrained by several factors:\n\n1. Mandatory minimum sentences, which are common for certain crimes, including first-degree murder in some states.\n2. Statutory guidelines, which often use a point system based on the nature of the crime and the offender's history.\n3. Sentencing tables provided by the legislature, which judges must consult.\n\nHowever, judges are not entirely restricted. Many states, like Washington, allow for limited deviations from the norm in cases where mitigating circumstances apply. This gives judges some flexibility to consider unique aspects of each case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because judicial discretion is not unlimited.\nAnswer B is incorrect because while statutory guidelines play a significant role, judges do have some flexibility.\nAnswer D is incorrect because while juries determine guilt, they typically do not determine the sentence in most U.S. jurisdictions."

Each jurisdiction (Scotland, USA, and even individual US states) can bring their own charges for crimes committed within their jurisdiction, regardless of convictions elsewhere. This is because each instance of the crime against each victim is considered a separate offense. Additionally, double jeopardy only applies within the same jurisdiction. Therefore, the man could potentially face extradition to the United States for crimes committed against US victims, even if he has already been convicted in Scotland for similar offenses. However, it's worth noting that for practical and policy reasons, jurisdictions are often satisfied if an alleged perpetrator stands trial somewhere, which might influence the decision to pursue extradition."

Can A sue B for deliberate cruelty, abuse and emotional distress so severe that it turned A into a homosexual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For cruelty and abuse, yes.\n\nFor sexual orientation change, you would need to prove a loss, i.e. that you are damaged or diminished as a result of that change, and your current partner might find that rather offensive! You would also need to prove your partner's culpability for that.\n\nThose are very, very bold claims, which will require very, very bold proofs. Realistically I think your prospects are very, very poor. You have much better prospects on the ordinary abuse.\n\nFurther, the conversion claim will have terrible optics. It will gain national notoriety and will be the butt of jokes on late\\-night talk shows and \"what is wrong with the world?\" editorial columns. *And I don't think I'm telling you anything you don't already know*.\n\nIt will generate a great deal of negative publicity for you, will reflect badly on LGBT (which is something you ought to think about since you're part of it)... and you will be *widely* viewed as publicity\\-seeking opportunist and drama\\-maker, including by the judge and jury, and it will undercut your abuse claim.

He is accused of a crime and the police get a search warrant to confiscate his computer. They suspect that he may hold evidence of the crime within the encrypted data, but have no way of getting to it without a password.\n\nCan the police force the owner of the computer to reveal his password, and/or penalize him if he doesn't, since they have a search warrant which justifies their viewing his data? Or would this qualify as being forced to bear witness against yourself and thus be protected under the bill of rights?\n\nRelated question, if they confiscate a user's computer and learn his password, either from his providing it or it being saved on his computer, would they have the right to use that password to view information stored on 'the cloud', such as in his e\\-mail or even on his facebook?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ***If law enforcement is actually requesting an encryption key, talk to a real lawyer.***\n\nTo answer your first question, the answer is \"the government probably can't demand the *password*, but might be able to demand the *data*.\" Some courts have ruled that the Fifth Amendment can prevent courts from forcing someone to decrypt data for the government, because the act of decrypting the data conveys information (see [United States v. Doe](https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/opiniondoe22312.pdf) from the 11th Circuit). Other courts have ruled that there are situations where that is not the case ([US v. Fricosu](http://www.internetcases.com/library/cases/2012-01-23-us_v_fricosu.pdf), [In re Boucher](http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf)). *Boucher* is particularly interesting because the government first asked for the password itself, and then (when that subpoena was quashed by the magistrate) narrowed its request to the decrypted data on appeal. In the magistrate's [opinion](http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2009/03-March/InreBoucherI.pdf), we see\n\n> Also, the government\n> concedes that it cannot compel Boucher to disclose the\n> password to the grand jury because the disclosure would be\n> testimonial.\n\nIt is not generically a violation of the Fifth Amendment to compel production of documents (the 11th Circuit, quoting the Supreme Court, considered this a \"settled proposition\"). The issue is that the *act of producing* the documents can be considered testimony \\-\\- by producing the documents, the person is showing that they know the documents exist, where they are, how to read them, etc. Possession of the key to decrypt a file links you to that file, because keys are generally kept secret. In the 11th Circuit case, the court found that the government didn't know for a fact that a) Doe could decrypt the files, and b) what files existed on the encrypted drive. In the cases where forced decryption was allowed, the government had seen enough to independently show that the files existed, were authentic, and that the defendant had actual control/possession over them. The 11th Circuit asked for a bit more (the location), based on a standard that is in effect in some circuits but not others.\n\nIn any event, courts seem to generally consider this to take a court order to force production of anything; the police can't just order you to do it.",

According to the documentation, courts have ruled differently on this issue, but there's a general trend that while the government might not be able to compel disclosure of the password itself (which could be considered testimonial), they may in some circumstances be able to compel production of the decrypted data. This depends on factors such as whether the government can independently prove the existence and location of the files, and the suspect's ability to access them. The other options are incorrect because they present absolutes that don't align with the nuanced legal landscape described in the documentation. Option A is false because the search warrant doesn't automatically override Fifth Amendment protections. Option B is incorrect as courts have not consistently ruled in favor of compelled decryption. Option D is too absolute, as some courts have allowed compelled decryption under certain circumstances."

When a person \"alters\" a regulated structure, under the [municipal code](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Ohio/cleveland_oh/partthreelandusecode/partiiielandusecode-buildingcode/titlexiiibuildingcode/chapter3105-permitsandoccupancycertifica?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:cleveland_oh) they are required to get a permit. Electrical work is included in the scope of what requires a permit. A penalty may be assessed under \u00a7 3103\\.99 if a person violates the ordinance. If, for example, new electrical circuits were added to the kitchen, that would require a city permit. But the scope of the required permit is limited to just that which is altered, per \u00a73137\\.02: the basic rule is that anything changed must comply with [the electrical code](http://codes.ohio.gov/oac/4101%3A8-34). Adding grounding of the service panel would be within the scope of required upgrades if you replace the panel, but that does not entail adding ground wires to existing circuits. Likewise, adding a circuit means that the circuit must have a ground wire, but does not require adding anything past the service panel. Theoretically, the city could take the contractor to court for doing unpermitted work, but the penalty is against violating the permit regulations, not against owning property where unpermitted work was done (\"it was like that when we bought it\").",

However, the scope of required upgrades is limited to the areas being altered. As stated in \u00a73137.02, anything changed must comply with the electrical code, but this does not extend to unaltered areas of the house. For example, adding new circuits to a remodeled kitchen would require those circuits to meet current code, but wouldn't necessitate upgrading existing circuits in other parts of the house. This means that while remodeled areas must be up to code, other areas of the house can remain in their existing condition, even if outdated."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not an American but this has always baffled me. From what I understand, American government is not allowed to compel someone to self incriminate themselves. However, IRS wants people to report their income even if it is illegally obtained. So to me it sounds like the government is forcing citizens to self incriminate themselves by showing \"or else\" stick dangling over their heads. Always wondered how this conundrum is handled within the legal framework.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You would report illegal income via [Schedule 1](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s1.pdf), line 8\\. At the bottom, after naming many specific legal sources of income there is a line 8z \"Other income. List type and amount\" with very little space. The [instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf) refer you to Miscellaneous Income in [Pub 525](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525#en_US_2021_publink1000229391). They do list \"Stolen Property\" as a category, saying\n\n> If you steal property, you must report its FMV in your income in the\n> year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its\n> rightful owner.\n\nHowever, there is no requirement to report the illegal nature of your income, and it is not difficult to describe such income in non\\-incriminating terms, such as \"miscellaneous income\".\n\nIf they are not satisfied, you may inform them of your 5th amendment right to not incriminate yourself. Invoking your right to silence does not constitute probable cause for a search warrant.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal approach to reporting illegal income on U.S. tax returns?\n\nA) Taxpayers are required to explicitly state the illegal nature of their income on their tax returns.\n\nB) Taxpayers can report illegal income as \"miscellaneous income\" without specifying its illegal nature, and can invoke the 5th Amendment if questioned further.\n\nC) The IRS does not require reporting of illegal income, as it would violate the 5th Amendment rights of taxpayers.\n\nD) Taxpayers must provide detailed explanations of all income sources, including illegal ones, or face automatic audits.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, taxpayers can report illegal income on Schedule 1, line 8z as \"Other income\" or \"miscellaneous income\" without explicitly stating its illegal nature. This allows them to comply with tax laws without directly incriminating themselves. If questioned further by the IRS, taxpayers have the right to invoke their 5th Amendment protection against self-incrimination. The other options are incorrect: A) is false because explicit stating of illegal activities is not required; C) is false because the IRS does require reporting of all income, including illegal income; and D) is false as it overstates the reporting requirements and consequences."

What measures is the website legally required to take? These are a few examples to consider:\n\n* A website only shows a warning against 18\\+ content on its home page, but fails to show it on any subpages (no account needs to be created to view the content).\n* A website says in its Terms of Service that viewers must be age 18 or older, but does not show any warnings, expecting users to check the Terms and leave immediately if the user is a minor. The home page itself does not have 18\\+ content.\n* A website shows an 18\\+ warning before viewing content and requires users to click that they are at least 18 years old and would like to view 18\\+ content.\n* A website requires users to create an account and provide their birthdate, but does not require an actual ID, before viewing 18\\+ content.\n\nNo financial transactions take place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A website can arbitrarily decide that it will not allow access to any person under 18\\. The minor violating the TOS in that case would bear whatever the legal consequences fall upon them, by being sued by the website owner.\n\nFor most if not all cases of so\\-called \"18\\+\" content, the restriction relates to laws regarding dissemination of obscene materials to minors. There are various state laws against disseminating obscene material to anyone, and additionally, federal laws against disseminating obscene materials to minors, see [47 USC 223(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/223). It is extremely unclear what constitutes \"obscene\" material (this is determined by the jury), so while porn may be legal, there *is* a risk in allowing a minor to view porn, because there is an increased risk that content that is deemed to be legal to show to an adult may be deemed obscene when shown to a minor. Out of an abundance of caution, a website operator may therefore try to filter out minors from the viewing audience.\n\nHere is the logical flow of the relevant federal law. 1: A website cannot send obscene material to a minor. 2: Nor can they make it available for a minor to see. However, both provisions are subject to a \"knowingly\" provision, thus accidentally making obscene material available is not a violation of the law. Additionally, subsection (e)(5\\) provides defenses, one that the person\n\n> has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate\n> actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by\n> minors to a communication specified in such subsections, which may\n> involve any appropriate measures to restrict minors from such\n> communications, including any method which is feasible under available\n> technology\n\nor\n\n> has restricted access to such communication by requiring use of a\n> verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult\n> personal identification number\n\nAnd furthermore, (6\\):\n\n> The Commission may describe measures which are reasonable, effective,\n> and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited communications under\n> subsection (d).\n\n(The \"Commission\" is the FCC). There are apparently no such regulations.\n\nThere are related laws such as [18 USC 1470](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1470) which criminalize transferring obscene material to anyone under age *16*, which also has a \"knowingly\" requirement. There are [laws against tricking children](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252C) into viewing \"harmful\" content by using misleading names, but the law also says that \"a word or digital image that clearly indicates the sexual content of the site, such as 'sex' or 'porn', is not misleading\".\n\nIn short, in a hypothetical cases where some content is *labeled* \"18\\+\", there are no legal consequences for the website operator unless the material is actually deemed to be obscene. In that case, the operator would have to make a reasonable attempt to exclude minors, such as by requiring a customer to be 18\\+ to view the site.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website hosts content that could potentially be considered obscene. Which of the following measures would most likely provide the strongest legal defense for the website operator under federal law if a minor accessed the content?\n\nA) Displaying an 18+ warning only on the homepage, with no restrictions on subpages\nB) Including age restrictions in the Terms of Service without any visible warnings\nC) Showing an 18+ warning before viewing content and requiring users to confirm they are 18 or older\nD) Requiring users to create an account with a birthdate, but not verifying ID, before accessing content\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the federal law outlined in 47 USC 223(d), website operators have a defense if they take \"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions\" to restrict or prevent access by minors. The law specifically mentions \"requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number\" as an acceptable measure.\n\nOption D, which requires users to create an account and provide a birthdate, most closely aligns with this provision. While it doesn't involve ID verification, it goes beyond simple warnings or terms of service agreements. It creates a barrier to entry and collects specific age-related information, which could be seen as a good faith effort to restrict access by minors.\n\nOptions A and B provide minimal protection and likely wouldn't be considered \"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions.\" Option C is better than A and B, but still relies solely on user honesty without creating any record or barrier to entry.\n\nIt's important to note that while option D provides the strongest defense among the given choices, the law doesn't specify exact requirements, and the effectiveness of any measure could still be subject to interpretation by the courts."

In his video, he presented a checklist of things which are required for a case to be considered self\\-defense and not murder or manslaughter.\n\nThe list is as follows:\n\n1. There is a belief of actual, imminent threat of deadly force (grievous bodily harm)\n\t* Belief must be OBJECTIVELY and **SUBJECTIVELY** reasonable\n2. Threat is unlawful and immediate\n\t* Must have clean hands\n3. Confronted with imminent peril\n\t* Force must be immediately necessary\n4. Response was necessary\n\t* Retreat may be required if:\n\t\t+ Duty to retreat\n\t\t+ There is an entirely safe place to retreat to\n\t\t+ Safe place is known to the person retreating\n\t\t\t- Exception: Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground\n\nThe requirement for a threat to be objectively reasonable is pretty clear: Even if I have an irrational fear of something and that perceived threat seems subjectively reasonable to me, it is generally unreasonable. The example presented was his girlfriend \"attacking\" him with a purple plush unicorn and him supposedly being deadly afraid of said plush unicorn.\n\nHowever, the requirement for a threat to be subjectively reasonable isn't obvious to me. If there is an objectively reasonable threat of deadly force (e.g. a stranger pointing a gun at me), why is it necessary to determine if I subjectively believed this to be an imminent danger to me?\n\nIs there an example of a situation in which a threat would be objectively reasonable, but subjectively unreasonable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because your buddy routinely points loaded firearms at you\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, you should probably get friends who don\u2019t do this but, even though this is objectively a threat, you know that you are in no danger (barring accidents). Self\\-defence is not justified.\n\nThis is why there is the dual requirement that the danger is clear to both:\n\n* an objective observer, and\n* the person under threat.",

While there is an objectively reasonable threat (a real gun being pointed at you), the scenario states that you subjectively don't believe you're in danger. This lack of subjective belief in the threat, even when an objective threat exists, would likely disqualify the situation from meeting the criteria for justified self-defense.

The presence of a donate button indicates an intent to make money, which classifies the application as commercial according to Imgur's definition.\n2. Commercial usage typically requires payment for API use.\n3. Open source status alone does not guarantee free usage for commercial applications.\n4.

It's his aim or purpose to achieve this consequence (death).\n* Oblique intention: the result is a virtually certain consequence or a 'virtual certainty' of the defendant's actions, and that the defendant appreciates that such was the case.\n* Knowingly: the actor knows, or should know, that the results of his conduct are reasonably certain to occur.\n* Recklessness: the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not.\n* Criminal negligence: the actor did not actually foresee that the particular consequences would flow from his actions, but a reasonable person, in the same circumstances, would have foreseen those consequences.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Mens rea* is a concept that is one of many elements that must be proved for particular crimes and torts. The *mens rea* necessary for one offense and the *mens rea* necessary for another offense are often different.\n\nFor example, the *mens rea* requirement for murder and the *mens rea* necessary to hold someone liable for wrongful death in tort, are different.\n\nIf someone is not found to have had the necessary *mens rea* for a particular offense or tort, that person is absolved of criminal consequences, or civil liability, as to that particular offense or tort, but not as to offenses or torts with a less strict *mens rea* requirement.\n\nThus, if you negligently, but not intentionally or recklessly kill someone while driving your car, you are not guilty of the crime of murder, but do have civil liability in a wrongful death action for the death that you caused.\n\nWhen there are multiple criminal offenses that are identical except for the *mens rea* requirement, with the higher *mens rea* requirement invariably associated with authorizing a more severe punishment, then the offenses with lower *mens rea* requirements are called \"lesser included offenses\" and depending on some rather arcane questions of criminal procedure, a jury may be asked to considering the most serious offense charged and also lesser included offense, at the same time as they deliberate. The jury could acquit as to an offense with a higher level of *mens rea* while convicting on an offense with a lower level of *mens rea* when that happens, if that is what they determine was the factual reality of the criminal defendant's intent to commit the crime.\n\nBut, it is also possible that a criminal defendant will be charged only with one offense, and will not be charged with lesser included offenses, and lesser included offenses will not be presented to a jury.\n\nFor example, there could be a situation in which it would make sense that someone has a intent to kill someone, and it would make sense that someone acted negligently in a manner that was not criminally negligent, but not intermediate fact patterns would be plausible under the circumstances. So, the criminal defendant might face only a murder charge and not other charges, and the jury would have to make an all or nothing call on criminal liability. A prosecutor might refrain from bringing lesser included charges to prevent the jury from being tempted to make a split the difference compromise verdict that is unlikely to reflect the factual reality.",

Given this scenario and the principles of mens rea, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) John should be completely absolved of all criminal liability since he lacked the specific intent for attempted murder.\n\nB) John can only be held liable for a civil wrongful injury claim, but not for any criminal charges.\n\nC) John could be found not guilty of attempted murder, but potentially guilty of a lesser included offense with a lower mens rea requirement, such as reckless endangerment.\n\nD) The lack of specific intent automatically downgrades the charge to criminal negligence, regardless of John's awareness of potential harm.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While John may lack the specific intent (direct intention) required for attempted murder, his actions still fall under a lower level of mens rea, likely recklessness. In this case, John was aware that his actions could potentially cause harm, which aligns with the definition of recklessness provided: \"the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because lacking mens rea for one specific crime does not absolve a person of all criminal liability, especially if their actions meet the criteria for other offenses with different mens rea requirements.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because criminal liability can still exist even if the highest charged offense cannot be proven. Civil liability (wrongful injury claim) could also apply, but it's not the only potential consequence.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the lack of specific intent does not automatically downgrade to criminal negligence. Recklessness is a higher level of culpability than criminal negligence and better fits the described scenario.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the different levels of mens rea, the concept of lesser included offenses, and how intent affects criminal charges."

Few lawyers are willing to even consider providing any advice on such a limited basis. Most would try to limit their clients to cases generating thousands of pounds in an in person visit. Lawyers are in the business of selling knowledge and time, not documents and results. An open\\-source approach would undermine their business model just as much as it would for the movie industry or the recording industry.\n\n> While I appreciate professional legal advice (I know it is required) I\n>  have a belief that by obtaining some knowledge first I'll be in a\n>  position to ask better questions.\n\nThis belief is not necessarily very well founded in this context.\n\nThe reality of information about the law is that the raw data has limited usefulness. One of the main things that a legal education provides is an ability to \"issue spot\" so that you know what points need to be researched and where to look for them. Without the overall context that a legal education provides, knowing what issues you should be looking for is difficult or impossible, and this is particular true in Anglo\\-American common law systems, where the law is embedded in an opaque network of appellate cases rather than laid out more or less completely in a carefully organized statute.\n\nAlso, you are almost completely unqualified to distinguish between a simple question and a hard one.\n\nJust as it is difficult for a non\\-expert to know what is difficult or impossible for a computer to do (e.g. turning raw image input in the models of reality is very hard for computers but easy for people, while intense calculations are simple for computers but hard for people), it is often very difficult for a non\\-lawyer to know what is an easy or hard legal question. \n\nFor example, the rights of neighboring home owners when trees start to grow across property lines seem like simple questions but are actually extremely complex legally, as is another simple question such as explaining what a book means in IP terms as a book migrates to a new platform. But, some seemingly complex points (e.g. detailed questions of tax law or civil procedure) can have very simple and clear answers.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that in a situation like spousal alimony, if you've done as much research as you state, it is very likely that a definitive answer that you are looking for simply does not exist. There a lots of legal questions that do not have clear objective answers. \n\nThis is because trial judges in family law matters have wide discretion in a lot of the fine points of alimony decisions, much of it exercised at the trial court level that does not generate binding legal precedents and is not widely available to researchers. Therefore, there is really no substitute in evaluating how judges will exercise that discretion for the collective experience of an attorney who has been through the process many, many times before the particular group of judges who are likely to handle your individual case.\n\nIn sum, while I understand your frustration, a lot of it is rooted in common, but inaccurate assumptions about how the legal system works.",

The documentation states that legal education provides crucial context and the ability to \"issue spot\" - identifying relevant legal issues that need to be researched. It notes that without this background, it's difficult or impossible for a non-lawyer to know what to look for or how to interpret the information. The answer also reflects the point that non-lawyers often cannot distinguish between simple and complex legal questions.

It's transformative (adding critical analysis), uses only small portions of the original work, and is unlikely to significantly impact the market for the original film.\n\nC) This is not fair use. Creating an unauthorized novelization is a clear example of copyright infringement, as it's making a derivative work without permission and could directly compete with official novelizations.\n\nD) This is not fair use.

[www.oed.com](http://www.oed.com). Oxford University Press. Retrieved 14 January 2021\\.}\n> \n> \n> In [*Giles v Thompson*](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/2.html){ UKHL 2, \\[1993] 3 All ER 321 (26 May 1993\\)} Lord Justice Steyn declared: \"In modern idiom maintenance is the support of litigation by a stranger without just cause. Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds.\"\n> \n> \n> At common law, maintenance and champerty were both crimes and torts, as was barratry (the bringing of vexatious litigation). This is generally no longer so1 as, during the nineteenth century, the development of legal ethics tended to obviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the Swynfen will case (1856\u20131864\\).2 However, the principles are relevant to modern contingent fee agreements between a lawyer and a client and to the assignment by a plaintiff of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the case. Champertous contracts can still, depending on jurisdiction, be void for public policy or attract liability for costs.\n\nIn any common\\-law jurisdiction that inherited the common law of England (which includes all US states other than Louisiana) champerty will remain unlawful **unless** a) a specific stature has removed or altered this part of the common law, b) a general statute has done away with the common law entirely, replacing it with statutory law generally (in which case a similar prohibition may or may not be in statute), or c) an appellate court has declared that champerty is no longer unlawful in that jurisdiction.\n\n### Ohio\n\nIn Ohio a case precisely on point was *Rancman v. Interim Settlement Funding Corp.*, 99 Ohio St.3d 121, 2003\\-Ohio\\-2721\\.. In that case a Ms. Rancman, who had a valid claim against an insurance company, did not wish to wait for the resolution of her case, and contracted with Interim Settlement Funding Corp. for an advance against the settlement of $6,000, in return for a promise of an amount ranging from $16,800 to $27,600, depending on how soon the case was resolved. If she lost the case, she would owe nothing according to the terms of the contract. When her insurance case settled for $100,000, she refused to pay as specified in the contract, instead offering to return the money advanced plus interest at eight percent per year. The lower courts upheld the eight percent rate as valid, The Ohio Supreme Court, however, held (at \u00b619}) that:\n\n> The advances made to Rancman constituted champerty and\n> maintenance. Consequently, the contracts requiring their repayment are void and shall not be enforced.\n\nApparently this left Interim Funding not even getting their principal back. Given this relatively recent holding (2003\\), one doubts that funding companies would be willing to advance money on future Ohio claims.\n\nIn the *Rancman* opinion Justice O\u2019Connor wrote:\n\n> {\u00b69} It is unnecessary for the resolution of this case to determine the threshold level of risk necessary for a contingent advance to be treated as an investment rather than a loan. **The advances here are void as champerty and maintenance regardless of whether they are loans or investments.** {*Emphasis added*}  \n> \n> {\u00b610} \u201cMaintenance\u201d is assistance to a litigant in pursuing or defending a lawsuit provided by someone who does not have a *bona fide* interest in the case. \u201cChamperty\u201d is a form of maintenance in which a nonparty undertakes to further another\u2019s interest in a suit in exchange for a part of the litigated matter if a favorable result ensues. 14 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1995\\), Champerty and Maintenance, Section 1\\.\n> \n> \n> \n> > The doctrines of champerty and maintenance were developed at common law to prevent officious intermeddlers from stirring up strife and contention by vexatious and speculative litigation which would disturb the peace of society, lead to corrupt practices, and prevent the remedial process of the law.\u201d 14 *Corpus Juris Secondum* (1991\\), Champerty and Maintenance, Section 3\\.\n> \n> \n> See, also, *Bluebird Partners, L.P. v. First Fid. Bank, N.A*. (2000\\), 94 N.Y.2d 726, 709 N.Y.S.2d 865, 731 N.E.2d 581\\.\n> \n> \n> {\u00b611} The ancient practices of champerty and maintenance have been vilified in Ohio since the early years of our statehood. *Key v. Vattier* (1823\\), 1 Ohio 132, 136, 1823 WL 8\\. We stated in Key that maintenance \u201cis an offense against public justice, as it keeps alive strife and contention, and perverts the remedial process of the law into an engine of oppression.\u201d Id. at 143\\. We have held the assignment of rights to a lawsuit to be void as champerty. *Brown v. Ginn* (1902\\), 66 Ohio St. 316, 64 N.E. 123, paragraph two of the syllabus. We have also said\n> \n> \n> \n> > that the law of Ohio will tolerate no lien in or out of the \\[legal] profession, as a general rule, which will prevent litigants from compromising, or settling their controversies, or which, in its tendencies, encourages, promotes, or extends litigation. (*Davy v. Fid. \\& Cas. Ins. Co.* (1908\\), 78 Ohio St. 256, 268\\-269, 85 N.E. 504\\.)\n> \n> \n> {\u00b612} In recent years, champerty and maintenance have lain dormant in Ohio courts. Historically, champertors and maintainors were attorneys, and these practices by attorneys have been regulated by DR 5\\-103 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. See, e.g., *Disciplinary Counsel v. Williams* (1990\\), 51 Ohio St.3d 36, 553 N.E.2d 1082\\. Nonetheless, the codification of these doctrines for attorney discipline did not remove them from the common law. \u201c\\[T]he doctrines of champerty and maintenance appear in numerous Ohio cases as contract defenses \\* \\* \\*.\u201d *Tosi v. Jones* (1996\\), 115 Ohio App.3d 396, 400, 685 N.E.2d 580, appeal dismissed upon the application of appellant in (1997\\), 78 Ohio St.3d 1430, 676 N.E.2d 535\\.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> {\u00b618} ...\\[A] lawsuit is not an investment vehicle. Speculating in lawsuits is prohibited by Ohio law. An intermeddler is not permitted to gorge upon the fruits of litigation\n\n#### Ohio Conclusion\n\nTo be clear, noting that I found in Ohio law makes such an agreement a crime, even though it was on under ancient common law. In the *Rancman* case, it seems that no one was criminally prosecuted.\n\nSuch an agreement is not legal in Ohio only in the sense that the court will not enforce it. Thus no funding company who checks the law would, I expect, enter into such an agreement and risk the same fate as Interim Settlement, not even getting the money advanced back when the suit had been won by the plaintiff.\n\nNor is this case obscure \\-\\- a simple google search found it via the Wikipedia article, and other simple searches probably would also.\n\n### Notes\n\n1.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Ohio, a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit against an insurance company is approached by a third-party funding company. The company offers to provide the plaintiff with $10,000 now in exchange for 30% of any future judgment or settlement. The plaintiff agrees and signs a contract. After winning the lawsuit and receiving a $100,000 settlement, the plaintiff refuses to pay the funding company. What is the most likely outcome of this situation under Ohio law?\n\nA) The contract is enforceable, and the plaintiff must pay the funding company $30,000.\nB) The contract is void due to champerty, and the plaintiff keeps the entire $100,000 settlement.\nC) The contract is partially enforceable, and the plaintiff must repay the $10,000 plus reasonable interest.\nD) The plaintiff is guilty of a criminal offense for entering into a champertous agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in Rancman v. Interim Settlement Funding Corp., such an agreement would be considered champerty and maintenance. The court explicitly stated that these types of advances are \"void as champerty and maintenance regardless of whether they are loans or investments.\" The contract would therefore be unenforceable, and the plaintiff would likely be able to keep the entire settlement. The court's ruling in Rancman even left the funding company unable to recover their principal, suggesting a similar outcome here. While champerty was historically a crime, it is not currently a criminal offense in Ohio, merely making such contracts void and unenforceable. The court also would not partially enforce the contract or allow recovery of the principal plus interest, as demonstrated in the Rancman case."

My only baby sitter is now returning back to work due to the fact that I was approved to\nWork from home and after months of me battling, trying to manage with not leaving my job is to find a sitter which my luck is now running out. I explained everything of this with childcare to my manager and she agreed to let me work from home. She even took my off the schedule which I Have proof of also messages and emails getting me set up to work from home. So yesterday morning I looked at my email to see if it was approved, the request said rejected. I then saw my manager and she said that she had to speak with me, once we spoke she didn\u2019t even mention the fact that I was not approved and I have to report to work the next day. I had to mention it to her, what she said she had to speak with me about was totally different from the fact that she denied me to work from home. Her reason was because I had to do 4 days of training and she couldn\u2019t afford for me to be out of work for four days .... but she already took me off Te schedule and it\u2019s been two days now and people are covering me the days I was suppose to be off..... so how does she not have coverage if everyday I come in and see that an extra staff is here to cover me .....after me purchasing a laptop and going through everything I had to\nGo through just to be turned down even after being taken off the schedule. I\u2019m pregnant and I\u2019ve been crying every since because it\u2019s depressing to me that I now have to possibly quit my job because I can\u2019t battle with having a sitter anymore. Do I have a right to sue them for renege/false promises?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can't sue for false promise per se, but it might enter into a suit for something else. It sounds like your employer offered you a choice between coming in to work (extremely difficult), termination or furlough (extremely undesirable), versus working at home (the preferable option), and the latter was contingent on you doing things that relate to being able to work at home (get a computer and so on). Relying on that promise, you purchased a computer: but then they decided that you had to come in to work. Based just on that, you could sue them for damages (maybe the computer, maybe the added cost of finding a new babysitter, possibly loss of wages). They might want to argue that they don't owe you anything, but your lawyer would (legally) prevent them from making that argument, using what is known as [promissory estoppel](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/promissory_estoppel). You took certain actions based on their promise, so you are entitled to rely on that promise. Their counter\\-argument would probably be that you didn't do what you were supposed to do, and your attorney would respond that the company obstructed you from doing what had to be done, or had not taken reasonable steps to say in advance what was required of you.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An employee was promised the ability to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic if they purchased a laptop. The employee bought the laptop, but after weeks of technical difficulties and training delays, the employer rescinded the work-from-home offer. Which legal concept would be most relevant if the employee decided to sue the employer for damages?\n\nA) Breach of contract\nB) Promissory estoppel\nC) Negligent misrepresentation\nD) Unjust enrichment\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Breach of contract is incorrect because there was likely no formal contract established for the work-from-home arrangement.\n\nB) Promissory estoppel is the correct answer. This legal principle applies when one party relies on a promise made by another party and suffers a detriment as a result. In this case, the employee relied on the employer's promise of work-from-home arrangements and purchased a laptop, incurring costs based on that promise.\n\nC) Negligent misrepresentation doesn't fit as well because it typically involves a false statement of fact, rather than a promise of future action.\n\nD) Unjust enrichment is not the best fit here, as the employer didn't necessarily benefit from the employee's purchase of the laptop.\n\nPromissory estoppel is the most relevant concept as it specifically addresses situations where one party relies on another's promise to their detriment, even in the absence of a formal contract."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My teacher was explaining Equal Protection of Law to our class, actually he was explaining reasonable grounds for violation of Equal Protection of Law by State, and he explained it thus:\n\n**Suppose there is manufacturing company, and in that company there are, broadly, two types of work: hazardous and non\\-hazardous. The company made it a provision that the company will pay some percentage of the life insurance instalments of all of its employees; but the percentage of instalments for workers engaged in hazardous jobs, that the company will pay, is more than those engaged in non\\-hazardous jobs.* The employees of non\\-hazardous jobs moved to Court by alleging the company of violating the equal protection of law. But the Court upheld the company's decision by saying it a reasonable differentiation.*\n\nWell, upto now I was of the view that equal protection law meant that the government officials will not have any special protection from law, like it used to be in in 18th century or earlier that King can do nothing wrong, or protection of higher officials from being convicted in any Court of Law. I understood it as: if a President/Prime Minister commits a murder he shall be tried in the same may as any other private citizen would have been had he committed a murder.\n\nIn my teacher's explanation, there are many mistakes that I can discern:\n\n1. First, the company is not a State that make laws or a Court which tries anybody. The most we can say is that the company is State\\-owned. But still, law exercises its role of protection to people through Police or Courts, paying instalments of life insurance is not a legal protection.\n2. Equal Protection of Law has nothing to do with making special provisions for weaker sections, that topic fall in Welfare principles of State. Equal Protection applies only when someone is convicted or comes under the ambit of legal punishment. For example: if a person of a particular religion is prevented from entering a restaurant, he is surely offended, but he cannot sue the restaurant on grounds of Equal Protection of Law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are indeed some problems with the teacher's explanation as given in the question.\n\n> First, the company is not a State that make laws or a Court which tries anybody.\n\nThat is absolutely correct. The Equal Protection clause limits what state governments can do, It does not limit what a private company may do. However, States can pass laws restricting what private companies can do A state can, for example, pass \"equal pay\" laws, limiting the ability of a company to pay workers different amounts for similar jobs. But such laws are not mandated by the equal protection clause, in fact that have nothing to do with that clause.\n\n> But still, law exercises its role of protection to people through Police or Courts, paying instalments of life insurance is not a legal protection.\n\nEqual Protection applies to all operations of a state government (or of state agencies and local governments created by the state). It is by no means limited to \"Police or Courts\". It may affect payments to state or local government employees.\n\n> Equal Protection applies only when someone is convicted or comes under the ambit of legal punishment.\n\nThis is not at all correct. While unequal punishments for crimes may well raise Equal Protection issues, it is not the only or indeed the most common situation for such issues to come up. Equal protection issues can arise in any circumstance where the state government is treating people who are in similar circumstances differently without a good reason. (What constitutes a good reason varies, is complex, and often winds up decided by the courts.)\n\nFor example, where districts for the state legislature are of significantly different sizes, so that different people have effectively unequal voting strength, Federal courts **may** require changes in the district maps on Equal protection Grounds. If a state law treats men and women differently, there may be an Equal Protection violation. And of course, if it is alleged that a state government treats members of one race differently from members of another, that would be an Equal Protection claim. Many other circumstances are possible.\n\n> For example: if a person of a particular religion is prevented from entering a restaurant, he is surely offended, but he cannot sue the restaurant on grounds of Equal Protection of Law.\n\nNo, that would not be an Equal Protection violation, unless the rule denying entry was **required** by state law, as racial segregation was required in many places during the \"Jim Crow\" era. But such a restriction would violate both State and Federal anti\\-discrimination law. Currently every state has such laws, and they would all make such action by a restaurant owner unlawful.\n\n> I understood it as: if a President/Prime Minister commits a murder he shall be tried in the same may as any other private citizen would have been had he committed a murder.\n\nWhile a law which treated a government official accused of crime differently than a citizen who is not an official would probably be an equal protection violation, that is not a major application of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and was never the major purpose of it.\n\nIn fact the original purpose was to prevent, in the aftermath of the Civil War, laws that treated Blacks differently than Whites. But the clause has a much wider scope than that.\n\nHowever, a high official does in some cases have the authority to do or order things that would be criminal if done by a person without such authority. For example, The President can order military action which results in people being intentionally killed. In other circumstances, intentional killing would be murder or some other crime.\n\nBut a President accused of an act not justified by that person' lawful powers should be traded just as anyone else would be. For example, Vice President Spiro Agnew was accused of accepting bribes (before he became Vice President) and resigned from office as part of a plea agreement.\n\nOne exception: A US Justice Department Opinion says that a sitting President should not be criminally charged. This has never been tested in court, and is not a law, merely a legal opinion.",

It is not limited to criminal convictions (ruling out A), nor does it primarily apply to private companies (ruling out B). While it can affect how government officials are treated in legal proceedings, this is not its main focus (ruling out D).

The screenshot hasn't been modified at all: it's simply an image showing the program.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: US copyright law has an exception for *fair use*; small portions of a copyrighted work may be used without permission, license, or royalties if they are used for educational or demonstrative purposes.\n\nTaking *your own* screenshots of a commercial software product would probably be fair use.

Screenshots of commercial are often used in third party books and magazines with a fair use rationale; the *For Dummies* series is a great example.

Facebook was found to have failed in that regards, specifically when it came to access by US spy agencies. It seems indeed quite plausible that it is not possible to transfer personal data from the EU to the US in a way that is compatible with both EU and US law. The EU and the US are in negotiations to find a way to make this legally possible.\n\nBut until then, it seems that if you do have a European subsidary and want to keep all of your account data in the same place, it needs to be a place with robust privacy protections.

When you revise a work, the existing copyright still exists, and you have created a derivative work. \n\nIf copyright is held by a known person, the expiration date is author's death \\+ 70 years. In a work made for hire (the company owns the copyright), it is the earlier of is 95 years from first publication or the shorter of 120 years from creation. A revision does not generally affect the duration of copyright: however, if a joint work is created, the copyright on the underlying work expires relative to the death of the original author and the copyright on later parts created by a second (added) author is relative to the second author's death. So if A writes ch. 1\\-4 of a book, then adds ch. 5\\-8 subsequently with a new co\\-author B, duration of copyright for ch. 5\\-8 is determined relative to the death of B.

Once the order is made, is that the whole/entire official process?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcKoT.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcKoT.jpg) *Legal docudrama example as mentioned, shows a physical pen being theoretically used to demarcate. Once the order is made, is that the whole/entire official process?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My understanding is that \"the record\" only refers to the *official* record of the proceeding, e.g. the transcripts that would be kept on file and used as the basis for formal decisions. Such records are usually prepared after the fact by a court reporter based on their shorthand notes or audio recordings, so this indicates that the reporter should simply leave out the statement in question when creating those records, perhaps replacing it with a marking saying \"(stricken)\" or something of the sort.\n\n\"Stricken from the record\" doesn't indicate that the statement is to be kept secret or scrubbed from all history in some Orwellian fashion, merely that it should not be considered in any legal decision\\-making process (e.g. a judge's ruling). The decision should be made *as if* the statement had never been uttered.\n\nAnyone else in the courtroom \\-\\- lawyers, journalists, members of the public \\-\\- is free to remember it, write it down, publish it, shout it from the rooftops, or etch it into stone tablets, if they wish. No penalties exist for doing so. I also don't think there is any requirement to delete it from the court reporter's preliminary notes or audio recordings; again, only from the final official transcript.\n\n(There could be *other* situations where it is forbidden to record or divulge what was said: secret grand jury proceedings, material under seal, gag orders, etc. But those would all require some sort of regulation or order outside the usual meaning of the phrase \"strike from the record\".)",

When a judge orders to \"strike from the record,\" it primarily affects the official transcript used for legal decision-making. This means that the stricken statement should not appear in the final, official record of the proceedings that would be used as the basis for formal decisions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because \"strike from the record\" does not affect personal memories, notes, or media reports. People are free to remember and discuss what was said.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there is typically no requirement to delete the statement from the court reporter's preliminary notes or audio recordings. The instruction applies to the final official transcript.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the order does not restrict anyone's ability to discuss the statement outside the courtroom. There are no penalties for remembering or sharing stricken information unless there are other specific orders in place (e.g., gag orders).\n\nThe key point is that \"strike from the record\" is about ensuring the statement is not considered in legal decision-making, not about erasing it from existence or memory."

During this process, the Tesla collides with a pedestrian, causing injury. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the likely legal outcome of this situation?\n\nA) Tesla would be solely liable as the manufacturer of the self-driving technology.\nB) The pedestrian would be at fault for not being aware of self-driving vehicles in the parking lot.\nC) Sarah would likely be primarily liable, but may have a separate claim against Tesla if a malfunction is proven.\nD) The shopping center would be liable for allowing self-driving vehicles in their parking lot.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, as explained in the documentation, the owner of the vehicle is generally responsible for its operation, even when using automated features. Sarah, as the owner who initiated the \"Smart Summon\" feature, would likely be held primarily liable for any accidents that occur during its use. This is analogous to being responsible for a car rolling down a hill due to a faulty parking brake.\n\nHowever, the documentation also mentions that the owner might have a separate civil claim against the manufacturer (in this case, Tesla) if a malfunction or fault in the self-driving system can be proven. This doesn't absolve Sarah of primary liability but opens up the possibility of a secondary claim against Tesla.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it places sole liability on Tesla, which doesn't align with current legal interpretations of vehicle owner responsibility. Answer B is incorrect as pedestrians generally have the right of way in parking lots and are not expected to be on constant alert for self-driving vehicles. Answer D is incorrect because the shopping center typically wouldn't be held liable for the actions of individual vehicles in their parking lot, especially when those actions are initiated by the vehicle's owner."

Even if this was a calculated and intentional effort to inflict emotional distress upon her, proving that this is why it happened would be exceedingly hard in most cases (absent some sort of whistleblowing informant).\n\nIf she had a lease with a two\\-sided attorney fees clause and had to hire a lawyer to establish that she paid the rent and can't be evicted, however, she might be able to recover nominal damages of $1 and her attorney fees fighting the acts taken towards a wrongful eviction as a breach of contract.\n\nBut emotional distress damages are not available in connection with breaches of contract with only rare and narrow exceptions not applicable here (e.g. bad faith breaches of insurance contracts, contracts to dispose of a deceased person's remains, and perhaps surrogacy contracts).",

However, her chances of success are very low. Negligent infliction of emotional distress is not applicable in this case as there's no physical injury involved. Intentional infliction of emotional distress would require proving that the landlord deliberately acted to cause Jane emotional harm, which is extremely difficult to establish and unlikely in this scenario. While Jane cannot be completely barred from suing, the circumstances make it highly improbable that she would succeed in court unless she can provide extraordinary evidence of the landlord's malicious intent.

As a plaintiff, you receive a settlement of $100,000. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tax implications of this settlement?\n\nA) The entire $100,000 settlement is tax-free because it's compensation for physical injuries.\nB) You must report the full $100,000 as taxable income on your tax return.\nC) The taxability of the settlement depends on the specific nature of the damages awarded, and you should consult IRS Publication 4345 for guidance.\nD) Only the portion of the settlement covering legal fees is taxable; the rest is tax-free.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The taxability of a lawsuit settlement can vary significantly depending on the nature of the case and the specific damages awarded. IRS Publication 4345 provides detailed guidance on how different types of settlements are treated for tax purposes. In a product liability case, some portions of the settlement (such as compensation for physical injuries) may be tax-free, while others (like punitive damages) may be taxable. It's crucial to carefully review the settlement agreement and consult IRS guidelines or a tax professional to determine the correct tax treatment. Options A and D are incorrect because they make absolute statements that may not apply in all cases. Option B is also incorrect as it assumes all settlement money is always taxable, which is not necessarily true for all types of damages awarded in a lawsuit."

I assume that is what you mean by \"tell him not prescribe people from our town\". Additionally, the courts of one state only have jurisdiction over actions in that state, so an Idaho judge cannot restrain a doctor's practice in Washington. The fact that a customer is an Idaho resident does not change that.\n\nPolice can give orders in furtherance of their official duties. Generally, that relates to immediate situations, such as an order to sit on the ground (during an arrest), step aside (when executing a search warrant), and the like. It depends on the state, but many states have \"emergency powers\" laws that allow the governor to give orders (such as evacuation) as are felt to be required in an emergency, and that authority may be transmitted to local police. If the governor (of that state) issued such an order, then police of the other state could enforce it (but that hasn't happened).\n\nIf an officer felt that the people from one town were selling oxycodone, he might feel that as a citizen, he should try to persuade the local doctor to stop writing those prescriptions.

The police officer can attempt to persuade the doctor as a citizen, but lacks the legal authority to enforce such a demand across state lines. Only courts have the power to order a licensed medical practitioner to refrain from writing legal prescriptions, and even then, courts in one state don't have jurisdiction over a doctor's practice in another state. The police officer's demand has no legal backing without a court order, and persuasion is the only legal option available. Options A and B are incorrect because the police officer doesn't have the authority to make or enforce such demands across state lines. Option D is incorrect because while governors may have emergency powers, these typically don't extend to controlling medical practices in other states."

What I mean by meta\\-data is parts of the contract regarding how the contract itself is applied and interpreted.

What do you call the main intent that would make up the body? For example if a property management company wanted to have a contract for lawn maintenance what would you call the active portion like:\n\n\"Company XYZ agrees to water and cut the grass every Thursday afternoon for Company ABC. Company ABC will compensate XYZ, $600 per lawn. XYZ must not use any poisonous chemicals on the lawn\". \n\nHow would the entire contract be structured? I've seen labels used for exampling having a specific \"severability\" heading, but I've never seen a \"main body\" heading. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is **never** meta\\-data in a contract. \n\nEverything in a contract is either a term or a warranty.

According to [\"An artist\u2019s guide to copyrights\"](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/an-artists-guide-to-copyrights) by Laura Levin\\-Dando:\n\n> a broad range of creative works, such as photographs, visual art, audio recordings, sheet music, novels, and screenplays. If you expended creative effort to make something, you created it independently without copying someone else\u2019s work, and it is embodied in a physical format\n\nTherefore, things that deemed to **lack creative value** or are **facts** (phone numbers) cannot be copyrighted. Where does this leave sequence of characters like digital signatures or hashes? They arguably don't have artistic value on its own \\- while they are unique, it just machine\\-generated sequence of bytes. It would be different if, for example, you used bunch of existing or valid hashes to compose them in ASCII art \\- but it would protect that piece of ASCII art only, wouldnt it?\nPlus, from my point of view \\- they are factual things. `Windows.dll` version `1.0.2.003` has md5hash `aea603dba12c6e23b7b0ab9db4f81120` \\- this is a fact. A file, containing list of hashes for list of files is not copyright protected on its own, even if it is a part of something which partially protected by copyright (software, video game).\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nP.S. If we delve into patent territory, then you can patent the mechanism by which has generated but not the product \\-\\- hash/digital signature \\-\\- itself.\n\nP.P.S I'm talking in this specific case about signatures used to sign files but not the authoritative ones like SLL Certificates, signed and what not or personal digital signatures. Just a signature for the encrypted container that is regenerated anew every time it is created.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The quote in the question and the question text both imply that what is protected by copyright is \"creative effort\" or \"creative value\". In [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law at least, the test is \"originality\". In many, probably most, cases these will be the same. But there can be things with \"creative value\" that are not considered original enough for copyright protection, or in some other way are not subject to copyright protection. Individual words or short phrases such as the titles of works are not protected by copyright, even if they have creative value, for example. An improvised song or dance that is not recorded is not protected, however creative it may have been, because it was not \"fixed in a tangible form\".\n\nHowever, a hash computed from a text is indeed a fact, just as a statement of the number of characters the text contains, and it would not be protected by copyright. The hash algorithm might or might not be protected by patent, and the code to a hash program might be protected by copyright. But the resulting hash value will not be protected by either.",

While the algorithm used to generate a hash value might be patentable, and the code for a hash program could be protected by copyright, the resulting hash value itself is considered a fact and is not protected by copyright. This aligns with the principle that facts and items lacking sufficient originality or creativity are not copyrightable. Options A and D are incorrect because they mistakenly assume that uniqueness or the nature of digital signatures and hashes automatically confers copyright protection. Option B is partially true in that an artistic arrangement of hash values (like ASCII art) could be copyrightable, but the individual hash values themselves would still not be protected."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it, the \"Right to Remain Silent\" errs on the side of innocence in the USA justice system.\nJurors are usually supposed to rule as if the defendant testified in the manner voiced by his attorney\n(in opening and closing arguments) even if the defendant does not really testify.\n\nWhat would be the harm in removing this right when questions are asked through his attorney with a long\nallowed response time? For example, suppose the judicial system (and even the police in the executive\nsystem) allowed questions like \"Were you inside your house at any time on March 30, 2021?\" and required\nan answer of either \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"I don't recall\" (with allowance for further supplemental information\nif the defendant wants to clarify further). There might be a limit of only a few such forced questions,\nbut answers to these forced questions are all admissible in court. It's important to realize that the\nattorney fields these questions for the defendant, so direct police interviews still would be refused.\n\nOf course, some defendant accused of murdering his wife on March 30 would rather not answer this question\nif he was truly at home with her. But, jurors would know that this incriminating evidence was forced\nout. So, jurors get more information in the end and can stay open to circumstances which allow the\ndefendant to still be innocent.\n\nI'm ultimately looking for alternative justice systems which drop the \"Right to Remain Silent\". There\nare many cases in the current system where defendants don't even try to give an alibi and this often puts\na wasteful burden on investigators. Are there any such candidate justice systems in other countries? or\nam I missing something that makes such a system impossible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe \"right to remain silent \" is a feature of US law, inherited, like much of the basic structure of US law, from the British law of the late 1700s. The right is also retained in modern UK law, in a somewhat different form.\n\nThe laws of many countries that do not inherit their legal system from the English/British source do not include the right. For example, the legal system of France does not. Such a system is clearly possible and need not be an arrant tyranny. Whether such a right improves the justice and fairness of the system could be debated, but it is not essential.\n\nNote that it is not the case that a jury must pretend that a defendant would have testified in accord with a defense lawyer's opening statement. Indeed the jury is routinely told that opening statements are not evidence and should not be regarded as such. But a US jury is instructed that it should not draw any inference or conclusion of guilt because a defendant remains silent. A defendant is entitled, by remaining silent to in effect say to the state \"Prove it!\" and need not offer a competing version of the events of the alleged crime. In UK law, an accused person's failure to deny the crime may be considered at the trial.\n\nHistorical origin\n-----------------\n\nThe right arose as a reaction against certain specific practices considered to be abusive and unfair. In several English courts, particularly the [Court of the Star Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber), the practice arose of compelling suspected persons to attend and asking them under oath if they had commuted various illegal acts. If such a suspect had in fact committed the act asked about, then the suspect had the choice of confessing to a criminal act that carried a severe penalty (often death), or committing perjury, which was both a criminal act and was widely believed to be a grave sin, possibly condemning a person's soul to hell. Or if the accused remained silent, a serious punishment for contempt of court could be imposed, and that might be treated as evidence of guilt.\n\nThese practices contributed to the abolition of the Star Chamber court in 1641\\. The right to silence seems to have been established in English law after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, as described in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence#History), although it was not fully established until well into the 18th century.\n\nCurrent US Practice\n-------------------\n\nThe right in the US not only applies during a trial for the protection of the accused.\n\nThe right permits a person being questioned by the police to refuse to answer questions, with the assurance that such refusal may not later be used in court to help convict the suspect. Many lawyers advise anyone questioned by the police who are or might be under suspicion to refuse to answer any questions at all.\n\nThe right also means that a witness who is not a defendant may not, in a criminal or civil trial, be required to answer a question if the answer might later be used to help convict that person of a crime.\n\nThere are other implications of the right, and the details are too long to go into in this answer \u2013 whole books have been written about the right and what it does and does not cover, and the reasons behind it.\n\nThe general principle may be taken to be that when the government accuses a person of crime, it must undertake to prove the crime by its own resources, not compel the accused to assist in the process.\n\nA system in which an accused is required to respond to specific questions can be imagined. To some extent it has existed at various times and places. It need not involve torture or coerced confession, but could require an accused, during a trial, to respond to specific questions. It would violate the principle that the state must make its case without help from the accused. The value of that principle can be debated.\n\nOther Legal systems\n-------------------\n\nIn the article [\"French Criminal Procedures\u2014Surprising Features of a French Trial](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/insight-french-criminal-procedures-surprising-features-of-a-french-trial) from Bloomberg, it is said that:\n\n> **The \u201cright to silence\u201d is limited.** During a trial, the judges usually turn to the defendant and ask for the defendant\u2019s response to the evidence in the record. A refusal to respond will lead to a strong inference of guilt. A defendant is not, however, put under oath.",

In the US legal system, the right to remain silent is strongly protected, and a defendant's silence cannot be used as evidence of guilt. Jurors are instructed not to draw any negative inferences from a defendant's choice not to testify. \n\nIn contrast, the French system has a more limited right to silence. During a trial, judges typically ask defendants to respond to evidence, and a refusal to respond can lead to a strong inference of guilt. This key difference highlights how the two systems approach the balance between a defendant's rights and the court's pursuit of truth.\n\nOption A is incorrect because US defendants are not required to testify. Option B is false because the French system does not have an absolute right to silence during trial. Option D is incorrect because French defendants are not put under oath when responding to judges' questions."

However, the majority opinion holds that Kennedy's prayer was protected by both the Free Exercise *and* Free Speech Clauses.\n\nThis would seem to suggest nonreligious speech, such as political speech, may also be protected if delivered in a similar manner to Kennedy's prayers. To what extent does the ruling guarantee a teacher's a right to express political opinions?\n\nFor example, suppose a coach wanted to \"take a knee\" a la Kaepernick in protest of police brutality, or give a midfield land acknowledgment denouncing America's colonial past. Is it constitutionally permissible for the school district to prohibit this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think Kennedy v. Bremerton would have much effect, because there has been little question that governments cannot prohibit the expression of a political viewpoint. There have been a number of rulings based on the Establishment Clause which say that it is impermissible for the government to establish a particular religion, or religions in general, which has resulted in a struggle between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, leading to a particular resolution in Kennedy v. Bremerton. I see nothing new in that opinion that bears on Free Speech. We can paraphrase the tail end of the holding in the opinion for any such future case: \"a government entity sought to punish an individual for engaging in a personal political expression, based on a\nmistaken view that it has a duty to suppress political expressions ~~even as it allows comparable secular speech~~. The Constitution neither\nmandates nor tolerates that kind of discrimination\". Since there is nothing that vaguely suggests that it is okay to suppress political expression, nothing fancy is required to conclude that the school cannot suppress political expression.",

The Kennedy v.

This aligns with existing protections for political speech.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the case focused on religious expression, the principles apply more broadly to protected speech, including political expression.\n\nAnswer B is too extreme. While the ruling supports teachers' rights to express views, it doesn't grant unrestricted rights. There are still limitations related to disrupting school functions or other established boundaries on teacher speech.\n\nAnswer C correctly captures the nuance that the ruling reinforces existing protections for political speech, acknowledging that such speech is protected but not without any limitations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it goes against the fundamental principle of free speech protection.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background\n==========\n\nMarbury V. Madison established the practice of Judicial review in the United States, though the principle existed before the case. This gave the Supreme Court power to invalidate laws, or portions of laws, that it found unconstitutional. By the same token, it limited the Supreme Court to a court of appeals with respect to [writs of mandamus](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/5us137) and not as a court with original jurisdiction on the matter.\n\nMarbury v. Madison, like any other Supreme Court case, is subject to being overturned either by the Supreme Court, or by amendment to the constitution. If this were to happen, that means the Judicial Act of 1789 regains full force of the law, and presumably the power to issue writs of Mandamus with original jurisdiction. But there is another part of the case that led me to ask this question...\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nIf Marbury v Madison was overturned, thereby reinstating in full the Judicial Act of 1789, does this also mean that the Surpeme Court loses the power of Judicial review? And, if so, does this loss of power apply to all cases where it has been applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Marbury V. Madison* did not establish judicial review. It was simply the first case where that power was used. It was clearly spelled out in [**The Federalist** \\#78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._78) that this power would exist in the new constitution, and those who voted to ratify it understood, or should have understood, that it would exist.\n\nAll that *Marbury V. Madison* decided was that the Supreme court did not have original jurisdiction to issue Writs of *Mandamus* That could be overturned, or the constitution could be amended to grant such jurisdiction to SCOTUS. That would not have any major effects on the US judicial system as far as I can tell.\n\nI suppose that the constitution could be amended so as to deny the power of judicial review to the courts. But I think the resulting system would be potentially unstable, and this would require a far more fundamental change than simply \"overruling *Marbury V. Madison*\"\n\nAs \\#78 of *The Federalist* said:\n\n> By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex\\-post\\-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, **whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.** Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between Marbury v. Madison and the concept of judicial review in the United States?\n\nA) Marbury v. Madison established judicial review, which was not previously conceived of in American jurisprudence.\n\nB) Marbury v. Madison was the first case to use judicial review, but the concept was already outlined in The Federalist Papers.\n\nC) Marbury v. Madison created judicial review, overruling previous understandings of the Constitution's intent.\n\nD) Marbury v. Madison limited judicial review by restricting the Supreme Court's ability to issue writs of mandamus.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The passage clearly states that Marbury v. Madison \"did not establish judicial review\" but was \"simply the first case where that power was used.\" It goes on to explain that judicial review was \"clearly spelled out in The Federalist #78\" and that those who ratified the Constitution understood this power would exist. Option B correctly captures this relationship, noting that while Marbury v. Madison was the first application of judicial review, the concept predated the case and was outlined in The Federalist Papers. Options A and C are incorrect because they suggest Marbury v. Madison created or established judicial review, which contradicts the passage. Option D is incorrect because it misinterprets the case's impact on judicial review; while it did limit the Court's original jurisdiction regarding writs of mandamus, it did not limit judicial review itself."

The \u00ae, barely visible in the blown\\-up picture below, is reduced to a small, vaguely pinkish dot on any device where the app may be found running, making its interior \"R\" practically indiscernible.\n\nI am wondering whether the implied presence of this symbol is still capable of carrying any legal force considering that the symbol itself cannot be made out.\n\n[![Enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXVL8.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXVL8.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") trademark law, [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1111) provides that:\n\n> **Notice of registration; display with mark; recovery of profits and damages in infringement suit**\n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1072 of this title, a registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, may give notice that his mark is registered by displaying with the mark the words \"Registered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\" or \"Reg. U.S. Pat. \\& Tm. Off.\" or the letter R enclosed within a circle, thus \u00ae; and in any suit for infringement under this chapter by such a registrant failing to give such notice of registration, no profits and no damages shall be recovered under the provisions of this chapter unless the defendant had actual notice of the registration.\n\nNotice that display of the symbol is optional, the registrant \"**may** give notice\" by using the phrase or the \u00ae symbol. But if such notice is not given a significant element of damages in case of an infringement is forfeit unless the infringer had \"actual notice\" of the registration of the mark.\n\nSince the purpose is to give notice that a word, symbol, logo or other indication is in fact a registered mark, making the registration so small that it cannot easily be seen might tend to defeat that purpose. If an infringer claimed not to be aware that an indication was a registered mark, and if the notice was displayed or printed in so small a form that this claim was plausible, it **might** raise an issue in an infringement suit. I have not found any caselaw on the point.\n\n[\"Finessing the Details of Type: Registered, Trademark, \\& Copyright Symbols\"](https://creativepro.com/finessing-details-type-registered-trademark-copyright-symbols/) by Ilene Strizver advises that:\n\n> These symbols are used at so small a size that they should be neutral in appearance, yet clear at the size they will be reproduced at ... when using a \u00ae or a \u2122 after a word, the size should be adjusted as necessary, independently from the rest of the text, to look clear and legible, yet unobtrusive. Its proportion next to the neighboring word or glyph depends a lot on the final size of each appearance. A general guideline for text is to make these symbols a little smaller than half the x\\-height. As the type gets larger, the symbols can become proportionately smaller, especially in headlines.\n\nHowever this is a guide for typesetters and graphic designers, and is not legal advice.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that a single use of the R\\-in\\-a\\-circle in connection with a particular mark in any given document or set of packaging is sufficient (as is also mentioned in a comment). If elsewhere in the same web site the logo is displayed in a larger size, with a larger version of the symbol, that would probably offer all the protection needed under US law.\n\nThis answer is US\\-centric. Law elsewhere may or may not be similar.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The company has fully protected its trademark and can claim full damages in any infringement case.\n\nB) The company has lost all legal protection for its trademark due to improper display of the \u00ae symbol.\n\nC) The company may face challenges in claiming certain damages in an infringement case if the defendant claims they were unaware of the trademark's registered status.\n\nD) The size of the \u00ae symbol has no bearing on trademark protection as long as it's present somewhere on the app or website.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to U.S. trademark law (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111), while displaying the \u00ae symbol is optional, failing to give proper notice of registration can limit the recovery of profits and damages in an infringement case unless the defendant had actual notice of the registration. Making the \u00ae symbol so small that it's barely visible could potentially defeat the purpose of giving notice. If an infringer claimed they were unaware the mark was registered due to the symbol's tiny size, it might raise issues in an infringement suit. Therefore, while the company hasn't lost all protection, it may face challenges in claiming certain damages if the defendant can plausibly argue they didn't notice the registration symbol."

From the [relevant legislation](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/ending-a-tenancy/pets) it says it is possible for leases to expresily prohibit pets. Assuming the lease does not expresiley prohibit or allow pets, can a landlord terminate tenancy because the tenant has a pet?

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in British Columbia rents an apartment with a lease that does not explicitly mention pets. The tenant adopts a well-behaved dog that causes no damage or disturbance. The landlord discovers the dog and immediately issues a 10-day eviction notice. What is the most accurate assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The landlord's action is legal and the tenant must vacate within 10 days.\nB) The landlord's action is illegal as pets are allowed when not explicitly prohibited in the lease.\nC) The landlord must first issue a \"breach letter\" before considering eviction.\nD) The tenant can keep the dog if they agree to pay an additional pet deposit.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the provided information, if a lease doesn't explicitly prohibit pets, then pets are allowed unless they cause damage or other problems. In this scenario, the lease does not mention pets, and the dog is well-behaved and causes no issues. Therefore, the landlord cannot evict the tenant or take any action against them for having a pet.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the landlord's action is not legal in this situation. The 10-day eviction notice is not justified when pets are not prohibited and are not causing problems.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because there is no breach of the lease agreement in this case. A \"breach letter\" would only be applicable if pets were explicitly prohibited in the lease or if the pet was causing damage or disturbance.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the tenant already has the right to keep the pet under these circumstances. There's no need for an additional pet deposit or agreement change when pets are not prohibited by the original lease."

For UK citizenship applications, the 12-month period of permanent residence is calculated from the date you were granted permanent residency status, not from when you received the physical card or the start date of the period covered by the card. In Sarah's case, this would be December 2015, as stated in her documentation.
