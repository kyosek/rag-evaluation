Hartford*, 204 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. Feb. 29, 2000\\) (holding that the Gender Motivated Violence Act (GMVA) applied to targeting of a transgender person) and *Parents for Privacy v. Barr*, No.18\\-35708 (9th Cir. Feb. 12, 2020\\) (rejecting arguments that a school policy protecting transgender students violated other students' rights).\n\nTo the extent that the Montana law was used in an attempt to do an end run around existing federal law protections of transgender individuals, it would probably be struck down as applied under the supremacy clause. Various other federal courts have found that transgender individuals are protected under:\n\n* The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n* Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,\n* Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972,\n* The Equal Credit Opportunity Act,\n* Title VII, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act,\n* Title IX of the Affordable Care Act,\n* The Fair Housing Act, and\n* The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to grant certiorari to review or overturn these decisions protecting transgender rights (which isn't to say that it couldn't adopt new precedents overruling these decisions in the future).\n\nSo, in almost all areas where sex discrimination is prohibited under federal law, the Montana statute would have to yield to federal law. Federal law protections against sex discrimination aren't all encompassing, but the federal courts have not hesitated to invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment when no statutory protections apply. So, there probably aren't many circumstances in which this law could have a meaningful effect.\n\nThe fact that a Montana state law might say otherwise is irrelevant.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recently specifically made clear to the Montana Supreme Court that it may not enforce state laws that violate federal law stating:\n\n> The Supremacy Clause provides that \u201cthe Judges in every State shall be\n> bound\u201d by the Federal Constitution, \u201cany Thing in the Constitution or\n> Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Art.

Ed. 2d 679 (June 30, 2020\\).\n\nSimilarly, in another not too ancient case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that:\n\n> The question presented in this case is whether the holding of\n> *Citizens United* applies to the Montana state law. There can be no serious doubt that it does. *See* U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2\\.\n\n*Am. Tradition Partn., Inc. v.

I'm not a lawyer, but from reading the original Constitution and all the amendments, I don't see anything that empowers Congress to enact such a law. I would have thought that allowing resident aliens to vote would be up to the individual states. What is the Constitutional basis for this law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DNR: Madison, Hamilton, Justice Harlan \\& Justice Scalia agree with you. Justice Black does not. \n\nYou raise an interesting question. As you point out, the Qualifications Clause, Art I, \u00a7 2\\.1, (those who vote for the House of Representatives \u201cin each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature\u201d) gives states the power to establish voter qualifications. Yet 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611, passed as part of the *Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act* of 1996, (the IIRIRA) makes it illegal for most aliens to vote in federal elections. What gives? \n\nFirst, the IIRIRA is purely symbolic. *It literally has no effect on who can vote in the US*. For almost a century, every state has prohibited aliens from voting in state elections. Under the Qualifications Clause, this means no aliens can vote in federal elections. (Before WWI, many states allowed aliens to vote.) \n\nSecond, some people argue Congress has control over voter qualifications under the \"Elections Clause,\" Art. I, \u00a7 4\\.1, which gives Congress the power to regulate the \"Times Places and Manners of holding elections.\" Like Dale M, these people read, \"Manners of holding elections\u201d to include the qualifications for voting.\n\nThis reading of the Elections Clause is inconsistent with several of the sources of constitutional authority Americans typically consult, including the text, the intent of the Founder and precedent. All of these support the \u201cQualifications Clause\u201d reading of the Constitution. \n\n1\\) **Constitutional Text**: Reading the Elections Clause as giving Congress control over voter qualifications, renders the Qualifications Clause almost completely meaningless. Yet everyone agrees the Constitution should be read so that all its parts mean something \u2013 no part should be rendered superfluous. \n\n2\\) **Intent of the Founders**: When the Founders debated voting qualifications, they were clearly worried that politicians would manipulate the electoral rules to favor them. The Founders believed the Qualifications Clause kept both national and state politicians from stacking the electoral deck. First, by giving the power of deciding who could vote to the states, the Clause prevented national politicians from choosing their own electorate. Secondly, by requiring the states to use the same qualifications for voters in state and national elections, the Clause prevented state politicians from manipulating the rules in national elections. \n\nAs for the Electoral Clause, in Federalist 60, Hamilton was clear who controlled voter qualifications: \u201cThe qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen\u2026are unalterable by the \\[federal] legislature\u2026\u201d \n\n3\\) **Precedent and practice**: For most of our history, people acted consistently with Hamilton\u2019s statement. They tolerated a wide variation in who was allowed to vote across states. As noted above, many of those states specifically allowed aliens to vote. (And, starting in 1787 with the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Congress passed a series of laws allowing aliens to vote in territories.) When Americans did make nationwide changes to voting qualifications, they did so by amending the Constitution. \n\nThere are only a handful of Supreme Court decisions involving federal control over voting qualifications. In 1970 the Supreme Court upheld a federal law changing the voting age to 18\\. The opinion of the Court, written by Justice Black, relied on the Elections Clause to say that Congress had the power to change voting requirements. None of the other Justices shared Black's views on the Elections Clause. Instead, they agreed with Justice Harlan, who said, \u201cnothing\u201d in the Constitution, \u201clends itself to the view that voting qualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.\u201d (These Justices used the Equal Protection Clause as the basis for federal control over voter qualifications.) \n\nSince then, no Justice has followed Justice Black. Instead, they have followed Justice Harlan. For example, in 2013, Justice Scalia, (in an opinion joined by Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan, Kennedy, Roberts, and Sotomayor) said, \u201cthe Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.\u201d \n\nFrom this evidence, I\u2019d say you were right to be puzzled about the constitutional authority for the IIRIRA. A federal law preventing aliens from voting in federal elections undermines the text of the constitution by rendering the Qualifications Clause superfluous, goes against the clear intent of the Founders, and is inconsistent with 200\\+ years of history and precedent.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this policy?\n\nA) This policy is illegal because U.S. currency must be accepted for all transactions as per federal law.\nB) The restaurant can refuse cash only if they display clear signage about their no-cash policy at the entrance.\nC) This policy is legal unless there is a specific state law mandating that businesses must accept cash.\nD) The restaurant can refuse cash only for purchases under $20, as larger amounts must be accepted in legal tender.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Federal Reserve, there is no federal statute requiring private businesses to accept cash as payment for goods or services. Businesses are free to set their own payment policies unless restricted by state law. Option A is incorrect because while U.S. currency is legal tender for debts, private businesses are not obligated to accept it for all transactions. Option B is a good practice but not a legal requirement. Option D is a misconception; there's no federal law specifying amount thresholds for cash acceptance.

I may be able to claim damages from a civil lawsuit. However, I was curious as to whether, if a person does not read the Terms of Service and violates them in a substantial way, would the person have criminal intent, recklessness, or negligence? In some cases, it may be clear without the Terms of Service that you cannot, for example, spread a virus or delete data from the server.\n\nThis is also true for a contract as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, a ToS document for a web site or online service is simply a contract or agreement. Normally violations of such an agreement are possible grounds for a civil suit, but are not crimes.\n\nMoreover, some terms that some TOS documents claim are not legally enforceable. For example some insist that a user waive a right that the law says cannot be waived.\n\nThe kind of terms mentioned ion the question are probably enforceable in most jurisdictions.\n\nIf a person intentionally supplies false information to a site operator or service provider, with the intention of gaining some financial benefit that would not be available without the false statements, under circumstances where it would be reasonable for the site operator to rely on the statements, that would be fraud in many jurisdictions. Fraud is often a matter for a civil suit, but in some cases it can be a crime also. Those cases vary in different jurisdictions, and the question does not specify any particular jurisdiction.\n\nCriminal fraud is the only case where I can think of where a ToS violation would be a crime.\n\nSome TOS documents prohibit things which are already crimes. For example a communication site might include in its ToS that users are not to use it to assist in committing a crime, or to unlawfully harass someone. If a user violated those provisions, they would also be committing a crime, but only because those actions would be crimes even if the TOS had never mentioned them.\n\nIt is a crime to plan a murder via a chat site, whether the TOS says so or not. But that is because it is a crime to plan a murder in general, with nor without the chat site.\n\nThere are some specifically online crimes. For example, posting so\\-called \"revenge porn\" is a crime in many jurisdictions. But that is a crime because of a law against it, not because of a TOS that prohibits it.\n\nIn all usual cases, a ToS violation will be dealt with via a civil suit, or by limiting or canceling the user's access, if it is dealt with at all.\n\nCFAA\n----\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the Computer fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), specifically 18 U. S. C. \u00a71030(a)(2\\), makes it a crime for anyone who\n\n> ... intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access ...\n\nThe recent case of [*Van Buren v. United States*, 593 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2021\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/593/19-783/#tab-opinion-4435485) dealt with the \"exceeds authorized access\" language. (See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States)) In that case, Van Buren, a police officer, accessed official databases to determine id the holder of a given license plate was in fact an undercover police officer. Van Buren thought that this information was being provided to a criminal, and was paid $6,000 for it. Van Buren knew that the access policy prohibited access for \"personal use\" or any \"non\\-official purpose\". He was charged with a felony violation of the CFAA on the ground that he accessed information with an \"improper purpose\", although he would have been authorized to access that same information with a proper purpose. After a long discussion of the meanign of the words \"so\" and \"entitled\" in the stsatute, the court opnion says:\n\n> If the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause criminalizes every violation of a computer\\-use policy, then millions of otherwise law\\-abiding citizens are criminals. Take the workplace. Employers commonly state that computers and electronic devices can be used only for business purposes. So on the Government\u2019s reading of the statute, an employee who sends a personal e\\-mail or reads the news using her work computer has violated the CFAA. Or consider the Internet. Many websites, services, and databases\u2014which provide \u201cinformation\u201d from \u201cprotected computer\\[s],\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2\\)(C)\u2014authorize a user\u2019s access only upon his agreement to follow specified terms of service. If the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause encompasses violations of circumstance\\-based access restrictions on employers\u2019 computers, it is difficult to see why it would not also encompass violations of such restrictions on website providers\u2019 computers. And indeed, numerous amici explain why the Government\u2019s reading of subsection (a)(2\\) would do just that\u2014criminalize everything from embellishing an online\\-dating profile to using a pseudonym on Facebook.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> ... For example, one police department might prohibit using a confidential database for a non\\-law\\-enforcement purpose (an access restriction), while another might prohibit using information from the database for a non\\-law\\-enforcement purpose (a use restriction). Conduct like Van Buren\u2019s can be characterized either way, and an employer might not see much difference between the two. On the Government\u2019s reading, however, the conduct would violate the CFAA only if the employer phrased the policy as an access restriction. An interpretation that stakes so much on a fine distinction controlled by the drafting practices of private parties is hard to sell as the most plausible.\n> \n> \n> In sum, an individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d when he accesses a computer with authorization but then obtains information located in particular areas of the computer\u2014such as files, folders, or databases\u2014that are off limits to him.\n\nThis case clearly says that a person who has authorization to access a computer, but does so for a purpose prohibited by system policy, perhaps as expressed n a TOS contract, is not subject to criminal prosecution under the CFAA. It does not directly deal with the case where, as a condition of access, a person must furnish truthful ID information, or comply with some other condition, and whether violating such a condition would constitute a crime under the CFAA.

This document states that the title insurance company is insuring and guaranteeing that a certain person will own the property free and clear subject to only specified encumbrances and easements of record, if certain steps are taken (i.e. if the required documents are paid at closing and the identified debts are paid in the amounts listed).

However, you gamble there: you'd need to convince the police that you have justification, and the Japanese police does not like people carrying any such items at all.

The accountant then accidentally put the spray in his pocket when cycling and was met by police, resulting in the suit. The judge ruled, as far as I understand it, that on the job with money the spray was ok.

Instead, prosecution for not abiding by those laws *under circumstances of emergency* would lead to the absurd outcome of penalizing (*ex\\-post*) people's efforts toward stopping the spread of the virus. Thus, it is a matter of balancing the *competing interests* of constitutional/statutory freedoms on the one side, and public policy or the common good on the other side.\n\nAs an example, consider the US government's likely decision to restrict or prohibit *interstate travel*. This prohibition seems justifiable as an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. \n\nAn infected person could complain in terms of [*U.S. v. Guest*, 383 US 745, 758 (1966\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19661128383us74511071) (\"*freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution*\", citing cases). However, leaving that person's *freedom of movement* unaltered exposes the population of the destination \\[virus\\-free] state(s) to a high risk of contagion, which is precisely what the government intended to prevent.\n\nMost examples have to do with the *freedom of movement*. In addition to that, any form of quarantine or a prohibition to attend gatherings might also be construed as a hindrance to people's *freedom of expression* or their *right to assemble* as premised on the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment). The rationale is inline with [the argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association#United_States_Constitution) that \"*people can engage in effective speech only when they join others*\". But, similar to the previous example, the risk and impact of contagion are too high to preserve or remedy the person's said rights under a situation that can easily get \\-\\-or might already be getting\\-\\- out of control.\n\nNote: This is not intended to be an exhaustive answer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between existing U.S. laws and efforts to control the spread of the virus?\n\nA) Existing laws explicitly prohibit measures that could slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nB) There are no legal conflicts between controlling the pandemic and constitutional rights.\n\nC) Laws impeding pandemic control efforts were specifically created in response to COVID-19.\n\nD) Certain constitutional rights may conflict with public health measures, requiring a balance between individual freedoms and collective safety.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the main point of the given text.

Bob\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance covers damage to his house up to a total rebuild costing 100k and covers personal liability up to another 100k. However, a court finds Bob liable for paying Mary\u2019s medical bills, which are more than 200k. Can the court order that the insurance payout all go to Mary and none of it go to rebuilding Bob\u2019s house?

So, if a court finds that Bob must pay Mary $200k then Bob must pay Mary $200k. Bob can then turn to his insurer to indemnify him and, under the terms of the policy, they will pay out $100k for personal liability leaving Bob to find the other $100k wherever he can.\n\nThe insurance company would not be a party to the litigation (although it would handle the defence on *behalf* of the insured) so a court cannot order it to do anything. Further there are many, many cases where the insured is found liable for something which the policy (allegedly) doesn\u2019t cover \\- this often leads to litigation between the insured and the insurer.\n\nIn parallel, the policy will cover the property damage in accordance with its terms.

It is possible that by agreement or at the insurer's discretion that the insurance can cut Bob a check and leave him to do what he likes with the money: rebuild the home, go on a holiday, or pay a debt he might owe to someone.\n\nIf the house is not adequately insured then Bob is a [co\\-insurer](https://www.brokerlink.ca/blog/co-insurance-explained/) and the cost of rebuilding is split.

The court would order Bob to pay the full $250,000 to Mary. Bob would then turn to his insurance company to indemnify him for the personal liability portion of $100,000, as per his policy limits. Bob would be responsible for finding the remaining $150,000 from other sources. The insurance company is not a party to the litigation between Bob and Mary, so the court cannot order the insurance company directly. The property damage claim would be handled separately from the liability claim, potentially allowing Bob to rebuild his house using the $100,000 property coverage, depending on the specific terms of his policy."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73960/do-you-have-to-pay-tax-when-you-sell-a-gifted-car", "docs_id": 73960, "title": "Do you have to pay tax when you sell a gifted car?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Assume someone gets a used car as a gift that has a value under $10K.

In this scenario, John's tax liability depends on the adjusted basis of the car at the time it was gifted to him. The adjusted basis is typically the fair market value of the car when it was given as a gift, not the original purchase price paid by his uncle. If the fair market value of the car when John received it was less than $10,000, he would owe capital gains tax on the difference between that value and the $10,000 sale price. If the fair market value was $10,000 or higher when he received it, he would owe no capital gains tax. The original purchase price of $12,000 is irrelevant for John's tax calculation.

The reason you feel there is a \u201clegal grey area\u201d is because there\u2019s a legal gray area.\n\nThe way the common law works is that there are some acts and omissions that are clearly crimes/torts/breach of contract, some that aren\u2019t and some that live in that grey area. When someone brings a case in the grey, the court will make a ruling that will apply to similar facts and we get a little light on the subject.

However, nuances matter and no two fact patterns are exactly the same and the difference might be enough to distinguish your case from the precedent.\n\nOr there might not be a relevant precedent because no one has sued/prosecuted on this fact pattern before.

Who cares if they give the information to the parents? As long as there is not some other violation at the school or unless the information goes deeper than what you've provided the student has no ability to consent or not. This is true for two reasons. \n\n1\\) Protected Health Information\n\nProtected health information under the HIPAA Privacy Rule protects most \"individually identifiable health information\" *held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate...* \n\nHIPAA defines a *covered entity* as:\n\n* a health care provider that conducts certain standard administrative and financial transactions in electronic form\n* a health care clearinghouse; or\n* a health plan\n\nAs I'm sure you agree, the school is neither one of those things.\n\n2\\) Talking to the parents of a minor\n\nThe [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) defers to state law regarding who is and is not considered a minor and when. That said, in general situations, \"a parent, guardian or other person acting *in loco parentis* usually is the personal representative of the minor child, and a health care provider is permitted to share patient information with a patient's personal representative.\" \n\nA parent is not treated as a minor child's personal representative [when](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/mental-health/index.html): \n\n> (1\\) State or other law does not require the consent of a parent or other person before a minor can obtain a particular health care service, the minor consents to the health care service, and the minor child has not requested the parent be treated as a personal representative; (2\\) someone other than the parent is authorized by law to consent to the provision of a particular health service to a minor and provides such consent; or (3\\) a parent agrees to a confidential relationship between the minor and a health care provider with respect to the health care service.\n\nFinally, special treatment is given to cases of psychotherapy notes. A parent does not have a right to receive a copy of these notes about a child's mental health treatment. \n\n> The Privacy Rule distinguishes between mental health information in a mental health professional\u2019s private notes and that contained in the medical record. It does not provide a right of access to psychotherapy notes, which the Privacy Rule defines as notes recorded by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session and that are separate from the rest of the patient\u2019s medical record.\n\n**Addendum**\n\nRecognizing that a school is not a health care provider or clearinghouse or health plan, I looked further for an answer related specifically to schools. Schools in these situations are not in general governed by HIPAA, but rather are governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This [Joint Guidance on the Application of the FERPA and the HIPAA to Student Health Records](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/hipaaferpajointguide.pdf) issued jointly by the Dep't of Health and Human Services and the Dep't of Education is worth you taking a look at due to the numerous situations that can arise and the detailed Q\\&A included. \n\nGenerally, though, parents and eligible students (those 18\\+) have the right to inspect and review the student's education records.

If there is a young child (say 4\\-10\\-ish) who is unsupervised and causing a major disruption, what is the extent of the measures you can take to stop him/her, as far as the law is concerned? When I say causing a disruption, I mean things like trashing a store, or spitting on passerby, or being aggressive, or even less important rules, like cheating at an arcade game, such as skeeball? I'm wondering basically because I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=NuHLsPVeqLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuHLsPVeqLU)\nAs a normal person, watching, are you alllowed to intervene? Do you just have to deal with it, or can you forcefully make the child stop? I want to know from a legal standpoint, rather than moral.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In addition to the general considerations of (1\\) who is allowed to use non\\-deadly physical force to maintain order in a shop (which I think that one could do if \"deputized\" by the property owner or to protect the property of another as well), and (2\\) the use of non\\-deadly physical force to make a citizen's arrest (which many of these scenarios would justify as the disorder would be a crime if committed by an adult), (3\\) I suspect that there is also some point at which a bystander may intervene to prevent harms associated with an unsupervised minor being at large and in need of supervision.\n\nGenerally speaking, intervention with the minimum reasonable non\\-deadly physical force to prevent property damage, or an assault, or a threat, is going to be permissible. As to the third reason: for a mentally normal ten\\-year\\-old that might be a stretch; for a four\\-year\\-old or a clearly impaired older child it might not.\n\nOne could approach the child, say, \"where's your mom or dad\", \"do you have a babysitter or sibling around?\", \"what is your name?\", or \"are you lost?\" and detain the child until a satisfactory answer is provided or a suitable authority arrives, to prevent the problem of a child being lost, abducted or hurt by the child's own actions.\n\nIt would be quite hard for a parent, guardian or babysitter to complain about this kind of conduct when the child was unsupervised and is released as soon as you confirm that this really is a responsible adult or older minor who is responsible for the child.\n\nIt would be important in doing so to not secret away or isolate the child, to try to determine the location of the child's caretaker, to refrain from doing anything that would harm the child, and to seek assistance from an authority within a reasonable time. Typically, if no caretaker appeared, a cop would come and the cop would oversee the situation until a social worker could come.\n\nFor example, Colorado has the following statute that would apply once a cop arrived (omitting lengthy provisions that apply to newborn children):\n\n> \u00a7 19\\-3\\-401\\.

The case involved a U.S. parent company requesting production of evidence from its Canadian subsidiary through American courts. The Canadian subsidiary applied to Canadian courts for permission to release the information, but this was refused due to existing Canadian legislation that prevented the release of such information. This case illustrates a situation where Canadian courts refused to enforce a U.S. court order due to conflicting domestic laws.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the issue was not about legal representation. Option B is incorrect because the jurisdictional relationship between the parent company and subsidiary was not the primary factor in the court's decision.

One is the Attorney General of the State of Maine. According to the Maine Constitution:\n\n> The Attorney General shall be chosen biennially by joint ballot of the Senators and Representatives in convention.\n\nThe other is the chairman of the board of professional land surveyors. According to 32 MRS S 18211 SS 4:\n\n> The board shall meet at least once a year to conduct its business and to elect a chair.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is, 'how long do these terms last?' \n\nIn the first place, consider a scenario where John is elected Attorney General or Chair of the Board in a January of say the year 2000\\. Suppose the next election of a Chair or an Attorney General does not happen until December of 2001 or December of 2002 respectively. In each of those cases, does John serve more than one total year (in the case of Chair) or more than two total years (in the case of the AG)?\n\nIn the second place, suppose no \"election\" or \"motion of choosing\" takes place at all. What is the logical consequence of such a failure? If the preceding AG or the preceding Chair continues to serve, there is no consequence it seems for not doing that which is required by law. Does the Chair or AG cease to serve upon failure to \"choose\" or \"elect\" them annually or biennially? If so, when? \\- (see my first question above).\n\nI did manage to find this. See 5 MRS S 3\n\n> \u00a73\\. Civil officers serve until successors qualify\n>  All civil officers, other than judicial officers, appointed in accordance with law and whose terms of office are fixed by law, shall hold office during the term for which they were appointed and until their successors in office have been appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed in accordance with law. \\[1975, c. 771, \u00a725 (RPR).]\n\nBut 1\\) I don't exactly know what counts as a civil officer. And 2\\) I don't know what \"terms of office are fixed by law\" means precisely. After all, if the terms were really fixed by law, I might not be asking this question in the first place. On the other hand, if it is presumed that the \"elections\" will take place when they're supposed to do so, then the terms are kind of \"fixed\" in a sense.\n\nSecondly, even if the AG counts as a \"civil officer\", one of the very next sections after 5 MRS Section 3 says this. (See 5 MRS Section 6\\):\n\n> \u00a76\\. Officials have 30 days to qualify\n>  All public officers appointed or renewed in accordance with law shall, within 30 days after being commissioned, qualify to perform the duties of their office and the certificate of qualification must be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Any officer who fails to qualify within 30 days and file a certificate of qualification in the office of the Secretary of State within 45 days must be suspended by the Secretary of State until the defect is corrected. During this suspension, the officer may be deemed to have forfeited the appointment and the office may be declared vacant by the appointing authority and a new appointment made. \\[1991, c. 837, Pt. A, \u00a77 (AMD).]\n\nI checked with the secretary of state. There are no \"certificates of qualification\" for board chairs. That must mean that they count as something other than \"public officers.\" So that might mean that section 3 does not apply to them at all. \n\nThere is one more thing. See 10 MRS S 8009:\n\n> \u00a78009\\. Standardized terms\n>  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon expiration of a professional or occupational licensing board member's term, that member serves until a successor is appointed and qualified. The successor's term commences at the expiration of the preceding term, regardless of the date of appointment. A vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of a specified term must be filled by appointment of a similarly qualified individual as a replacement. The replacement member serves for the remainder of the unexpired term, regardless of the date of appointment. \\[2013, c. 217, Pt. A, \u00a72 (AMD).]\n\nBut I am sure this section is talking about the terms of actual board members, not the chair or any other kind of special elected officer of the board. \n\nWhat I'd like to know, in addition to an answer particularized for the state of Maine in these cases if you can, is when the term of such an official would end in the absence of any kind of legal specification?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not quite sure what you're asking here. \n\nOfficials serve until they are (1\\) replaced (which covers until after their successor has qualified) or (2\\) removed from office by legal (or inevitable biological) processes.

Option D is correct based on the principle outlined in 5 MRS \u00a7 3, which states that civil officers \"shall hold office during the term for which they were appointed and until their successors in office have been appointed and qualified.\" This allows for continuity in office even if elections or appointments are delayed.

We found one that we all really like and have seen them for several sessions now.\n\nWe have commercial health insurance through my work, and my son also has insurance through the state (Wisconsin) under Medicaid.

There are regulations related to health information (HIPAA), to educational records, to tax information, to census information, credit reporting agencies, and to banking records (as well, of course, as to national security information). There are also largely consistent restrictions at the state level related to the juvenile justice process.\n\nBut data privacy is not a subject of general regulation in the U.S.\n\nInstead, the data privacy regulations of the U.S. consist of a patchwork of fragmentary state and federal laws and regulations, superimposed on a significant and not entirely consistent or well developed body of common law precedents such as the privacy torts set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which some states have adopted fully, some states have rejected almost completely, and some states have adopted in part or with significant modifications.\n\nThe U.S. Constitutional law of the First Amendment also heavily colors how other legal limitations and authorizations are construed and drafted, because the right to distribute truthful information without restriction has long been considered one of the core protections of the First Amendment, even in the much less vigorously protected area of commercial speech.\n\nSome states have more general regulations, and the most important of these is California, both because it is a large and economically significant state, and because it is the home to many of the leading U.S. technology companies, many of which expressly adopt of the law of the State of California in choice of law clauses in their terms of service and contracts.\n\nThe California law most similar to the GDPR is the [California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5) (CCPA) which gives consumers rights with respect to the use of the personal information that businesses collect about them and the [CCPA regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=IEB210D8CA2114665A08AF8443F0245AD&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) that provide guidance on how to implement the law.

The discovery phase, *which concluded before the trial began*, required Alex Jones to provide texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook (among other things). He did not provide any and testified in writing and in court he could find none.\n2. On August 3rd 2022, day seven of the trial, plaintiffs' attorney Mark Bankston claimed he had obtained from Jones's attorneys a digital copy of Jones's cellphone on which there were texts and emails that mentioned Sandy Hook. He said this copy was mistakenly provided to him. Whether accidental or deliberate, this copy or *its texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook were not provided during discovery*. Judge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, \"we don't know whether it was on accident or on purpose... but what we do know is that it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.\" [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=7658](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7658)\n\nA video clip of the part of the hearing in question, when Bankston begins asking Jones about the texts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=tpnSCIak5A8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpnSCIak5A8). Or this timestamp in a longer clip [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=6821](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=6821).\n\nMark Bankston for the plaintiffs, addressing Jones:\n\n\"Your attorneys messed up and sent me a digital copy of your entire cellphone, with every text message you sent for the past two years. And, when informed, did not take any steps to identify it as privileged or protected in any way, and as of two days ago it fell free and clear into my possession. And that is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have text messages about Sandy Hook.\"\n\nThe above quote begins 5mins into the first clip or this timestamp in the longer clip [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=6830](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=6830)).\n\nAfter the texts, Bankston asked questions about emails not being turned over... Jones had sworn he didn't even use email. Bankston showed him emails that appeared to be written by Jones. \"I must have dictated them\" said Jones.\n\nJudge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, \"we don't know it was on accident or on purpose, but what we do know is it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.\" [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=7665](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7665)\n\n[Bankston told journalist Dan Solomon the phone copy was put in a Dropbox the parties were using to exchange materials](https://nitter.net/dansolomon/status/1554900413702443016#m). Bankston did not believe it was put there deliberately and notified Jones's attorneys. Apparently Jones's attorneys did not respond. [Under Texas law they had ten days to assert privilege or say the material was put there by mistake, Rule 193\\.3(d)](https://www.stcl.edu/lib/TexasRulesProject/TRCP186-193/rule193-3Nov1999.htm) \\- as of August 3rd Bankston was legally free to read and use the material.\n\n(There is some gossip online about what was supposedly heard on 'hot mic' between Reynal and Bankston, I haven't heard it myself and have no timestamps or clips. I do think I heard Jones, after leaving the witness box, ask Reynal [\"they got my text messages?\"](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=8352))\n\n\\[edit]\n\nIncidentally, [this isn't the first time that Jones / his attorneys failed to comply with discovery orders in relation to these Sandy Hook cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones#Sandy_Hook_school_shooting) \\- a number of sanctions and default judgements have gone against him for that.\n\nIndeed this damages phase is the result of [the default judgment against him in September 2021 for failing to comply with discovery](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074090-pozner-judgment):\n\n\"The Court find that Defendants unreasonably and vexatiously failed to comply with their discovery duties. The Court finds that Defendants' failure to comply with discovery in this case is greatly aggravated by Defendants' consistent pattern of discovery abuse throughout the other similar cases pending before this Court.\"\n\n\\[edit 2]\n\n**On August 4th 2022 Jones's attorneys have filed an emergency motion that seems to settle the issue of whether the provision of all the material was a \"mishap\": they say it was \"inadvertently\" supplied.**\n\n[text of the motion](https://www.scribd.com/document/585555024/Alex-Jones-Emergency-Petition)\n\nThey claim they promptly informed plaintiffs' attorneys about the mistake but the latter used the material anyway in violation of privilege, procedure and the court's protective order. Now Twitter lawyers are arguing about whether the language used by the defence was adequate to engage the rules mentioned above.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to resolve the issue of why the material demanded for discovery was not supplied for discovery or why Jones testifed he could not find such material.\n\nJudge Gamble denied the request for a blanket protective order to seal the record of the text messages and denied the motion for mistrial.

In this case, Jones' attorneys were notified of the error but did not respond within the required timeframe. As a result, the plaintiff's attorney, Mark Bankston, was legally permitted to read and use the material after the 10-day period expired.

In this case, the party making the payment is a \"decentralized autonomous organization\".\n\nCreation of \"new property\" should only apply when the \"creator\" owns the raw materials. For example, when a oil company owns the mineral rights and simply transforms the oil from a state of buried to a state of being in a barrel, such an activity is not taxable.\n\nHowever, if an oil company is rendering a drilling service for the owner of the mineral rights, and gets paid not in fiat cash at the end of the month, but in barrels of oil immediately upon extraction, then the oil company's revenue is the market value of the oil at the moment of extraction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is cryptocurrency mining/staking profits \"newly created property\"? I think that Crypto profits from staking/mining should be treated as payment received for performance of a service, i.e. assembling a new block.\n\nYour rationale mistakenly conflates two modalities of profit, one of which certainly constitutes newly created property.\n\nMining/staking profits have two components: (1\\) \\[crypto\\-]coins (whether fractional or not) which are new insofar as they did not exist before, and (2\\) transaction fees (in terms of the cryptocurrency) each payer determines in a competition for a timely processing of his transaction. Only the second component fits the notion of *service*, which [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines as \"*\\[t]he being employed **to serve another**; duty or labor to be rendered by one person **to another**, the former being bound to submit his will to the direction and control of **the latter**.*\" (emphasis added). In other words, a service involves a party and a counterparty.\n\nThe first component is not cognizable as \"service\" because there is no reasonable way to attach to a counterparty the act and outcome of mining/staking (that is, other than processing the specific transaction the anonymous/pseudonymous payer submitted). Indeed, the additional coins pursuant to the first component are not traceable to other's balance. The scheduled existence of additional coins pursuant to the first component does not change the fact that these coins come out of nowhere. Hence these coins are newly created.\n\nIt is in this sense that [Jarrett's pleadings](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IRS-Tax-Litigation.pdf) (paragraph 35\\) cite from [*Eisner v. Macomber*, 252 U.S. 189, 207 (1920\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1920441252us1891420) the language \"*coming in*\". However, *Macomber* seems largely unavailing to Jarrett's claim because *Macomber* addresses whether \"*a true stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith*\" is taxable. For that purpose, the court delves in \"*the nature of a corporation and the stockholder's relation to it*\", a framework that is foreign to the cryptominer's/staker's relation to a quite abstract \"entity\" such as a cryptocurrency protocol.\n\n> In this case, the party making the payment is a \"decentralized autonomous organization\".\n\nThat is inaccurate in regard to the first component of profit because there is no such entity or organization in the first place. Simply put, one cannot file suit against \"Bitcoin\" or against \"the blockchain\", just like it would make no sense to file suit against the US dollar or against abstract entities such as a \"decentralized economy\". The economy does not pay the agent. Other agents acting in that economy do, but that brings us back to the second component of miners' profit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the nature of cryptocurrency mining/staking profits according to the legal analysis provided?\n\nA) All cryptocurrency mining/staking profits should be treated as payment for services rendered, similar to an oil company drilling for another party.\n\nB) Cryptocurrency mining/staking profits are entirely \"newly created property\" and should not be taxed as income.\n\nC) Cryptocurrency mining/staking profits have two components: newly created coins and transaction fees, with only the latter being considered a service.\n\nD) Cryptocurrency mining/staking profits are paid by a decentralized autonomous organization and should be taxed as regular income.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the analysis distinguishes between two components of mining/staking profits. The first component consists of newly created coins that did not exist before and cannot be traced to any counterparty. This is considered \"newly created property.\" The second component involves transaction fees, which can be seen as payment for a service of processing transactions. Only this second part fits the legal definition of a service, as it involves a party and a counterparty. Options A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the nature of these profits and mischaracterize the source of payment. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the transaction fee component, which can be considered a service and potentially taxable income."}}
