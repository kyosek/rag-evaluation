He loves weapons. Above all, he loves practice shooting with his shotgun, which he jokingly nicknamed *shotzooka*.\n\nOne summer, Billy decides to innovate. He spends his days adding new features to his shotzooka. First, he adds a telescope. Then he adds a laser sight. But does not stop there. Somehow he manages to attach a remotely controlled anti\\-tank guided missile to his beloved gun.\n\nThe now upgraded shotzooka is capable of immense destructive power. Strangely enough, though, the weapon still resembles a regular shotgun. Billy decides to test his weapon's new capabilities on a tree. He locks his target, then takes a 180 degree turn and pulls the trigger. The missile turns 180 around and, flying at Mach 3 speed, pulverizes the tree to the ground. Billy had never had such power in his hands.\n\nCan Billy legally possess his *shotzooka*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, we need to determine what laws this new hybrid gun falls under. We got a normal shotgun, which in itself might be under the National Firearms Act (NFA) a Class 3 Destructive device, but most aren't. So, let's assume \"Shotzooka\" is a standard Remington 870\\.\n\nBecause Billy wants his gun to be more compact, he shortens the gun with a telescopic stock. Great, there are 2 options for that: a full stock that can be lengthened and one that is pretty much folding out completely. This can be a problem if the total gun in its shortest configuration gets below 26 inches length \\- then it is illegal under Texas law as a short barrel firearm. And the complete removal makes it **no longer** a shotgun under federal law but pushes it to a different weapon category: Any Other Weapon. Since it once was a proper shotgun (which means it had a stock) it can't ever become a Pistol Grip Firearm.\n\nNow, here comes the crux: owning and operating these is totally fine if you have them registered at the Bureau of Alcohol Tabacco and Firearms. But you need to register your intent to manufacture them **before** you start with the conversion and have the approval of your project. It also costs 200$ tax \\-but you need to also make sure your new gun is allowed locally (see below).\n\nThe Laser sight likely isn't a problem... but now comes the really big problem:\n\nThe laser\\-guided anti\\-tank missile. THAT is a problem. Because anti\\-tank weapons are explosive and all explosives are classed as Destructive Devices under the NFA (well,technically that's Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968 amending the NFA of 1934\\...). And possession of such a Title II weapon like a Destructive Devices demands them to be registered and tax\\-stamoed for 200$ federally \\- and manufacturing them is prohibited for private citizens.\n\nThis means in the act of mounting the missile to his shotzooka he turned her into an illegal, unregisterable NFA Class3 DD of the explosive type, illegally manufactured it, and just for the possession alone put himself up to a [fine of 250k and 10 years jail time:](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/houston/press-releases/2011/texas-man-charged-with-unlawfully-possessing-destructive-devices)\n\n> The charge of unlawful possession of a destructive device in violation of the National Firearms Act carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nBut the trouble doesn't stop there, Texas itself has a penal code that defines that anti\\-tank missile somewhere! [Texas Penal Code, Title 10, Chapter 46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm):\n\n> 46\\.01 DEFINITIONS\n> \n> \n> (2\\) \"Explosive weapon\" means any explosive or incendiary bomb, grenade, rocket, or mine, that is designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting serious bodily injury, death, or substantial property damage, or for the principal purpose of causing such a loud report as to cause undue public alarm or terror, and includes a device designed, made, or adapted for delivery or shooting an explosive weapon.\n> \n> \n> (10\\) \"Short\\-barrel firearm\" means a rifle with a barrel length of less than 16 inches or a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches, or any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle if, as altered, it has an overall length of less than 26 inches.\n\n> 46\\.05\\. PROHIBITED WEAPONS.\n> \n> \n> (a) A person commits an offense if the person intentionally or knowingly possesses, manufactures, transports, repairs, or sells:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) any of the following items, unless the item is registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or otherwise not subject to that registration requirement or unless the item is classified as a curio or relic by the United States Department of Justice:\n> \n> \n> (A) an explosive weapon;\n> \n> \n> (B) a machine gun; or\n> \n> \n> (C) a short\\-barrel firearm;\n\n> Sec. 46\\.09\\. COMPONENTS OF EXPLOSIVES.\n> \n> \n> (a) A person commits an offense if the person knowingly possesses components of an explosive weapon with the intent to combine the components into an explosive weapon for use in a criminal endeavor.\n\nOUCH! See that? The mounting of the missile launcher just turned the gun highly illegal, and even in the act of shortening the shotgun by altering the stock to be telescopic, it might have become illegal if the gun became too short. And it gets worse. The mere possession of the guided missile is impossible unless it's a curio or relic (which would mean it is old!) or registered, but it can't be because private citizens can't make it... and even owning the **parts** for the missile would be illegal if they would be used in a crime... wait, manufacturing of a missile **is** a crime, so owning the parts also is a crime!\n\ntl;dr:\n------\n\nBilly is screwed under **both** texas and federal law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the laws described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Billy's \"shotzooka\" in Texas?\n\nA) Billy can legally possess the modified weapon as long as he registers it with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and pays a $200 tax stamp.\n\nB) The weapon is illegal under both Texas and federal law due to the addition of the anti-tank guided missile, regardless of registration or tax payment.\n\nC) Billy can legally possess the weapon if he removes the anti-tank guided missile but keeps the telescope and laser sight modifications.\n\nD) The weapon is only illegal under Texas law, but not federal law, as long as the overall length remains over 26 inches.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The addition of the anti-tank guided missile to Billy's shotgun makes it an illegal destructive device under both Texas and federal law. The National Firearms Act (NFA) classifies explosive weapons as destructive devices, which private citizens are prohibited from manufacturing. Texas Penal Code also explicitly prohibits the possession of explosive weapons unless registered (which this cannot be) or classified as a curio or relic. Furthermore, even possessing components of an explosive weapon with intent to combine them is illegal in Texas. The other modifications (telescope, laser sight) are less problematic, but the missile addition makes the entire weapon illegal, regardless of registration or overall length. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the weapon is illegal under both Texas and federal law due to the anti-tank guided missile."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49209/re-release-of-mit-licensed-open-source-app-to-the-ios-app-store", "docs_id": 49209, "title": "Re-Release of MIT-licensed open-source app to the iOS App Store", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **TL:DR** someone re\\-uploaded my MIT\\-licensed open\\-source app to the iOS App Store.\n\n---\n\n**WHAT HAPPENED**\n\nI have created a small app for iPhone, which has been available on the App Store for over 2 years now. \n\nIt is licensed under MIT and I am the copyright owner.

Installing a visible fake gun turret that tracks pedestrians could be interpreted as making a terrorist threat under RSMo Section 574.115, as it may cause \"a false belief or fear that an incident has occurred or that a condition exists involving danger to life.\" It could be seen as having \"the purpose of frightening ten or more people.\"\n\nB) While misleading, this is unlikely to cause fear of danger to life and would not meet the criteria for a terrorist threat under the statute.\n\nC) Installing a visible security camera is a common and accepted security measure that does not typically cause fear of danger to life.\n\nD) Verbally warning trespassers about calling the police is a reasonable response and does not imply a threat to life or safety.\n\nThe key factors in the correct answer are the simulation of a weapon (even if fake) and the potential to cause fear in multiple people passing by, which aligns with the specific language and intent of the Missouri statute on terrorist threats."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76388/i-supposedly-owe-91-dollars-for-a-4-dollar-toll-from-half-a-decade-ago-can-it-b", "docs_id": 76388, "title": "I supposedly owe 91 dollars for a 4 dollar toll from half a decade ago.

But it's okay because Delaware has an amnesty program and if I just pay in the next 20 days I 'only' have to pay 64 dollars on my 4 dollar toll.\n\nAs I said the state is hours of driving away from me and I couldn't imagine why I would be driving through it, though it's close enough, and long enough ago, that I can't rule out some forgotten long drive that took me through it. I've always had an ez\\-pass though so I would think any toll would have been automatically payed anyways. I've never received any notice about this supposed toll before today.

You may demand evidence that the debt is valid before deciding whether to pay or contest the alleged debt. Or you can go straight to the Delaware EZ Pass authorities.\n\nAccording to [this official EZ Pass FAQ](https://www.ezpassde.com/pages/FAQs.shtml):\n\n> Q: What do I do if I receive a Violation Notice?  \n> \n> A: A Toll Violation Notice is issued for every violation (see example). In addition to the toll, a Violation Notice has a $25 Administrative Fee, $10 Ambulance Company Fund Fee, and a $15 fee to Combat Violent Crimes.\n> \n> \n> A Toll Violation Final Notice (see example) is issued if the Violation Notice has not been paid within 30 days. The Toll Violation Final Notice adds a Civil Penalty of $25 and a Civil Penalty Surcharge of $12\\.50 to the fees listed on the first Notice of Toll Violation. If the Toll Violation Final Notice is not paid, it will be subject to registration hold, collection activities or legal action.\n\nThose fees would add up to $91\\.50 on a $4 toll if a violation went unpaid for 30 days or more. Note that the \"violent crimes part\" is to fund the \"Combat Violent Crimes\" program, not because a toll violation is itself violent.\n\nThe FAQ goes on to state:\n\n> Q: How can I appeal my violation?  \n> \n> A: Delaware E\\-ZPass Customers with accounts in good standing can appeal their violation notices by accessing the [Appeal Page](https://acct.ezpassde.com/Violations.aspx) of this website, over the phone, in person, by fax or mail.

A friend of mine is a webcam model for a video chat site.

It is unclear to me at this point whether or not the difficulty stems from the websites' unwillingness to remove the content based on her location, or if it is more a matter of her not fully understanding the English language and not meeting the requirements for an effective DMCA takedown notice. So my questions are:\n\n* What makes for an effective DMCA takedown notice specifically in regards to websites that host pornographic material?\n* Is a website more likely to respond to a DMCA takedown notice if the notice comes from within the United States?\n* If the answer to the previous question is Yes: how would someone from outside of the United States authorize someone residing in the United States to send a DMCA takedown notice on their behalf?\n* When sending a DMCA takedown notice, does one send the notice directly to the website in question?\n\nMany pornographic websites have a DMCA link on their page.

Is this something a model should consider doing or would it be better to take the formal legal route of sending a DMCA takedown notice?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.

If the site fails to comply with a valid notice, they lose the benefit of DMCA's safe harbor provisions and become themselves liable for continuing to host the infringing work, and you can sue them. (Prior filing suit, though, I imagine a letter from a lawyer that says, \"Hey, my client sent you a valid DMCA notice a while ago; kindly comply at once, or we will actually sue you,\" should be sufficient.)\n\nThe requirement to submit a photo appears to be totally unnecessary. A valid DMCA notice includes a signature (electronically including your name in an email is sufficient) and an assertion, under penalty of perjury, that the writer is authorized to control the copyright work and that the work is being used illegally. Beyond a signature and contact information, no further identity verification is necessary. The DMCA handles this by opening the submitter to perjury charges if the takedown was submitted illegally.\n\nOf course, any site might choose to ignore your DMCA takedown, at their own peril.

If I was to make a SAR to each, processing the responses would take a long time, particularly if some provided responses that were incomplete or in a non\\-machine readable format, and I had to chase them. It would be much easier for me to set up a website that allows data controllers to upload files and associate them with portions of the request, validates that they can be read by a machine, and allows submission only when complete.

I doubt that your strategy would work.\n\nThe GDPR does not explicitly allow you to choose in which format your requests will be answered. If the data controller chooses a different format or medium, I would assume they are compliant. All the GDPR says is this (Art 12(1\\)):\n\n> The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.\n\nFor example, it would likely be perfectly compliant if they provide a response through physical mail. Electronic mail is common as a convenience to both parties. You as the data subject have no legal basis for forcing the data controller to interact with any website.\n\nFurthermore, the GDPR does not give you a right to receive responses in a machine\\-readable format. In addition to your Art 15 right to access, you may have a separate Art 20 right to data portability. While generally similar \u2013 and usually handled by data controllers together \u2013 they have different conditions and cover different information. For example, information on the source and recipients of personal data is required under Art 15(1\\) letters (c) and (g), but that information will usually not be machine readable and is not in scope of Art 20\\. In any case, there are no commonly used machine\\-readable formats for responses to data subject requests, so that each controller could choose its own format (typically a JSON or XML file or a ZIP archive with a custom schema/structure) \u2013 but only for the copy of your data, not for the additional information mentioned in Art 15\\.\n\nSending data subject requests from a no\\-reply address could be an indication that you're not actually interested in the responses, which could indicate that your requests are \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d and can therefore be rejected under Art 12(5\\).

While electronic means are common, the data controller is not obligated to use a specific format or medium requested by the data subject, such as a custom web form or website. The GDPR does not explicitly allow data subjects to choose the format of the response. Additionally, while machine-readable formats may be used for certain data under the right to data portability (Article 20), this doesn't apply to all information in a SAR response, particularly additional information required by Article 15.

The information provided emphasizes that trademark policy cannot override trademark law, and nominative use is a legal right. Additionally, the answer points out that Canonical's policy has serious problems and contradicts the GPL, suggesting that Linux Mint is likely aware of the policy's weaknesses.

There are all sorts of laws establishing duties of care, such as between doctor and patient, which may be created by a legislature or may be part of common law tradition. There is a duty of care imposed on a landlord w.r.t. the tenant, requiring that the premise be \"secure\", therefore a landlord might easily be held liable if the main door into the building was not locked. This duty is a specific instance of a general duty from tradesman/businessman to customer.\n\nAs far as I can determine, there is no such statutory duty imposed on tenants in Washington state, and none from case law being revealed by a few cursory searches. In order to be subsumed under general \"everybody has a duty to everybody else\" law, the damage would have to be foreseeable. It is said that \"If something is foreseeable, it is a probable and predictable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligent actions or inaction\". This mean that a reasonable person would have known that, under the circumstances, the damage is likely to result. Circumstances vary quite a bit, and there is no general rule about holding the door open for another person.

Option B presents the scenario where the outcome is most foreseeable and where Resident A has most clearly breached a duty of care. The presence of multiple warning signs creates an explicit expectation for residents, and the high-crime area increases the foreseeability of criminal activity. In this case, a court would be more likely to find that a reasonable person should have foreseen the potential consequences of letting a stranger in.\n\nOption A presents the lowest risk scenario, making liability unlikely.

Words can have different meanings in particular contexts and can be defined in a contract or statute to have a meaning different from the common meaning.\n\n**\"Person\" Usually Includes Entities Of Any Kind**\n\nThis said, usually the term \"person\" in the law refers to any human being and any trust, estate or entity that is capable of suing and being sued and entering into contracts. \n\nAn \"entity\" in this sense would often include partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, non\\-profit associations (whether or not incorporated), business trusts, joint ventures, local governments, states, the federal government and foreign governments. \n\n(I break out trusts and estates separately because there is divided authority in different jurisdictions over whether trusts and estates are entities, or are simply a special hat that the trustee or executor wears that are not entities, which can be relevant in some highly technical situations.)\n\n**Agency Situations**\n\nThe term \"person\" is also often used in the sense that it refers to the principal and not the agent, when an agent is taking action on behalf of the principal. \n\nThus, if there is a law that says \"a person who enters into a real estate contract must disclose that person's taxpayer identification number\", and someone with a power of attorney from you signs a real estate contract on your behalf, the power of attorney agent should disclosure your taxpayer identification number and not theirs.\n\n**Why Is The Term \"Person\" Defined So Broadly?**\n\nOne important reason for using the term \"person\" to apply to entities as well as human beings, is that it allows for statutes and contract terms or case law legal rules to be stated in very general terms without being wordy in a way that accurately reflects how those legal rules or contract terms should apply to entities.\n\nFor example, a statute using the word \"person\" might say: \n\n> A person who is engaged in business in this state must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nBy using the word \"person\" in this way, the statute wouldn't have to say instead (probably less accurately and less comprehensibly): \n\n> Any individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation,\n>  business trust, non\\-business trust, estate, governmental entity, or\n>  other entity, including the principal of any agent acting on behalf of\n>  the principal, engaged in business in this state, must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nThe phrasing without the word \"person\" would be more likely to create loopholes because some kind of entity is omitted, and would be prone to ambiguity because one would have to decide which words that define the kind of persons and entities that are covered modify which other words in the sentence. \n\nThus, using the word \"person\" is often makes entities more rather than less accountable to the law, by making legal language more clear and more general (and hence containing fewer loopholes).\n\n**\"Individual\" or \"Natural Person\"**\n\nUsually the term \"individual\" or \"natural person\" would mean a human being, although, of course, there are other senses of the word \"individual\" such as \"an individual Widget\" referring to exactly one Widget in particular, as opposed to Widgets in general.\n\n**Alternative Definitions Of \"Person\"**\n\nThere are isolated times when the word \"person\" would not include minors and incapacitated people who are incapable of suing or entering into contracts in their own name due to lack of legal capacity.\n\nIt isn't uncommon to have a definition of \"person\" in a statute or contract that omits governmental entities, that omits all kinds of entities, or that omits particular kinds of entities (e.g. foreign entities or corporations).\n\nFor example, a tax statute might define \"person\" in a way that includes natural persons and entities, but excludes governments.\n\nSome of the definitions of terms like these in the bankruptcy code are particularly non\\-intuitive."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In U.S. statutory law, the term \"person\" is often defined broadly. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal definition and use of the term \"person\"?\n\nA) The term \"person\" always excludes governmental entities and only refers to human beings and private corporations.\n\nB) Using \"person\" in legal language typically makes it easier to create loopholes in the law by omitting certain types of entities.\n\nC) The term \"person\" usually includes any human being, trust, estate, or entity capable of suing, being sued, and entering into contracts, but its exact definition can vary based on context.\n\nD) In all legal contexts, \"person\" and \"individual\" are interchangeable terms that exclusively refer to natural human beings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the typical broad usage of \"person\" in legal contexts while acknowledging that definitions can vary. The passage states that \"person\" usually refers to \"any human being and any trust, estate or entity that is capable of suing and being sued and entering into contracts.\" It also emphasizes that definitions can change based on context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that \"person\" often includes governmental entities, not excludes them.\n\nOption B is incorrect. The passage actually argues the opposite, stating that using \"person\" often makes entities more accountable to the law by making legal language clearer and more general, thus containing fewer loopholes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage distinguishes between \"person\" (which can include various entities) and \"individual\" (which usually refers specifically to human beings).

For example, could parents bar contact with volunteers from a LBGTQ group to a child if the parents were (by ideal/simplified hypothetical case) in no way harming the child?\n\nI think this could apply to religious groups as well, but looking through the family law of a few states, it might also represent a special case. Could parents bar their child from associating with religious groups (or a\\-religious) they oppose?\n\nIs there a responsibility of any such group to get parental consent? \n\nGoing back to the two examples: Let's say an LGBTQ group was having a non\\-privileged support group meeting (no professional or licensed therapists present) and a local mosque was having a youth prayer meeting.

If there were some archetype examples, I would appreciate it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The constitutional protection afforded people in the United States for freedom of association is protection from interference by the government and its agents.\n\nUntil the age of majority, or emancipation by a court of law, parents enjoy broad discretion over the activities of their children including with whom they can associate.\n\nComplexities do arise for children of divorced parents *who disagree* as to who can set the characteristics of how the children are raised. In these cases family court intervention is used to deem what's in the best interest of the child.\n\nComplexities can also arise for children facing medical treatment. The most common example would be a parent attempting to refuse specific care for their child. In these cases it's possible to get a court to deem the parents \"unfit\" in order to force the medical treatment to go forward. This is usually a high\\-bar to achieve as the courts don't want to interfere in the parent\\-child relationship unless there is no other choice. Such medical treatment can also apply to mental\\-health services.\n\nNew York, [as an example](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx),\n\n> allows the local commissioner of social services or local commissioner\n>  of health to give consent for medical, dental, health and hospital services for any child found by the family court to be an abused, neglected or destitute child.\n\nOklahoma created the [Parent's Bill of Rights](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx) (same link as above) which:\n\n> prohibited the state from infringing upon parental rights, directed the board of education of a school district to develop a policy listing parental rights related to education, including sex education; prohibited a surgical procedure on a minor without parental consent\u2014excluding abortion\u2014 and, prohibited a mental health evaluation of a minor without parental consent.\n\nYou will find that it will take court intervention to interfere with parental discretion and that court intervention will likely need to find the parents unfit to make the decision. Assuming the advocacy groups you outline in your question are not providing medical care it is extremely unlikely that a court will interfere.\n\nThe right of association is not implicated in your question because it is not the government preventing the child from participating."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 15-year-old wants to attend meetings of an LGBTQ support group against their parents' wishes. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The child has a constitutional right to freedom of association that overrides parental authority in this case.\nB) The LGBTQ group is legally required to check for parental consent before allowing the child to attend.\nC) The parents have broad discretion to restrict their child's associations until the age of majority, barring court intervention.\nD) The child can freely attend as long as the meetings take place in a public school setting.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, parents have broad discretion over their children's activities, including associations, until the age of majority or emancipation. Constitutional protections for freedom of association primarily protect against government interference, not parental authority. The LGBTQ group is not legally required to check for parental consent, though they may face risks if they knowingly go against parental wishes. The location of the meetings (such as a public school) does not inherently override parental authority. Court intervention would be necessary to overrule the parents' decision, and this typically requires proving the parents unfit or that their decision is not in the best interest of the child - a high bar to meet in most cases."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85973/how-to-address-a-conclusory-statement", "docs_id": 85973, "title": "How to address a Conclusory Statement", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that a **[conclusory statement](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/conclusory)** consists of, or relates to, a conclusion or assertion for which no supporting evidence is offered.\n\nUPDATE: Assume that Bob worked in the US in 2021 and had a duty to pay Federal income tax and failed to do so.\n\nFor example, as a working American, Bob has a duty to file and pay Federal income tax.\n\nAn IRS investigator sends a letter to Bob indicating Bob did not file and pay his 2021 federal income tax.

This would be tortious (probably conversion or civil theft, at a minimum), and the LLC would be liable in tort for this tortious act because it was committed by someone acting on its behalf. But, the human being who actually wrote that code while working for the LLC would also be personally liable in tort for the harm caused because they personally participated in that tort. But, if that person's manager at the LLC never knew that this was done by the employee, the manager would not have personal liability.\n\nOf course, nothing under the sun can prevent you from being sued. Anyone with a word processor, the filing fee and a process server can sue you for anything. The substantive law can make it more or less likely that you will be found by the court to have legal liability in the end.

Surjeet Kaur](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1419708/) rejected an interpretation by NCDRC which concluded that education is a service, instead saying\n\n> The respondent as a student is neither a consumer nor is the appellant\n> rendering any service...The case decided by this Court in [Bihar School\n> Examination Board](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/615635/) (supra) clearly lays down the law in this regard\n> with which we find ourselves in full agreement with\n\nIn the Bihar decision, (1\\) the defendant was the examination board and (2\\) the Board is a statutory creation. Para. 11\n\n> The object of the Act is to cover in its net, services offered or\n> rendered for a consideration.

We\n> are clearly of the view that the Board is not a `service provider' and a student who takes an examination is not a` consumer' and\n> consequently, complaint under the Act will not be maintainable against\n> the Board.\n\nThe Maharshi case likewise involved a legislatively\\-created educational institution.\n\nIn [Anupama College Of Engineering vs Gulshan Kumar](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/31263824/), the Supreme Court cited an order from P.T. Koshy \\& Anr. v. Ellen Charitable Trust \\& Ors (which appears to be unpublished) that\n\n> In view of the judgment of this Court in Maharshi Dayanand University\n> v.

Such matters cannot be entertained by the\n> Consumer Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986\\.\n\nGiven the definite policy of the NCDRC, you *cannot* file a complain in consumer court. Theoretically, you could appeal up to the Indian Supreme Court, if you can distinguish your case from the Maharshi U case. Two issues raised in that case and the Bihar case that is foundational for the later case are whether the institute is a statutory institution or a private business, and whether you are a paying customer (paying tuition, not just fees). Even the most recent NCDRC ruling leaves open a distinguishing factor, that the putative deficiency relates not to education, but to an extracurricular activity made available by the institution. I conclude that the Supreme Court of India has *not* made a broad ruling that \"education is not a service\", it has ruled more narrowly that in certain cases, a specific education\\-related entity is not providing a \"service\"\n\nIf you sue, it will be dismissed, and you will have to appeal to the highest court.

In this situation, the incomplete first clause creates ambiguity, but the second clause clearly states a 30-day notice requirement. More importantly, the lease refers to \"TENANT\" in the singular, which legally encompasses both roommates as a single entity. This means that both tenants must act together in giving notice and terminating the lease. The 30-day notice requirement in the second clause provides a clear guideline that would likely be enforced, especially given the ambiguity in the first clause. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't account for the joint responsibility of the tenants.

Reasons for the decision \\- i.e. a description of the evidence, and the judge's findings of fact and legal reasoning.\n\nSometimes a party, even though they have completely won, is nevertheless aggrieved by some things the judge has said in the Reasons (or in the way the judge has handled the trial \\- e.g. the judge's interventions). For example the judge may have said that the winning party was not a credible witness but they nevertheless won because of the evidence of other witnesses who were found to be credible.\n\nThe rule in England and Wales is that you can only appeal orders.

In this case, while the plaintiff may be unhappy with the judge's comments, they cannot appeal or challenge these comments separately from the verdict. The order is completely in the plaintiff's favor, awarding full damages. Even though the reasons contain unfavorable comments, these cannot be appealed or amended. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest actions that are not possible within the legal framework described.

It relies from this on the concept of country of origin. Assuming that the book was originally published in the UK (as it has a London based publisher) then the applicable copyright law is that of the UK.\n\nExceptions to copyright can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exceptions-to-copyright). The relevant exemption is the first part of the *Teaching* section:\n\n> the copying of works in any medium as long as the use is solely to illustrate a point, it is not done for commercial purposes, it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement, and the use is fair dealing.\n\nAcknowledgement is pretty straightforward but *fair dealing* as a legal concept means:\n\n> There is no statutory definition of fair dealing \\- it will always be a matter of fact, degree and impression in each case.

If a use of a work acts as a substitute for it, causing the owner to lose revenue, then it is not likely to be fair\n> * is the amount of the work taken reasonable and appropriate? Was it necessary to use the amount that was taken? Usually only part of a work may be used\n> \n> \n> The relative importance of any one factor will vary according to the case in hand and the type of dealing in question.\n\nIf the work had been simultaneously or previously published in the USA the relevant consideration is *fair use* rather than *fair dealing*.

However, the Statute provides that the signature may be made by a person authorised by you.\n* In Australia, a Commonwealth income tax return must be signed by the taxpayer. The taxpayer must sign it personally. If you get your assistant to sign it then you haven't filled it in properly and you are liable to be fined for failure to lodge a valid tax return. There are rules in the legislation for corporations, e.g. the public officer signs it. Sometimes the law allows a tax agent/accountant to sign a form. The theme is that the law provides specific rules.\n* In Australia, banknotes must bear the signatures of two senior officials such as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. However, the law imposing this requirement allows a great deal of flexibility about how these signatures are applied, freeing these officials from the tedium of signing millions of banknotes: Reserve Bank Act 1959, s 37\\.\n\nIn the case of a letter, there are no specific laws about who can sign it and how. You could very well get an employee to sign it for you.\n\nThe other issue to be aware of is deception. If I write you a letter signed \"Kim Kardashian\", but she has no idea I've done this and has not given me permission, but I lead you to believe that Kim Kardashian just wrote you a letter saying you're great, and then you go and embarrass yourself posting that letter on Facebook, then potentially I am in a bit of trouble. (A more serious example would be where I impersonate your bank and purport to waive the repayments on your mortgage, resulting in you defaulting.) In such a case, the relevant laws are the various laws to do with deception, not laws specifically about who can sign a document.\n\n**Is it legal for a single individual to use multiple signatures when signing legal documents (ie, is there a requirement your signature be identifiable or consistent)?**\n\nThis is fine. A real signature is not like a cryptographic signature. Its function is not to, by itself, prove the authenticity of a document. The act of signing something is significant because it shows commitment, etc, and for very important documents (e.g. deeds) people (or the law) will ask for the signature to be witnessed. The verification in that case comes from the witness being able to testify as to who they saw sign the document, not the appearance of the signature itself. \n\nKeep in mind that the law related to signatures evolved at a time when not everybody could write their name and continues to accomodate people who cannot today. \n\nThere is no reason or principle requiring an individual to use a consistent signature.\n\nThere is a practical exception in relation to banks. Banks keep a specimen signature on file for each customer and use this to decide whether to accept withdrawal slips, cheques etc. It is not an ideal system (it is not hard to forge a signature well enough to get past a teller) but in conjunction with the banks' other fraud prevention methods it is the best they can do. However, this is a matter of their own risk management not a legal requirement. If you were transacting in person at the branch and the teller knew you and the bank manager was happy, legally you could sign withdrawal slips with an \"X\" or a different signature every time."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company sends out demand letters for payment, all bearing the printed name of their Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at the bottom.

This aligns with the principle that default judgments don't create absolute truths, but rather allow the case to proceed without the defaulting party's input. In a new lawsuit, even if related, these assertions would need to be proven if contested.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the facts don't automatically become true and usable without proof in future lawsuits. Option B is wrong as these \"facts\" are not legally binding truths and can be challenged. Option D is incorrect because while these assertions aren't automatically true, they aren't necessarily irrelevant or inadmissible in related lawsuits; they just need to be proven if challenged."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93098/when-flatmates-get-an-avo-against-each-other-who-has-to-move-out", "docs_id": 93098, "title": "When flatmates get an AVO against each other, who has to move out?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If one flatmate trespasses in another\u2019s room after an extended period of hostile verbal and nonverbal communication, can the flatmate who was trespassed against get an AVO?

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential outcomes of this situation?\n\nA) If granted, the AVO will automatically require Flatmate B to move out of the shared residence.\nB) The court will always mandate that Flatmate A must relocate, as they are the one seeking protection.\nC) The AVO, if issued, will definitively state which flatmate must leave the shared residence.\nD) The specifics of the living arrangement following an AVO grant would be determined by the court on a case-by-case basis, with no guaranteed outcome regarding who must move out.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As stated in the original response, \"Usually, an order would specify what happens. There is no hard and fast rule in this situation.\" This means that the court would consider the specific circumstances of the case and make a decision accordingly. There is no automatic or guaranteed outcome regarding which flatmate would be required to move out. The court would likely consider factors such as the lease agreement, the severity of the situation, and the practical implications of their decision.

Let's say the estate's total value is more than $1 million and less than $6 million. It will be divided among ten beneficiaries, each receiving a percentage.\n\nOne heir currently lives in a house that would be part of the estate. The elder relative has stated that they must keep the house, anything inside it, and perhaps some additional funds for property taxes and such \"off the top\" (meaning, they receive this in addition to their percentage of the remainder).\n\nFor reasons that stretch over decades of family history, I believe strongly in the justice of this arrangement (which I do not benefit from). The beneficiary in the house devoted considerable time and energy to caring for the testator. Other beneficiaries have their own opinions, but most at least accept it as their relative's wishes.\n\nUnfortunately, this arrangement is not reflected in the will.

While beneficiaries may agree to override the will's provisions, the executor must default to the written will if there's any disagreement.

This is because:\n\n1. The platform's Terms of Service likely allow them to withhold funds during a fraud investigation, which is not necessarily an unfair contract term.\n2. The platform doesn't have indefinite rights to hold the funds, but they can hold them for a \"reasonable time\" during the investigation.\n3. The freelancer has a direct contract with the client for the work performed, separate from the platform agreements.\n4. Australian Consumer Law is unlikely to void the fraud risk assumption in the freelancer-platform contract as an unfair term.\n5. There is no standard 30-day release requirement for held funds in this situation.\n\nTherefore, while the situation is complex, the most viable option for the freelancer to recover payment is through legal action against the client, based on their direct contract for services rendered."}}
