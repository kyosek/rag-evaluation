[It is enumerated in a number of government constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial).\n\nHowever during the COVID\\-19 pandemic many courts suspended operations for months, and now more than 6 months later many are still struggling to resume even limited criminal trials. This means that defendants will wait at least six months longer than usual for trials.\n\nHow does the law balance the delays wrought by exigent circumstances like this pandemic with the fundamental right of defendants to speedy trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The hard part is figuring out what the nstional standard of speed is. As held in [US v. Marion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/404/307/), 404 U.S. 307,\nThe Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a speedy trial is applicable only after a person has been \"accused\" of a crime. In Washington, [Rule CrR 3\\.3](https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/?fa=court_rules.display&group=sup&set=CrR&ruleid=supCrR3.3) states the number of days and the order of priority to be given to trials. Therefore, under section (b), criminal trials take precedence over civil cases; criminal trials are to commence within 60 days or 90 days, depending on whether defendant is incarcerated. There are a number of factors that allow the deadline clock to reset, such as failure to appear, mistrial, change of venue etc. This also includes \"exclusions\" (events not counted for the 60/90 day rule) such as competency hearings, continuances and of particular interest for covid:\n\n> (8\\) Unavoidable or\n> unforeseen circumstances affecting the time for trial beyond the\n> control of the court or of the parties.\n\nIf that doesn't work out, then there is a \"cure\":\n\n> (g) The court may continue the case beyond the limits specified in\n> section (b) on motion of the court or a party made within five days\n> after the time for trial has expired. Such a continuance may be\n> granted only once in the case upon a finding on the record or in\n> writing that the defendant will not be substantially prejudiced in the\n> presentation of his or her defense.

The court may direct the parties to remain in attendance\n> or be on\\- call for trial assignment during the cure period.\n\nThat give a little bit of leeway. If they still cannot manage within that time frame, the last section of the rule is\n\n> (h) A charge not brought to trial within the time limit determined\n> under this rule shall be dismissed with prejudice. The State shall\n> provide notice of dismissal to the victim and at the court's\n> discretion shall allow the victim to address the court regarding the\n> impact of the crime. No case shall be dismissed for time\\-to\\-trial\n> reasons except as expressly required by this rule, a statute, or the\n> state or federal constitution.\n\nThe covid lockdown orders appear to have worked around the time to trial rules. [This order of March 20](http://www.courts.wa.gov/content/publicUpload/Supreme%20Court%20Orders/Supreme%20Court%20Emergency%20Order%20re%20CV19%20031820.pdf) orders that\n\n> 4.

Very little is known to me about what governmental organizations these people come from; or for that matter, what governmental organization oversees the sub\\-governmental organizations which perform the audits. What would the organization that oversees the sub\\-governmental organizations that perform the audits be called? I noticed that on Wikipedia it is mentioned that Australia has an entity called the [Australian National Audit Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit#Auditing_Australia), and that sounds kind of like what I am looking for.\n\nP.S. You may want to re\\-tag my question with \"auditors\", \"audits\", or something more appropriate than I have been able to find in the tags.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Within the field of accounting, the process of maintaining financial records and auditing financial records for purposes other than tax collection is called \"financial accounting\" as distinct from \"tax accounting\" and as distinct from \"managerial accounting\" which is the internal use of financial information for the purposes of managing the entity and improving its performance rather than for outside oversight of an entity. \n\nFinancial audits (as opposed to \"performance audits\") almost always pertain to either financial accounting or tax accounting. Obviously, tax audits are done by tax collection officials.\n\nIn the United States, financial accounting standards for non\\-profits are primarily set by a private organization controlled by the accounting profession called the [Not\\-for\\-Profit Advisory Committee](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/BridgePage&cid=1351027226246) which provides advise that is usually followed to the accounting profession controlled private [Financial Accounting Standards Board](http://www.fasb.org/home) that defines \"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\" (GAAP) in the United States for the for profit and non\\-profit sectors. This is the main body that sets industry accounting standards particular to non\\-profits and for fund accounting.\n\nThe private sector financial standards set by organizations like the FASC and NAC which are controlled by the accounting profession, are then adopted by reference by public or private organizations that want to specify accounting rules without having to devise them from scratch themselves.\n\nThese financial accounting standards are subject to specific tax law rules set by the IRS (under the Internal Revenue Code, [ERISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act), and related regulations and regulatory guidance) and state tax collection agencies, and by other industry specific regulations.\n\nIn cases where non\\-profits issue publicly held debt, the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or other applicable state and federal securities regulators, and the governing body of any exchange upon which the bonds issued by the non\\-profit are traded can also impose accounting standards. \n\nState probate statute also set some of the accounting standards for non\\-profits such as the rules for distinguishing between principal and interest.\n\nPublic or private donors to non\\-profits usually make grants that condition receipt of grant funds on a right to audit the non\\-profit, and investors in bonds issued by a non\\-profit generally have either a contractual or statutory right to obtain audited financial statements from the non\\-profit as well. These audits would usually be performance by Certified Public Accountants in private practice (and regulated under state administered licensing schemes) who are hired on an audit by audit basis.\n\nIn addition to tax collection authorities, and private people who have audit rights because they have invested in bonds from the entity or have given grants to the entity, **state attorneys\\-general** will generally have broad supervisory authority over non\\-profits including the same kinds of rights with respect to a non\\-profit that a beneficiary of a private trust would have (although sometimes a different official in state government is given this authority). \n\nState attorneys\\-general are given this authority so that there is someone with jurisdiction to oversee the affairs of, and prosecute misconduct in, charitable organizations with no well defined individuals or entities that are permanent beneficiaries of the charities.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the regulatory landscape for non-profit financial accounting in the United States?\n\nA) The IRS is the primary body responsible for setting all financial accounting standards for non-profits, including those unrelated to tax matters.\n\nB) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is a government agency that directly oversees and audits non-profit organizations.\n\nC) State attorneys-general have broad supervisory authority over non-profits, including rights similar to those of private trust beneficiaries, but they do not set accounting standards.\n\nD) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the main entity responsible for setting and enforcing non-profit accounting standards, regardless of whether the non-profit issues public debt.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the IRS primarily deals with tax accounting, not all financial accounting standards for non-profits. \nB is incorrect because FASB is a private organization controlled by the accounting profession, not a government agency, and it sets standards but does not directly oversee or audit organizations. \nC is correct because state attorneys-general do have broad supervisory authority over non-profits, including rights similar to those of private trust beneficiaries, but they are not responsible for setting accounting standards. \nD is incorrect because the SEC's involvement is limited to cases where non-profits issue publicly held debt, and it's not the main entity responsible for all non-profit accounting standards."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11901/why-do-judges-wear-costumes", "docs_id": 11901, "title": "Why do judges wear costumes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many judges often wear robes in the courtroom, but sometimes, they also wear it outside of the courtroom.

In medieval times, all educated people in the British isles, not just judges wore robes and these were customs descended from the Gaelic people who originally ruled Britain and Ireland. This custom differed from that of the Romans who wore togas.\n\nThe Gaelic elite wore robes with color signifying rank, black being the lowest rank, that of a docent, the lowest level of a professor. Later, when the Saxons invaded they eventually adopted some of the customs of the Gaels. The culmination of this was the founding of what is now known as Oxford University by [King Alfred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great), the greatest of the Saxon kings. This tradition was preserved and developed at Oxford which affected the dress of all academics, including lawyers and justices.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHL3C.jpg)\n\n**Thomas More in his regalia typical of an Oxford Don, c. 1500**\n\nThese patterns of dress also were influenced somewhat by Italian clerical styles.

The Gaelic robe either has no opening at all, just a hole the head is put through, or is divided at the back.\n\n**Wigs**\n\nThe custom of wearing wigs or perukes was a late development which originated in France in the 1700s and has no great antiquity at all.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the origin and history of judicial robes is most accurate?\n\nA) Judicial robes originated in ancient Rome, with black being the color of highest rank among Roman judges.\n\nB) The tradition of black judicial robes comes from medieval Gaelic customs, where black represented the lowest academic rank.\n\nC) King Alfred introduced black robes for judges when he founded Cambridge University in Saxon England.\n\nD) The use of black robes for judges was first established by the Italian clergy and later adopted in Britain.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, the black judicial robes have their origins in medieval Gaelic customs. In this tradition, educated people wore robes with colors signifying rank, and black represented the lowest rank of a docent or junior professor. This custom was later adopted and preserved through institutions like Oxford University, influencing the dress of academics, lawyers, and justices.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the robes are not of Roman origin; Romans wore togas, not robes.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect on two counts: King Alfred founded Oxford, not Cambridge, and the robes predated his time, coming from Gaelic tradition.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Italian clerical styles had some influence, they were not the primary origin of the black robes for judges.

That means that you hold the copyright to the text, and only you can authorize a derivative work (such as a synthesized recording). Therefore, you hold the copyright to the recordings as well. The crucial consideration governing that right is that you \"created\" the work, meaning that there is a [modicum of creativity](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/9413/4501). However, if you did not create the text and your only function is to host an automatic process where users can create a synthesized recording, then whoever created the text has the right to the text and derivative works (i.e. the synthesized output). Automated processes like (unassisted) OCR or wav\\-to\\-mp3 conversion would not count as being \"original\", nor would automatic text\\-to\\-speech, so you don't gain copyright just from making an automatic work\\-creating tool available.\n\nOn the assumption that the conversion involves a component of Chrome, you can use the service per the [terms of service](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/privacy/eula_text.html), though you cannot \"reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services\". This might limit the extent to which you could make this conversion available to others, depending on how, exactly, you could do such a thing (does it duplicate the service?). As they say, Google owns all legal right to the *Services*, but Google obtains no right from you for any content created through their service.\n\nThere is no restriction in the TOS against using the service for commercial purposes.

According to the Brussels Regulation (Regulation No. 1215/2012), judgments made in one EU member state may be enforced in another EU member state. However, this process is not automatic or immediate. It requires following specific legal procedures, which can take time. The judgment creditor must go through the process of registering the judgment in the other EU country.

The $3 administrative fee represents a unilateral change to the existing lease agreement, which is not permitted without the tenant's consent. In contract law, including lease agreements, any modification to the terms must be agreed upon by all parties involved. Company Z cannot simply add new fees or charges that were not part of the original lease agreement signed by John Doe, regardless of their new ownership status. The fact that they are providing a new service (rent statements) does not justify imposing a mandatory fee without the tenant's agreement. Options A and B are incorrect because new ownership or additional services do not override the terms of an existing contract.

While the company is not automatically liable just because the incident occurred on their property (ruling out option A), they may be held liable if negligence can be established. The fact that there were previous similar incidents that the company was aware of but took no action to prevent future occurrences could be seen as a failure to conform to the required standard of conduct, which is one of the key elements in establishing negligence. This is not clearly an \"act of God\" situation (ruling out option B) due to the company's prior knowledge of the risk.

[This rather long document](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf) analyzes the notion of \"declaration of war\". The primary significance of a \"declaration of war\" lies in international law, see the [Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907). Articles 1 and 2 say:\n\n> The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves\n>  must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form\n>  either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with\n>  conditional declaration of war\n\nand\n\n> The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers\n>  without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after\n>  the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by\n>  telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of\n>  notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware\n>  of the existence of a state of war\n\nSo if the US were to declare war on Canada, we would need to officially notify the government of Canada of this fact, which we could do because there is a country Canada whose government we can inform. This is not possible with \"terrorism\", which is not a nation. There were official declarations for the War of 1812, against Mexico, Spain, and WW I, WW II (11 declarations). Since \"the South\" was not (from the perspective of \"the North\") a separate country, the United States did not declare war on itself to conduct the Civil War. In fact, since the congressional action authorizing military action against the Algerine Cruisers (the [2nd Barbary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War)) in 1815, the actions authorized by Congress have not used the word \"war\" (except in mentioning a specific law, the War Powers Act), except in the aforementioned declared wars. Instead, the resolution described what could be done:\n\n> it shall be lawful fully to equip, officer, man and employ such of the\n>  armed vessels of the United States as may be judged requisite by the\n>  President of the United States for protecting effectually the\n>  commerce and seamen thereof on the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean\n>  and adjoining seas\n\n\"Declared war\" is a fairly limited genre of use of force, but \"being at war\" in the broadest sense, is common and can involve concepts and things (terrorism, poverty, drugs).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the United States' ability to declare war and engage in military conflicts?\n\nA) The U.S. can only formally declare war against recognized nation-states, as stipulated by the Constitution.\n\nB) The U.S. Congress has the sole power to declare war, and this declaration must always use the specific phrase \"declaration of war.\"\n\nC) The U.S. can engage in military conflicts without a formal declaration of war, often through congressional authorizations for use of force.\n\nD) The U.S. is required by international law to officially notify all countries before engaging in any military action, regardless of the target.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Would it be different if they were going through their own territory, or a third country's, with permission? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a hard question, but a good question. The following relates to the issue from the perspective of the USA.\n\nYou ask \"...if the US wants to invade France, **can** they officially declare war by...\", You have to make clear what you mean by \"can\". If you mean whether or not the US has the physical ability to do this, then of course they do. If you mean whether they are allowed, then this is another question. When you ask whether something is allowed, then you have to make reference to a moral code or a law that determines what is and what isn't allowed (legal). Normally each country will have laws that govern what is and what isn't legal for it's citizens to do. That hard part is how this applies to nations. There are two sides to the question. (1\\) What are the leaders allowed to do under their own laws, (the domestic laws) (2\\) what are countries as entities allowed to do? (the international laws) It sounds a bit like you are asking about the second thing. Here treaties govern what is and what isn't \"legal\". However, usually when someone breaks a law, other entities have the power to enforce that law and decide (judge) whether the person has broken the law. The question is: who decides whether a country has broken a treaty or an international law? And if a law is broken, what exactly can be done about it? This is hard to answer. \n\nConsider for example the conflict in Ukraine. Here many will argue that Russia has piratically invaded Ukraine. There should be war between the nations. But Russia denies this and other world powers have done little beyond imposing sanctions. This illustrates how hard it is to deal with this question.\n\nOne question that comes up is what the purpose of international treaties are if a country can just violate them without much consequence. Pointing out two points about this. (1\\) If, for example, a president wants to convince his/her own congress that the country *should* engage in war, then it makes a stronger point if you can show how the country you want to engage has violated international trities. (2\\) After you have won a war, you might want to prosecute the leaders of the loosing power. Here you will stand stronger if you can make references to some international law that existed before the conflict started. This second point is illustrated in the [Nuremberg principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles). Here it was exactly stated that \"*Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment.*\"\n\n[According to the US constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States) \"Congress shall have power to ... declare War\". That means that historically Congress has the power to decide where to wage war. The [War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) says, for example, that \"[The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities ...](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1542)\".\n\nNote that this doesn't mean that the US has do formally declare war before going to war. Example: [The Iraq War was authorized by Congress, but there never was a formal declaration of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Military_engagements_authorized_by_Congress). \n\nIt is interesting that you ask about the timing for when the declaration should be given. The Japanese wanted to [deliver their declaration of war just before](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/world-war-ii/resources/japan-declares-war-1941) the attack on Pearl Harbor. But because of issues with decrypting the message from Japan to the Japanese Embassy, the [declaration wasn't delivered until after the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_declaration_of_war_on_the_United_States_and_the_British_Empire). \n\nRemember also in all of this that the winning party to a conflict, usually decides what was and wasn't legal!\n\nOne good reference for more on all of this is the report by the Congressional Research Service called \"*[Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf)*\".

Parents also have some level of control over their children spending their own money (not the topic of discussion here).\n\nMy question is: given that once minor children receive a special gift it is theirs and the parents cannot take it, can parents legally *prevent* their minor children from receiving gifts in the first place?\n\nLet's say Grandma wants to give $10,000 to Junior. Could the parents say \u201cNo, Mom. Either give the money to us and we will administer it, or Junior can\u2019t accept the gift at all.\u201d? This is not taking what Junior owns, it's preventing him from owning it in the first place.\n\nIf such prevention can be legally done beforehand, then consider further if the gift has already been accomplished. Perhaps Grandma has *already* placed one hundred crisp 100\\-dollar bills into Junior's hands (or, say she deposits money into his custodial bank account before the parents learn of it). He runs to Mom and displays the cash/balance slip saying, \"look what Grandma gave me!\" Has the gift been irrevocably given at that point, or can the parents require it to be returned or set conditions on the gift at that point, given this is happening the moment they learn of the gift and immediately after the giving?\n\nIf they cannot prevent the ownership against the child's wishes at this point, what if the parents convince the child to give the money back or give the money to them (perhaps operating under a mistaken belief about what is legal, knowingly or unknowingly communicating falsehoods about the situation to their child)? Could the child or the gift\\-giver later claim that the parents stole the money because the child didn't understand his rights at the time? It seems like if the law considers a child competent to receive and own gifted property, the child is competent to also give away such property, and if a child could legally refuse Grandma's gift in the first place (even if foolishly) then he can also give away Grandma's gift after its receipt (even if foolishly).\n\nFocusing more closely on the quoted cases in the original question, one part may be relevant: in [HOBLYN vs. JOHNSON, 2002](https://law.justia.com/cases/wyoming/supreme-court/2002/434232.html) as recorded at law.justia.co (emphasis mine):\n\n> \"As a general rule any property acquired by the child in any way except by its own labor or services belongs to the child, and not to the parent.\" \\[46 C. C. 1314]. . . . It furthermore goes without saying that a parent cannot deprive a child of its property except pursuant to law (31 C. J. 1011\\), and the fact that in this instance the father had the property in question assessed as his property could not affect the title of the children. In Banks v. Conant, 14 Allen (Mass.) 497, it was said: \"In consideration of the duty which the law imposes on a father to furnish adequate support to his child during infancy, the services of the child during that period are due to the father, and, if they are rendered to a third person, the right of the father to recover the value thereof is clear and indisputable. But this is the extent of the father's right. He has no title to the property of the child, **nor is the capacity or right of the latter to take property or receive money by grant, gift or otherwise, except as a compensation for services, in any degree qualified or limited during minority.** Whatever therefore an infant acquires which does not come to him as a compensation for services rendered, belongs absolutely to him, and his father cannot interpose any claim to it, either as against the child, or as against third persons who claim title or possession from or under the infant.\"\n\nRephrasing this more directly, \"the right of the child to receive property by gift is not limited or qualified in any degree during minority.\"\n\nThis would seem to *suggest* that parents may not interfere with gift giving to their children, however it is not clear. Does \"the right to take property or receive money is not limited\" assert that children must be allowed to receive *any* gift at all? Or is this only recognizing that, once given (a process that the parents might legally prevent, but did not), the parents cannot then take the gift after its receipt?\n\nImagine the parents believe all dancing is wrong, and a friend of the child gives him a book on how to breakdance.

Judicial review is the power of the courts (the judiciary) to review decisions of executive government e.g. a decision of a council in a development application or the decision of the Minister in an immigration case.\n\nOf course, in American English, which is not the kind the High Court of Australia uses, judicial review does mean what you think it means \\- so you\u2019re only wrong in most of the World rather than all of it.\n\nUnconstitutionality\n-------------------\n\nThe High Court of Australia, like all common law courts, cannot veto legislation nor does it give advisory opinions. It exists only to decide controversies between litigants or in criminal cases, either as part of its original jurisdiction or as the final appellate court (since 1975\\) for all Federal, State and Territory law.\n\nIn deciding a case it can decide that Parliament has exceeded its Constitutional power and deem legislation [ultra vires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_vires).\n\n[This](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter1/The_courts_and_Parliament) Parliament House web page gives the following representative list:\n\n> * Petroleum and Minerals Authority case\u2014The High Court ruled that the passage of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill through Parliament had not satisfied the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution and was consequently not a bill upon which the joint sitting of 1974 could properly deliberate and vote, and thus that it was not a valid law of the Commonwealth.\n> * McKinlay\u2019s case\u2014The High Court held that (1\\) sections 19, 24 and 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, as amended, did not contravene section 24 of the Constitution and (2\\) whilst sections 3, 4 and 12(a) of the Representation Act 1905, as amended, remained in their present form, the Representation Act was not a valid law by which the Parliament otherwise provides within the meaning of the second paragraph of section 24 of the Constitution.\n> * McKellar\u2019s case\u2014The High Court held that a purported amendment to section 10 of the Representation Act 1905, contained in the Representation Act 1964, was invalid because it offended the precepts of proportionality and the nexus with the size of the Senate as required by section 24 of the Constitution.\n> * Postal allowance case\u2014The High Court held that the operation of section 4 of the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 and provisions of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 denied the existence of an executive power to increase the level of a postal allowance\u2014a ministerial decision to increase the allowance was thus held to be invalid.\n> * Roach\u2019s case\u2014The High Court found in 2007 that amendments to section 93 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, to remove the entitlement to vote from all persons serving a sentence of imprisonment, were invalid, being inconsistent with the system of representative democracy established by the Constitution.\n> * Rowe\u2019s case\u2014During the 2010 general election campaign, the High Court declared invalid amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 which had reduced the time available for updating the electoral rolls after the issue of writs.\n> * Cases involving Commonwealth expenditure\u2014in Combet (2005\\) the High Court rejected arguments that the broad terms of statements in an Appropriation Act were such that the Parliament could not be said to have authorised certain expenditure. The effect was that it was recognised as a matter for the Parliament, and not the courts, to determine the level of detail in such provisions. In Pape (2009\\) the Court held that a parliamentary appropriation was a prerequisite for the lawful availability of money for expenditure, but not in itself authority for expenditure; and that authority for Commonwealth expenditure must be found in the executive power or in legislation under a head of power in the Constitution. In this case the Court upheld the validity of the Tax Bonus for Working Australians Act (No. 2\\) 2009, but in Williams (2012\\) and Williams (No. 2\\) (2014\\) the Court held that the Commonwealth did not have the power to make payments under funding agreements (in this instance in relation to school chaplaincy) without the legislative authority to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the power of the High Court of Australia in relation to federal legislation?\n\nA) The High Court has the power to veto legislation before it becomes law if it deems it unconstitutional.\n\nB) The High Court can declare legislation ultra vires as part of deciding controversies between litigants or in criminal cases, either through its original jurisdiction or as the final appellate court.\n\nC) The High Court provides advisory opinions on the constitutionality of proposed legislation to the Parliament of Australia.\n\nD) The High Court can only review decisions of executive government but cannot rule on the constitutionality of federal laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the High Court does not have veto power over legislation before it becomes law. \nOption B is correct as it accurately describes the High Court's power to declare legislation ultra vires (beyond the powers) when deciding cases, either through its original jurisdiction or as the final appellate court.\nOption C is wrong because the High Court does not give advisory opinions on proposed legislation.\nOption D is incorrect as it confuses judicial review of executive decisions with the court's power to rule on the constitutionality of laws.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the High Court's role in the Australian legal system, where it can deem legislation unconstitutional as part of its judicial function in deciding actual cases and controversies, not as a separate veto power or advisory function."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86152/could-i-free-a-proprietary-font-by-printing-all-glyphs-tracing-them-with-a-pe", "docs_id": 86152, "title": "Could I &quot;free&quot; a proprietary font by printing all glyphs, tracing them with a pen, and scanning my copy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I understand correctly, typefaces are not copyrightable in the US, only the digital colt files.\n\nIf I want to make a libre version of a proprietary font, can I print out a document that says something like\n\n> ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789@\\#$\\_\\&\\-\\+()/\\*\"':;!?\\~\\`\\|^\\={}%\\[]\n\nthen trace the glyphs with a pen, scan my traced copy, and create a new digital font file from the scan?

This is likely to provide that if the work goes out of print (whch the contract normally defines) the author may reclaim the rights. But there seems to be no such provision in this case.\n\nThe contract language quoted does not license the right to perform the work.

For a musical or dramatic work, this might be of significant value.\n\nUnder [17 USC 203](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203) a US author has the right to cancel all previous licenses and transfers at any time during a period lasting 5 years, and starting 35 years from the granting of the license, or 35 years from initial publication under the license.\n\n17 USC 293 (b) provides that:\n\n> (b) Effect of Termination.\u2014Upon the effective date of termination, all rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grants revert to the author, authors, and other persons owning termination interests under clauses (1\\) and (2\\) of subsection (a), including those owners who did not join in signing the notice of termination under clause (4\\) of subsection (a), but with the following limitations:\n\nSubsection (b)(4\\) providfes that:\n\n> A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid **only** if it is made **after** the effective date of the termination.

The Act does not explicitly protect the right of unrelated individuals to live together. While there are occupancy standards, they are generally applied in the context of families with children, not unrelated adults. The landlord's refusal based on condo association rules for unrelated individuals is likely legal under federal Fair Housing laws.

However, the Supreme Court has recognized that sometimes there are *special law enforcement needs.* When those needs are present, the Supreme Court has approved of police setting up roadblocks to stop drivers without the police having any suspicion that that drive had violated a law. \n\nThere are two things that must be true for any given roadblock to be deemed appropriate. First, it must stop vehicles on a *neutral, articulable standard*. (An example is: \"all cars\"). Second, the roadblock must be *designed to serve the police officers' efforts closely related to a particular problem regarding vehicles and their mobility.* \n\nA roadblock to test for drunk drivers: valid due to the extent of the problem of drunk drivers. \n\nA roadblock to search cars for illegal drugs: invalid because its only purpose is to detect evidence of a regular crime (in other words, it has nothing to do with driving).\n\n**Addendum to address fixed checkpoints based on comment:**\n\nI came back to this and wanted to expand on the fixed checkpoints, which are checkpoints run by the border patrol inside of the US border. Crossing the checkpoint, a vehicles slow down and officials peer inside. Vehicles may or may not be asked to stop. \n\nBorder officials may operate such checkpoints in order to look inside of crossing vehicles and they may do so [*without a reasonable suspicion*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/543/) that the car includes illegal aliens. They also do not have to be approved in advance, so there is [no prior evidence\\-gathering needed](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html) to put one up. Further, officials can point a car to a secondary pull\\-off location for limited inquiry, also without a reasonable suspicion. It does not require the higher standard because the nature of the secondary pull\\-off search is not as intrusive as that of a roving stop (where the official is part of a roving patrol and may stop vehicles *but does require a reasonable suspicion.*).

While the roadblock does stop all vehicles (satisfying the neutral, articulable standard), it fails to meet the second requirement for a valid roadblock. The Supreme Court has ruled that roadblocks must be designed to serve police efforts closely related to a particular problem regarding vehicles and their mobility. Searching for illegal drugs is considered detecting evidence of a regular crime and is not specifically related to driving or vehicle mobility. This is similar to the example given in the documentation where a roadblock to search for illegal drugs is explicitly stated as invalid.

To what extent can those Terms and Conditions, as a contract, alter standard copyright law and Fair Use? Can they be more protective than copyright protection?

Still if this is important to you, you should get legal advice from a lawyer knowledgeable about copyright and IP law in your country. \n\nA contract cannot change the law, but copyright law in particular provides for honoring agreements between parties, and honoring and enforcing license terms imposed by the copyright holder. A license can restrict the use of a site in various ways. For example, a coding advice site could state that its examples are for education only, and may not be reused as part of a commercial product. \n\nUnder US law, as best as I understand it, a license or contract cannot restrict Fair Use rights, as those are rights given to any user without the copyright holder's consent. However, being informed of the rights holder's objections might weigh on some of the fair use criteria. Remember that fair use is a case\\-by\\-case determination, and the precise facts may change what is and is not allowed as fair use. \n\nFair Use is a very specifically US legal concept. Somewhat similar concepts in the copyright laws of other countries are significantly different, and go by different names.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The developer is definitely infringing on copyright law and must immediately remove the code from their commercial product.\n\nB) The new Terms and Conditions cannot be applied retroactively, so the developer is not at risk of copyright infringement for previously used code.\n\nC) The developer may be protected under Fair Use doctrine, but this would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering multiple factors.\n\nD) As long as the developer attributes the source of the code to the website, there is no risk of copyright infringement regardless of the new Terms and Conditions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This situation involves several complex aspects of copyright law and contract terms. While the website's new Terms and Conditions aim to restrict the use of their code examples, several factors come into play:\n\n1. Fair Use doctrine: In the US, Fair Use rights cannot be restricted by contract terms. However, the application of Fair Use is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the purpose of use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the potential market.\n\n2. Retroactive application: While the new terms might not apply retroactively, the original terms and conditions and the nature of the initial use would need to be examined.\n\n3. Contract vs. Copyright law: While contracts cannot change copyright law, copyright law does provide for honoring agreements between parties and license terms imposed by the copyright holder.\n\n4. Commercial use: The fact that the code was used in a commercial product could weigh against a Fair Use determination, but it's not the only factor to consider.\n\nGiven these complexities, the most accurate statement is that the developer may be protected under Fair Use, but this would need to be evaluated considering all relevant factors of the specific case. It's not a clear-cut infringement (A), nor is it definitely protected (B). Simply attributing the source (D) is not sufficient to avoid infringement in all cases.

According to UK housing laws, landlords have no affirmative duty to disclose personal information about other occupants, especially sensitive data like mental health history.

This is an excerpt from a recent, thorough discussion of the issue, which includes some sample cases and statutes:\n\n> While the law concerning the use of deadly force against police\n>  officials in self\\-defense is relatively developed, the law regarding\n>  the third party use of force against police officials is slim. . . .\n> \n> \n> [Section 35\\-41\\-3\\-2 of the Indiana Penal Code](https://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-35-criminal-law-and-procedure/in-code-sect-35-41-3-2.html) provides the clearest and,\n>  simultaneously the most controversial legal pronouncement regarding\n>  the use of force against public servants in defense of others. Section\n>  35\\-41\\-3\\-2 provides, in essence, that an intervener may come to the aid\n>  of the perceived victim of unlawful police aggression and may, under\n>  certain circumstances, use deadly force to protect a third party, even\n>  a stranger, from excessive police force. . . .\n> \n> \n> The states are split in terms of the circumstances under which an\n>  intervener may use force in defending another from excessive police\n>  force. The case law on this issue is sparse. In 1997, the Supreme\n>  Court of Nevada, in *[Batson v. State](https://law.justia.com/cases/nevada/supreme-court/1997/27353-1.html)*, in an issue of first impression,\n>  held as a matter of state law that an intervener can use force against\n>  a police officer in defense of another party when the intervener\n>  witnessed the excessive use of police force. The court stated that:\n> \n> \n> \n> > \\[A] person may defend another only where that person has witnessed a\n> >  police officer's unlawful and excessive use of force, and only where\n> >  the individual being \"rescued\" is facing imminent and serious bodily\n> >  harm at the hands of the police officer. Furthermore, an individual\n> >  acting in defense of another against a police officer may\n> >  only use that force reasonably necessary to remove the threat of\n> >  imminent serious bodily harm to that other person.\n> \n> \n> . . . So in Nevada, an intervener's actions must\n>  meet four criteria to exonerate him or her under the state's defense\n>  of others doctrine:\n> \n> \n> 1. The intervener must be a first hand witness to excessive police aggression;\n> 2. The police aggression must threaten imminent and serious bodily harm to the defended party;\n> 3. The intervener can only use the degree of force necessary to stop the threat of serious bodily harm;\n> 4. The defended party must have in fact had the right to defend himself or herself.\n> \n> \n> The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in *[Commonwealth v. French](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1992/531-pa-42-1.html)*\n>  articulated a similar standard. . . .\n> \n> \n> Although most states have no statutory provisions specifically\n>  permitting the use of deadly force on public servants, the case law\n>  permits the force under certain circumstances. It is less clear under\n>  the law of these states the circumstances under which an intervener\n>  can use deadly force against a police official to aid a third party. . . .\n\nKindaka Sanders, *[A Reason to Resist: The Use of Deadly Force in Aiding Victims of Unlawful Police Aggression](http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sanlr52&div=21&page=)*, 52 San Diego L.

State, a bystander can legally use force against a police officer to defend another person only under specific circumstances. These circumstances, as outlined in the passage, are:\n\n1. The bystander must have directly witnessed the officer's excessive use of force.\n2. The officer's actions must pose a threat of imminent and serious bodily harm to the person being defended.\n3. The bystander can only use the degree of force reasonably necessary to remove the threat.\n4. The person being defended must have had the right to defend themselves in that situation.\n\nOption C correctly captures these key elements, specifying that the bystander must witness the excessive force, that it must threaten imminent and serious bodily harm, and that only necessary force can be used. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they either omit crucial requirements or overstate the permissible circumstances for intervention."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45904/can-people-criticize-the-imperial-family-in-japan", "docs_id": 45904, "title": "Can people criticize the Imperial Family in Japan?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can people criticize [the Imperial Family in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_House_of_Japan)?

The 1947 Japanese constitution abolished L\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws, which previously made it illegal to criticize or insult the monarchy. As a result, criticism of the Imperial Family is now legally protected under freedom of speech. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there are no laws in modern Japan that criminalize criticism of the Imperial Family. \n\nOption B is false as there is no legal distinction between citizens and foreigners regarding criticism of the Imperial Family, and deportation is not a consequence for such actions. \n\nOption D is also incorrect because while there may be social or cultural sensitivities around criticizing the Imperial Family, there is no official government censorship or monitoring of such criticism in Japan."}}
