If I invented a new way to make Widgets, that method would need to be available to the public. The cheapest and most efficient way to disseminate the method to create Widget is not to patent it, but to publish it in a scientific or technical magazine in the right area. This not just makes many people aware of it, but it also makes sure that any company worth it's salt might counterclaim any patent filed based on the paper.\n\n> From time to time, I get an idea that seems (to me) marketable.\n\nThough, I need to pull this tooth of yours: 99% of all ideas that people think are marketable are either not developed enough to get to market, lack a market demand, or are already prior art.

This approach:\n\n1. Makes the idea available to the public, which is crucial for establishing prior art.\n2. Reaches a wide audience of relevant professionals and companies in the field.\n3. Creates a documented, dated record of the idea's disclosure.\n4. Allows companies to easily cite the publication if they need to challenge a patent claim.\n5. Requires relatively little effort from the inventor compared to pursuing a patent or managing trade secrets.\n\nOption A is insufficient because private letters to companies don't constitute public disclosure. Option C keeps the idea secret rather than making it public, which doesn't prevent others from patenting. Option D, while potentially creating prior art, lacks documentation and wide dissemination, making it less effective and harder to prove than a published description."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73500/do-i-need-to-keep-paper-copyright-registration-certificates", "docs_id": 73500, "title": "Do I need to keep paper copyright registration certificates?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Every time I register a copyright with the US Copyright Office, they eventually send me a fancy \"Certificate of Registration\" printed on heavy, patterned stock.

But there are alternative options to prove the same thing, even then.\n\nA copyright registration certificate is not like a dollar bill or an original promissory note, where a copy isn't as good as the original, even though it can be slightly convenient to have the original in hand.\n\n> Or are they just souvenirs that I can safely shred?\n\nIf you scan them and then shred them, nothing horrible will happen. In the rare worst case scenario where the fact of your registration is disputed by a stubborn defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit all of the way up to trial, you could get a replacement certified copy from the Copyright Registrar, or you could prove your registration with other evidence.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nRegistration is not required for a copyright to come into being in U.S. law. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 408(a). But it is a condition precedent (i.e. a requirement that must be met prior to taking action) to certain legal remedies. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\\. So, proving your registration is usually one element of your infringement claim in a typical copyright infringement lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, if you actually go to trial, you need to prove that the copyright was registered in a timely fashion, if the other side won't stipulate to that fact.\n\nBut it would be rare for a defendant who had been presented with a copy to insist that the fact of registration be proven at trial because being that stubborn is likely to piss off the judge unless they can successfully prove that you have faked your claim to have a registered copyright, which is something that almost no intelligent lawyer in a copyright infringement lawsuit wants to do, since judges have broad discretion on so many issues, even in a jury trial.\n\nThe easiest way to prove the fact that your copyright was registered on a particular date is to offer up a certified government document like the ones that you have in your office into evidence as an exhibit (typically, one of your very first exhibits in your infringement case). This is because an official government certificate is exempt from the hearsay rule, is \"self\\-authenticating\" ,and its contents are admissible if not barred by another rule of evidence (which it almost never would be). The legal reason for keeping these paper documents is to get that evidentiary benefit at trial. *See* Federal Rules of Evidence [803(8\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803) (exceptions to the hearsay rule), [902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902) (self\\-authentication) and [1005](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_1005) (admissibility of public records).\n\nOf course, mostly, these fancy certificates are issued as a matter of pride and ego and customer satisfaction. Prior to an actual trial or evidentiary hearing in a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copy, supported by your declaration under penalty of perjury that the copy isn't a fake, would be the usual way to establish your registration in documents that are e\\-filed through the federal electronic e\\-filing service called CM/ECF rather than presented in person on paper anyway.\n\nTypically, pretrial document disclosure is done via an electronic transmission of scanned copies as well.\n\nIn practice, it would be quite rare for a defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit to insist that you prove up your registration at trial, rather than just stipulating to it. Indeed, it is you who might not want to stipulate in a jury trial, just so you can flash an important looking document in front of the jurors right at the start of the trial for dramatic effect. But you don't have to do that.\n\nUltimately, if the defendant really did insist on proof of your registration, you could get a new certified copy from the Copyright Registrar (which wouldn't be quite as pretty, but would have the same legal effect) for a small fee without too much advanced notice, or you could introduce your scanned copy into evidence and authenticate it through, for example, your testimony on the stand under oath that you scanned the original and that it is a true and correct copy of the original.\n\nYou also might want to keep a paper copy because it will still be around if all of the relevant electronic records are destroyed or inaccessible for some reason.

Essentially, someone prepares a map of the initial boundaries of the municipality and a proposed name and proposed charter to a court of general jurisdiction in that area in a petition that also recites that all requirements to form a municipality have been met, and then gives public notice to everyone owning property in the area, usually by both mail and publication.\n\nOne or more hearings are held at which the court determines if notice was adequate and that the petition complies with the statute, and hears any objections (e.g. that some of the land is subject to some other municipality, or that someone doesn't want to be in the municipality, or that the population is insufficient to qualify).\n\nIf every property owner has consented in writing and it meets the requirements either with no objection, or with objections not supported when an evidentiary hearing is held on the objections, then the municipality is created. Otherwise, if any objections are overcome following hearings on them, then the judge orders that a vote be conducted, and if a sufficient percentage vote and a sufficient percentage of voters support creating it, then the municipality comes into being. An election for initial elected officials is held either contemporaneously with the formation vote or separately shortly afterwards.\n\nSometimes, much less commonly these days, a municipal government or local government is created by a law passed to create it.\n\nIn Colorado, the relevant statute is Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 [31\\-2\\-101](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-31-government-municipal/co-rev-st-sect-31-2-101.html) to 31\\-2\\-109\\.\n\nIn practice, it is now very rare that new municipalities are created.

Cases about it have tended to fall apart and get dropped before precedents got set.\n\nThe [Atomic Energy Act of 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Act_of_1946) ostensibly automatically classifies and controls any and all information about nuclear weapons, regardless of the circumstances of their creation. [United States v. Progressive, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Progressive,_Inc.) was a case about a publication purporting to reveal the secrets of the H\\-bomb, and based on unclassified/public information, that was challenged under this provision. Ultimately the case was dropped by the government, and many legal pundits believed it likely that SCOTUS would have ruled the provision an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. But it otherwise appears to be valid law, at least in the sense of not having been struck down by a court, to this day. [The government has tried to censor publications even within the last decade](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/hydrogen-bomb-physicists-book-runs-foul-of-us-energy-department-20150401-1mcp4g), though with limited success, in part because of the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect): aggressively trying to prevent people from looking at it just gives it free publicity and makes more people look at it. A more successful attempt by the government appears to be the case of [\"The A\\-bomb kid\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aristotle_Phillips), who wrote a college paper with a design for a nuclear weapon, and made a mockup of the design, both of which were confiscated by the FBI, but this was back in 1976 (and said kid later wrote a book about the whole thing).\n\nThat said, there are quite a number of ways of easily finding varying levels of nuclear weapons designs online already. [Including on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon). Government policy across the world has usually been to never acknowledge any purported leaks in any way; the US Department of Energy calls it their \"no comment\" policy. But such purported leaks do exist and can be found with relative ease, and many of the weapons designs you can find are based both on such leaks, as well as reverse engineering from non\\-weapons nuclear technologies such as nuclear reactors. The government is far more likely to try to restrain those who have actually encountered actual governmental nuclear weapons information, and have signed NDAs, but even then it rarely succeeds or pushes too hard. Most of the scientists who worked on developing the first nuclear weapons have published or publicly stated information concerning such endeavors, after all (though usually not terribly deep and technical; scientists have self\\-censored on nuclear weapons pretty much since German scientists first made public their possibility in the early 1930s).\n\nAs such, you are most likely just fine, and any attempt by the government to stop you is probably just going to result in more publicity and potentially more sales and money for you.

The information provided indicates that publishing nuclear weapon designs based on publicly available information exists in a legal gray area in the United States. While the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ostensibly classifies all nuclear weapons information, attempts to enforce this have been challenged on First Amendment grounds. Cases like United States v. Progressive, Inc. were dropped before setting clear precedents, and legal experts believe such restrictions might be ruled unconstitutional if brought before the Supreme Court.

Let's assume I pay for mortgage on my own, but she buys some furniture, paints walls, etc. Does she have any rights on my apartment, or not?\n2. Let's assume that officially I was paying for mortgage myself, but she is generous so she sends me 50% of my monthly mortgage payments to by bank account as an unofficial help. I don't think there is anything illegal with that. However, now if we would break up, she could go to court, show transactions and say that she was paying part of my mortgage. Is it possible that court would say that now part of the apartment belongs to her, or there is no way for her to prove that I was using that money as mortgage payments?\n3.

Now, the cover page of the modern printing says:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUUWE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUUWE.png)\n\nThe key part of the statement is the following line: \n\n```\nAll rights reserved, including the right to reproduce this book or portions thereof, in any form, without prior permission,\nin writing, from the publisher, except by a reviewer who wishes to quote brief passages.\n5761 \u2022 2001\nManufactured in the United States of America\nLibrary of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data\nShneur Zalman, of Lyady, 1745-1813\n\n```\n\nSo there seems to be 2 contradictory things in that statement: \\#1, it says that it's copyright and published in 2001, but at the bottom, it mentions the original authors name, and says explicit when we lived, which based on that, seemingly would mean that it is in the public domain. Possibly when it was first published, it wasn't necessarily copyrighted, so maybe that changes things. From the official [copyright law website](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap3.html), section 302:\n\n> 302. Duration of copyright: Works created on or after January 1, 19784 (a) In General.\u2014Copyright in a work created on or after January 1,\n>  1978, subsists from its creation and, except as provided by the\n>  following subsections, endures for a term consisting of the life of\n>  the author and 70 years after the author\u2019s death.\n> \n> \n> (b) Joint Works.\u2014In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more\n>  authors who did not work for hire, the copyright endures for a term\n>  consisting of the life of the last surviving author and 70 years after\n>  such last surviving author\u2019s death.\n> \n> \n> (c) Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire.\u2014In\n>  the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for\n>  hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of\n>  its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its\n>  creation, whichever expires first. If, before the end of such term,\n>  the identity of one or more of the authors of an anonymous or\n>  pseudonymous work is revealed in the records of a registration made\n>  for that work under subsections (a) or (d) of section 408, or in the\n>  records provided by this subsection, the copyright in the work endures\n>  for the term specified by subsection (a) or (b), based on the life of\n>  the author or authors whose identity has been revealed.

However, maybe this would then fit under subsec. \"c\", \"Anonymous works etc...\", which states, as quoted above: \n\n> In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made\n>  for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year\n>  of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its\n>  creation, whichever expires first.\n\nSo in this case, the first publication (although not in the US) was in the year 1848, and 1848 \\+ 95 \\= 1943, which has already passed. Or, it said, 120 years from \"its creation\", lets see: it doesn't say in the wikipedia page when it was created (as opposed to published), but even assuming it was created right before it was first printed, that would be 1848 \\+ 120 \\= 1968, still a year that has already passed.\n\nSo, can someone explain to me how the modern day book publishing company can copyright this work that was first published way more than 120 years ago? Do they own the rights to it at all? Can anyone republished (the original text of) it? If not, this seems to be similar to copyrighting a bible or Torah text itself, which I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to do, meaning copyrighting it has no effect, since its so old.\n\nSo what's the law here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They have copyright in their additional text, and possibly in things like their visual design choices (fonts, layout etc).

I worked for an Internet company that not only dealt with User Generated Content on our own servers, but also browsed the web looking at other sites quite a lot. This gives me an odd perspective.\n\nThere is a US law called [18 USC 2257](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257), and I fully expect Europe has similar laws. It requires any porn provider who shows people with genitals displayed in a suggestive manner to \n\n* obtain **informed\\-consent**, in writing.\n* obtain *in advance* certain specific **documents to confirm legal age** (you can thank [Traci Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traci_Lords) for that) and make good copies of them\n* **retain these documents on file**.\n* Keep these files in an **office which is staffed Monday\\-Friday 9\\-5**, effectively so Feds can walk into that office anytime and inspect the records.\n\nThe record\\-keeping requirements were originally thought to be the government harassing the porn industry, since it [had a long history of doing so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt). However in actuality, the porn industry was developing a very professional and cordial relationship with the Attorney General's office. The process got smoothed out: the \"staffed office\" requirement could be subcontracted to third party companies, so it became like a Registered Agent, something every company must have. \n\nAs Internet porn took off, they worked out ways for Site X to license content from Provider Y, and have the 2257 stuff work smoothly. Federal prosecution for porn had fallen to almost nil. Even amateur producers were entering the scene and not having any trouble with compliance.\n\nEnter revenge porn\n------------------\n\nNow you can see, under the 2257 legal framework, revenge porn is impossible because it does **absolutely none of this stuff**. It tossed the \"known rules\" and the working relationship right out the window. \n\nI expected revenge porn to end with door kickdowns and 2257 prosecutions, but it never happened. I suspect the Attorney General's office is a heavy \"ship of state\", and it is unable to make a \"snap turn\" from the cordial relationship with the porn industry, and feared damaging the relationship while the EFF screams about the bad old days. \n\nHowever, 2257 is still on the books, and *still* binds anyone who publishes porn. \n\nThe casual publisher\n--------------------\n\nThe Internet has created a real problem for the old model of \"all porn coming from companies with lawyers and 2257 offices\". Is it reasonable to hold a 16 year old boy with a smartphone to the 2257 laws? If you never meant to publish, but someone hacked your phone, who's responsible? That's for the courts to decide, but yeah, my intuition is that courts will seek to find an original *publisher* of a work, i.e. the guy/gal who turned it from a private document into \"one that is loose on the Internet\". **So to answer your question, it's not on the *producer*, it's on the *publisher*.** If you re\\-post porn that you \"found somewhere\", then you're the publisher, unless you can document a prior source.\n\n**But then, there are the child porn laws**. Mere possession of any pornographic photo of someone under 18 is an essentially automatic lifetime branding as a sex offender in the US, and most likely, a trip to prison. Publication is a confession to possession. On the other hand, the person actually being 18 is an absolute defense; the 2257 law doesn't apply to *mere possession*. Europe may be more lax, it's difficult to imagine them being more draconian. \n\nAnd then, you have all the common law that comes from the **basic sexual assault** that it is to publish someone's sexy pics without permission. And both state attorneys (criminally), and victims' attorneys (civilly), have a variety of legal approaches to go after you, if they want to. I can't guess at the risk of this happening over a random posting on the Internet, but it is certainly all downside risk, and no measurable benefit for you. So why do it? \n\nAlso, it's a completely horrible and evil thing to do.

The 18 USC 2257 law requires publishers of pornographic content to obtain informed consent, verify legal age, and maintain proper documentation. Someone who reposts pornographic images found elsewhere online would be considered a publisher in this context, even if they did not originally produce the content. They would be unable to provide the required documentation and consent forms, making them potentially liable under the law. \n\nOption A is incorrect because merely producing content without publishing it does not violate the law.

This is the obligation of the *data controller*. Any processing by a data processor happens under the authority of the controller.

Then, the controller must find a legal basis for this processing. Consent is only one legal basis among many. Consent is only explicitly required for a few narrow cases, however certain use cases effectively require consent as well, such as email marketing without a prior business relationship.\n\nBy itself the queries to B's list are not an actual purpose of processing so it depends on *why* these queries will be done.\n\nFor example, if membership in B's list is used to infer interests for marketing purposes that would be a purpose that would make it possible to discuss whether consent would be required. My hunch is that for that specific example, an argument could be made for legitimate interest instead. But the processing might be considered to be profiling, in which case additional restrictions might apply (e.g. some kinds of profiling do require consent).\n\nIf personal data was collected for one purpose but shall be used for another, Article 6(4\\) requires the controller to perform an analysis to determine whether this repurposing is possible: just because you have the data does not mean you can use it towards your goals.

While consent is one legal basis, it's not the only one, and obtaining new consent may be impractical in this scenario.\nC is correct. Under Article 6(4) of GDPR, when repurposing data, the controller must consider factors including the link between the original and new purposes, the context of collection, the nature of the data, potential consequences for data subjects, and appropriate safeguards.

Importantly, if you do start working anyway, you are not committing a crime and cannot possibly be banned or forced to leave the country. You do have the right to work from the day you became an EU citizen and if any doubt arises down the line, you should be able to clear it up later.\n\nIn practice, employers are sometimes supposed to check you are allowed to work (and for that would require some proof of your citizenship) but they don't necessarily need a passport or ID. What's typical on the other hand is that you have to provide an official proof of address (in the countries where you have to register your address with the authorities) and the local social security, insurance, or national tax number. Both of these will require dealing with the authorities and will be considerably more difficult, if not downright impossible, without a national ID card or passport (in fact it can even be difficult *with* a passport).\n\nI worked in multiple EU countries and I don't recall always having to present my ID to employers.

In both cases, I was expected to solve these issues within the first month and you risk a fine if you don't register within a week or two but it was neither illegal nor impossible to start working before all the formalities were completed.\n\nNone of this means I would be completely comfortable about being *months* without a passport. But the main issue for you will be entering the country and what your employer's HR department is prepared to tolerate, not any sort of legal obligation to hold a passport to work.\n\n*Note that in one of the cases I described above I went to the local consulate to get an emergency passport.

She also indicates that other tenants have been getting the same notices and phone calls, so this situation is not unique to me.\n\nI then give my 30\\-day notice over email, as requested, and I receive a call back from the same employee, saying the owner will continue honor my rent discount promotion from June onwards, but only if I pay the backdated rent.\n\n**Question**\n\nDo I actually owe this backdated rent? \n\nIt's suspicious that there were no notices for late rent payments until after new staff was brought in. Aren't verbal agreements binding? \n\n(Jurisdiction is US, state of California.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your title doesn't quite match your question. \"Reneging\" would mean saying that a lease would be offered at the reduced rent, and then not offering the lease. Here, they offered the lease, and you accepted. So now the question is not whether they can refuse to offer you the reduced\\-fee lease, but whether they are owed the back rent. \n\nVerbal agreements are indeed binding, but they are rather sticky from an evidential point of view. Also, there are other possible complications. If your original lease stated that verbal agreements are not binding, or that only specific people are authorized to modify the terms and the person you talked to is not such a person, then this is not binding. If after they said you could keep the rent reduction, you signed a lease for the full amount or otherwise indicated acceptance of the full amount, then it may be considered not binding.\n\nEven if the agreement is not binding, you have further arguments. If you believed that it was binding, and did so out of good faith, then there was not a meeting of the minds, and they can't go after you for breach of contract. They may have other claims, such as damages if they can show that they could have gotten more money from another prospective client, but them accepting the rent makes that difficult to pursue.\n\nNow, again, verbal agreements do have evidentiary problems.

Trademark infringement: If the game uses or references the name of the TV show, which is likely protected as a trademark, this could lead to legal action.\n\n2. Copyright on specific elements: Although the developer didn't use exact graphics or sounds, the overall presentation or structure of the game could potentially be seen as infringing if it's too similar to the show's unique expression.\n\n3.

Precedent from video game cases: While those cases were within the same medium, they demonstrate that courts have sometimes found infringement based on overall similarity, even without literal copying.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while game mechanics aren't copyrightable, other legal issues could arise.

In other words, they *are* trust funds subject to fiduciary duty and not ordinary operating accounts.\n\nThe Staff of the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission considered such a possibility in their opinion [TRUST ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: HANDLING CLIENT AND THIRD PARTY FUNDS](https://www.in.gov/courts/discipline/files/trust-account-materials-2012-03.pdf). While not stating outright that such commingling is unethical if there is neither intent to defraud nor recklessness, it gives two reasons why it could cause serious trouble:\n\n> 3. Risks of Lawyer Commingling Client Funds in Lawyer's Personal or Business Account\n\n> > (a) Client funds become available to the lawyer's personal creditors in the event of an attachment of those funds pursuant to proceedings supplementary to execution or otherwise under the Depository Financial Institutions Adverse Claims Act. IC 28\\-9\\-1\\-1, et seq.

Once again, there may eventually be a separation of interests in the funds, but in the meantime, client funds will be unavailable to their true owners.\n\n> > (c) ...\\[a scenario involving actual fraud and/or misappropriation]\n\nWhat they are saying is that even if you 100%, really and truly intend to just use your operating account as an \"in and out\" tool with full intention to devote your entire attention to promptly disburse the funds to their proper destination, that five minutes of commingling could coincide with some sort of legal event that would greatly complicate the payment.\n\nFor example, you transfer the client's funds from the escrow account into your firm's operating account at Time\\=0, morally confident that the transfer will be complete at Time\\=5\\. Unbeknownst to you, an earthquake occurs at Time\\=3 in which you are knocked offline and you and your entire firm are killed by falling debris. The contents of your operating account are frozen by your bank and sent to probate. Your client and Walmart hire another attorney to spend the next few months arguing over what your intentions were and why all of that \"operating\" money needs to be paid over to Walmart.\n\nSimilar to the above, you are in the middle of the transfer when a court order is served on your bank to freeze your operating account as part of some investigation into something entirely unrelated to your representation of your current client. Now, you are making your case to the court to unfreeze certain funds while Walmart is still waiting and your client is upset that you messed up something that should have been \"simple\".\n\n### A potential solution:\n\nThe same opinion, in Attachment G, provides:\n\n> Lawyers are permitted to advance filing fees for their clients out of operating funds, see, Ind. Prof. Cond. R. 1\\.8(e). In that event, no trust account questions arise from the use of a debit card that draws funds from an operating account.\n\nThe opinion then seems to indicate that debit cards should not be used, but in this case they are talking about linking cards directly to the escrow account:\n\n> May lawyers use debit cards to pay client funds for filing fees directly out of trust? The answer has two parts. First, current rules appear to prohibit it. Second, even if the rules were not an impediment, many banks refuse to issue debit cards on trust accounts.\n\nThe professional rule [cited above in the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct](https://casetext.com/rule/indiana-court-rules/indiana-rules-of-professional-conduct/client-lawyer-relationship/rule-18-conflict-of-interest-current-clients-specific-rules) provides that lawyers may \"advance court costs and expenses of litigation\". If the payment to Walmart can be considered a court cost or expense, it may be reasonable to pay the amount out of your operating fund and then immediately reimburse it with a client reimbursement from their escrow funds.\n\nThe pay\\-then\\-reimburse model also mitigates the issue mentioned above about intervening causes stopping the transfer.

This method is supported by the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct, which allow lawyers to advance court costs and expenses of litigation.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 primarily amended the Communications Act of 1934, which is the foundational law for FCC regulations. The 1996 Act inserted definitions that established telecommunications service providers as common carriers regulated under Title II of the original 1934 Act.

The key legal question was whether the matter is \"justiciable\" (meaning, not a political matter but a legal matter). Nixon's argument was that Senate Rule XI violates the Impeachment Trial Clause, and the court held that the question (more specifically what it means to \"try\") is nonjusticiable. White \\& Blackmun, and Souter, wrote concurring opinions (which might be called on in a subsequent impeachment case) that reminds the reader (and future court) what was not part of the holding of the court, and what might therefore allow future impeachment review.

In Nixon v. US, the Supreme Court did rule that the specific question of Senate impeachment trial procedures was non-justiciable (not subject to judicial review).

Because as written, it seems like they could have someone start their lease at the first day after what I mentioned in my noticed (May 1\\), and have the new tenant pay for May, after I have already paid for May.\n\nRelevant section from the lease\n\n> NOTICE TO VACATE Resident understands Washington State Law requires that to terminate residency, twenty\n>  (20\\) days written notice must be given to Landlord or to Resident by Landlord prior to the end of the monthly\n>  term. Resident agrees that if he/she remains in possessions of said unit after date of intention to vacate, he/she will pay a\n>  daily rental of $75\\.00 thereafter.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [law in Washington](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.200), RCW 59\\.18\\.200 (also stated in [59\\.04\\.20](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.04.020)), states that\n\n> When premises are rented for an indefinite time, with monthly or other\n>  periodic rent reserved, such tenancy shall be construed to be a\n>  tenancy from month to month, or from period to period on which rent is\n>  payable, and shall be terminated by written notice of twenty days or\n>  more, preceding the end of any of the months or periods of tenancy,\n>  given by either party to the other.\n\nI assume you have a month\\-to\\-month agreement (otherwise, you would be at the end of the lease and you don't have to give notice). The law simply requires written notice, and does not require any special form or signature. The misunderstanding by the agency about what 20 days is is common enough (after all, 30\\-20\\=10\\). One possible cause of confusion is over whether the law is stated in terms of tenants giving notice versus landlord receiving notice. The statute is not clear on this, but the above clause says \"given by either party to the other\", not \"received by either party from the other\".\n\nIf it is concluded, somehow (contrary to your attorney's argument) that your notice was not sufficiently timely, one option is to simply pay the next month's rent (at whatever the agreed rate is) and not leave until the end of the next month (giving timely notice early in the month). Under that option, landlord may not re\\-rent or otherwise illegally enter the premise, until the end of the subsequent month. A tenant may physically stay beyond the end of the lease, without paying \u2013 this is known as \"[unlawful detainer](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.12.030)\": under that circumstance, the landlord can take you to court to have you evicted and recover their damages (which would include attorney fees as well as lost rent), so that is not the best course of action). A third option is to abandon the unit. [The law](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.230) provides\n\n> If the tenant defaults in the payment of rent and reasonably indicates\n>  by words or actions the intention not to resume tenancy, the tenant\n>  shall be liable for the following for such abandonment: PROVIDED, That\n>  upon learning of such abandonment of the premises the landlord shall\n>  make a reasonable effort to mitigate the damages resulting from such\n>  abandonment\n\nThe liability clause says:\n\n> When the tenancy is month\\-to\\-month, the tenant shall be liable for the\n>  rent for the thirty days following either the date the landlord learns\n>  of the abandonment, or the date the next regular rental payment would\n>  have become due, whichever first occurs.\n\nThere is a problem with \"the date the landlord learns of the abandonment\": when (or what) exactly is \"the abandonment\", and does \"learning of the abandonment\" have to follow \"the abandonment\"? It may be tempting to think that signalling the intent to abandon starts the clock, but [Washington case law](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1215159/moore-v-northwest-fabricators-inc/) states that \"Abandonment, as applied to leases, involves an absolute relinquishment of premises by a tenant, consisting of act or omission and an intent to abandon\", citing NJ [precedent](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3577143/schnitzer-v-lanzara/). There does not appear to be any case law clarifying the meaning of \"learning of the abandonment\": it would probably require expensive litigation to establish that this means \"learning of the intent to abandon\", so you might as well assume that the abandonment clock starts from when you are really out of the unit. If you leave at the end of the month, indicate an intent to abandon the unit, and do not pay rent, then you will have abandoned the unit, and you will be liable for 1 month rent. However, they law also imposes an obligation to mitigate the damage, which basically means, no double\\-dipping.\n\nLeaving aside unlawful detainer, both the abandonment approach and the \"keep it another month\" approach entail paying another month's rent. In the former case, you have no claim on the unit but they can only ding you for rent for the number of unoccupied days. In the latter case, there is no option to pay less than a month's rent, but you retain full tenant rights (they cannot enter or re\\-rent). In neither case is there an avenue for both keeping the full month's rent from you, *and* re\\-renting the unit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Washington state gives a 20-day notice to vacate on the 11th of the month, planning to move out on the 30th.

However, the landlord cannot both charge for a full month's rent and market the apartment for that same period. If the tenant chooses to abandon the unit on the 30th, they would be liable for the next month's rent under RCW 59.18.310. But importantly, the law requires the landlord to make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages, meaning they must attempt to re-rent the unit. This prevents \"double-dipping\" where both the former and new tenant would be paying for the same period. Option C best reflects this legal situation, balancing the tenant's liability with the landlord's obligation to mitigate."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59761/can-states-legally-leave-entire-areas-unrepresented-in-congress", "docs_id": 59761, "title": "Can states legally leave entire areas unrepresented in Congress?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose, for example, that the Utah state legislature decides Salt Lake City shouldn't get US House representation, so they draw the congressional districts such that no district's boundaries include any portion of Salt Lake City.\n\nWould this be legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 14th Amendment says\n\n> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to\n> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\n> State wherein they reside.

Libraries are usually incentivized to be well occupied as it helps when they seek municipal budget contributions or tax levies.\n\nFWIW, I've used municipal libraries for lengthy research projects as a lawyer now and then, both in times when I've been between offices (e.g. at one point tenant finish wasn't done at my new office but my old lease has expired and I was mostly working from home), and when I need to concentrate and the phone and colleagues interrupting me with innocent reasonable questions that aren't urgent keep interrupting me.\n\nThird point: It is rare in practice for libraries to be overwhelmed with remote workers, in part, because you can't really talk on the phone or attend Zoom meetings, or meet with people. It is also poor for spreading out with a lot of dead tree paper, especially if filing is necessary. Coffee shops which allow for talking and allow food and drink are more popular and commonly used by low volume realtors and lawyers without offices (I used them for meetings when I was a newly admitted solo practitioner), day traders, freelance and novel writers, graduate students, etc. The prohibition on talking and on consuming food and drinks in the library mostly solves the problem. Also, lots of remote workers don't want to work someplace that has little children squealing during story time and lots of homeless people. In my experience, the most common kind of remote workers in municipal libraries are day traders.\n\nIt is much more common for municipal libraries in the U.S. (which are one of the only places you can just be without spending money) to come up with ways to limit homeless people (or to better accommodate them) than to boot them out. Many municipal libraries in urban areas have hired social workers in lieu of security staff to regulate things, place limits on sleeping in the place, and sometimes place a maximum number of hours in place.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHT: Libraries are publicly owned property, and as such, library managers have not only the regulatory authority of a representative of the government, but also all of the rights of a property owner at their disposal legally.

Additionally, libraries are incentivized to be well-occupied to justify their budgets, so charging fees would likely discourage usage.\n\nThe question tests understanding of common library management practices and the nature of public libraries as free, accessible spaces, while also requiring careful reading to distinguish between mentioned and unmentioned strategies."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80894/why-would-american-airlines-be-at-fault-and-not-the-arresting-office", "docs_id": 80894, "title": "Why would American Airlines be at fault and not the arresting office?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Context: [SOURCE](https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-sues-american-airlines-claiming-hasty-decision-wrongfully/story?id=85240322)\n\n> Michael Lowe filed his lawsuit on Monday in Tarrant County, Texas,\n> after he says he was arrested last July for a crime he didn't commit.\n> \n> \n> According to the lawsuit, a duty\\-free shop at Dallas\\-Fort Worth\n> International Airport in Tarrant County was burglarized in May 2020\\.\n> Surveillance footage of the incident showed the culprit was a\n> passenger of American flight 2248, and investigators obtained a search\n> warrant ordering the airline to produce \"any and all recorded travel\n> data for all individuals\" on that flight, the suit stated.\n> \n> \n> Instead, Lowe said, American only produced identification for one\n> passenger \\-\\- him.\n\n**Why would the airline have any responsibility?**\n\nLet us assume that the evidence excludes Mr. Lowe. I realize that they the airline has deep pockets / insurance so from that standpoint they are \"ripe\" for the picking. That being said, they did not arrest Mr. Lowe and the video evidence should have immediately exonerated Lowe. IANAL.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem was that the arresting officer and the investigating officer were two different people. After American airlines misidentified Mr Lowe as the suspect a warrant was issued for an arrest, and it wasn't until about a year later when officers in New Mexico ran his name and found that he had a warrant that they detained him. So their actions were perfectly proper. The length of his detention was primarily because the USA functions as separate legal jurisdictions, so you can be held for some time on a warrant for another state.\n\nPossibly the investigating officer should not have relied on American Airlines identification of the suspect. However, Mr. Lowe would have to overcome the qualified immunity bar to sue the PD.\n\nThe case against the airline is that of negligence: they had no duty to single out Mr. Lowe; they could just have turned over all the data, as requested. Having chosen effectively to carry out their own investigation, the claim is that they owed a common law duty of care to Mr. Lowe to do it competently. It's clear that misidentifying Mr. Lowe as the suspect was likely to do him harm, so it's a reasonable foundation for a claim.

The lawsuit is primarily based on negligence. American Airlines was requested to provide \"any and all recorded travel data for all individuals\" on the flight in question. Instead, they only provided identification for one passenger - Michael Lowe. This selective provision of information, which was not what was requested, forms the basis of the negligence claim. The airline had no duty to single out any individual, and by doing so incompetently, they potentially breached their duty of care to Lowe.\n\nOption A is incorrect because American Airlines did not directly arrest Lowe; law enforcement did based on the information provided.\n\nOption B is incorrect because sharing information with law enforcement pursuant to a valid warrant is not a breach of privacy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the airline's actions led to Lowe being suspected, they did not publicly declare him a criminal, which would be necessary for a defamation claim.\n\nThe case hinges on the airline's decision to go beyond what was asked of them (providing all passenger data) and instead conducting their own de facto investigation, which they allegedly did negligently, resulting in harm to Lowe."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64744/privacy-and-gdpr-on-facebook", "docs_id": 64744, "title": "Privacy and GDPR on Facebook", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a doubt regarding the privacy on Facebook and the law application.\nAlso lawyers That I have spoken with, seem not very sure about the matter.\nIn particular I would like to know if it is my right to ask the removal of photos of me that other people have shared in Messenger and in Private groups.\nIf it is my right, to whom I should address the problem? To people that have shared my photos (again in private chats and groups) or to Facebook? I have already kindly asked to remove the photos to people but I have not received reply.\nHow can I have the proof that the photos have been deleted?\n\nIn my opinion, since the photos were shared using Facebook they cannot considered private as it is an online tool and social media. What do you think?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are trying to invoke your Art 17 GDPR right to erasure. However, this right has many limitations. As a rule of thumb, your GDPR rights might not apply if their exercise would negatively impact other people.\n\nIn this scenario, you're seeking to delete images from other people's private chats. Requiring Facebook to search their chat messages according to your instructions would likely be a disproportionate invasion into those people's privacy, unless those images are inherently illegal. Even if you were the copyright holder for these images, it would likely be disproportionate to retroactively search the chats and potentially delete images. But you can't be the copyright holder since you didn't create those photos.\n\nAll of this means:\n\n* Facebook will likely refuse to act on your requests.\n* Those other people will likely refuse your requests.\n* A court is unlikely to order Facebook or those other people to perform a search and delete offending images.\n\nYou are claiming that since the images were shared with Facebook that there wouldn't be any expectation of privacy. This is a valid argument in the US (see the [third party doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine)). However, this argument doesn't fly in Europe in the context of the GDPR. Under the GDPR, any processing of personal data requires a legal basis, such as a specific law, the user's consent, or a legitimate interest. Facebook is bound by its privacy policy to keep private chats private. It has no legal basis to search those chats for the purpose of fulfilling your requests, unless you can get a valid court order that compels Facebook.\n\nMost likely, you won't be able to prevent private use of these images, for example your ex shares them in private messages. However, you may have personality rights that prevent wider circulation and publication of these images. That is difficult to enforce in the context of the internet, but it's more enforceable than what you're currently trying to do. If you're in a photo and you don't like it, you can report the photo to Facebook.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the GDPR, an individual requests Facebook to remove photos of themselves from private messages and groups shared by other users. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Facebook is legally obligated to search all private messages and remove the requested photos to comply with the individual's right to erasure.\n\nB) The individual should directly contact the users who shared the photos, as Facebook has no responsibility in this matter.\n\nC) Since the photos were shared on a social media platform, they are considered public and the individual has no right to request their removal.\n\nD) Facebook is likely to refuse the request as searching private messages would disproportionately invade other users' privacy, unless the images are inherently illegal.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the GDPR, while individuals have a right to erasure (Art 17), this right has limitations. Searching through private messages to remove photos would likely be considered a disproportionate invasion of other users' privacy. Facebook is bound by its privacy policy to keep private chats private and would need a legal basis (such as a court order) to search these chats. The request would likely be refused unless the images are inherently illegal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Facebook is not legally obligated to search all private messages, as this would violate other users' privacy rights. Option B is partially true (the individual can contact other users) but incorrect in stating Facebook has no responsibility. Option C is incorrect because under GDPR, data shared on social media is not automatically considered public, and users retain certain rights over their personal data."}}
