Apparently you are 25 hour short on that obligation, which may mean that you probably will be in breach of contract. I don't see what error there is w.r.t. the date: whatever the contract says, that is what you agreed to.\n\nPerhaps you are wholely responsible for the shortfall of hours, or perhaps the employer bears some responsibility (e.g. making it impossible for you to work). It sounds like the employer is offering you an accommodation so that you can fulfill the hours part of the contract, by extending the termination date. Technically, you also have to do the work by a particular date, but a reasonable delay in performance is standardly allowed under contract law, unless the contract has a \"time is of the essence\" clause which states that completion by the specific date is essential to the contract. If not, then there is reasonable flexibility in completion. Doing less than you contracted for, on the other hand, is not a standardly\\-available option.\n\nPursuant to the comment, it sort of sounds like the employer made it impossible to satisfy the conditions of the contract, and wants to use the end of contract date as a form of hardball to extract additional hours (i.e. \"we'll sue you for breach of contract for not having done this by the deadline, unless you agree to work an additional 15 hours\"). Hardcore deadlines without a time is of the essence clause don't support a claim for damages in case of minor delay, and even less so when the employer bears responsibility for the delay.

According to the documentation, the contractor is likely liable for completing the 200 hours as agreed in the contract. However, contract law typically allows for reasonable flexibility in completion dates, especially if there's no \"time is of the essence\" clause. The contractor may be able to negotiate a compromise to complete the remaining hours shortly after the original end date, but is not obligated to work until July 23rd as demanded by the employer. Option A is incorrect as the employer cannot unilaterally extend the contract. Option B is incorrect because simply terminating the relationship without completing the agreed hours could result in a breach of contract.

Standpoints (1\\) and (2\\) are largely equivalent.\n\nThe terms of the lease are unlikely to \\[explicitly] sanction the landlord's non\\-enforcement of the clause. But there are at least two legal arguments that favor your position:\n\n* The mere existence of no\\-smoking clause induces a tenant's reasonable expectation that the landlord will enforce the clause across the board. That inducement occurs at the formation of the contract, if not earlier.\n* The landlord's pretext that it \"*can't do anything about it due to Covid\\-19*\" reflects landlord's implicit acknowledgment of the aforementioned expectation of enforcement. Make sure you have that landlord's statement *in writing* so you can file it in court if need be.\n\nThe option that involves suing the smoker has the purpose of making him responsible for the penalization if you breach the lease. There is no contract between you and the smoker\\-tenant, but his repeated violations of a clause of which he was aware clearly disrupt the enjoyment to which you as tenant are entitled (and ultimately your contract with the landlord). This type of claims is known as *tortious interference with relation*.\n\nPrior to suing the smoker, you might want to send him a *cease and desist letter* letting him know of the legal ramifications of his conduct.

In this case, the employee fully owns the LLC, so any work performed through it would likely be seen as a direct violation of the non-compete agreement. This principle is supported by case law such as Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933], where the court held that an individual cannot escape contractual obligations by forming a company. Options A and D incorrectly assume that corporate structures can shield individuals from personal contractual obligations in all cases. Option B is incorrect as creating an LLC does not automatically void existing contractual agreements."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41474/is-it-okay-for-letting-agency-to-deny-me-viewing-for-not-telling-them-my-employe", "docs_id": 41474, "title": "Is it okay for letting agency to deny me viewing for not telling them my employer name and how long I had been in a profession?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it okay for a letting agency to ask me these questions ?\n\n1.

The contractor is responsible for completing all aspects of the job, including cleanup and removal of equipment. By failing to remove the bin, the contractor has not fully completed the contracted work, which constitutes a breach of contract.

The devices are used by company technicians when fixing network speed problems reported by subscribers. For every measurement the devices store the location and the time of measurement, and the measured network speed. The location is stored as the **technical identifier** of the subscriber's **network endpoint**, which basically identifies the \"internet cable\" installed at the subscriber's home.\n\n**Question 1\\. Are technical identifiers personal data?** Inside private company databases, they are definitely linked to subscriber data. They are also printed on invoices sent to the subscriber. But they are not public information.\n\n**Question 2\\. Can technical identifiers be stored in measurement devices?** The devices I made only measure a physical parameter, the network speed, for a given location in the company's IP network. I think this has nothing to do with the subscribers themselves.\n\nSomeone told me endpoint identifiers **should not be stored** in the devices, or at least **should be deleted after a while**, \"because of GDPR\". I think deleting the endpoint identifiers would make the measurements unusable, because the location of the measurement is very important for solving network problems. Delayed deletion is also problematic: if there is a 2nd speed problem months later, then it would be useful to have previous measurements at the same location. What should I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Question 1\\. Are technical identifiers personal data?\n\nYes. If they identify a person. For example an IP Address is considered personal data, because a person or household can be identified by an IP. Yes, I know that technically there are a lot of exceptions. But in general, if you have an IP, you can identify the subscriber given the right databases. So if your identifier, lets say a generated GUID, identifies a customer or something the customer can be linked to, it is personal data.\n\n> Question 2\\. Can technical identifiers be stored in measurement devices?\n\nJust because something is personal data, does not mean you are forbidden from using it. As long as you *need* it to do your job, you can store it. The internet would not work, if everybody was forbidden from storing any IP address.\n\nSo to summarize it: yes, it is personal data since it identifies a subscriber. However, it is needed for the job your subscriber asked you to do. So for as long as the job takes, it is legal to store it.\n\nOnce your job is done, you would be required to delete it.\n\n**But** consent trumps everything. If your subscriber consents to you keeping all data of such incidents to improve your network and handle future incidents better, then it's legal. Just let them sign it with your other legal paperwork. Done. No problem. You could just periodically delete all records that have no consent for long term storage beyond the current incident.

They can also detain people in connection with civil violations of immigration status, but US citizens cannot commit violations of immigration status. Of course, if CBP does not believe the claim of citizenship, they will treat the person as an alien who is therefore potentially subject to civil immigration detention.\n\nThe constitution guarantees a right to a speedy trial. That prevents (is supposed to prevent) indefinite detention of those suspected of crimes. I do not know what procedural guarantees exist for aliens in civil detention to prevent indefinite detention, nor whether a claim of US citizenship would affect the procedure.\n\n> Absent any indication of a crime or violation, does CBP have the authority to detain a US citizen if presented with proper identification documentation (passport card, passport)?\n\nNo. Absent any indication of crime or violation, they can't detain anyone except under specific circumstances for a very limited period of time. Specifically, they can stop people at Martinez Fuerte checkpoints, and they can stop people who are entering the country from foreign territory. In both cases, they need justification to hold them for more than a few minutes.\n\n> What obligation does CBP have to process a detained US citizen in a timely manner?\n\nThe same obligations that apply to anyone detained in connection with a crime, arising out of the speedy trial guarantee in the US constitution.\n\n> Does CBP \\\\ ICE have jurisdiction or authority to demand ID from citizens in a non\\-border or non\\-airport context?\n\nMore or less. If an officer charged with enforcing immigration law has reasonable suspicion that someone claiming to be a US citizen is not, the officer can ask the US citizen for evidence of citizenship. If the US citizen does not provide it, the officer can detain the US citizen while investigating the claim of citizenship. Remember, this is true only if there is a reasonable suspicion that the US citizen is lying.\n\n> Did the citizen do anything to warrant the detention?\n\nProbably not all 23 days. It looks like someone is trying to cover something up since they claimed that he never said he was a US citizen even though they seem to have filed a complaint alleging that he presented a falsified US birth certificate.\n\n> Is there anything the citizen could have done at the checkpoint to avoid detention?\n\nIt is hard to know without knowing more about what happened or definitely whether he was detained for civil immigration violations or for a crime. If the former only, a US passport might have helped.\n\n> If the citizen refused to answer CBP questions, could this produce a better outcome?\n\nI don't see how it would have.\n\n> Once detained, what could the citizen do to reduce the detention duration?\n\nIt sounds like not much in addition to what he did. Getting before an immigration judge should have resulted in his release, but immigration judges are very overloaded these days, I believe.\n\n> What are the lessons learned for other citizens?\n\nIt really seems to depend. Don't hang out with your out\\-of\\-status brother might be one. Get and carry a passport might be one. Move north might be one.

I'm interested in the theoretical here: if they have actual grounds.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **theoretical** is that the domain slutsofinstagram.com *does dilute or harm* Instagram's mark because of the use of \"Instagram\" in the domain and because of the unwanted association of the parody story; that's the theory and \"grounds\" that Instagram would use in their lawsuit.\n\nInstagram would have to prove their theory of dilution or harm to the jury or judge, and convince either that the harm is not theoretical but real and financially damaging in order to win their case. The owners of slutsofinstagram.com would have to defend themselves and argue that they are not damaging Instagram's mark and their parody is a parody and is protected as such.\n\nAny actual court outcome is also theoretical. If Instagram won their case, one of the legal remedies could be the court ordering the owner of slutsofinstagram.com to transfer ownership of the domain to Instagram so they could simply park the domain and effectively take down the parody story. Or, the owner of slutsofinstagram.com could prevail because they argued the fact \\- and the court agreed \\- that the domain name and creative contents of the site is a parody and is protected speech and doesn't dilute Instagram's mark because any reasonable person could see that the site is a parody and not related to Instagram.\n\nIn the US, a possible example of a parody not diluting a mark is [L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1987\\)](https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/llbean.htm), where \n\n> Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but plaintiff\\-appellee\n>  L.L.

The mark is being used to refer to, or **name**, the product (or service). It is not being used to sell a similar product, or anything else. No reasonable person could take it to indicate that the trademark owner has endorsed the person making the statement, nor that there is any sort of affiliation. \n\n[This page](https://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/Fair-Use-of-TrademarksNL.aspx) from the International Trademark Association describes the concept. \n\nThis concept is sometimes called \"fair use\" by analogy with the concept in US copyright law, but that term is not strictly accurate. It is better to simply say \"nominative use\" or \"descriptive use\". \n\nDigital Media Law's page on [\"Using the trademarks of others\"](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others) says:\n\n> As a general matter, if you are reporting on, commenting on, or criticizing a trademark owner, most ordinary consumers will not be confused about whether the company or organization is the source or sponsor of your work. You can reduce the likelihood of confusion further by avoiding a website design that looks like the trademark owner's site or resembles its product packaging, and you should never festoon your website with a company's logo (but isolated use when relevant to a discussion is OK)\n\n...\n\n> If someone threatens you with a lawsuit or sues you for trademark dilution, then a lack of consumer confusion will not help you. Here, one obvious line of defense is to argue that there is no likelihood of dilution. Federal and state dilution law protects a trademark owner against the whittling away of the distinctiveness of its famous trademark by association with other goods or services; it does not give a trademark owner the right to shut down all unflattering speech about it. If you do not associate a famous trademark with your own goods or services, then there can be no dilution (or at least that's how your argument goes).\n\n...\n\n> The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1\\) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2\\) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3\\) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits.

She is using the trademark to refer to the company and its actions in a factual manner, not to sell or promote any competing products. The use meets the three requirements for nominative fair use: (1) Coca-Cola cannot be readily identified without using its name, (2) Jane uses only as much of the mark as necessary to identify the company, and (3) there's nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by Coca-Cola.

According to the information provided, someone else (in this case, Sarah) can make the funeral arrangements on behalf of the next of kin (John) with their permission. Most funeral homes will accept payment authorization remotely via phone, fax, or email from the person responsible for payment. Additionally, the next of kin is not personally liable for funeral expenses if the deceased's estate is insolvent. The expenses are paid from the estate, and if the estate cannot cover them, the next of kin is not required to pay out of pocket.

(13:20\\)\n* Knowledge that you didn't like someone is used to convict. The focus is motive and opportunity. (14:50\\)\n* The 5th amendment was not designed as a shelter for the guilty (despite it often being used as such). It was designed to help prevent you from unknowingly incriminating yourself. (17:00\\)\n* Even if you are innocent, what you say to the police can be used to crucify you in court if the police don't recall your testimony with 100% accuracy. (17:38\\)\n* People often forget that \"them vs the legal system\" is like an \"avg person vs a professional boxer\". It seems that both defendants and juries are in the amateur vs champion game.

(I know the question asked about the UK, I just happen to know the US copyright rule.) It would seem on the face of it to include independent research on a subject totally unrelated to the person's employment, done off the company's premises and not during normal work hours, but while the person was an employee.. Indeed it would arguably include the copyright to a novel written off premises and during off hours. \n\nUse of \"course of employment\" (instead of \"term\") would improve the provision. so would \"as a part of his or her employment\" or \"closely related to the subject of his or her employment\". Another possible restriction would be \"Using the Company's facilities and/or equipment, or during normal working hours\".\n\nHowever, my experience is that an employer will have drafted whatever language it uses through its company lawyer, and will be quite unwilling to alter it in any way.

Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 99\\-100\\). A third\u2014unilateral declarations\u2014has also been recognized, but it is less well developed as a source (see Currie at p. 111\\-117; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France)*, [\\[1974] I.C.J. Rep. 253](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/58/058-19741220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf), [p. 266](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/58/058-19741220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf#page=18)):\n\n> It is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with the declaration. An undertaking of this kind, if given publicly, and with an intent to be bound, even though not made within the context of international negotiations, is binding. In these circumstances, nothing in the nature of a *quid pro quo* nor any subsequent acceptance of the declaration, nor even any reply or reaction from other States, is required for the declaration to take effect, since such a requirement would be inconsistent with the strictly unilateral nature of the juridical act by which the pronouncement by the State was made.\n\n### Treaties\n\nTreaties (also sometimes called \"conventions\", \"charters\", \"covenants\", \"protocols\", \"pacts\", \"acts\", \"statutes\", or \"agreements\" (Currie, p. 125\\)) express the will of the parties to be bound by their terms. The law of treaties is itself largely governed by a treaty: the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). The *Vienna Convention* describes the ratification process and how treaties come into force. It specifies that treaties are binding upon the parties and that treaties must be performed in good faith.\n\n### Customary International Law\n\nIt is also widely recognized that there exists customary international law that creates or reflects binding obligations on states. For something to be customary international law, a rule must satisfy two elements (see Currie, p. 188\\):\n\n1. general and uniform state practice; and\n2. *opinio juris* (the requirement that states believe that the rule is legally obligatory).\n\nSee also *Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya*, [2020 SCC 5](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18169/index.do):\n\n> \\[77] There are two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such: general but not necessarily universal practice, and opinio juris, namely the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation. \\[citations omitted]\n> \n> \n> \\[78] To meet the first requirement, the practice must be sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent. To meet the second requirement, opinio juris, the practice \u201cmust be undertaken with a sense of legal right or obligation\u201d, as \u201cdistinguished from mere usage or habit.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n> \n> \n> \\[80] When an international practice develops from being intermittent and voluntary into being widely accepted and believed to be obligatory, it becomes a norm of customary international law.\n> \n> \n> \\[82] Once a practice becomes a norm of customary international law, by its very nature it \u201cmust have equal force for all members of the international community, and cannot therefore be the subject of any right of unilateral exclusion exercisable at will by any one of them in its own favour.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n\n### *Jus cogens*\n\nThere are some elements of customary international law that are \"non\\-derogable\" (Currie, p. 206; [*Vienna Convention*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf), art. 53\\). These are called *jus cogens* or *peremptory norms*. These cannot be derogated from even by treaty. See *Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya*, [2020 SCC 5](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18169/index.do):\n\n> \\[83] Within customary international law, there is a subset of norms known as jus cogens, or peremptory norms, which have been \u201caccepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole . . . from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.\u201d This Court acknowledged that \u201ca peremptory norm, or jus cogens norm is a fundamental tenet of international law that is non\\-derogable.\u201d \\[citations omitted]\n\n### Relationship to domestic law\n\nTreaties do not change domestic law. States must take actions in good faith towards implementing treaties in their domestic law. This is known as the *dualist* approach.\n\nHowever, even in countries that take a dualist approach to treaty implementation, the dominant approach to customary international law is that it is directly and automatically incorporated into domestic law (see *Nevsun*, paras. 86\\-89, in particular the empirical study of Professors Pierre\\-Hugues Verdier and Mila Versteeg cited at para. 88\\):\n\n> \\[P]erhaps the most striking pattern that emerges from our data is that in virtually all states, CIL \\[Customary International Law] rules are in principle directly applicable without legislative implementation. . . . \\[M]ost countries that require treaty implementation do not apply the same rule to international custom, but rather apply it directly.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about sources of binding international law is NOT correct?\n\nA) Customary international law requires both general state practice and opinio juris to be considered binding.\n\nB) Treaties automatically change domestic law in all countries once they are ratified.\n\nC) Unilateral declarations by states can create binding legal obligations if made with the intention to be bound.\n\nD) Jus cogens norms are a subset of customary international law that cannot be derogated from, even by treaty.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is correct.

The critical bit seems to be \"A request may be excessive if it: repeats the substance of previous requests and a reasonable interval has not elapsed\". This is clarified \"how often the data is altered \u2013 if information is unlikely to have changed between requests, you may decide you do not need to respond to the same request twice.\" [The actual legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/53/enacted) says even less, but does say that it up to the controller to show that it is excessive.\n\nI was in the process of setting up a cron job to make an SAR to the DVLA requesting a list of organisations that have received my data.

I thought I had read that every 3 months was considered \"not excessive\" but I cannot find that now.\n\nI can think of 2 ways to make this decision, depending on what factors are important in the definition:\n\n* If the important factor is the use to which the data is to be put, then there is timing defined by the act, and this gives 14 days for a letter to be posted, received, acted upon than the response posted and received. I would say in this context 7 days would not be excessive for a process that could be completely automated.\n* If the important factor is \"information is unlikely to have changed between requests\" then I would take the distribution of information sharing events in the response to the 1st request, put them into a bayesian model and make requests at the frequency of the low end of the 95% credible interval of getting a change in the time period. It is quite possible, depending on the frequency of information sharing events , the time period for which information is provided as well as the model and prior, that this would be less than 7 days.\n\nI either case I would provide this rational in the initial data request, as well as informing them of my intention to make these follow up requests. It would then be up to the data controller to demonstrate that my rules are manifestly excessive.\n\nAs well as the DVLA, a similar argument could be made for many other organisations such as credit reference agencies. Many people may be interested in making these requests if it was demonstrated useful.\n\nAs a data subject, what aspects should be considered when making these decisions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no specific criteria for deciding whether a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, because this depends very much on context. The ICO has given some clarifications, but they still won't tell you an allowed frequency of requests.\n\nWe (as data subjects) should not invent particular criteria because they would be only our opinion. In any case, the data controller would have burden of proof to show that a request was indeed manifestly unfounded or excessive. That means that a data controller will generally err on the side of caution and allow repeated requests. But that doesn't mean you won't get pushback on your proposed frequency.\n\nI think your proposed approach is likely to be *both* unfounded and excessive.\n\nA controller has one month to respond to your request. Sending off a request while a previous request is still pending would likely demonstrate an excessive frequency of requests. Even if the data controller responds more quickly, it is doubtful whether that would entitle you to more frequent updates. Since the data controller will inform you about important events with a letter, this weakens your need to make frequent requests.\n\nYour \u201cBayesian model\u201d is also flawed, both in content and application. As your prior, you expect a very high rate of events. However, a normal citizen would expect to receive a parking fine approximately never. Your model should more correctly be based around the probability of missing an event, while also accounting for letters (which generally do arrive in time). It might also be incorrect to use *your* circumstances as the basis for determining a reasonable frequency. The ICO suggests multiple factors (nature of the data, purposes of processing, how often the data is altered, relationship with other GDPR rights). These factor's generally relate to the controller's processing, but not to your individual circumstances.\n\nNext, your requests seem unfounded: the purpose of your requests is not aligned with the GDPR, and automated requests raise doubt about whether the request is valid.\nYour motivation to make the requests is \u201cto know about claims such as parking fines \\[\u2026] when something goes wrong with the letters sent\u201d. This is a fairly speculative reason since letters generally do arrive well. In contrast, the GDPR provides for the right to access \u201cin order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing\u201d (Recital 63\\). You are not claiming the right to access for the purpose of verification and to obtain information about the processing, instead you're abusing the GDPR rights to create a kind of API that auto\\-updates.\n\nSo, is three months a hard and fast rule? Definitely not, but it seems like an unobjectionable, reasonable frequency. If a data controller thinks a request every three months is excessive, you'll likely be able to push back successfully. But with more frequent requests, you're entering a grey area.

If all of the primary beneficiaries are all dead, the company will check on the secondary beneficiaries. If there are no surviving secondary beneficiaries, the benefits go to the estate and are subject to probate. If a person is not specifically named as a beneficiary, the insurance company does not get involved in figuring out who gets the money. So then, as part of the estate, the benefit (and anything else) would go to whoever the state's intestacy laws dictate.

That law explicitly supersedes all state laws related to employee benefit plan. However, it explicitly does not supersede state law pertaining to insurance. One path would be to make the insurer prove in court that this is an ERISA plan (the burden is on the insurer, *Zavora v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.*, 145 F.3d 1118\\). If it is an ERISA plan, then you have to get a lawyer to challenge their finding. You should know that you have to submit all of the evidence to the insurance company first, and the legal presumption (\"deference\") is that the insurer is correct. There is a [very long article](https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context=lawreview) which addresses the legal matter of entitlement to survivor benefits under ERISA. Nothing therein suggests that the federal government dictates an order of succession. [This report to the Sec'y. of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/about-us/erisa-advisory-council/2012-current-challenges-and-best-practices-concerning-beneficiary-designations-in-retirement-and-life-insurance-plans.pdf), about beneficiary designations under ERISA, noting that \"The complexity of the rules under ERISA may, in some cases, lead to beneficiary designations that do not accurately reflect the participant\u2019s intent\". The document (which reports on common practice in the industry) notes that\n\n> If no beneficiary designation is made, the beneficiary is usually\n>  determined by the terms of the plan document. Retirement plan\n>  documents typically include default beneficiary provisions that apply\n>  in the event the retirement account owner fails to designate a\n>  beneficiary. The most common order used for a default is the current\n>  spouse, children, parents, siblings and the estate.\n\nIt is therefore possible that the *insurance company* included language in the plan that places siblings before the estate. Federal involvement could be a provision in the law that allows an insurer to specify default beneficiary provisions in case the insured's elections are deceased. (It is also possible that the insured made these elections decades ago and didn't understand the consequences of not mentioning grandchildren). Assuming that siblings precede grandchildren according to the language of the plan, then this is required by federal law in the sense that that is what the plan says, and the law requires the insurer to follow the plan (since the insured is assumed to have read and understood the plan, even though that is often not actually the case).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of an ERISA-regulated life insurance policy where all named beneficiaries are deceased, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the distribution of benefits?\n\nA) Benefits automatically go to the next of kin according to state intestacy laws.\nB) The insurance company has complete discretion to choose who receives the benefits.\nC) Benefits are distributed according to the default beneficiary provisions specified in the plan document.\nD) Federal law mandates a specific order of succession that overrides both state law and the plan document.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. For ERISA-regulated life insurance policies, when all named beneficiaries are deceased, the distribution of benefits typically follows the default beneficiary provisions specified in the plan document.

The Terms of Service and AUP state clearly that they are not to access the server or data contained within without a work authorization or valid legal request.\n\nThey also provide an internet connection to said servers, as well as several public IP addresses for use on these servers.\n\nThrough testing and diagnosis, I have determined (and their support team has confirmed) the existance of a device that intercepts outgoing SMTP traffic from said servers. This device acts as a man in the middle device, and rewrites said traffic to strip out the STARTTLS ESMTP capability (i.e. disables encryption), meaning that all ougoing email communications are either unencrypted, or fail (if encryption is set to be required).\n\nTheir reasoning for the presence of such a device is to prevent abuse of their network.\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2510 defines a wiretap device as such:\n\n> 5\\.\n>  \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication other than\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof,  \n> \n>  (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business or furnished by such subscriber or user for connection to the facilities of such service and used in the ordinary course of its business; or  \n> \n>  (ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business, or by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties;\n\nThis leads to two questions:\n\n1. Does the usage of this device fall under the classification of \"ordinary course of its business,\" given that it is not providing email service, but internet service?\n2. If not, does such action constitute illegal wiretap, or is there some other law or regulation that makes such action legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The hosting provider could indeed argue that disabling encryption of your SMTP to protect their network does fall under the category of \"being used...in the ordinary course of its business\". They are also \"the provider of electronic communication\", both of which give them a huge argument of immunity granted by section 5(a)(2\\).\n\n> 5. other than\u2014 \n>  (a)(ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic\n>  communication service in the ordinary course of its business, or by an\n>  investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his\n>  duties;\n\nIt would be on you to prove that deencrypting your data in this way is not ordinary in the course of its business. This of course would likely be very difficult, though not impossible depending on how its argued. \n\nIf your contract does state that \"they are not to access the server or data contained within without a work authorization or valid legal request\", then you could argue that they are indeed technically breaking the contract. Intercepting your SMTP emails and deencrypting them is \"accessing\" data contained on the server. If they are intercepting this data, then they could easily be recording it and there is likely no way for either party to prove whether its being recorded or not. \n\nAs a result, it does seem like you could win for breach of contract. Proving wiretapping could be incredibly difficult on your end without a great legal argument. You would have to be able to show that changing your SMTP data in this way is not an ordinary practice in their business. Their initial argument would probably be that data leaving their servers is deencrypted because they want to make sure that they aren't liable for sending out illegal data, or data that could harm their business such as bulk spam emails that could cause their IP address to get banned by email providers. If that's their defense, it would be on you to prove why this deencryption method of theirs is not \"ordinary\".\n\nI think your best argument is the breaking of the contract. As they are indeed accessing your data through interception and deencryption. Their perception of this clause is probably that they won't login to your servers and read your files, code and software. It's considered normal practice for hosting providers and telecommunications companies to be able to read all outbound traffic that is leaving their servers. For them to be deencrypting your code, they either figured out how to crack your encryption on their own, or they accessed your servers and are deencrypting it before its sent out through their internet service, or they stole the encryption keys from your server and are deencrypting it that way. How they are successfully able to deencrypt your data could play a large role in this case, as it may be difficult to prove wrongdoing by simply reading the data sent from their servers to requests by web clients.\n\nIf you really wanted to go after wiretapping or another class under Federal law, you would have to prove that deencryption of your code is code breaking/hacking/code cracking. And that it's perfectly normal for tech companies to send encrypted data over their network (which it is). Deencryption of your data could possibly be considered illegal under various hacking laws, if you felt that you wanted to build your case around that.\n\nTo summarize my thoughts:\n\nAs far as wiretapping, the hosting provider will likely be found allowed to read data that it sends from it servers as an ordinary practice of its business. This includes encrypted data.\n\nChanging the data to a deencrypted state could be classified as hacking/code cracking.

Assume that a person has been subpoenaed to testify in a case (either civil or criminal \u2013 the person is not the defendant or a party in the case), and the person speaks English fluently, plus some other language \"well enough\" \u2013 let us say that he speaks Tigrinya. The person decides that he wants to testify in Tigrinya, so he gives his testimony in Tigrinya. He does not demand that questions be posed in Tigrinya, he simply opts to respond in Tigrinya for \"artistic\" reasons. Is there a statutory or case law basis in the US on which the court can compel him to testify in English? Various provisions whereby people who don't speak English have a right to an interpreter don't apply, since he *does* speak English. Tigrinya court interpreters are common enough that this would not impose an overwhelming burden on the court. Does the answer change if the language is Karuk, for which interpreters are unavailable? I am specifically interested in the substantive basis for the conclusion.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can you be compelled to testify in English?\n\nYes insofar as the witness's reasons for not testifying in English are merely \"artistic\".\n\nCourts allegedly procure efficiency, economy, and *ease of access*. Translation costs and the possibility of translation inaccuracies (or perhaps witness's pretenses thereof) contravene these criteria. The witness's fluency in English makes it highly doubtful that allowing him to testify in a foreign language would improve at all the ease of access to evidence. Furthermore, the witness's \"artistic reasons\" are very likely to be perceived as vexatious.\n\n[*Duha v. Agrium, Inc.*, 448 F.3d 867, 876 (2006\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061315448f3d86711312) points out that \"*\\[c]ases involving foreign language documents normally consider their impact and perhaps the cost of translation in the balance of convenience*\" (citing cases). Although this issue generally is a factor for deciding whether a U.S. court is *forum non conveniens*, various court decisions serve as guidance on what approach to adopt on your question.\n\nFor instance, [*Re Nine West Holdings, Inc*., (U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Apr. 2020\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inbco20200413301) makes the remark that \"*communications between the parties were conducted in English*\", whence there seems to be no actual impediment for testimony in English. Also the \"*inconvenien\\[ce] to either party to have to litigate \\[...] in a foreign language*\", *Id.*, implicitly weakens the witness's \"artistic reasons\" for testifying in the U.S. in that foreign language. Conversely, see [*Takiguchi v. MRI International, Inc.*, (U.S. Dist. Court, Nevada, 2015\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20151209908), where a majority of evidence being in a foreign language \"*weighs in favor of dismissal*\".

Hananel, 575 F.3d 97, n.12 (2009\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20090805051).\n\nThese decisions suggest that a court would rather compel testimony in a form that is *readily available*.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the court's likely approach to this situation?\n\nA) The court must allow the witness to testify in Tigrinya, as it is their right to choose any language for testimony.\nB) The court can compel the witness to testify in English, citing efficiency and ease of access to evidence.\nC) The court must provide a Tigrinya interpreter, regardless of the witness's English fluency.\nD) The witness's artistic reasons are protected by freedom of expression and cannot be challenged.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Based on the information provided, courts can compel a witness to testify in English if they are fluent in the language, especially when the reasons for using a foreign language are merely \"artistic.\" Courts prioritize efficiency, economy, and ease of access to evidence. The witness's fluency in English means that allowing testimony in Tigrinya would not improve access to evidence and could be seen as vexatious.

This means that if user A uploads a file, and then user B uploads the same file, the file will exist only once but under two distinct aliases chosen individually by each user. This also means that if user B deletes their file (or more precisely their alias to the file), then the file will still be present in the storage service until user A also deletes it.\n\nA common sense counter\\-argument for this would be that without deduplication, in a system where each file is always distinct, if there are duplicate files then if one user requests erasure then we would not also delete all duplicates of the file which might belong to other users. Is there any reason for this to not extend to deduplicated files with aliases?\n\nAccording to section 65 of the GDPR[1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679), personal data can be kept for as long as it is needed for its intended purpose. Is the purpose that it is needed for other users to be able to access their data valid?\n\nI would really appreciate any insight on this and any good resources to further my understanding of GDPR.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this.\n\nDeduplication is a technical detail that's irrelevant here\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the data may be deduplicated on a technical level, the files remain logically distinct.\nIf users 1 and 2 upload identical files, and then one user edits or deletes their file, this will not affect the other user's data.\nUsers cannot tell whether their files are duplicates of someone else. From the user's perspective, it makes no difference whether or not the storage uses deduplication, except perhaps via the cost of the service.\n\nBecause there is no user\\-perceptible difference, it would be difficult to interpret some GDPR significance into this scenario.\n\nWhose personal data is it anyway?\n---------------------------------\n\nPersonal data is any information that relates to an identifiable data subject. The files here are likely to be their uploader's personal data. Thus, the uploaders would also have a right to have their uploaded files erased. In case of deduplicated storage, this would affect their logical copy.\n\nThe contents of the uploaded files might also be personal data relating to a third party. Then that third party might have a right to get the file contents erased. But this right must be invoked with the data controller for that processing activity, which might be company A, company B, or the uploaders, depending on context. Which leads us to the next aspect:\n\nCompany A is not responsible for handling erasures\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom your description, it sounds like company A is a data processor providing services on behalf of company B. In turn, B might be a processor acting on behalf of the uploaders. In any case, it seems that A would not be the data controller for these processing activities. Data subject rights like erasure must be invoked against the controller, as only the controller can understand whether such a request should be granted. The right to erasure is not absolute, and depends a lot on *why* that data is being processed. In particular:\n\nPersonal data need not be erased if it is still necessary\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, a person might very well be the data subject of some of these files, and might then ask for erasure. But if the files are being stored because they are going to be needed as evidence in legal proceedings, the data subject can't use this GDPR right to destroy evidence. The data controller would be allowed to refuse a request in such cases.\n\nIt could now happen that two different users of this deduplicated storage are storing the same file, but for entirely different purposes. Blanket deletion of all copies of a file could be quite problematic. Note that deletion is also a \"processing activity\" and needs a legal basis under the GDPR. Unexpected data loss could be a data breach. One user's erasure could be another user's reportable data breach incident.\n\nThus, I would strongly expect such requests to be handled on a logical file level, not on the deduplicated storage level.\n\nCaveat: public access and cloned files\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf the (logical) file is made available to the public who can then clone or copy this file, and if the \"original\" is taken down due to an erasure request (or copyright takedown notice), it might be appropriate to remove logical clones as well. Again, this might not involve deleting the contents on the deduplicated storage level, but it might affect other users' copies.\n\nIn a GDPR context, the grounds for this would be the Art 17(2\\) right to be forgotten:\n\n> Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.\n\nBut this depends crucially on who those other controllers are. If A is the sole controller, the logical files could probably be deleted directly.

If a user requests their data to be erased under GDPR, what is the most appropriate action for Company A to take?\n\nA) Delete all instances of the file from the deduplicated storage, even if it affects other users' data.\n\nB) Refuse the erasure request, citing technical limitations of the deduplication system.\n\nC) Forward the erasure request to Company B, as Company A is likely acting as a data processor, not a controller.\n\nD) Only delete the file if it doesn't contain personal data of other individuals.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Company A is most likely acting as a data processor for Company B, which would be the data controller in this scenario. According to GDPR, data subject rights like erasure must be invoked against the controller, as only the controller can understand whether such a request should be granted. The right to erasure is not absolute and depends on why the data is being processed. \n\nOption A is incorrect because blanket deletion could lead to unexpected data loss for other users, potentially causing a data breach. Option B is incorrect because technical limitations don't justify refusing a valid erasure request. Option D is incorrect because the presence of others' personal data doesn't automatically prevent erasure, but requires a more nuanced approach that the controller (Company B) would need to determine.\n\nBy forwarding the request to Company B, Company A ensures that the appropriate entity can assess the validity of the erasure request, consider any conflicting obligations or rights, and make an informed decision about how to proceed with the erasure in the context of the deduplicated storage system."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15434/is-it-legal-to-organize-a-female-only-event-assuming-the-topic-isnt-gender-spe", "docs_id": 15434, "title": "Is it legal to organize a female-only event, assuming the topic isn&#39;t gender-specific?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've recently seen a few \"female\\-only\" lectures about technical topics, organized by companies that try to promote the presence of women in engineering.

My idea is to use the user password to hash a salt to create a identify hash and track the user through this. Theoretically, the only way that I can return from hash identify to user is if I know his password, but it is a thing that only he know, by premise. So, it's considered anonymous or pseudonymised for GDPR?\n\\\\\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR has a fairly broad concept of what it means for a data subject to be identifiable. The details are given in Recital 26:\n\n> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.\n\nThe good news is that this mandates a risk\\-based approach to identifiability. You don't have to prevent re\\-identification with absolute certainty, but you must make sure that re\\-identification is not \u201creasonably likely\u201d.\n\nThe bad news is that \u201cidentify\u201d does not just mean \u201cfiguring out the real\\-world identity of the data subject\u201d, but also \u201cbeing able to single out the data subject\u201d.\n\nHashes of personal data are still personal data.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe hashed password still allows you to single out data subject, since the hash now serves as an identifier that links multiple records. Equivalently, a random ID would serve as an identifier. Depending on the information in the linked records, this could reasonably likely also allow linking to a real\\-world identity. I'll also point out that the GDPR explicitly notes that \u201conline identifiers \u2026 such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers\u201d enable profiling and identification, and are thus a kind of personal data.\n\nNote that it seems you have a user database that includes a password hash.\nThis database includes rich links between the password hash and other, more directly identifying, data. Alternatively, consider that the software that collects tracking information along with this tracking identifier would also receive other information about the data subject that could allow re\\-identification, such as the data subject's current IP address. It would be reasonably likely that such additional information could be used to identify or single out the data subject. For this analysis, it is irrelevant whether you have any *intention* of singling out users \u2013 it only matters whether, under an objective analysis, the relevant means to do so exist.\n\nRelated: EDPB thinks hashed phone numbers are personal data.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere has been recent debate by regulatory bodies on the question whether hashed phone numbers are personal data. This debate was published by the [EDPB binding decision regarding the Irish DPC's fine against WhatsApp](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/binding-decision-board-art-65/binding-decision-12021-dispute-arisen_en), which uses hashed telephone numbers to intersect user's address books. The question in the context of the fine was whether this represents processing of personal data of users who are not WhatsApp users themselves. Originally, the Irish DPC argued that such hashes were not personal data.\n\nHowever, the German, French, Portuguese, and Dutch supervisory authorities pointed out that the specific hashing approach used by WhatsApp does not provide anonymization, for example because there still is contextual information (such as the user's social graph) that would allow indirect identification (and because their hashing was pretty weak and reversible with reasonable effort). Such hashing would only be pseudonymization, not anonymization.\nThe Hungarian supervisory authority makes the argument that WhatsApp could always re\\-create the hash from the original data, thus permitting re\\-identification of the hash. This is in line with my above argument that the hash allows singling out. Again, the hash should be considered pseudonymous, not anonymous. The EDPB upheld all these objections against the Irish interpretation as \u201crelevant and reasoned\u201d, and largely agreed with their merits.\n\nSome parts of the resulting analysis are specific to issues around phone numbers, in particular that there are comparatively few phone numbers. However, a recurring point is that the hashed data cannot be viewed in isolation. It must be viewed in the context of how it is created and used, and in the context of other data that the data controller has.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIt is possible that in some cases the hash could serve as an anonymous token. But this would require careful analysis about how the hash is created and used, and about what other data you have available and could potentially link or correlate with this token. Unless you are extremely sure that there are no means that could be reasonably likely used to perform re\\-identification or singling out, you should consider such tokens to be pseudonymous data. Pseudonymization is a great security measure, but such data is still personal data. I suggest reading the [WP29 opinion 05/2014 on Anonymization Techniques (WP216\\) (PDF link)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf). It predates the GDPR and is slightly outdated in both legal and technical matters, but still contains highly relevant guidance on the matter of proper anonymization in the European data protection context.\n\nAside from identifiability issues, I am concerned about using the password (or derived hashes) for anything other than authentication.

The GDPR takes a risk-based approach to identifiability, considering whether re-identification is \"reasonably likely\" given all available means and contextual information.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that hashed personal data is still considered personal data under GDPR, and anonymity is not automatically achieved through hashing.\n\nAnswer B is too absolute.
