Sure, it may have been \"Disney World\\-ified\" in later years, but this is the 1970s and earlier.\n\nIt seems very strange to me that you would get such harsh prison sentences (or any punishment at all) for using Cannabis in a town full of booze, gambling, strippers and neon lights. It seems like the perfect place for this to be legalized as the first place in the USA...\n\nCan somebody please straighten this out to me once and for all?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can tell, it was punished severely, but not quite that severely.\n\nI found [Nevada's 1971 controlled substances statute, AB 107](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Statutes/56th/Stats197109.html#Stats197109_CH667). \"Marihuana\" appears in Schedule I, the list of drugs which are most tightly restricted (Section 31, subsection 4(j)).\n\nSection 65 makes it a crime to possess such substances. Under subsection 1, a first offense was punishable by 1 to 6 years in prison, a second offense by 1\\-10 years, a third or subsequent offense by 1\\-20 years. There were also fines of up to about $2000\\-$5000\\. There was an exception in subsection 3 for marihuana possession of less than one ounce: a first offense could alternatively be punished by up to one year in county jail, probably at the discretion of the prosecutor or judge. Second offenses were treated as a first offense under subsection 1, and so on.\n\nSelling and distributing drugs including marihuana was punished more severely. Under Section 62, the punishment was 1 to 20 years in prison for a first offense, and for a second offense, life in prison without possibility of parole. If the drug was distributed to a person under age 21, a first offense was punishable by life in prison, but with possibility of parole after 7 years. There was no exception for small quantities of marihuana.\n\nI didn't find a reference to the specific 25 year term you mention. It's possible that it comes from some version of the law as it existed before or after the 1971 statute; I didn't check. Also, marijuana was (and still is) also illegal under federal law; I didn't check what punishment federal law would have prescribed at the time. It's unlikely that the City of Las Vegas would have had separate laws; this sort of thing would normally be done at the state level.\n\nAs far as I know, this is in keeping with other state drug laws of the time, and given the prevailing politics, I'm not surprised by the law. Drug use was treated very differently under the law than the other \"vices\" you mention. It'd be outside the scope of this site to discuss the possible factors behind this, but you could perhaps take it to Politics.SE or History.SE.\n\nNevada eventually legalized recreational marijuana for adults in 2017, according to [https://norml.org/laws/nevada\\-penalties\\-2/](https://norml.org/laws/nevada-penalties-2/).

For possession of such substances, the law stipulated that a third or subsequent offense was punishable by 1 to 20 years in prison. Option A (1 to 6 years) was the punishment for a first offense, option B (1 to 10 years) was for a second offense, and option D (life without parole) was not mentioned for possession but was a potential punishment for distributing drugs to a person under 21 or for a second offense of selling and distributing.

The FDA has given [Emergency Use Authorization](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained) to some vaccines.

In general, the employer can fire for anything they want, unless you have an employment contract that limits the grounds for termination. There are discrimination\\-based grounds that they cannot use, such as race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, disability, age (age 40 or older), or genetic information at the federal level. Mississippi has no specific employment discrimination laws. Other that that, an [employer can fire an employee for any reason](https://www.blr.com/HR-Employment/Performance-Termination/Termination-with-Discharge-in-Mississippi), or no reason (Mississippi is what's known as an \"employment at will\" state).

While the COVID-19 vaccines may only have Emergency Use Authorization, this does not legally prevent employers from requiring them. Employers can implement such a policy and terminate employees who refuse, unless the refusal is based on a legally protected reason such as a medical condition or sincerely held religious belief.

There is no general law forcing relocation based on an employee's place of living, and such decisions are typically governed by the specific agreement between the parties. Answer A is incorrect as there is no universal legal requirement for employees to relocate based on their residence.

A good lawyer won't use those terms to mean allowed or disallowed. We talk in terms of potential civil or criminal liability, or other sanctions and consequences. To say that something is \"legal\" does not communicate much.\n\nSecond, all contracts are governed by a duty of good faith. That means that you cannot try to \"trick\" someone with the terms of the contract and expect to enforce that contract against them and you cannot try to skirt your obligations by finding a tricky form of compliance not within the mutual understanding of the agreement.

At this moment Alice could say that if he doesn't repay the damages she will sue. Bob would then have an incentive to pay, as he now knows that Alice is likely to sue and if it comes to that, he will likely lose much more (legal fees, time, etc.) So it would be optimal for both of them if Alice tells Bob that she will sue, as both of them would be saving time and money if he just paid her without going to court.\n\nSo, in the above situation, why should Alice just sue Bob without first threatening/warning/telling him?

The best, most efficient, most effective and cheapest way to resolve a dispute is to negotiate a settlement. The best, most efficient and quickest way to derail a negotiation is to make threats.\n\nPeople don't like being threatened. It makes them upset and angry. People who are upset and angry like to make the person who made them upset and angry upset and angry in return. This rapidly leads to an escalation of tensions often to the point that the thing (a lawsuit) that was previously only one option out of many is now the only option.\n\nSo instead of resolving the dispute cheaply, quickly and under the control of the parties to the dispute, it gets resolved expensively, slowly and by someone who doesn't give a rat's arse about the parties.\n\nLawyers can't make empty threats\n--------------------------------\n\nLawers have an ethical duty not to make threats they don't intend to follow through on.

US $50 million a year in lost profits.\n\nBut after filing an answer in the patent infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the patent infringement defense lawyer for Dull Co. who reads archaeology and linguistics texts in his spare time happens to learn that in 2016, archaeologists discovered an inscription in Old Persian from 1100 BCE in a newly unearthed tomb and translated it and published their findings in the journal *Nature*, describing precisely the same lost art of using flax oil to forge knives that Sharp Co. reinvented independently in 2012 and for which it secured its patent. No one affiliated of Sharp Co. learned about the newly discovered Old Persian texts until after they brought their infringement lawsuit and the lawyer for Dull Co. brought it to their attention. Dull Co.'s lawyer had raised the defense of invalidity based upon prior art in the answer that Dull Co. filed even though he didn't know about this particular prior art at the time.\n\nEvidence from the ancient Old Persian text and some related authentic texts written by Old Persian priests from a few centuries later indicates that there were hundreds of copies of the description of this process which were included in every prayer book of the predominant religion of the region now called Iran in 1100 BCE that was freely available in each of hundreds of temples in the region to anyone interested, but it was not preserved by later scribes who decided that it was considered an obvious piece of knowledge among metal workers that wasn't worth recopying at some point in the early Iron Age, even though they were wrong and the process was later entirely forgotten.\n\n**Question**\n\nDoes the previously lost prior art, that is rediscovered before the patent of the lost prior art process expires, provide Dull Co. with a meritorious prior art invalidity defense to the validity of Sharp Co.'s patent infringement lawsuit against Dull Co.?\n\nI can imagine this question functionally hinging on when prior art has to exist, and I could also imagine it hinging on the definition of what has to happen for something to constitute prior art. But, I'm not really sure exactly what the proper analysis would be.\n\n**Differences from prior similar questions**\n\nThis differs from the similar question \"[What impact does prior art discovered after (US) patent awarding have on enforceability and even validity of that patent?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15542/what-impact-does-prior-art-discovered-after-us-patent-awarding-have-on-enforce)\", because in this question, by design, there was nothing that would have operationally counted as prior art available at the time the patent was applied for and at the time that it was issued, while that question implicitly assumes that the only reason that prior art wasn't discovered was due to an inadequate prior art search when the patent was issued, and that a sufficiently thorough search for prior art at the time the patent was applied for and issued could have possibly found it.\n\nThis also differs from the fact pattern where someone already uses the patented process in a secret manner protected as a trade secret that is not disclosed until after the patent is issued, because, as I understand it, to be prior art, something must be knowable to people in the general public at some prior time (usually in a publication that is not confidential).\n\nThe example is loosely inspired by Rahil Alipour, Thilo Rehren, Marcos Martin\u00f3n\\-Torres. **\"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia.\"** Journal of Archaeological Science (2020\\); 105224 DOI: 10\\.1016/j.jas.2020\\.105224 (recounting their discovery that there was widespread manufacturing of chromium steel in Southern Persia around 1000 CE, a metallurgy technique that was subsequently lost and then only rediscovered about nine centuries later).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The patent is invalid\n---------------------\n\nFrom [35 U.S.C. 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102)\n\n> A person shall be entitled to a patent unless \u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent\n\nThere is no doubt that the Persion \"printed publication\" in c.1100 BCE predates the invention of the technique by Sharp Co. in 2012 CE.

According to 35 U.S.C. 102, a person is not entitled to a patent if the invention was \"described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.\" The ancient Persian text, despite being unknown at the time of Sharp Co.'s patent application, still constitutes prior art. The law does not require that the prior art be known at the time of the patent application, only that it existed before the invention. Therefore, Sharp Co.'s patent is invalid because their invention was not truly \"new\" as required by 35 U.S.C. 101.

Before 1949 it was a separate country. [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland) says in 1907 Newfoundland made the transition from the status of a \"self\\-governing colony\" to that of a \"dominion\".\n\nA \"dominion\" is what Canada called itself before 1982\\. As a \"dominion\", Canada was an independent country, which in particular sent and received ambassadors, etc., **except** that the basic constitutional law of the country was an act of the British Parliament, and so could be altered only by the British Parliament. I don't know whether that is how Newfoundland was organized when it was a \"dominion\". The Wikipedia article suggests the concept of \"dominion\" is defined in the Statute of Westminster, but that statute did not exist until the 1930s, so it could not have governed whatever it was that happened in 1907\\.\n\nWhat is the difference between the status of Newfoundland before 1907 and the status after 1907?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *I'll be referencing the* \"Minutes of proceedings of the Colonial Conference, 1907\" *throughout ([600\\+ pg. PDF](https://archive.org/download/minutesofproceed00colo/minutesofproceed00colo_bw.pdf)). The page numbers refer to the ones printed on the page instead of any software page number.*\n\nIt seems that @owjburnham's comment is essentially correct, it is mainly a shift in terminology. It came from a desire to further distinguish self\\-governing from non\\-self\\-governing colonies (or \"Crown Colonies\" as the official term seems to have been). As such, \"Dominion\" came to be (re)defined as \"self\\-governing colony.\"\n\n---\n\nDuring the 1907 Colonial Conference, Prime Minister [Sir Joseph Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ward) of New Zealand opined the following \\[pg. 30\\-31]:\n\n> I think the term \"Colony,\" so far as our countries are concerned, ought to cease, and that that term ought to apply to the Crown Colonies purely, and that those of us who are not at present known as Dominions or Commonwealths, should be known as States of the Empire, or some other expressive word, so as to make a distinction as between the Crown Colonies and the self\\-governing\n>  Dependencies.\n\nHe also stated the following \\[pg. 48]:\n\n> I assume that in this resolution New Zealand, now known by the term \"Colony,\" will be included in the expression \"Dominion,\" which I think it ought to be.\n\nAwkwardly, this was right at the end of the day and no one reacted to this statement as the conference adjourned.\n\n---\n\nAs the participants were deciding upon the structure and participants of subsequent conferences, there is a lengthy discussion of the exact term to be used to refer to the self\\-governing colonies \\[pg. 78\\-90]. Near its conclusion, the chairman states the following \\[pg. 89]: \n\n> We agreed \\[...] that instead of the word \"Colonies\" we should use the word \"Dominions;\" but is it sufficiently defined if we use the word \"Dominions\" alone throughout? \\[...] I would suggest that we might take what is really the official term \"the Dominions beyond the seas\" in the first place where it occurs \\[...] and any other reference to it in the course of the Resolution might very well be \"Dominions.\" That would make it absolutely clear what we mean by the expression in the first place.\n\nThus, the conference opted for an implicit rather than explicit definition of \"Dominion\". The designation of Newfoundland as a Dominion in 1907 is just a reconciliation of the fact it was a self\\-governing colony and the new understanding that the word \"Dominion\" was to mean roughly that. There was no effective change of status. An explicit definition of \"Dominion\" would not come until the [Balfour Declaration of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1926).\n\nIronically, Newfoundland played no role in deciding the term to be used for itself as [its Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bond) only arrived on Day 4 of the conference \\[pg. 87].", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The transition of Newfoundland from a \"self-governing colony\" to a \"dominion\" in 1907 was primarily characterized by:\n\nA) A significant change in its constitutional relationship with Britain\nB) The acquisition of new powers to conduct foreign affairs independently\nC) A shift in terminology without substantial change in status\nD) The implementation of the Statute of Westminster's definition of \"dominion\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect.

Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales)*, 545 U.S. 748 (2005\\) (full text [here](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/748/)). In this case, despite the urgent requests of the beneficiary of a Colorado domestic violence restraining order and the warning that a violent crime was imminent, the police in the Town of Castle Rock blew the woman off, and did nothing to prevent ex\\-husband who had illegally abducted her three daughters from murdering them even though they could easily have done so. The conclusion of the majority opinion by Justice Scalia states that (some citations and footnotes omitted):\n\n> We conclude, therefore, that respondent did not, for purposes of the\n> Due Process Clause, have a property interest in police enforcement of\n> the restraining order against her husband.

So, you can't bring a federal civil rights action to enforce a deprivation of that right.\n\nThe situation is even worse under state law, where police have absolute immunity from liability for all tort claims (i.e. roughly speaking, lawsuits to enforce rights other than contractual rights), unless it comes within a specific exception (of which are there are several) for cases of ordinary negligence such as car accidents when just driving around and not having emergency lights illuminated, or failing to clear ice from a sidewalk on police department property.\n\nTheir boss may not take kindly to their indifference, but that is a purely discretionary issue for their boss in the context of an employer\\-employee relationship (often further limited by civil service protections for public employees and/or protections as members of a law enforcement union).\n\nThe primary exception, not applicable in the example in the question, is that law enforcement officers have certain obligations to protect people who are in law enforcement custody from harm. This obligation is stronger prior to a criminal conviction, and is weaker after someone has been convicted of a crime and is serving a sentence of incarceration for that crime.\n\nIf you brought a lawsuit of the type described in the question, you would probably lose the case on a motion to dismiss filed swiftly after you filed your lawsuit, and there is a very good chance that you would be compelled to pay the legal fees of the people whom you sued.\n\n**Comparative Law Footnote**\n\nIncidentally, while this rule of law is widely shared in countries with \"common law\" legal systems derived from English law, it is not the case with nearly the same degree of clarity in \"civil law\" legal systems based upon the civil codes found in Continental Europe such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Almost all countries in Latin America, most countries that are not former British colonies in Africa, and most countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia, are civil law countries.\n\nIn civil law countries there generally are both statutory obligations and human rights law obligations for which the government or government officials can have liability for willfully refusing to enforce criminal laws. But even there it is, as a practical matter, difficult to enforce this obligation and is possible only in the most stark circumstances (such as the one described in the question where there is open defiance of this obligation without any understandable and legitimate contravening reason for failing to act).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, if the police refuse to respond to your stolen car report and prevent you from taking action to recover it yourself, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal action against the police?\n\nA) You can successfully sue the police for breach of duty, as they have a legal obligation to respond to all reported crimes.\n\nB) You can file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the police for depriving you of your constitutional right to reclaim your stolen property.\n\nC) You cannot sue the police for failing to respond, as they have no affirmative legally enforceable duty to take action to enforce the law for any particular person.\n\nD) You can sue the police, but only if you can prove that their inaction was due to discriminatory practices based on your protected class status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the U.S. Supreme Court case Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, police have no affirmative legally enforceable duty to the general public or any particular person to take action to enforce the law. This means that even if the police refuse to respond to your stolen car report, you cannot successfully sue them for failing to do their job.

He loves weapons. Above all, he loves practice shooting with his shotgun, which he jokingly nicknamed *shotzooka*.\n\nOne summer, Billy decides to innovate. He spends his days adding new features to his shotzooka. First, he adds a telescope. Then he adds a laser sight. But does not stop there. Somehow he manages to attach a remotely controlled anti\\-tank guided missile to his beloved gun.\n\nThe now upgraded shotzooka is capable of immense destructive power. Strangely enough, though, the weapon still resembles a regular shotgun. Billy decides to test his weapon's new capabilities on a tree. He locks his target, then takes a 180 degree turn and pulls the trigger. The missile turns 180 around and, flying at Mach 3 speed, pulverizes the tree to the ground. Billy had never had such power in his hands.\n\nCan Billy legally possess his *shotzooka*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, we need to determine what laws this new hybrid gun falls under. We got a normal shotgun, which in itself might be under the National Firearms Act (NFA) a Class 3 Destructive device, but most aren't. So, let's assume \"Shotzooka\" is a standard Remington 870\\.\n\nBecause Billy wants his gun to be more compact, he shortens the gun with a telescopic stock. Great, there are 2 options for that: a full stock that can be lengthened and one that is pretty much folding out completely. This can be a problem if the total gun in its shortest configuration gets below 26 inches length \\- then it is illegal under Texas law as a short barrel firearm. And the complete removal makes it **no longer** a shotgun under federal law but pushes it to a different weapon category: Any Other Weapon. Since it once was a proper shotgun (which means it had a stock) it can't ever become a Pistol Grip Firearm.\n\nNow, here comes the crux: owning and operating these is totally fine if you have them registered at the Bureau of Alcohol Tabacco and Firearms. But you need to register your intent to manufacture them **before** you start with the conversion and have the approval of your project. It also costs 200$ tax \\-but you need to also make sure your new gun is allowed locally (see below).\n\nThe Laser sight likely isn't a problem... but now comes the really big problem:\n\nThe laser\\-guided anti\\-tank missile. THAT is a problem. Because anti\\-tank weapons are explosive and all explosives are classed as Destructive Devices under the NFA (well,technically that's Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968 amending the NFA of 1934\\...). And possession of such a Title II weapon like a Destructive Devices demands them to be registered and tax\\-stamoed for 200$ federally \\- and manufacturing them is prohibited for private citizens.\n\nThis means in the act of mounting the missile to his shotzooka he turned her into an illegal, unregisterable NFA Class3 DD of the explosive type, illegally manufactured it, and just for the possession alone put himself up to a [fine of 250k and 10 years jail time:](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/houston/press-releases/2011/texas-man-charged-with-unlawfully-possessing-destructive-devices)\n\n> The charge of unlawful possession of a destructive device in violation of the National Firearms Act carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nBut the trouble doesn't stop there, Texas itself has a penal code that defines that anti\\-tank missile somewhere! [Texas Penal Code, Title 10, Chapter 46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm):\n\n> 46\\.01 DEFINITIONS\n> \n> \n> (2\\) \"Explosive weapon\" means any explosive or incendiary bomb, grenade, rocket, or mine, that is designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting serious bodily injury, death, or substantial property damage, or for the principal purpose of causing such a loud report as to cause undue public alarm or terror, and includes a device designed, made, or adapted for delivery or shooting an explosive weapon.\n> \n> \n> (10\\) \"Short\\-barrel firearm\" means a rifle with a barrel length of less than 16 inches or a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches, or any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle if, as altered, it has an overall length of less than 26 inches.\n\n> 46\\.05\\. PROHIBITED WEAPONS.\n> \n> \n> (a) A person commits an offense if the person intentionally or knowingly possesses, manufactures, transports, repairs, or sells:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) any of the following items, unless the item is registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or otherwise not subject to that registration requirement or unless the item is classified as a curio or relic by the United States Department of Justice:\n> \n> \n> (A) an explosive weapon;\n> \n> \n> (B) a machine gun; or\n> \n> \n> (C) a short\\-barrel firearm;\n\n> Sec. 46\\.09\\. COMPONENTS OF EXPLOSIVES.\n> \n> \n> (a) A person commits an offense if the person knowingly possesses components of an explosive weapon with the intent to combine the components into an explosive weapon for use in a criminal endeavor.\n\nOUCH! See that? The mounting of the missile launcher just turned the gun highly illegal, and even in the act of shortening the shotgun by altering the stock to be telescopic, it might have become illegal if the gun became too short. And it gets worse. The mere possession of the guided missile is impossible unless it's a curio or relic (which would mean it is old!) or registered, but it can't be because private citizens can't make it... and even owning the **parts** for the missile would be illegal if they would be used in a crime... wait, manufacturing of a missile **is** a crime, so owning the parts also is a crime!\n\ntl;dr:\n------\n\nBilly is screwed under **both** texas and federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario described, which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding Billy's legal situation in Texas with his modified \"shotzooka\"?\n\nA) Billy has committed no crime as long as he doesn't fire the weapon in a populated area.\n\nB) Billy has only violated federal law by adding the anti-tank missile, but is in compliance with Texas state law.\n\nC) Billy has violated both federal and Texas state laws in multiple ways, facing potential fines and imprisonment.\n\nD) Billy can avoid legal trouble by registering his modified weapon with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nC is the correct answer because Billy has indeed violated both federal and Texas state laws in multiple ways:\n\n1.

EZ Pass violation notices can be appealed.\n\nYour communication is apparently from a debt collector. You may demand evidence that the debt is valid before deciding whether to pay or contest the alleged debt.

In addition to the toll, a Violation Notice has a $25 Administrative Fee, $10 Ambulance Company Fund Fee, and a $15 fee to Combat Violent Crimes.\n> \n> \n> A Toll Violation Final Notice (see example) is issued if the Violation Notice has not been paid within 30 days. The Toll Violation Final Notice adds a Civil Penalty of $25 and a Civil Penalty Surcharge of $12\\.50 to the fees listed on the first Notice of Toll Violation. If the Toll Violation Final Notice is not paid, it will be subject to registration hold, collection activities or legal action.\n\nThose fees would add up to $91\\.50 on a $4 toll if a violation went unpaid for 30 days or more.

If any further information is needed please let me know and I will supply all that I can.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: DMCA applies as long as the the website is being *hosted* inside the U.S. The location of the copyright holder is irrelevant.\n\nFor step\\-by\\-step help drafting a valid DMCA notice, see Step 2 of <https://nppa.org/page/5617>. If the site fails to comply with a valid notice, they lose the benefit of DMCA's safe harbor provisions and become themselves liable for continuing to host the infringing work, and you can sue them. (Prior filing suit, though, I imagine a letter from a lawyer that says, \"Hey, my client sent you a valid DMCA notice a while ago; kindly comply at once, or we will actually sue you,\" should be sufficient.)\n\nThe requirement to submit a photo appears to be totally unnecessary. A valid DMCA notice includes a signature (electronically including your name in an email is sufficient) and an assertion, under penalty of perjury, that the writer is authorized to control the copyright work and that the work is being used illegally. Beyond a signature and contact information, no further identity verification is necessary. The DMCA handles this by opening the submitter to perjury charges if the takedown was submitted illegally.\n\nOf course, any site might choose to ignore your DMCA takedown, at their own peril. They might bet that you won't actually hire a lawyer and follow through on your legal right to file suit, or they might not understand that identity verification is not a legal requirement listed in [17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512). Your options are either:\n\n1. follow the law as written and file a valid takedown notice, and then hire a lawyer when they don't don't comply with the rules written in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n2. follow their additional rules to get them to comply, which may be more difficult but might not require hiring a lawyer", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the DMCA takedown information provided:\n\nQuestion: A non-U.S. webcam model discovers unauthorized videos of her performances on a U.S.-hosted website.

The separate opinion of the Chief Justice, being part of the minority view, does not create binding precedent, even given their senior position. Instead, it is treated as obiter dictum - a judicial comment that is not essential to the decision. Such opinions, while potentially influential due to the stature of the judge, are considered persuasive rather than binding on lower courts.

I doubt that your strategy would work.\n\nThe GDPR does not explicitly allow you to choose in which format your requests will be answered. If the data controller chooses a different format or medium, I would assume they are compliant. All the GDPR says is this (Art 12(1\\)):\n\n> The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.\n\nFor example, it would likely be perfectly compliant if they provide a response through physical mail. Electronic mail is common as a convenience to both parties. You as the data subject have no legal basis for forcing the data controller to interact with any website.\n\nFurthermore, the GDPR does not give you a right to receive responses in a machine\\-readable format.

While generally similar \u2013 and usually handled by data controllers together \u2013 they have different conditions and cover different information.

In any case, there are no commonly used machine\\-readable formats for responses to data subject requests, so that each controller could choose its own format (typically a JSON or XML file or a ZIP archive with a custom schema/structure) \u2013 but only for the copy of your data, not for the additional information mentioned in Art 15\\.\n\nSending data subject requests from a no\\-reply address could be an indication that you're not actually interested in the responses, which could indicate that your requests are \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d and can therefore be rejected under Art 12(5\\).

Trademark law specifically allows *nominative use*. You may use the name \"Ubuntu\" to refer to \"Ubuntu\". That sounds obvious, but it's good to remember that this is a legal right. \n\nHaving said that, there are far more serious problems with the Canonical policy. For instance, both its claims that \"Canonical IP is the exclusive property of Canonical and can only be used with Canonical\u2019s permission\" and that it \"can be revoked at any time\" are in direct contradiction with the GPL (both v2 and v3\\), yet Canonical obviously distributes binaries built from GPL\\-licensed sources \\- Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nSo, I'm confident to say that Mint knows how weak Canonical's policy is.

The information provided emphasizes that trademark policy cannot override trademark law, and nominative use is a legal right. Additionally, the answer points out that Canonical's policy has serious problems and contradictions with the GPL, suggesting that Linux Mint is likely aware of the policy's weaknesses.

There are all sorts of laws establishing duties of care, such as between doctor and patient, which may be created by a legislature or may be part of common law tradition. There is a duty of care imposed on a landlord w.r.t. the tenant, requiring that the premise be \"secure\", therefore a landlord might easily be held liable if the main door into the building was not locked. This duty is a specific instance of a general duty from tradesman/businessman to customer.\n\nAs far as I can determine, there is no such statutory duty imposed on tenants in Washington state, and none from case law being revealed by a few cursory searches. In order to be subsumed under general \"everybody has a duty to everybody else\" law, the damage would have to be foreseeable. It is said that \"If something is foreseeable, it is a probable and predictable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligent actions or inaction\". This mean that a reasonable person would have known that, under the circumstances, the damage is likely to result. Circumstances vary quite a bit, and there is no general rule about holding the door open for another person. If there is abundant signage reminding tenants to never ever let in a stranger no matter that their excuse and/or if the premise is in a crime war\\-zone, the outcome is more likely to be considered to be foreseeable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a high-crime area apartment complex with gated entry and prominent signage warning residents not to let in strangers, a tenant holds the gate open for an unknown person who claims to have forgotten their key.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the tenant's potential liability?\n\nA) The tenant is automatically liable for damages because they breached the building's explicit policy.\n\nB) The tenant cannot be held liable under any circumstances as there is no statutory duty for tenants to secure the premises.\n\nC) The tenant may potentially be held liable if it can be proven that the damage was reasonably foreseeable given the circumstances.\n\nD) The tenant is only liable if they personally knew the individual they let in.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While there is no specific statutory duty for tenants to secure the premises, the general principle of duty of care applies. In this scenario, several factors increase the foreseeability of potential harm:\n1. The area is known to have high crime rates.\n2. There is prominent signage warning against letting in strangers.\n3. The complex has gated entry, indicating a need for security.\n\nGiven these circumstances, a reasonable person might foresee that letting in an unknown individual could lead to criminal activity. Therefore, the tenant may potentially be held liable if it can be proven that the damage was reasonably foreseeable. This aligns with the principle stated in the documentation that \"If something is foreseeable, it is a probable and predictable consequence of the defendant's negligent actions or inaction.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because automatic liability is not established; it depends on the specific circumstances and foreseeability. Option B is too absolute, as liability can still arise from general duty of care principles even without specific statutory requirements. Option D is overly narrow, as liability is not limited to personally knowing the individual, but rather based on the reasonable foreseeability of harm."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41862/can-liability-for-data-disclosure-be-waived-by-tcs-under-gdpr", "docs_id": 41862, "title": "Can liability for data disclosure be waived by T&amp;Cs under GDPR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in Ireland, an EU county subject to the GDPR.\n\nI see in a service T\\&Cs the line:\n\n> \"Despite our use of commercially reasonable efforts to protect your\n>  Personal Information from unauthorized access or disclosure, the\n>  Internet is not an inherently secure environment and so we cannot\n>  guarantee the security of your Personal Information.

I know the Dictionary Act defines it as an \"individual\" or a corporation, corporate body, but that leaves open the question, what is an \"individual\" under U.S. law? There is the Black's Law Dictionary, which defines \"person\" as a \"human being.\"\n\nI am also aware that the word \"individual\" is distinguished from corporations by the distinct jurisprudential definitions for \"natural person\" and \"legal person,\" or \"artificial person.\" \"Natural person\" is defined as a human being who is born alive by Black's Law Dictionary. So is \"individual\" in the Dictionary Act equivalent to a \"natural person,\" and thus, a \"human being\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Caveat**\n\nKeep in mind that words do not have uniform definitions for all times and places and contexts. Words can have different meanings in particular contexts and can be defined in a contract or statute to have a meaning different from the common meaning.\n\n**\"Person\" Usually Includes Entities Of Any Kind**\n\nThis said, usually the term \"person\" in the law refers to any human being and any trust, estate or entity that is capable of suing and being sued and entering into contracts. \n\nAn \"entity\" in this sense would often include partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, non\\-profit associations (whether or not incorporated), business trusts, joint ventures, local governments, states, the federal government and foreign governments. \n\n(I break out trusts and estates separately because there is divided authority in different jurisdictions over whether trusts and estates are entities, or are simply a special hat that the trustee or executor wears that are not entities, which can be relevant in some highly technical situations.)\n\n**Agency Situations**\n\nThe term \"person\" is also often used in the sense that it refers to the principal and not the agent, when an agent is taking action on behalf of the principal. \n\nThus, if there is a law that says \"a person who enters into a real estate contract must disclose that person's taxpayer identification number\", and someone with a power of attorney from you signs a real estate contract on your behalf, the power of attorney agent should disclosure your taxpayer identification number and not theirs.\n\n**Why Is The Term \"Person\" Defined So Broadly?**\n\nOne important reason for using the term \"person\" to apply to entities as well as human beings, is that it allows for statutes and contract terms or case law legal rules to be stated in very general terms without being wordy in a way that accurately reflects how those legal rules or contract terms should apply to entities.\n\nFor example, a statute using the word \"person\" might say: \n\n> A person who is engaged in business in this state must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nBy using the word \"person\" in this way, the statute wouldn't have to say instead (probably less accurately and less comprehensibly): \n\n> Any individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation,\n>  business trust, non\\-business trust, estate, governmental entity, or\n>  other entity, including the principal of any agent acting on behalf of\n>  the principal, engaged in business in this state, must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nThe phrasing without the word \"person\" would be more likely to create loopholes because some kind of entity is omitted, and would be prone to ambiguity because one would have to decide which words that define the kind of persons and entities that are covered modify which other words in the sentence. \n\nThus, using the word \"person\" is often makes entities more rather than less accountable to the law, by making legal language more clear and more general (and hence containing fewer loopholes).\n\n**\"Individual\" or \"Natural Person\"**\n\nUsually the term \"individual\" or \"natural person\" would mean a human being, although, of course, there are other senses of the word \"individual\" such as \"an individual Widget\" referring to exactly one Widget in particular, as opposed to Widgets in general.\n\n**Alternative Definitions Of \"Person\"**\n\nThere are isolated times when the word \"person\" would not include minors and incapacitated people who are incapable of suing or entering into contracts in their own name due to lack of legal capacity.\n\nIt isn't uncommon to have a definition of \"person\" in a statute or contract that omits governmental entities, that omits all kinds of entities, or that omits particular kinds of entities (e.g. foreign entities or corporations).\n\nFor example, a tax statute might define \"person\" in a way that includes natural persons and entities, but excludes governments.\n\nSome of the definitions of terms like these in the bankruptcy code are particularly non\\-intuitive.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In U.S. statutory law, the term \"person\" is often defined broadly to include both natural persons and various types of entities.

In these cases family court intervention is used to deem what's in the best interest of the child.\n\nComplexities can also arise for children facing medical treatment. The most common example would be a parent attempting to refuse specific care for their child. In these cases it's possible to get a court to deem the parents \"unfit\" in order to force the medical treatment to go forward. This is usually a high\\-bar to achieve as the courts don't want to interfere in the parent\\-child relationship unless there is no other choice. Such medical treatment can also apply to mental\\-health services.\n\nNew York, [as an example](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx),\n\n> allows the local commissioner of social services or local commissioner\n>  of health to give consent for medical, dental, health and hospital services for any child found by the family court to be an abused, neglected or destitute child.\n\nOklahoma created the [Parent's Bill of Rights](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx) (same link as above) which:\n\n> prohibited the state from infringing upon parental rights, directed the board of education of a school district to develop a policy listing parental rights related to education, including sex education; prohibited a surgical procedure on a minor without parental consent\u2014excluding abortion\u2014 and, prohibited a mental health evaluation of a minor without parental consent.\n\nYou will find that it will take court intervention to interfere with parental discretion and that court intervention will likely need to find the parents unfit to make the decision.

While children do have constitutional rights, these are generally not enforceable against parental decisions. The LGBTQ group, knowing about the parents' objection, could potentially face legal risks for knowingly going against the parents' wishes regarding their minor child's associations.
