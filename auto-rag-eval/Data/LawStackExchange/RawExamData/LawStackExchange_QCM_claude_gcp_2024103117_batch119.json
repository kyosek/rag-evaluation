Any content on YT is protected by copyright. Transcribing a movie would be creating a derivative work, which requires permission from the copyright owner. The same goes for transcribing a half of a movie. The minimal individual components of a text, the words and phrases, are not protected by copyright. A sentence, or two, or ten, get you into the realm of fair use analysis. There are 4 core factors and a \"tie\\-breaker\" about transformativeness, where e.g. if you only take a tiny bit that's consistent with fair use, if it's taken for an educational / research purpose that's pro fair use, if it's for a non\\-profit reason that's a vote for fair use, and a transcription is highly transformative. Of course, it's impossible to tell if your plan is *actually* fair use, because what happens is that you get sued for infringement, then you can use fair use as a defense. So it is legally more involved than the case where you actually did not copy or transcribe anything (they got the wrong guy, or, you are actually the original author).\n\nDictionary sentences are relevant because dictionaries generally copy sentences from existing literature, though often they are out of copyright at this point. The greatest risk of copyright infringement would be if you transcribed the entirety of *Red Cliff*, which relates to the \"substantiality\" consideration.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A college student wants to transcribe and use sentences from YouTube videos to learn Chinese.

The legality depends on factors such as the amount transcribed, the purpose (educational use is favored), whether it's for non-profit reasons, and how transformative the use is.

It was not the currency of an EU member state, and even if it was it would've been permitted for personal use...\n\nbut I feel uncomfortable having inadvertently brushed so close to the boundary between what's permitted and what's outlawed.\n\nWith the flurry of new regulations introduced since the Russian invasion, I suspect that there might be a lot more that I'm not aware of. The concerns of (new) laws that affect us personally without us knowing about them it's a generic one, and I know that \"Ignorance of the Law is No Excuse\".\n\nUsually the concern is about [new emergency regulations which affect large swaths of the population](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/54905/is-ignorance-of-the-law-a-valid-excuse-for-not-following-emergency-laws-with-no), but here I think that the issue is for laws (or interpretation thereof) that affects some [obscure circumstances](https://www.layroots.com/lobster-law-101/). Due to the relatively small population of Russian citizens in the European Union (EU), and due to the extremely small amount of travellers visiting Russia from the EU, I understand that regulations that affects only those in these circumstances are not be advertised as much as for other laws, but this does not answer the question... how to mitigate risks in accidentally breaching recently introduced new regulations? How to be aware of all of them?\n\nI'm interested in answers relevant for any place in the world, but especially EU/EEA and neighboring countries (UK, Switzerland, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that, as a practical matter, you can't be aware of every change in the law that could conceivably affect you. Even lawyers don't have enough time to keep up with every change in the law until after a specific legal issue presents itself. Firms selling legal research products have scores and hundreds of employees working full time every day to keep track of every change in the law, to the exclusion of all other working time in their lives.\n\nYou can read the mainstream media and trade publications in fields in which you are engaged which often address these questions. You can take continuing education courses in your occupation or profession. You can confer with a lawyer before taking action in areas where you aren't familiar with the law. You can proceed with caution when you do something that everyone else you know of who is similarly situated is not doing. You can pay special attention to the news and government provided information during periods of major emergencies.\n\nBut, the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse is sometimes simply harsh and unfair. Nonetheless, this rule is the law with respect to most kinds of laws in most legal systems.\n\nAs a practical matter, law enforcement authorities and courts will often show leniency towards someone who innocently violates a new law of which they were unaware, at least the first time, sometimes letting them off with a warning or a minimal penalty.

In other words, it governs using personal property as collateral for loans.\n\nUnder the UCC, there are two important steps: attachment and perfection. A security interest is effective against the party granting it when it \"attaches\" usually immediately upon the signing of the security agreement. But, a security interest is not effective in bankruptcy or against third parties until it is \"perfected\".\n\nHow is a security interest perfected?\n\nYou have to look at Sections 301\\-324 of Article 9 of the current version of the Uniform Commercial Code, or, in states that haven't adopted the most recent version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 301 et seq. of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe way a security interest is perfected varies by the type of property involved. \n\nSecurity interests in some property can only be perfected by possession (i.e. a pawn transaction) or control. \n\nPerfection of some kinds of property (e.g. automobiles, airplanes, copyrights) are governed by specific laws outside the UCC: security interests in automobiles must be shown on the certificate of title, security interests in airplanes and copyrights are perfected in special national registries.\n\nWhen there is no special rule that applies, security interests are perfected by filing with a state level official, usually the state government's Secretary of State for the state where the debtor resides or is organized if the debtor is an entity.\n\nHistorically, under the 1998 version of the UCC adopted in all U.S. states, in addition to the state filing, it was also necessary to make a filing in the real estate records of the county where the property was located for certain kinds of personal property with a connection to real estate, the most common of which were \"fixtures\" which are items of tangible personal property that are attached to real estate, and for security interests in growing crops which are by their very nature attached to the land upon which they grow. Counties have never shared their filings with the state, so a state level search is not sufficient to determine if fixtures or agricultural property are lien free in states where there a valid filings made under the 1998 version of the law that are still in force.\n\nThe requirements to perfect an agricultural lien or a lien in fixtures in the modern version of Article 9 of the UCC (finalized for adoption by states in 2010\\) are found at Section 310 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which dispenses with the county level filing requirement of the 1998 Act. \n\nThe [2010 version of Article 9 has currently been adopted by every U.S. state](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=UCC%20Article%209%20Amendments%20(2010)). There was a strong push for all states to adopt the 2010 amendments with a uniform effective date of July 1, 2013, so as to allow states to adopt the amendments uniformly and have them become operative simultaneously (thereby avoiding unnecessary conflicts and confusion with respect to interstate transactions). Mostly this was successful, but there may have been isolated exceptions.\n\nFor the most part, the grandfathered filings have now expired.

The correct place to file for perfection of a security interest in this case would be with the Secretary of State of the state where the debtor (the manufacturing company) is located or organized. The machinery, once installed, would likely be considered a fixture, but under the current UCC, this no longer requires a separate county filing. Option B is incorrect because county-level filing is no longer required for fixtures under the 2010 amendments. Option C combines the old and new requirements and is therefore incorrect. Option D is incorrect because the U.S. Copyright Office is only relevant for perfecting security interests in copyrights, not machinery or fixtures."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44738/do-firefighters-contitute-a-legislative-power", "docs_id": 44738, "title": "Do firefighters contitute a legislative power?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to this article [ref here](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/new-york-fire-commissioners-call-for-new-9-11-investigation/), [ref here](https://www.globalresearch.ca/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-new-911-investigation/5684982), [ref here](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-demand-new-911-investigation) and [ref here:](https://www.ae911truth.org/news/540-new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-for-new-9-11-investigation) \n\n> ...History has just been made, as the first legislative body in the\n>  country officially announces their support for reopening the 9/11\n>  investigation.

Intel has known about it for several months and has informed the OS vendors so they could publish patches before the vulnerability was made public, as is the custom in these cases. This looks to my non\\-lawyer eyes like blatant insider trading. Is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The accusation would be the crime of securities fraud (\"insider trading\" is legally meaningless), under [15 USC 78j(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j). There is a bit more elaboration in [17 CFR 240\\.10b5\\-1](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=se17.4.240_110b5_61&rgn=div8). That law prohibits using \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in\" in connection with a securities transaction. Under [15 USC 78ff](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78ff), violation of the law can result in a fine of up to $5 million and 20 years, thus it is a crime. As a crime, the standard of proof required is must higher than it in for a civil forfeiture (which can be as low as \"reasonable suspicion\"). In the US, and pursuant to the Due Process clause, that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that is (from [in re Winship](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html)), \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged\". \n\nThe statute itself does not state the elements that must be proven to secure a conviction, but they can be discerned based on jury instructions (which are circuit\\-specific). The 9th Circuit instruction is [here](http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/415). You can see that there are 4 specific allegations that have to be chosen between, and the prosecutor has to have at least alleged one of those prohibited acts (so that the jury can decide if the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did that thing).\n\nThe evidence you have presented could constitute \"reasonable suspicion\", but not \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\". If we had a different standard of proof in criminal trials, where it was sufficient to just suspect based on a small bit of evidence that a person may have done something prohibited, then the conclusion could be different. Or, if you had stronger evidence surrounding the sale, your argument might carry a bit more weight. In other words, criminal prosecution is based on quite a lot of specific and objective evidence about what happened. An example of the kind of evidence and allegations required to get the ball rolling can be seen [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/994881/download); for \"insider trading\" specifically, look [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/980156/download) (this case is based on an FBI investigation, where an agent will presumably testify to hearing the defendant state a plan to violate the law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal standard and evidence required for a successful prosecution of securities fraud (often colloquially referred to as \"insider trading\") in the United States?\n\nA) Reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing based on circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction, as long as the defendant sold stocks prior to negative public disclosures.\n\nB) The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in at least one of the specific prohibited acts outlined in the relevant circuit's jury instructions, supported by strong objective evidence.\n\nC) A civil standard of proof applies, requiring only a preponderance of evidence showing that the defendant likely had inside information when trading stocks.\n\nD) Proof that a company executive sold a large number of shares before a negative announcement is enough to secure a criminal conviction for securities fraud.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The passage emphasizes that for a criminal prosecution of securities fraud, the standard of proof is \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is much higher than mere suspicion or civil standards. The prosecution must prove specific elements of the crime as outlined in jury instructions, which vary by circuit. Strong, objective evidence is required, not just circumstantial evidence or suspicious timing of stock sales. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because reasonable suspicion is not sufficient for a criminal conviction, and circumstantial evidence alone is typically not enough.\n\nAnswer C is wrong because it describes a civil standard of proof (\"preponderance of evidence\"), which is lower than the criminal standard required for securities fraud prosecution.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while suspicious timing of stock sales might raise questions, it alone is not sufficient to secure a criminal conviction without additional strong evidence of intent and knowledge."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78777/which-country-should-prosecute-cross-border-criminal-gross-negligence", "docs_id": 78777, "title": "Which country should prosecute cross border criminal (gross) negligence?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by the second crash of the [Boeing 737 MAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings).

It is therefore legal to publish a transformation of such words and phrases.\n\nYou can consider a given novel to be a sequence of words and short phrases. It is not legal to sequentially publish the words and phrases of a protected novel, for example as a web page with a million sequentially numbered chapters each containing a couple words of original text. It would be legal to alphabetically list all of the words employed in a novel, along with a token count.\n\nIn order to prove copyright infringement, the plaintiff in the lawsuit would have to prove that the allegedly\\-infringing work as a certain degree of similarity to the protected work. Suppose that the fifth word of the original and supposed copy is \"the\" \u2013 that is not sufficient similarity to prove copying. The question of degree of similarity is a very fact\\-intensive inquiry.\n\nIf a novel is in fact copied and run through the blender to produce unrecognizable word slurry, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the necessary degree of similarity between the original and the copy. This involves exposing the reconstruction procedure. Given any sufficiently large database of words (the word\\-count list mentioned above), one can also select words from the database so that the selection procedure maximally matches the original text (then you devise a mapping post hoc that \"reconstructs\" the original text from the slurry). The defense can counter this argument by positing a different algorithm that converts the slurry into Mother Goose rhymes. Whether not the plaintiff's argument that there was copying depends crucially on the uniqueness of the reconstruction.\n\nSo, the summary. First, words and phrases are not protected by copyright law. Second, entire works, which contain words and phrases, cannot be copied at all regardless of any transformations you apply. The law is stated in terms of copying, and not in terms of \"creating a text that has a particular relation to a protected word\". However, the law also has to deal with the known facts, and cannot require time\\-travel as a means of proving that there was copying. Therefore, the law takes \"similarity\" as a substitute for direct knowledge of an action in the past.

However, the key issue here is not the ease of reconstruction (ruling out option C), but rather the ability of the copyright holder to prove infringement. \n\nThe correct answer is D because, as stated in the provided information, to prove copyright infringement, the plaintiff must demonstrate a certain degree of similarity between the allegedly infringing work and the protected work.

Legal recourse would have to be via state law. Such legal action is conceivable, for example it would be \"menu fraud\" to sell chuck steak as \"Kobe beef\", and the practice of selling shark meat disks as scallops is likewise illegal. Fish are problematic since multiple species can be commonly called by a single name (sole, halibut, cod, snapper, sardine, herring). It is possible that in a certain market, \"white tuna\" is standardly understood to be albacore tuna, therefore it would be fraudulent to sell escolar as \"white tuna\". That would be the point that has to be proven in a legal action, that the term has a specific interpretation. Analogously, there are a number of creamed vegetable products sold as \"hummus\" which contain no chickpeas (by original definition, hummus *is* chickpeas and not soybeans).

Option C accurately reflects that legal action would need to be pursued under state law, and the customer would need to prove that \"white tuna\" has a specific local meaning.

In such situations, the primary concern is determining whether the vehicle is lost or abandoned property.

This allows for a proper investigation to find the rightful owner, whether the car was lost, stolen, or abandoned. The police will then follow the necessary procedures to determine ownership.

If the employer doesn't want that you work (because he has nothing to do for you) it's his problem, not yours. He still has to pay if you are there and ready to do work. This is for instance also mentioned in [this article](https://www.20min.ch/story/unverschuldete-minusstunden-was-tun-560345018339).\n\nThe meaning of this is obvious if having a contract with a fixed number of work hours per day/month/year.\n\n**Second part**\n\nProve that you have a fixed work contract.\n\nIf the shift plans are made in advance you have a proof that you have a certain number of hours to work (and thus an expected income). If I interpret [this here](https://www.slp.ch/lohnfortzahlungspflicht-bei-gelegenheitsarbeit/) correctly, this is \"echte Arbeit auf Abruf\" (true work on request), because if your employer wants your work, you *have to* be there according to the shift plan, as opposed to your employer asking \"who is ready to work tonight?\".\n\nSo your employer must pay you the hours agreed on in the shift plan, regardless of whether he has work for you or not (but you must explicitly tell him that you are willing to take work).\n\n**Third part**\n\nCan the employer change the shift plan, and to what extent?\n\nThe employer must announce changes to work hours as soon as possible, and changes on short notice are only acceptable in [emergency cases](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/sozial-und-sicher/die-festlegung-der-arbeitszeit-ist-chefsache/story/13793839).

For employees with pre-planned shifts, this is considered \"echte Arbeit auf Abruf\" (true work on request), meaning the employer must pay for the hours agreed upon in the shift plan.

She obtained her license by working through another agent in her neighborhood. I wasn't aware she was working, so I asked her more about what the job entailed and she told me that she doesn't actually provide her services as an agent, she only uses the license to get deep discounts for her own travels.\n\nI don't think I can convince her it's fraud, but I don't want to see her in jail. I couldn't find any sources online that said one way or another whether it is fraudulent behavior. Are there any referencable sources I can point her to that could be helpful? Or is what is she doing entirely legal?\n\nAlso, unfortunately, I don't know any more details about her license or method of obtaining it as we spoke in casual passing about it. I can probably ask her though, if necessary.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Utah Department of Professional Licensing](https://dopl.utah.gov/licenses/) does not issue licenses for travel agents, and there seems to be no evidence of a statutory requirement for licensing. Therefore it's unclear what status this license has. I did see a number of online places offering to train people to be travel agents, and perhaps one of them offers a certificate of training.\n\nThere is such a thing as an IATA number, and some hotel might require providing one's IATA number. If a person does not have an IATA number and the hotel does not verify the IATA number, then it would be fraud to falsely make up a number in order to obtain a benefit. The person could be sued to recover the amount of the discount. If the person has an IATA number, then there nothing obviously fraudulent, but you would have to inspect the conditions for using an agent discount.\n\n[IATA](https://www.iatan.org/en/accreditation/idcard) requires you to work at a registered agency to get an agent number, and the proof requirements are substantial enough that it would be surprising if a person could get away with just claiming to work at a travel agency. The organization would certainly be in a good position to sue a person for falsifying the application (note also that the application is subject to binding arbitration by the Travel Agency Commissioner).\n\nSo it depends on who gave the discount, what the required, what if any accreditation was used to get that discount, and what the actual facts are (i.e. does the person actually work for an agency making at least $10,000 a year).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A woman claims to have obtained a travel agent license in Utah to receive discounts on hotels and airfare, but does not actually work as a travel agent.

IATA numbers, which are often required for agent discounts, are only issued to individuals who can prove they work for a registered travel agency and earn at least $10,000 per year in that capacity.\n3.

This isn't really commentary, unless you add some analytical or critical materiel, in short some **comments**, on the quotes. That woukld make it pretty clearly fair use. But fair use is significantly broader than commentary. Let us look at the statutory factors. [This question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) lists and describes them. [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107) is the actual law.\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use.** The use is commercial, which weighs soemnwhat agaisnt fair use, but not overwhelmingly. The use is arguable soemwhat trasformational, but it seems to me not highly so. That weighs a little towards fair use.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work.** The works quoted are creative, works of entertainment, not factual or educational. This weaighs agaisnt fair use, but not overwhelmingly.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.** This nis not really clear from the question. One or two lines from a short song might be a substantial portion. \"*Like a bridge over troubled water / I will lay me down.* Might alone be considered the \"heart\" of the Simon \\& Garfunkel song, as it in my view, captures the key feeling of the song, even if it is only 2 short lines, one sentence. A line or two for a feature\\-length film is much less likely to be a substantial part. This factor can be quite subjective. Recall *Harper vs Nation* where a 300\\-word quote from President George H. W. Bush's long autobiography was judged to be the \"heart\" of the work, and fair use denied.\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** This is also hard to judge without specifics, but short quotes rarely harm the market for an existing work, much less one decades old. This provably weighs in favor of fair use.\n\nSo fair use is possible for the kind of use described, but a long way for assured. Adding significant commentary on each quote would make the case for fair use significantly stronger.\n\nAs for Sweden, while the basic framework of modern copyright, derived from the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) is the same, Sweden has nothing like the fair use doctrine in its law. I think the case for copyright infringement under Swedish law would be fairly strong.\n\nAnd of course, even if a use is clearly an infringement, there is no penalty unless the copyright holder shooses to sue. One can never know if that will happen, but corporate media copyright owners tend to be more ready to sue than the general population. They often have the resources, and are inclined to think that way.

Then $11,000 when the tax return is filed, and $12,000 on the day the assets are distributed. And the second beneficiary gets 10%.

This aligns with the principle that percentage-based bequests typically refer to \"the totality of what is left to disburse to beneficiaries\" after specific bequests, debts, taxes, and administration expenses have been handled.

Nobody is entitled to a \"standard of living\". Just because you lucked out to marry a high\\-net\\-worth or high\\-earning individual, it should not \"entitle\" you to live the good life in perpetuity after you stopped being married.\n\nThis is *separate* from the idea that a spouse may have contributed to said high\\-earning status by supporting their career, which is a far valid \\- but a wholly separate \\- reason in divorce court. For example, I assume a judge can apply \"standard of living\" idea even if the wealthy spouse can show that the wealth/income didn't change upwardly during the marriage; and that the spouse didn't contribute economically at all, due to paying for hired help to do house chores, and no children resulting etc...\n2. It seems like a moral hazard, in that it encourages lower income earners to trick higher income earners into marrying them under false pretenses, just to divorce them after a couple of years for a big payout in raised standard of living, or to simply not be a good spouse since they won't suffer in the divorce.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for an authoritative answer to \"why\", for example a reason given by a judge establishing precedent, or a politician proposing the law that passed which establishes the idea). However, a solid legal analysis would also be good.\n\n**UPDATE**: Just to clarify \\- the question isn't asking why there is spousal support/maintenance in general. It's asking very specifically, why \"established standard of living\" is the criterion used to decide the amount. In other words, if a spouse is used to a billionaire lifestyle, why is the support aimed at perpetuating that same expensive lifestyle, **as opposed to** being a modest livable amount (say, mode or median or average wage).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [A brief explanation](https://mavrideslaw.com/history-alimony-massachusetts/) follows. The Code of Hammurabi articulates the first form of alimony:\n\n> 137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, or from his wife who has borne him children: then he shall\n> give that wife her dowry, and a part of the usufruct of field, garden,\n> and property, so that she can rear her children. When she has brought\n> up her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal\n> as that of one son, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man\n> of her heart\n\nIn the Middle Ages, English ecclesiastical law mandated that a husband still has an obligation to support his wife even when they are separated (recall that divorce was not possible). This carried over to the US. As discussed in [this article](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1631&context=luclj), there was a view (articulated in Bradwell v. Illinois by Justice Bradley that \"Man is, or should be,\nwoman's protector and defender .... The paramount destiny and\nmission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator\".\nThe basic rationale at the time was that the wife had a right to support as a consequence of the marriage, and would continue to exercise that right were it not for the conduct of the husband (by law, someone was at fault, and if it was the husband, he would have to compensate his wife).\n\nWhen no\\-fault divorce became a possibility in the late 60's, concepts of alimony were re\\-worked, so that alimony was no (usually) longer a permanent property right, and in its place there developed a desideratum of \"maintenance\" allowing the spouse with lesser economic power to maintain a diminishing property right. See [this 1973 version](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c157.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20157%20%C2%A7%209) of Washington's replacement\\-for\\-alimony law, which includes \"The standard of living established during the marriage\" as [the law now](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.09.090) does.\n\nBecause this is established by state law in the US, and state legislatures aren't infamous about keeping close track of legislative debates, I don't think there are any surviving records of the rationale of the author of these bills. In fact, this law was drafted a few years earlier by The Uniform Law Commission \u2013 there may be some record of their discussion.\n\\[This article]\\[5], written after the law was passed, takes note of the history of contractual concepts being applied to marriage (e.g. the territorial legislature enacted a measure that \"marriage is declared to be a civil contract\"), from which perspective one expects there to be compensation for breach of contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the historical development and rationale behind considering \"standard of living\" in divorce asset division?\n\nA) It originated from the Code of Hammurabi and has remained unchanged in legal practice since ancient times.\n\nB) It was introduced in the 1960s as part of no-fault divorce laws, with no historical precedent.\n\nC) It evolved from medieval ecclesiastical law, through fault-based divorce systems, and was adapted for modern no-fault divorce laws.\n\nD) It was solely based on the idea that women were inferior and needed constant protection from men.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The consideration of \"standard of living\" in divorce asset division has a long historical development. It traces back to concepts in the Code of Hammurabi and medieval ecclesiastical law, where husbands had obligations to support wives even when separated. This idea carried through fault-based divorce systems in early U.S. law. When no-fault divorce became possible in the late 1960s, the concept was reworked into \"maintenance\" to allow the economically disadvantaged spouse to maintain a standard of living, albeit often on a diminishing basis. This evolution shows how the principle adapted over time to changing social and legal norms, rather than being a completely new concept or remaining static since ancient times."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52732/does-eu-law-require-permanent-usage-of-catalytic-converters-in-cars", "docs_id": 52732, "title": "Does EU law require permanent usage of catalytic converters in cars?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many countries have vehicles with permanently active catalytic converters despite the fact that they lower efficiency and produce more carbon dioxide for the same mechanical power output.\n\nThe gases the catalytic converters combust, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, are not dangerous in the concentrations they often appear, and they spontaneously react to become other chemicals after some time in the atmosphere.\n\nCatalytic converters were introduced 35 years ago when environment policies and car configurability were different. I don't question the motives of why the laws were passed then. **Today there is a big focus on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, so why are catalytic converters still in permanent use?** Catalytic conversion can be avoided with just a software change or configuration change in the engine control unit, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some percent.\n\nA solution could be an adaptive system that configures combustion depending on circumstances, like turning off the oxygen supply to the catalytic converter when the car is moving at higher speed and turning it on in confined spaces like parking places and smoggy cities. It could also easily be turned off and on depending on geographic location or based on data from an carbon monoxide sensor.\n\n**Does the law require permanent usage of catalytic converters in cars?**\n\nThe setting of the engine control unit is the direct cause of increased fuel consumption, since the combustion process in the engine cylinder is providing more air than is optimal in order to provide oxygen to the combustion in the catalytic converter. [Back pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure) from the catalytic converter also decreases engine efficiency and increases fuel consumption. In some vehicles there is a [secondary air injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_air_injection) to provide oxygen to the catalytic converter. This requires energy and increases fuel consumption.\n\nFor example in regard to carbon monoxide the catalytic converter can be deactivated when levels are within [WHO guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK138710/#ch2.s11) at 6 ppm. In average CO levels are [0\\.1 ppm in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide#Occurrence).\n\nA common misunderstanding of this question is that people seems to think that I write that the total carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel will be different with or without catalytic conversion. I have not written that. I write that there will be a diffence per mechanical power produced.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no EU law that *requires* vehicles to have a permanently active catalytic converter installed. There are various \"clean air\" regulations such as [Regulation 715/2007/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2007:171:TOC) which covers the emissions standards vehicles must meet before they can be approved for sale within the EU. As long as the standards are met, the law is not particularly concerned with *how* those standards are met (excluding obvious cheating mechanisms, etc.)\n\nAdditionally, [Directive 2014/45/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02014L0045-20140429&from=EN#tocId2) covers vehicle roadworthiness and mandates regular emissions testing as part of it. All vehicles must meet the standards of the test to be considered roadworthy. In the UK, this is performed as part of the annual MOT test.\n\nIt appears that catalytic converters are simply one of the easiest ways to meet those standards, and it is probably cheaper/more efficient for manufacturers to install a permanently active catalytic converter (which can be applied across multiple markets) rather than implementing software or alternative solutions which may or may not meet regulations in all the markets the vehicle is sold in.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to EU regulations on vehicle emissions and roadworthiness:\n\nA) Catalytic converters are mandatory and must be permanently active in all vehicles sold in the EU.\n\nB) Vehicles must meet specific emissions standards, but the method of achieving these standards is not strictly prescribed.\n\nC) Manufacturers are required by law to implement adaptive systems that turn catalytic converters on and off based on driving conditions.\n\nD) The EU mandates that all vehicles must use software-based solutions instead of catalytic converters to reduce emissions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. EU regulations, such as Regulation 715/2007/EC, set emissions standards that vehicles must meet to be approved for sale in the EU, but they do not specifically require the use of catalytic converters. The law focuses on the emissions results rather than mandating a particular technology. Catalytic converters are widely used because they are an effective way to meet these standards across different markets.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while catalytic converters are common, they are not explicitly required by EU law to be permanently active.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as the EU does not mandate adaptive systems for catalytic converters. While such systems could potentially be beneficial, they are not a legal requirement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the EU does not mandate software-based solutions over catalytic converters. The regulations are technology-neutral as long as the emissions standards are met.\n\nThis question tests understanding of EU vehicle emissions regulations and the flexibility manufacturers have in meeting these standards."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19253/requirement-to-carry-drivers-license-and-registration-in-massachusetts", "docs_id": 19253, "title": "Requirement to carry driver&#39;s license and registration in Massachusetts", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was reading Chapter 90 in the Massachusetts General Laws and I could not find any provision requiring an operator to carry a driver's license and registration documents in the vehicle while operating it.

Is there any specific protection for privacy in social media?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nEven in the 49 U.S. states that are \"employment at will\" states in the U.S., there are reasons for which termination of employment is prohibited under both state and federal law, and termination without cause entitles an employee to unemployment benefit if certain other conditions are met.\n\nMost unionized employees, most public sector employees, most private sector employees in Montana, and a small number of employees (mostly senior management) with written employment contracts that so provide can only be fired for cause.\n\nThere is a split of authority in the U.S. on the status of not making full disclosure is something that the employer required you to disclose and that you represented that you did disclose in the hiring process, such as your social media accounts. This is commonly called \"resume fraud\" even though it actually applies more broadly than resumes. Also, sometimes the question might be resolved differently under parallel state and federal laws.\n\nIn general, in the U.S., asking about social media accounts is something that an employer may permissibly ask unless it is use to facilitate discrimination on a prohibited ground.\n\nOne rule, which applies in some jurisdictions, is that \"resume fraud\" (i.e. a material misstatement in a resume or employment application) discovered by an employer after an otherwise wrongful termination can serve as a lawful basis for terminating employment that excuses the wrongful basis for termination of employment (at least assuming that the information withheld or misrepresented was on a matter that the employer could lawfully consider). Even if the information not disclosed was not itself a basis upon which the employer would not have hired someone, the dishonestly in the hiring process would be a basis for termination of employment.\n\n[For example](https://www.hallrender.com/2012/05/15/resume-fraud-embellishment-embarassment-and-worse/):\n\n> The Seventh Circuit, which covers Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin,\n> has consistently held that it\u2019s permissible for employers to reject\n> job applicants and fire employees who are suspected of engaging in\n> resum\u00e9 fraud. The rationale for the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning is\n> very straightforward: lying to employers is a legitimate and\n> non\\-discriminatory basis for turning down an applicant or firing an\n> employee. The cases of *Carter v. Tennant Co*., *Aubuchon v. Knauf\n> Fiberglass* and *Gilty v. Village of Oak Park* all stand for this\n> proposition. . . . .\n> \n> \n> If the employer, as part of its investigation of the allegations in\n> the lawsuit, discovers that the employee engaged in resum\u00e9 fraud, can\n> the employer use that belated discovery to its advantage? According\n> to the United States Supreme Court, the answer is yes. More\n> specifically, in *McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.*, the\n> Supreme Court essentially held that an employer\u2019s belated discovery of\n> an independent, alternative basis for firing an employee (e.g., resum\u00e9\n> fraud) can be used by the employer to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s potential\n> recovery. (Think of this as the employer\u2019s \u201cif we knew then what we\n> know now, we wouldn\u2019t have hired you in the first place\u201d defense.)\n\nIn other jurisdictions, \"resume fraud\" is not itself a basis for discharge, although it might be used as evidence to support an initially claimed valid reason for terminating employment in the face of an employee allegation that this was a mere pretext for wrongful termination.\n\nI don't know which states or how many U.S. states fall in each category. The former rule is the rule in almost all cases under federal private sector employment law.\n\nA variety of cases that address the question in the context of public employment sector employment can be found [here](https://www.aele.org/law/Digests/empl226.html).\n\nIn addition to these general rules of law, there are also often reasonable questions of fact about whether a prospective employee substantially complied with an employer's social media disclosure question on a fact by fact basis that turns on the exact wording of the question and the reasonable interpretations that language could be given by the employee.\n\nFor example, if a question has a social media disclosure requirement and one doesn't disclose a blog, one might reasonably argue that a blog is not a social media account, depending on the language used in the question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, an employee is discovered to have omitted mentioning certain social media accounts during the hiring process when asked to disclose all social media accounts.

The legality of terminating an employee for omitting social media accounts during the hiring process varies depending on the jurisdiction in the United States. Some courts, particularly in the Seventh Circuit (covering Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin), view this omission as \"resume fraud\" and consider it a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for termination. However, other jurisdictions may not treat such omissions as automatic grounds for dismissal. The question of whether the omission constitutes a material misstatement that can justify termination often depends on state-specific laws and interpretations. Additionally, factors such as the exact wording of the employer's question and whether the employee substantially complied with the request may also be considered. Therefore, the consequences can vary significantly based on the specific jurisdiction and circumstances of the case."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15385/reasons-for-uk-citizen-to-not-get-an-irish-passport", "docs_id": 15385, "title": "Reasons for UK citizen to not get an Irish passport?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The United Kingdom has opted to leave the European Union, this may make travelling and visiting my holiday home abroad more difficult, or even stop me from working abroad in the future.\n\nMy mother is about about to get an Irish passport, as her mother (my grandmother) is Irish.

Any additional details require a decent amount of background on parts of the Constitution, so please bear with me.\n\nCanadian Federalism\n===================\n\nA quick discussion on Canadian federalism may help understand the context of the sections you are asking about. Canada's federal system has some blurry or intricate lines between provincial and federal legislative domains. Beyond the federal appointment of provincial superior court judges, a few other cases of these lines can be found in the distribution of legislative powers found in [sections 91 and 92](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867\\. \n\nFor example, while marriage and divorce is a federal competency, the solemnization of marriage is a provincial competency. Another common example is that with criminal law being a completely federal concern, the federal government can often enact criminal law on what would otherwise be a provincial concern.\n\nIn dealing with the interplay of provincial and federal powers, the Supreme Court noted in [Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_(AG)_v_PHS_Community_Services_Society) that Canadian constitutional interpretation is evolving \"towards the more flexible concepts of [double aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_aspect) and cooperative federalism.\"\n\nFor more info, see [this Wikipedia article on Canadian federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federalism), which is surprisingly detailed.\n\nCanada's Judiciary\n==================\n\n[Section 92(14\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867 places the judiciary under primarily *provincial* responsibility:\n\n> The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\n\nThere are of course exceptions, the Supreme Court being the most obvious example. These exceptions are authorized by [section 101](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#h-25) of the Constitution Act, 1867 which gives Parliament the ability to set up federal courts by ordinary statute:\n\n> The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.\n\nThis has been done for example in the areas of intellectual property, and tax, among others.\n\nNote that Canada's judiciary is **unified**. As a general rule, *any* court is competent to adjudicate both provincial and federal law, unless that jurisdiction has specifically been removed from the provincial courts by a section 101 statute. Note that the Supreme Court has final say on all provincial and federal law. This is in contrast with the U.S. where its Supreme Court cannot overrule a state supreme court on matters of state law.\n\nFor more info, see [this Wikipedia article on Canada's court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada), which again, is surprisingly detailed.\n\nAnswers to your specific questions\n==================================\n\n\"Why\" questions are usually more of a political or historical question than one of law, but I'll do my best.\n\n> Why did the framers allow provincial superior courts to adjudicate some matters falling under federal legislative power (for example, bankruptcy cases)?\n\nI would say \"some matters\" is a little misleading, it is instead most. It's less about the Constitution allowing provincial superior courts to adjudicate matters falling under federal legislative power, and more about allowing the federal government to take away jurisdiction under section 101\\. Note that provincial superior courts aren't special in this respect, any provincial court can still adjudicate on matters falling under federal legislative power.\n\n> Why didn't the framers confine to the Federal Court?\n\nBecause of section 101, this isn't needed. Should the federal government wish to take over exclusive jurisdiction of a federal competency, they can.\n\n> Why blur the distinction between provincial v. federal jurisdiction?\n\nThis question really strikes at the design of Canadian federalism. With respect to federal appointment of provincial superior court judges, I think it's only natural to have some federal input in the spirit of cooperative federalism, especially given that provincial courts can adjudicate federal legislation.\n\n*Disclaimer: The rest of this answer is much more history than law*\n\nAs a more general question with respect to these blurry or intricate distinctions throughout the Constitution, we have to go back to its design from 1864\\-1867\\. I am greatly summarizing, but the design of Canadian federalism is mainly due to two things: the American Civil War and Quebec (and a third, staying under the British monarchy, but that's less relevant to this question). For further information see [here](http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp187-e.htm) and [here](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/18745/).\n\nHaving just seen the American Civil War at its end, the framers wanted a unitary government with little to no provincial rights. However, as a practical matter, Quebec's distinct culture and legal system made this infeasible. A federation with a strong central government and provinces having power over local matters was thus envisioned. The separation of legislative domains flowed from that principle.\n\nThis does raise the question of why the judiciary was given to the provinces by default, as it does seem like an important piece that should have been given to the federal government. One reason might be that section 101 does reserve the federal government some control anyway. Another might be that the judiciary was just not that powerful at confederation. For example, it wasn't until the Constitution Act, 1982, that the courts were explicitly allowed to strike down a statute as unconstitutional thanks to [section 52(1\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (though I believe they already had been with respect to *ultra vires* laws).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the relationship between provincial superior courts and federal legislative power in Canada?\n\nA) Provincial superior courts have no jurisdiction over matters falling under federal legislative power.\n\nB) Provincial superior courts can only adjudicate federal matters if explicitly granted permission by the federal government.\n\nC) Provincial superior courts have jurisdiction over most matters falling under federal legislative power, unless specifically removed by federal statute.\n\nD) The Constitution strictly limits provincial superior courts to adjudicating only provincial matters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Canada's unified judiciary system, provincial superior courts have jurisdiction over most matters falling under federal legislative power by default. This jurisdiction can only be removed if the federal government specifically takes it away through legislation under section 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. \n\nOption A is incorrect because provincial superior courts do have jurisdiction over federal matters in most cases. \n\nOption B is wrong because provincial courts don't need explicit permission; they have this jurisdiction by default. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the Constitution does not strictly limit provincial courts to only provincial matters.

In this case, can Uber company sue against the developer because they have also bought copyrights for the Uber application?\n\nIt's a little bit confusing for me as a developer because most of the time we use similar codes to create similar behaviors in an application. Also the way you code is like your handwritten and you can not code similar applications in different ways, it's kinda meaningless! Because most of the time we just copy and paste similar codes that we already use in another application if we want to build something similar.\n\n**So how does copyrights law work for the applications?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A fundamental principle of copyright law is that protection is only afforded to the concrete expression, and not the abstract idea. Therefore, if you write a sort program, what is protected is \"that specific program\", and not the general idea of a sort program. There are many kinds of sort algorithms: if you write a bubble sort program, you don't \"own\" all bubble sort programs, you only own the one that you wrote. If you sell your right to a particular bubble sort program, you don't thereby prevent yourself from writing another bubble sort program. But, technically, you *do* prevent yourself from copying that program, changing some variable names or maybe manually recoding a couple of lines, and re\\-licensing the code (assuming that you fully transferred copyright, or gave the customer exclusive rights to the code).\n\nThe basic question that the courts will ask is \"did you copy that program\", which they answer by looking at the similarity between the two programs. All bubble sorts have a necessary similarity. To prove infringement, the plaintiff would (ultimately) have to prove that the similarity had to have come from copying rather than independent coincidental re\\-creation. Functional considerations and general programmer practice\nwould tend to weigh against an allegation of infringement in certain cases, where \"counter\" is a common name for a counter variable, and bubble sort is a well known algorithm with limited practical differences in lines of code.\n\nThe hard part is establishing that it would be natural for such similarities to exist even when independently coded by a single person. It may be common practice to take a program that you've sold and tweak it in some fashion, but that is copyright infringement, whereas \"applying the lessons that you learned in writing X to a new program\" is not infringement, it is using the same ideas, and the ideas are not what is protected.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates a ride-sharing app similar to Uber and sells it, including the copyrights, to Company A. Later, they create another ride-sharing app for Company B, reusing about 90% of the code from the first app. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential copyright infringement?\n\nA) The developer is safe from copyright infringement claims because they wrote both pieces of code themselves.\n\nB) Company A can successfully sue the developer for copyright infringement because they own the rights to the first app's code.\n\nC) The developer may be at risk of copyright infringement if they directly copied and only slightly modified the original code, but not if they independently recreated similar functionality.\n\nD) Copyright law doesn't apply to software, so there's no risk of infringement in this scenario.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because copyright law protects the specific expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. If the developer directly copied and only slightly modified the original code sold to Company A, they could be at risk of copyright infringement. However, if they independently recreated similar functionality using their knowledge and skills, even if the result is very similar, it would likely not be considered infringement. The courts would look at the similarity between the two programs and consider whether the similarities could have arisen from independent creation or must have come from copying. Functional considerations and common programming practices would be taken into account.

You can however be prosecuted for aiding a person or organization that is criminal or terrorist. One of the laws against aiding terrorists is [18 USC 1339b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2339B), which says in part that to be punished, you \n\n> must have knowledge that the organization is a designated terrorist\n>  organization (as defined in subsection (g)(6\\)), that the organization\n>  has engaged or engages in terrorist activity (as defined in section\n>  212(a)(3\\)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act), or that the\n>  organization has engaged or engages in terrorism (as defined in\n>  section 140(d)(2\\) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal\n>  Years 1988 and 1989\\).\n\nThe law does not allow prosecution for aiding an organization that *becomes* designated as terrorist.\n\nSupposing that you have (currently) violated the law by acting as a spokesman for ISIS, then what you'd be looking for is immunity from prosecution.
