In the absence of a written contract specifying ongoing security responsibilities, the developer's obligations were likely fulfilled upon delivery of a reasonably secure website. The passage of time (one year) and the evolving nature of cyber threats further support the developer's limited liability.

The husband earns 150K before tax, has no saving, no properties and won't take anything from the 2 houses. \n\nThe wife doesn't want any alimony but only child support. The 2 kids are to stay with mom. What would be a fair amount for child support?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are statutory guidelines that are based upon the gross income of each parent, the number of children, the extraordinary expenses of the children, and number of nights a child spends with each parent, which are adopted by states in order for the states to be eligible for federal welfare programs; although standards vary somewhat. Income can be imputed if a party has an ability to earn income but does not exercise it. But, assets owned aren't considered unless they produce or could produce income.\n\nIn the absence of a showing of unfitness sufficient to terminate the parental rights of a parent for abuse or neglect, or some extremely unique circumstance (e.g., one parent is on the space station 365 days a year), no parent ever has 100% of the nights with the children.\n\nWithout having a more realistic estimate of the number of nights with each child, and a fair guess of the capacity of mom to earn income including income from stock trades, it isn't possible to make a realistic estimate.\n\nTo get the correct estimate, you would need to do a full fledged child support guidelines calculation, but this question doesn't have enough information to do that. A good rule of thumb is that child support for two children is typically about 25% of the difference in income of the couple times the number of days that one parent has a child more than the the parent, divided by the number of days in the year. \n\nFor a pretty typical parenting time division, that would work out to about 10% of the difference in income between the parties paid by the higher income party to the less high income party within a normal range. But this is strictly a rule of thumb.\n\nHowever, in a case like the one you describe, the rental value of one of the houses would probably be imputed as income to the wife, as would the profits she makes in an average year from stock trades. The rental value of a $1\\.25 million house is probably about $72,000 a year. It is hard to value stock trades which depend upon the size of the portfolio and the skill of the trader. \n\nIf the stock trades generated $28,000 of income a year and the wife has the kids 5 nights a week, and there were no extraordinary expenses, child support might typically be on the order of $416 a month. If wife made $78,000 from stock trades, child support would be nominal (they would have equal incomes, but she would have a few more days a year).\n\nBut, that involves some very specific assumptions.\n\nAlso, in situations like this one where the facts are so extraordinary relative to a typical divorced couple and the family is very affluent on a combined basis, the judge has wide discretion to deviate from the guidelines on a case by case basis. In reality, no case like this has a clear fair or typical resolution and it would depend a great deal upon how the case was argued and how the facts were developed by the parties and their counsel.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a divorce case, a wife owns two houses valued at $2.5 million and earns income only from stock trades.

The question states that assets owned aren't considered unless they produce or could produce income.\n\nThe correct answer is D because the total value of the wife's real estate assets would not directly factor into child support calculations.

Article 2 (2\\)c states that this regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data: \n\n> by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\n\nThis sentence is known as the **personal use exemption**. When this was included in the GDPR, the drafters decided to keep the personal use exemption *unchanged* from the article 3(2\\) of [Directive 95/46](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046&from=EN). (There as a lot of lobbying for removing \"purely\" from the sentence \u2013 but drafters wanted to keep it.)\n\nThere also an unofficial description in [Recital 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/), that say:\n\n> (1\\) This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. (2\\) Personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. (3\\) However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities.\n\nThis says that you're *not* exempt for processing that has connection to a professional or commercial activity. But it is very ague on what *makes* you exempt. Does \"social networking\" include maintaining your own blog, or are they only referring to your activities on Facebook and similar \"social\" media where you obviously are *not* the controller (the controller is who owns and runs the platform)?\n\nA key question, partly arising from a lengthy discussion thread under the answer by @Greendrake in this [related question](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28070/957), is whether this means that\na publicly accessible, personal blog is *excluded* from the scope of the GDPR?\n\nTo answer this question, one need to consider that the GDPR [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) definition 1 says that:\n\n> \u2018personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n\nWe know from EU case law that this also includes *IP\\-addresses*, since such online identifiers *indirectly* makes people who is visiting such a publicly available personal blog *identifiable*.\n\nAlso, note that the *scope* of the GDPR is *processing* of personal data. This is defined in GDPR [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) defintion 2:\n\n> \u2018processing\u2019 means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\nSome critics of the GDPR have objected that such a definition of \u2018processing\u2019 is *over\\-reaching*. However, it being over\\-reaching does not mean that we should ignore it.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to link to two seminal cases heard by the ECJ:\n\n* [C\\-101/01](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=48382&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=322419)\n* [C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=160561&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=322511)\n\nCentral to both cases was the question of whether the processing activities of an individual was covered by personal use exemption under article 3(2\\) of Directive 95/46\\. In both these cases, the ECJ took an extremely restrictive view, and concluded that the personal use exemption did *not* apply to the processing done by these individuals.\n\nThe questions is: Is it *possible* for a publicly accessible, personal blog to make use of the personal use exception of the GDPR to avoid having to comply with the regulation? If \"yes\": What need to be considered by its owner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that one cannot answer a question such as \"Will the personal use exception in the GDPR apply to personal blogs?\", because it is unclear if you refer to:\n\n1. personal information published on the blog pages\n2. personal information collected from the Website, by way of forms, cookies, server logs, strictly collected and processed for the purpose of operating the Website for your own personal purposes as a blogger (by yourself of through a subcontractor in the sense of GDPR)\n3. and not personal information collected from the Website's operation, transferred or provided to third parties for their own purposes (this would include cookies used to identify and track users across multiple domains)\n\n**Regarding 1\\.**, a personal blog wanting to benefit from the exemption should not publish third party's personal information without their consent or another legal basis, and [C\\-101/01](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01) certainly applies here.\n\n**About 2\\.**, if the information is strictly collected and used for the own personal purpose of the operation of the blog, I would tend to agree that it should benefit from the exemption. I feel that [C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-212/13) would not necessarily be an indication that because the blog is publicly accessible it is then \"directed outwards from the private setting\" in the sense of this ruling, and should not be considered as \"purely \u2018personal or household\u2019 activity\".\n\n[C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-212/13) case was relating to a camera installed by an individual on his family home for its own security purposes which was also monitoring a public space. The persons filmed on this public space had absolutely no direct connexion with the person collecting their images. In case of a blog, the visitors of the blog interact with the blog for fulfilling the own personal purpose of the operation of the blog of the publisher of the blog.\n\nAnother argument is given by the [Recital 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/) which you quote: a personal blog can be viewed as a type of social networking or related online activity.\n\nFinally, **about 3\\.**, there is no doubt for me that, in this case, the publisher of the blog is engaged in an activity which is not personal, since it willingly provides personal information to third parties which they use for their own purposes (and not as subcontractors in the sense of GDPR).\n\nThere may be other approaches apart from these 3, but that's a start for your considerations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A personal blogger operates a publicly accessible blog for purely personal interests.

This aligns with the interpretation that data collected for strictly personal purposes in running a blog may be exempt.\n\nOption A violates the exemption as publishing others' personal information without consent goes beyond personal use, as established in case C-101/01.\n\nOption C involves sharing data with third parties for their own purposes, which extends beyond personal use and likely falls under GDPR jurisdiction.\n\nOption D clearly involves commercial activity and data sharing, which is explicitly excluded from the personal use exemption.\n\nWhile the exemption's applicability to blogs remains somewhat ambiguous, option B represents the scenario most closely aligned with purely personal or household activities as described in GDPR Article 2(2)(c) and Recital 18."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13188/penalties-for-speeding-on-private-roads", "docs_id": 13188, "title": "Penalties for speeding on private roads", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Washington State, a private road is just that: a road on private property, as opposed to a road on a public right\\-of way.

This question tests understanding of the UK's constitutional hierarchy and the limits of executive power. Orders in Council, which are a form of secondary legislation, cannot be used to override or nullify Acts of Parliament, which are primary legislation. This is a fundamental principle of UK constitutional law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Orders in Council can be used in emergencies, they still cannot suspend Acts of Parliament. Option B is false as Orders in Council do not have equal standing with Acts of Parliament. Option D is also incorrect, as even with majority support in the Commons, the executive cannot use Orders in Council to override Acts of Parliament. This reflects the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and the separation of powers in the UK system.\n\nThe question relates to the specific case mentioned in the documentation, where it was suggested that an Order in Council might be used to suspend the Benn Act, but constitutional experts widely rejected this as a legally valid approach."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2250/employer-tuition-repayment", "docs_id": 2250, "title": "Employer Tuition Repayment", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 1 year ago, I accepted a new job with an education budget included. I turned down their initial job offer. When they asked if there was anything that could entice me to reconsider, I countered with the options of an increased salary or an education budget.\n\nThe job became too much... I was given many duties well outside of the job description I signed when I took the job. Also, an employee that left was not replaced and I had to take on many of his duties as well. I have been stressed to the point of affecting my health and working endless hours of overtime that I don't get paid for because I'm on salary.\n\nNow that I have accepted another job (similar pay, less stress/hours), I am being asked to repay the education budget and realizing that the job offer did stipulate 2 years of employment. I am trying to negotiate with the employer based on the fact that I wouldn't have accepted the job without the education. However, if that fails, I still think I have a case because the clause is worded \"I will to the best of my ability continue to work for (company) for 2 years\". I have put every effort I have into the job, put in all the time required to keep up with the added duties, and in the end I am still being asked for more.\n\nWould the \"best of my ability\" argument hold up if I get taken to court?\n\n(Amount: $2500, Country: Canada)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a general common law doctrine of contract interpretation which tells us that ambiguities are construed against the drafter. In your case, had the employer intended to require two years of work (or else reimbursement back to them) *they could have explicitly stated this*. The fact is, the contract is written as it is for a reason, likely to entice you to accept the offer of employment. They softballed the requirements to get you to take the job and now they are trying to play hardball.\n\nI would hope that a court would find this and tell the employer to think about these clauses next time. The fact is, after a deal goes south is a bad time for an employer to start explaining what these terms mean.\n\nYou have fulfilled your half of the bargain. If the facts are as you say they are then you satisfied the \"best of my ability\" condition.\n\nAnother problem you might have is if the employer does not take you to court but instead continues to make threats, maybe sends a collections agency after you. In that case you will need to get an injunction to stop the employer. In other words, get a court to state that you do not owe them any money and enjoin them from continuing to as if you do.\n\nEDIT: as a commenter mentioned, a contract may explicitly provide that ambiguous terms will not be construed against either party.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the common law doctrine of contract interpretation mentioned in the answer, how should the clause \"I will to the best of my ability continue to work for (company) for 2 years\" likely be interpreted in this case?\n\nA) Strictly in favor of the employer, requiring full repayment of the education budget\nB) As a binding agreement that requires exactly 2 years of employment, regardless of circumstances\nC) In favor of the employee, given the ambiguity and the fact that they fulfilled the \"best of my ability\" condition\nD) As null and void, since the job duties changed significantly from the original description\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer discusses the common law doctrine that ambiguities in contracts are generally construed against the drafter (in this case, the employer). The clause \"I will to the best of my ability continue to work for (company) for 2 years\" is ambiguous and not explicitly requiring repayment or a strict 2-year commitment. The answer suggests that the employee has fulfilled their part of the bargain by working to the best of their ability under challenging circumstances.

Case\\-in\\-point, the EU.\n\nUnder some other nation's law, Youtube may be liable for infringement if they wait to be notified. Alternatively, part of the agreement that was being hammered out between Youtube and the content companies might very well be some sort of indemnity agreement, that protects Youtube from the content companies so long as they uphold their end of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, even if Youtube isn't liable for the copyright infringement itself, since they serve ads on such videos, they could conceivably be sued under the theory of \"unjust enrichment\".

But if TAs normally maintain a record of the kinds of interactions we're talking about, and they consulted those records to answer your question, the answer might be different.\n\nIt's less clear whether the statement you're talking about providing would be an educational record. If neither you nor the university \"maintain\" the record, then it doesn't sound like it would fall within the language of the rule. So perhaps whomever you're hoping to hand it off to could draft it, hand it to you to sign, and then take it back. At that point, it's never been maintained by you or the university.\n\n**A few other notes:**\n\n* If this is for a lawsuit, your statement will have virtually no value, as your hearsay account of those TA's stories would be inadmissible.\n* FERPA does not say that schools may not release educational records; it merely says that they are ineligible for federal funding if they have a \"policy or practice\" of permitting the release of educational records. So unless you are a school policymaker, *you* cannot violate FERPA. Of course, the school probably has nondisclosure agreements or other policies in place to ensure that educational records are not released improperly. You need to also consult those rules to determine your obligations.\n* FERPA is very poorly enforced by the federal government. At least as of the last time I looked at this question, no school had ever lost any funding due to a FERPA violation.

It seems that the next step is to obtain a Business License in the city you are living in. But I can't tell if that's actually necessary, since the cloud is inherently everywhere. For example:\n\n> If you are planning on starting a business located in the City of Foo or conducting business within the City's limits, you must first complete a business license application.\n\nThis makes sense if you have a storefront or building where customers come within the city. But I am not sure about if you have an internet business. Since internet businesses are potentially mobile, the idea of \"doing business\" is unclear. The actual doing of business, where a transaction occurs (i.e. a customer buys something) likely occurs in the cloud, in some remote Amazon server perhaps. You might do some administrative work at a coffee shop here or there, etc. So I'm wondering if you need to obtain a *city* business tax license at all, or if so, in which cities the license must be obtained. I don't imagine you would need a license in every city you would sell to, as that would be a lot of work. At the same time, you could be a traveling entrepreneur living in a motor home traveling all across the states.

Does research.\n\nBusiness A does 1, 2, and 3\\. Business B does only 2 and 3\\. Business C does only 4\\.

If any of these are done by an automated script, then the place where the person sits who starts and stops that script, and potentially troubleshoots it, is a place where it does business. \n\nFor D, if it does not sell any of this research, then it does not do business. if it does, then the place where the person (or people) who do the research do it is a place where it does business, and so also is the place where the person sits who takes orders for the research, or runs the script which does this. \n\nIf any of these are multiple variable places, such as cofeeshops with wifi, but they are all within the city Foo, then the company does business within Foo. The Foo City Clerk can probably say how the form should be filled out in such a case.\n\nThis is assuming that Foo has an ordinance requiring a Business License, not all localities have such a requirement.

This is because the acquittal of the first murder charge would almost always imply a jury determination that a murder didn't take place which would be inconsistent with a murder of a postal worker charge.\n\nOn the other hand, a trial on a murder charge would probably not bar, for example, a trial on a burglary charge (which at common law involved trespassing with an intent to commit a crime), even if the burglary charge arose from the same conduct. This is because an acquittal on a murder charge isn't necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a trespass, or with the intent to commit some crime other than the murder for which the defendant was acquitted.\n\nBut the exact way that the line gets draw is tricky and while what I have described is a good general summary of the cases interpreting the double jeopardy clause, it isn't a perfect one. This issue has been litigated many, many tines over the years, so there are a lot of cases that are squarely on point addressing specific fact patterns in precedents that are binding case law that are not always a perfect fit to the general principles. In these circumstances, the binding case law is going to control, at least until a court with appellate authority over the court whose case established the precedent in question decided to overrule a prior precedent from the lower court, or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court precedents, until the U.S. Supreme Court revisits one of its own prior precedents as wrong decided or wrongly interpreted, which happens now and then, although it is a rare event.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a U.S. court, John is charged with second-degree murder for killing his neighbor during a heated argument.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential further prosecution?\n\nA) John can be charged with first-degree murder since it's a different charge from second-degree murder.\nB) John cannot be charged with any crime related to this killing due to double jeopardy.\nC) John can only be charged with lesser offenses not included in the original murder charge, such as assault.\nD) John can be charged with a federal crime if the killing occurred on federal property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the double jeopardy principle in U.S. law, a person cannot be charged twice for the same offense or for offenses that are substantially similar or lesser included offenses of the original charge. In this case, even though new evidence suggests premeditation (which could support a first-degree murder charge), charging John with first-degree murder would be inconsistent with his acquittal on second-degree murder, as both charges fundamentally relate to the same act of killing. Option A is incorrect because first-degree murder would be considered substantially similar to second-degree murder for double jeopardy purposes. Option C is incorrect because assault would be a lesser included offense of murder, and thus also barred by double jeopardy. Option D, while potentially true in some circumstances, is not relevant to the double jeopardy principle discussed here and would likely still be barred if it relates to the same act for which John was already acquitted."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74608/online-dictionary-for-german-legal-terms", "docs_id": 74608, "title": "(Online) Dictionary for German legal terms", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Where can I find a search engine or (online) dictionary which returns the definition and usage of a given term?\n\nExample:\n\n```\nSearch: [Fachkunde ]\n\nReturns\n\nType            Source                      Link\ndefinition      1.

However, most tax-related imprisonments involve fraud or evasion, which are separate from mere failure to pay. Options A, B, and C all involve fraudulent actions beyond simple non-payment. Option D describes a scenario of pure inability to pay, which is not typically a criminal offense and would be most aligned with the 24th Amendment's protections.

If serious issues arise during the trial, the judge will ask the attorneys to speak to them in chambers \u2014 away from the jury.

The \"no-show-no-tell boundaries\" are primarily established through the rules of evidence, which vary by jurisdiction. Admissibility hearings are held well in advance of the trial to resolve disagreements about what evidence can be presented. During the trial, some issues may arise and be resolved through objections.

Section 85 seems to indicate that a consumer will have a right to terminate such a \\=n agreement even after 10 days, but must pay for any services already received, and for any goods received and not in returnable condition. Sections 82 through 88 generally cover terminations of \"Unsolicited consumer agreements\".\n\nIt is not entirely clear to me if the kind of agreement described in the question is an \"Unsolicited consumer agreement\" under this law or not.

In a case like this, the buyer should have known that there was something suspicious going on, and so had a duty to look into things. In any case ignorance is not a legal defense to an accusation of non\\-payment of a tax properly due.\n\nBy the way, it is not a question of a court learning something, but of a tax official, The tax official could refer to matter to a prosecutor, who could bring charges and take the matter to court.\n\nHowever, relatively minor tax issues are most often handled as civil matters with a tax penalty or fine being imposed, and even if it were handled as a criminal matter (unusual for a first offense) the Judge would have the option to impose only a fine.\n\nThe California sales tax rate on autos is currently 7\\.25%, so the tax due would have been something less than $725\\.\n\nThe Californium Sales And Use Tax Law [section 6476](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/lawguides/vol1/sutl/6476.html) specifies a penalty of 6% of the tax due but not paid. However, this applies to:\n\n> Any person required to make a prepayment pursuant to Section 6471 who fails to make a timely prepayment ...\n\nThat would normally be the seller. Remember these taxers are normally collected by the seller from the buyer, and the seller, particularly one whose business is such sales, must make regular payments to the state. I have not found a law or regulation specifying a penalty rate for the buyer in such a situation, but it is probably a similar rate. Note that a later section specifies a 10% penalty instead of 6% when the non\\-payment is negligent or willful.\n\nThe official page [\"Sales And Use Tax Regulations\"](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/lawguides/vol1/sutr/1703.html) from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) summarizes a number of regulations and sections of law, particularly Regulation 1703\\.

A penalty of 10 percent of the amount of all unpaid tax shall be added to any tax not paid in whole or in part within the time required by law.\n> \n> \n> (c) (1\\) (C) Vehicles, Vessels and Aircraft. A purchaser of a vehicle, vessel or aircraft who registers it outside this state for the purpose of evading the payment of sales or use taxes shall be liable for a penalty of 50 percent of any tax determined to be due on the sales price of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft.\n> \n> \n> (c) (3\\) (A) Negligence or Intentional Disregard. A penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax specified in the determination shall be added to deficiency determinations if any part of the deficiency for which the determination is imposed is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations.\n> \n> \n> Generally, a penalty for negligence or intentional disregard should not be added to deficiency determinations associated with the first audit of a taxpayer in the absence of evidence establishing that any bookkeeping and reporting errors cannot be attributed to the taxpayer's good faith and reasonable belief that its bookkeeping and reporting practices were in substantial\n> compliance with the requirements of the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations.\n> \n> \n> (c) (3\\) (C) Fraud or Intent to Evade. A penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax specified in a deficiency determination shall be added thereto if any part of the deficiency for which the determination is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations. In the case of a determination for failure to file a return, if such failure is due to fraud or an intent to evade the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount required to be paid, exclusive of penalties, shall be added thereto in addition to the 10 percent penalty for failure to file a return. Fraud or intent to evade shall be established by clear and convincing evidence.\n> \n> \n> (c) (3\\) (E) (8\\) Relief from Penalty for Reasonable Cause. If the Board finds that a person's failure to make a timely return, payment, or prepayment, or failure to comply with the provisions of section 6074 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the person's control, and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect, the person may be relieved of the penalty provided by sections 6074, 6476, 6477, 6480\\.4, 6511, 6565, 6591, and 7051\\.2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code for such failure.\n> \n> \n> Any person seeking to be relieved of the penalty shall file with the Board a statement under penalty of perjury setting forth the facts upon which the claim for relief is based.

The customer has the right to reject the new terms, and if the service provider then terminates the service, the customer is generally entitled to a pro-rated refund for the unused portion of their subscription. This is based on the principle of contract law that both parties must agree to changes in terms.

It used to be \"not more than one year\", but in 2011, [Substitute Senate Bill 5168](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5168-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2096%20%C2%A7%201.) changed this and many similar instances to \"up to 364 days\". They explained their purpose in the first section of the bill:\n\n> The legislature finds that a maximum sentence by a court in the state of Washington for a gross misdemeanor can, under federal law, result in the automatic deportation of a person who has lawfully immigrated to the United States, is a victim of domestic violence or a political refugee, even when all or part of the sentence to total confinement is suspended. The legislature further finds that this is a disproportionate outcome, when compared to a person who has been convicted of certain felonies which, under the state's determinate sentencing law, must be sentenced to less than one year and, hence, either have no impact on that person's residency status or will provide that person an opportunity to be heard in immigration proceedings where the court will determine whether deportation is appropriate. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to cure this inequity by reducing the maximum sentence for a gross misdemeanor by one day.\n\nIn federal law, [8 USC 1227](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227) (2\\) (A) (I) provides that:\n\n> Any alien who\u2014\n> \n> \n> (I) is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years (or 10 years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident status under section 1255(j) of this title) after the date of admission, and\n> \n> \n> (II) is convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed,\n> \n> \n> is deportable.\n\nThe Washington State legislature didn't think that deportation was an appropriate punishment for an alien who committed a gross misdemeanor.

The Washington State legislature made this change primarily to prevent the automatic deportation of certain immigrants who commit gross misdemeanors. The federal law in question is 8 USC 1227 (2)(A)(I), which states that an alien is deportable if convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed. By reducing the maximum sentence to 364 days, the state ensured that gross misdemeanors would not trigger this automatic deportation provision.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because reducing prison overcrowding was not mentioned as a motivation for this change.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the change was not made to align with federal guidelines, but rather to circumvent a specific federal immigration consequence.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while reducing costs might be a secondary effect, it was not stated as the primary motivation for this change.

Where this is is often dependant on how long or in what way you stay.\n\n### Where's the line between a Tenant and a Guest?\n\n**THAT** is the operative question. When does a Guest/Lodger become a Tenant and can get eviction protection?\n\n* In [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\") a couple of Hotels actually do have renters with a special rental contract \\- which is vastly different from the normal room rental. For example, the Maritim in Hamburg has year\\-rentals. These are actual renters with a rental contract and eviction protection, that give up some tenant rights for services (e.g. room cleaning service for limits in remodeling). However, overstaying at a hotel can actually become a crime: Einmietbetrug \\- obtaining a room in a hotel or a residency but not wanting to pay or mischaracterizing your ability to do so \\- is a variant of fraud and thus can be punished under [\u00a7263 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__263.html); Under the operating law, a hotel guest is not afforded with all rights of a tenant, unless they are explicitly pointed out like with *longstay* contracts.\n* In [california](/questions/tagged/california \"show questions tagged 'california'\") the line is [30 days](https://www.findlaw.com/realestate/landlord-tenant-law/rights-of-renters-in-extended-stay-hotels.html), in [new\\-york\\-state](/questions/tagged/new-york-state \"show questions tagged 'new-york-state'\") it is the same but they *also* need to not have a different residency.\n* in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), the operative case when someone is a lodger or tenant is Brillouet v Landless (**1995**) 28 H.L.R. 836: a hotel Guest is **not** a tenant, even after more than a month of stay. In fact, courts following this case argue, that such a person is only licensed to be on the premises, and the license could be revoked without eviction procedures.\n\nIn fact, the Brillouet v Landless case is very close to the example. Brillouet rented a room in September, and extended the stay. Then he did not pay (or rather, his accommodation services didn't. In October, Landless sought to get rid of Brillouet for non\\-payment, just telling him to leave. Brillouet applied for an injunction against the eviction and got a temporary one (to preserve the status\\-quo) till the hearing. Mere days later, and the first instance court handed out judgement against the application of an injunction to protect Brillouet. The Hotel guest, so the court, was **not** a tenant under the Housing Act 1988:\n\n> The Protection from Eviction Act depends on premises having been let as a dwelling.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of protection from eviction and seeing no tenancy (emphasis mine):\n\n> It is an essential prerequisite of any tenancy that the tenant should have, so it is said in some of the authorities, **exclusive possession**. In my judgment the facts of this case particularly when one bears in mind that Mr Brillouet upon his own assertion avails himself of at least some of the facilities (he goes to the restaurant occasionally for his breakfast) \u2014 come nowhere near demonstrating that he has or has had within this room exclusive occupation. At best in my judgment he could conceivably be a **licensee**. One then has to examine once more the terms of the statute to ascertain whether he is a licensee entitled to protection under the 1977 Act.\n> \n> \n> As the section to which I have alluded makes plain, only licensees who occupy as a dwelling premises which they do occupy are entitled to protection. If, as in my judgment the facts here clearly demonstrate, **the occupant is no more and no less than a hotel guest properly so\\-called, then the accommodation is not let to the licensee as a dwelling.**\n\n[Street v Mountford (1985\\) AC 809](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1985/4.html) most likely doesn't apply if any hotel services are offered by the hotel. In the case, Mountford was found a tenant because Street did not offer any services beyond the room and furnishings itself. The presence of any service would change the pattern significantly, as the House of Lords decided: It applies *against* Bob if the hotel offers cleaning service/room service, and by offering service beyond the room and the furnishing within it, it is lodging, not a tenancy:\n\n> **The occupier is a\n> lodger if the landlord provides attendance or services which require\n> the landlord or his servants to exercise unrestricted access to and\n> use of the premises**. A lodger is entitled to live in the premises\n> but cannot call the place his own.\n> \n> \n> \\[...] Street provided neither\n> attendance nor services and only reserved the limited rights of\n> inspection and maintenance and the like set forth in clause 3 of\n> the agreement. On the traditional view of the matter, Mrs.\n> Mountford not being a lodger must be a tenant.\n\nMehta v Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (2000\\) 32 H.L.R. 45 doesn't apply, as that case revolved around a *verbal contract with the manager for 6 month exclusive use of rooms*. Mehta became a tenant by that contract and eviction protection applied.\n\nIn contrast, due to how agreements with hotels are generally written, Westminster CC v Clarke (1992\\) might apply: If the contact specified that the hotel does have unlimited access (which is typical) and that reassignments of rooms (like, another guest in the room) might apply, then there is no tenancy.\n\n### *Could* Bob be a tenant?\n\nFor Bob to be a tenant under the E\\&W interpretation (following the pattern established by Street \\& Brillouet), the facts must be such, that several things must be true:\n\n* **Exclusive possession**: No services are offered at all beyond the room. For example, there can't be any shared facilities with the rest of the hotel that Bob has access to, and services such as room cleaning or fresh towels or laundry are not offered either. Not using them is not enough, they can't be offered at all. (both Street, Brillout)\n\t+ If in exclusive Possession, Bob still isn't a tenant if he is what Street calls a *service occupier*. That's an employee who is given a place to sleep in to perform his duties to the employer, like a Butler or Maid. (Street)\n\t+ Bob is also not an owner in fee simple, trespasser or mortgagee in possession, or an object of charity \\- for which all other rules apply. (Street)\n\nIn the alternative, one fact makes them automatically one:\n\n* There was a contract that in its form stipulates they **are** a Tenant (Mehta v RBS)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal principles established in English case law, which of the following hotel guests would most likely be considered a tenant with eviction protection rather than a lodger?\n\nA) Alice, who has been staying at a hotel for 45 days and uses the hotel's daily housekeeping and room service.\n\nB) Bob, who has been in a hotel room for 3 months, but the room has no kitchenette and he shares bathroom facilities with other guests.\n\nC) Carol, who signed a 6-month contract with the hotel manager for exclusive use of a fully self-contained apartment within the hotel building, with no housekeeping or other services provided.\n\nD) David, who has lived in a hotel room for 2 years but regularly uses the hotel's laundry service and has his towels changed daily by housekeeping.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Carol is the most likely to be considered a tenant based on the principles established in cases like Street v Mountford and Mehta v Royal Bank of Scotland. She has a long-term contract for exclusive possession of a self-contained living space, with no hotel services provided. This arrangement more closely resembles a tenancy than a hotel stay.\n\nOptions A, B, and D all involve the use of hotel services (housekeeping, shared facilities, laundry), which according to Brillouet v Landless and Street v Mountford, typically indicate a lodger relationship rather than a tenancy.

The fact that your marijuana or your chair or your what is trivial in the scheme of the national economy is irrelevant if the aggregation of all regulated marijuana, chairs or wheat is significant: 317 US 111, 127\\-128\\.\n\nIf the law didn't prohibit possession of marijuana absolutely but instead prohibited, say, the carrying of marijuana in schools, then the US Congress might have trouble relying on the Commerce Clause: see *United States v Lopez* (1995\\) 514 US 549 and replace 'marijuana' with 'handguns' (OK the marijuana/handgun analogy is bad but hopefully this illustrates that there are at least some limits on Congress' power \\-\\- it's not just 'any physical object that relates whatsoever to interstate trade therefore unfettered federal legislative power').", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the interpretation of the Commerce Clause and the Controlled Substances Act, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered outside the scope of Congress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause?\n\nA) A person growing a single marijuana plant in their backyard for personal use\nB) A local bakery producing and selling cannabis-infused cookies only within their city limits\nC) An individual manufacturing a small amount of a controlled substance in their home laboratory for personal experimentation, with no intent to distribute\nD) A person collecting wild psilocybin mushrooms from their private property for personal consumption, never leaving their land\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because, as established in Wickard v Filburn, even small-scale personal production can be regulated due to its potential aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\n\nB) is incorrect because local distribution of controlled substances is explicitly mentioned in the Controlled Substances Act as having a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nC) is incorrect because manufacturing of controlled substances, even on a small scale and for personal use, is considered to have a potential impact on interstate commerce according to the Act.\n\nD) is the correct answer because it involves neither production nor distribution, and the mushrooms are naturally occurring on private property.

The owner's action is legal and aligns with the terms agreed upon at sign-up. The user acknowledged that the service could be cancelled for any reason, which gives the owner the right to terminate the service or change its conditions.

He is now 18, 6'9\", 300 pounds, and bearded, resembling Andre the Giant. During each weekly orthodontics visit, the other children in the waiting room are clearly shaken and parents report that their 5 year olds are becoming scared to go to their dentist. They ask if the owner of the practice could kindly talk to the parents of the 18 year old and ask if he could attend an adult dentistry. The owner obliges, not wanting to upset and possibly lose customers. The owner explains the situation to the \"giant's\" parents and offers an alternative practice, one run by the owner's friend from dentistry school who happens to have worked with children for 20 years before opening a general practice, i.e. whose service is equal with that of the current dentists. The parents refuse. Would the owner of the practice be able to deny service to this individual without losing a discrimination lawsuit?\n\nI think this is a pretty interesting question. One, we are dealing with children, who can't expected to be rational actors (e.g. observe that the giant is peacefully going about his business and is perfectly innocuous by the determination of any sane adult), but are also in a sense \"customers\". In addition, there are perfectly viable alternatives available that would only enhance the experiences all involved parties if exercised. \n\nThis feels like discrimination; if we replaced the giant with a black child, or anyone else with \"abnormal\" but immutable features, it seems the answer would be clear. We would say that the children need to learn how to live with others in their society that don't look like themselves. But this is maybe a bit more acute, considering it would seem much easier to convince a 4 year old who hasn't been exposed to Nazi propaganda or \"Birth of a Nation\" that a random African American is harmless than it would given the real\\-world manifestation of the cartoon antagonist of the latest Disney flick. After all, on top of the desired for specialized care, part of the ethos of the children's dentistry is the desire to create a sort of dental \"safe space\", a friendly environment that assuages the anxiety of this otherwise possibly frightening experience. Should we really expect children to learn life lessons while dealing with the immediate fear of the dentist?\n\nTL;DR: \nKids at a children's dentist are scared because an 18yo who has been going there since he was 5 looks like Andre the Giant. The dentist denies service to the 18 year old and his family, saying that of course it would be discriminatory if everyone involved were rational, but that little children can't be expected to be rational actors, and that if the 18yo keeps coming, it will hurt the business of the dentist. **Is there any sort of precedent that firmly classifies discrimination against an individual based on immutable characteristics as illegal, or can this take place under certain circumstances?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Discrimination is not illegal per se\n------------------------------------\n\n*Some* discrimination is illegal, details vary by jurisdiction, for example discrimination on the following bases is illegal in Australia:\n\n* race\n* colour\n* sex\n* sexual preference\n* age\n* physical or mental disability\n* marital status\n* family or carer\u2019s responsibilities\n* pregnancy\n* religion\n* political opinion\n* national extraction\n* social origin\n\nSome of these apply only in particular circumstances (e.g. employment) and not in others (e.g. consumer rights).\n\n**Physical appearance is not one of the illegal ones**, unless it is as a result of a physical disability.\n\n**Age** discrimination is illegal *but* not universally.

The sender is not an employee of the defendent, however, they are contracted to execute the Defendent's decisions.\n\nDespite the redaction failures, counsel attempted to redact the contractor's message. Plaintiff's attorney argued that based on what is visible, it is necessary to see the remainder of the message as \"best evidence\". Defense Counsel has vigorously asserted that the judge should not consider any of the information that is intended to be redacted under attorney\\-client privilege. The judge asked the defense if he should consider what is clearly already visible.\n\nAnalysis of the evidence clearly revealed the fully unredacted message. Said analysis includes: Plaintiffs were able to \"cut and paste\" the partially redacted email to a basic text editor to reveal the complete message, without redactions. The message is an attempt to request counsel as to how to undertake the contested action and provides false information to counsel. The message is damaging to the Defense's case as the contractor admits plaintiff's claim.\n\nThe unredacted message:\n\n1. provides a pretextual basis to the third\\-attorney, for which counsel provide an opinion\\-letter regarding why the defendant is able to undertake the its disputed action. The opinion letter is the foundation which the Defendent relies upon for the Business\\-Judgement rule.\n2.

In contract law, it's generally assumed that both parties review and agree to the terms before signing. Each party typically receives an identical copy of the signed agreement.

The clean copy, especially if it matches records held by third parties like banks or accountants, would likely be considered the binding agreement.

You can't sue someone for breach of contract, lose and then go again for negligence \\- you have to bring all your causes of action at once. Is there a similar principle in criminal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nFor a particular sovereign in the United States, the criminal law test for this is from [Blockburger v. United States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/284/299) (emphasis mine)\n\n> 12\n> Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element. The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not. Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 342, 31 S. Ct. 421, 55 L. Ed. 489, and authorities cited. In that case this court quoted from and adopted the language of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433: 'A single act may be an offense against two statutes; and **if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.**' Compare Albrecht v. United States, 273 U. S. 1, 11, 12, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. 505, and cases there cited. Applying the test, we must conclude that here, although both sections were violated by the one sale, two offenses were committed.\n\nWhat this says in more plain language is that a person can be prosecuted under two different statutes for the same logical act as long as there is at least one fact that has to be proven for each count which doesn't have to be proven for the other count. This does mean, for example, that a person could not be prosecuted for aggravated assault, acquitted and then later prosecuted for simple assault on the same facts if there aren't any facts required for simple assault that aren't required for aggravated assault.\n\nFor the example in the question, this does seem to mean that if, for example, a robber was first prosecuted for murder, and then later separately prosecuted for carjacking after the murder, this would not be double jeopardy. I would guess in practice that courts wouldn't appreciate this kind of game\\-playing since it wastes the court's time as well to adjudicate two trials when there could just be one, but I don't know if there's a hard rule against it. Blockburger was actually arguing that multiple convictions from one trial should be overturned because some of them relied on the same facts as another. In this case SCOTUS ruled against Blockburger, but on the basis that the facts did not overlap, not that the legal basis of the argument was unsound.\n\nI noted in the beginning that this applies to particular sovereigns, which in terms of US law means either a state or the US Federal Government. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine (e.g. [Gamble v United States](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-646)), if the same set of facts of a case constitute both a state crime and a federal crime, or the also likely case that a federal crime requires all the facts of a state crime plus a few more, both the relevant state government and the Federal government can prosecute the person under their own statutes. This would technically also apply if two states wanted to prosecute someone, although it's unlikely that there is any way to have the exact same set of facts break two different state's laws since state laws generally can only cover actions taken inside the state or affecting that state in particular.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a complex criminal case involving multiple potential charges stemming from a bank robbery, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the application of double jeopardy principles in the United States?\n\nA) A prosecutor can bring charges for murder, then later bring separate charges for robbery arising from the same incident, as long as each charge requires proof of at least one unique element.\n\nB) Once a defendant is tried for any charge related to the bank robbery, they cannot be prosecuted for any other charges arising from the same incident.\n\nC) A state prosecutor can bring charges for the robbery, and regardless of the outcome, a federal prosecutor can then bring charges for the same act under federal law.\n\nD) If a defendant is acquitted of aggravated assault, they cannot later be charged with simple assault for the same act, as simple assault does not require proof of any additional elements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of several key principles discussed in the provided information:\n\nA) While this reflects the Blockburger test, it's not the most comprehensive answer.\n\nB) This is incorrect, as the Blockburger test allows for multiple charges if they each require proof of different elements.\n\nC) This is correct and the most comprehensive answer.

In practice, [a majority of states (but by no means all)](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx) allow the governor to appoint a replacement, and then hold an election for the replacement at the time of the next general election. \n\nWhen there are casual vacancies in the House, the legislature of the relevant state has to call an election to fill the vacancy (Section 2 Clause 4\\).\n\n1 My recollection is that there was more than one survivor and I distinctly remember the Speaker was a woman.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the event of a catastrophic incident that leaves only a handful of members of Congress alive, which of the following statements is correct regarding the ability of Congress to conduct business?\n\nA) The remaining members can conduct business as usual, regardless of their number, due to the extraordinary circumstances.\n\nB) A quorum can be established with just one-third of the total members of each chamber present, as per emergency protocols.\n\nC) No business can be conducted until at least a majority of seats in both chambers are filled through special elections or gubernatorial appointments.\n\nD) The President can temporarily authorize the remaining members to act with full Congressional authority until new elections are held.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Section 5, Clause 1 of the Constitution, \"a Majority of each [house] shall constitute a Quorum to do Business.\" This means that 51 senators and 218 representatives are required for Congress to function. In the event of mass casualties, no business can be conducted until at least these numbers are reached. Vacancies in the Senate may be filled by gubernatorial appointments in some states, while House vacancies must be filled by special elections. There are no provisions for lowering the quorum requirements or allowing the executive branch to grant temporary authority to a reduced Congress. The constitutional requirements for a quorum must be met before Congress can resume its duties."}}
