According to Tennessee law, state governments, including courts and their employees, are generally immune from lawsuits for liability. This principle of governmental immunity makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for individuals to sue the state for negligence in criminal justice decisions. While the family's frustration is understandable, the legal system provides broad protections for governmental entities in these situations. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest it would be easy or straightforward to sue the government, which is not the case.

Identical twins are rare to start with, and few women have sex with more than one identical twin in the several day period when she could have conceived or didn't know which twin she had sex with. It has happened at least once in history (post\\-DNA testing), but you can probably count the number of times that it has ever happened on one hand.\n\nFor example, presumptions from cohabitation, marriage, and claims of paternity often resolve paternity disputes without DNA evidence.\n\nFurther, to the extent that there is good faith uncertainty (perhaps everyone agrees that the mother has sex with both twins on the only possible day of conception and nobody really knows), the downsides to a mistake in the larger cosmic sense of the overall paternity law system are minimal, as identical twins very rarely become deeply alienated from each other and instead tend to be close and intensely cooperative once they discover each other, and tend to be similar to each other in almost every respect depriving the child of little if the court gets it wrong. Realistically, identical twins are particularly likely to settle out of court so the judge doesn't have to decide.\n\nIn one of the only two [actual cases I could locate](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-identical-twins-child-maintenance-paternity-dna-test-goias-a8852436.html) that went to trial (in Brazil), both twins were ordered to pay child support because the evidence showed that they actively conspired with each other to confound the mother and the court regarding who the father was, and conspiracies can support joint and several liability.\n\nThe [other case reported in a news story](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/28/davidsmith.theobserver) had convincing circumstantial evidence supporting one identical twin over the other that probably establish a presumption of paternity for one twin and not the other.\n\n> One of the twins, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to court\n> last summer in the hope of forcing the mother to grant him access to\n> the child.

In cases involving identical twins where DNA evidence cannot distinguish between potential fathers, the court relies on a preponderance of evidence standard. This means they consider all available evidence, including testimony under oath, circumstantial evidence, and any other relevant information to determine paternity. The legal system does not automatically dismiss such cases or always hold both twins equally responsible.

There are various regulations that touch on bathrooms, for example the [OSHA regulations pertaining to sanitation](https://www.govregs.com/regulations/expand/title29_chapterXVII_part1910_subpartJ_section1910.141#title29_chapterXVII_part1910_subpartJ_section1910.141) require that \"toilet facilities, in toilet rooms separate for each sex, shall be provided in all places of employment in accordance with table J\\-1 of this section\", but \"Where toilet facilities will not be used by women, urinals may be provided instead of water closets\". These are regulations imposed on employers, and there is no provision for enforcement *by employers*, for instance no clause saying that the employer must call the police, or in any way intervene or sanction an employee, if a person enters a bathroom of \"the wrong sex\".\n\nIt is apparently not a crime, as reflected anywhere in the US Code, for a male to enter or remain in a female bathroom, or vice versa. Building managers have some discretion regarding the operation of federal facilities, for example courthouses, which could extend to requesting a male to not enter a female bathroom or vice versa, but there isn't a practical way to determine what departmental regulations exist that would allow eviction of a bathroom\\-cross\\-user. Federal law does not protect against sex/gender discrimination in public accommodations.\n\nAs for Maryland law, the owner of private property has the right to control his property up to the point that state law take that control from him, and therefore in principle he could call the police to remove a person trespassing in a bathroom ([this article](https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/is-it-illegal-for-a-man-to-use-the-ladies-room/) addresses the trespass angle in North Carolina). Maryland does not appear to have any case law or statutory exception to trespass laws related to labeling of bathrooms, so enforcement actions would be at the discretion of the owner.\nAt the lower end of the political hierarchy, Baltimore has an ordinance requiring single\\-use bathrooms to be gender neutral, and a [proposal exists](https://legiscan.com/MD/text/SB401/2020) to enact a state law with this effect.\n\nIn other words, there does not appear to be any direct, enforceable legal requirement regarding bathroom entry and sex.

In those circumstances, sometimes the judge is shown the document itself which is not made available to the plaintiff, in order to allow the judge to make that determination, especially in a case headed to a jury trial. This process is called *in camera review*.\n\nTemporary Lack Of Disclosure Of *Ex Parte* Motions For \"Tactical\" Reasons\n=========================================================================\n\nI can image circumstances where something that is the basis of an *ex parte* motion (e.g. a request for permission to enter into a party's premises to search for documents or evidence or disputed property, without prior notice to prevent the things from being concealed or destroyed), would be granted \"under seal\" and not available to the plaintiff (and possibly not even listed in an official register of actions) until the *ex parte* motion which was granted is carried out. But, the non\\-disclosure to the other party in these circumstances usually wouldn't be a permanent matter.\n\nIt is much more common for this to happen in a case where the defendant is not allowed to see something filed by a plaintiff than the other way around.\n\nNational Security\n=================\n\nDocuments implicating national security can also sometimes be filed by the other party with the court \"under seal\", typically in support of a motion to have the plaintiff's case or part of the plaintiff's case dismissed on the grounds that this would risk a revelation of state secrets.\n\nSometimes, when the attorney, but not the client, has a security clearance, these documents can be made available to the attorney, but not to the client, on an \"attorney's eyes only\" basis.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit, under which of the following circumstances would a plaintiff be legally prevented from seeing certain documents related to their own case?\n\nA) When the defendant files a routine motion to dismiss the case\nB) When the plaintiff's attorney requests additional time to prepare their arguments\nC) When documents contain trade secrets and are subject to a protective order for \"attorney's eyes only\"\nD) When the judge issues a standard scheduling order for the case\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In commercial lawsuits between competitors, such as trademark disputes, some documents may be disclosed on an \"attorney's eyes only\" basis under a protective order issued by the judge. This typically occurs when documents contain trade secrets that cannot be easily redacted from information the plaintiff is entitled to see. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because a routine motion to dismiss would generally be served on all parties. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because a request for additional time by the plaintiff's own attorney would not typically involve hidden documents from the plaintiff. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because a standard scheduling order would be made available to all parties involved in the case.\n\nThe question tests understanding of situations where legal documents may be withheld from a party in a lawsuit, specifically focusing on the concept of protective orders in commercial litigation."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43902/advice-if-concept-is-too-general-for-nda", "docs_id": 43902, "title": "Advice if concept is too general for NDA", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently low on money and have no way of paying for a patent on a new device I have designed.

While these are useful for large software firms with very specific modifications, a few of my changes that I have proposed are on the broader side. Thus, I was hoping that before I gave them the NDA that a few people would be able to look it over and help me determine if the proposed information that would be protected by the NDA is \"too broad/vague.\"\n\nSince I will not state the actual information that I am looking to protect with my NDA (for obvious reasons), I will give you the general idea of what I would be trying to protect.

Imagine it being the same thing as the real one, but with different words.\n\n---\n\n\"My new furnace doesn't use coal like most furnaces, instead, it uses chemical X. Moreover, chemical x is bonded with arsenic and turned into a molten fluid, which allows me to burn up the mixture 50% more efficiently. While molten fluid furnaces have been proposed, they've never used chemical x in them before.\n\nOnce the chemical x is burnt, helium is bubbled through at pressures around 5,000 psi to get the waste to become a gas, that way it bubbles out. It can react with magnesium to make a solid substance for disposal. Helium is known to react with way with most substances, however, I am the first to apply it to a liquid chemical x\\-arsenic waste mixture for the purpose of removing it from the furnace.\n\nThe heat produced by the furnace is taken to a ultra\\-pressurized sodium gas and sent to a vanadium turbine system. After this turbine system, it immediately goes to whatever needs to be heated up. This process for exchanging heat from the furnace to the target has been used before and is well known, but never when used with a molten fluid furnace before.\"\n\n---\n\nWhile most of this was not in legalese, it does give the general idea of how much detail I currently have about the design/concept as well as how original the concept is.\n\nThe thing I would be protecting is how all of these different parts would be used to make chemical x into a usable furnace fuel, not all of the little parts. I would like to stop people from taking my idea of \"using a molten fluid mixture\" for getting heat from chemical x and making their own furnace out of it. Since it is pretty general, I will keep the period to 3\\-5 years.\n\nThus, would this concept be something that I could protect using a unilateral patent/employee NDA?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two issues \\- one is you do not want your disclosure to constitute a public disclosure as it related to patent law; the other is you do not want your idea taken by someone else. The first is easier \\- if you trust the people. They just need to agree, even verbally, that the information is confidential and is not a public disclosure. The second is harder\n\nVery generally \\- The NDA can just say that they will keep confidential certain information you would like them to know for purposes of evaluating your ideas for purposes of deciding to enter into a business relationship with you, for example. The NDA itself can just mention the topic \\- A system of using a molten fluid furnace to drive a turbine and to also provide heat.\n\nSeparate is what you then tell them and what you provide in writing, if anything. Many NDA \"forms\" are set up so anything verbally disclosed must be followed up in writing that is marked a certain way to indicate it constitutes a disclosed under the agreement. \n\nProfessional venture capitalists, as an example, do not sign NDAs but expect to hear enough non\\-propriety information about the invention and the people behind it to make a decision about a level of interest.

Is Sam still cover by Unemployment Benefits, Severance Pay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sam is not entitled to unemployment benefits because it is a voluntary quit.\n\n*There's an exception where a person can argue that even though it looked like a voluntary quit, it really wasn't. The person might have learned they were about to lay off everyone in the state (and then that happened). Or been told \"Please turn in your resignation by the end of the day\", a common executive courtesy allowing you to save face. Since those aren't really voluntary quits, the employment office will accept them as layoffs.* \\*\n\nSo the way I see it, that sword cuts both ways. If a layoff is viewed as a *fait accompli* even if there's a resignation a few days prior.... then a voluntary resignation is a *fait accompli* even if there's a layoff a day prior.\n\nIn fact it is very common for employers to say \"Thanks for the 2 weeks notice. Go pack your stuff, today is your last day in the office\" (sometimes with a guard watching you pack your stuff and walk out the door). The remaining 2 weeks are either a gift from the employer, or come out of your accumulated sick or vacation time. At workaholic IBM this often amounted to *months* \\- \"I'm quitting as of May 2\\.

According to the documentation, Sam's situation would still be considered a voluntary quit, even though his employer ended his employment one day earlier than his stated resignation date. The concept of \"fait accompli\" applies here, meaning that Sam's voluntary resignation was already a done deal, regardless of the employer's action to end employment slightly earlier. The documentation states that it's common for employers to end employment immediately upon receiving notice, and this doesn't change the nature of the voluntary quit. Therefore, Sam would not be eligible for unemployment benefits, as voluntary quits generally do not qualify for such benefits.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the employer's action to terminate slightly early doesn't override Sam's voluntary resignation. Answer C is incorrect because unemployment benefits don't work on a day-by-day basis in this manner. Answer D is incorrect because the employer's ability to find a replacement is not a determining factor in unemployment benefit eligibility in this scenario."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72432/does-texas-s-b-8-actually-ban-abortion", "docs_id": 72432, "title": "Does Texas S.B. 8 actually &quot;ban abortion&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Note: I voted to close my own question. I agree, the way I asked it was too opinion\\-based.\n\nI've not read the Texas statute exhaustively, but as far I understand, it is not a criminal statute. Furthermore, section Sec. 171\\.205 seems to allow abortions in cases of a medical emergency, as determined by the doctor performing the abortion.\n\nI have read the ACLU's headline description: [SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW TEXAS ABORTION BAN](https://www.aclutx.org/en/press-releases/us-supreme-court-review-texas-abortion-ban). I've read the body, saying for example: \"S.B. 8 bans abortion after six weeks\u202finto a pregnancy...\" That is scary stuff.\n\nI absolutely believe that abortion should not be banned. But viewing the news with a skeptical eye, my immediate reaction was that \"ban\" seems to imply criminality. But comments have suggested it's broader, so let's examine if S.B. 8 \"officially or legally prohibits abortions\". It certainly prohibits them *without the doctor checking for a fetal heartbeat*, which scares me less, but it's not conclusive, it is a complex law setting standards applicable to a doctor, not on a mother. In fact, the rest of the conditions seem comforting similar to medical ethics as many doctors interpret them. Other doctors interpret the [Hippocratic oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) differently.\n\nI'm no expert on medical ethics, but if there is a ban here, it seems to be imposed by the Hippocratic oath. In in Wikipedia, I find this:\n\n> I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment, and I will do no harm or injustice to them.\\[7] Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. **Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion.** But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even, verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.\n\nIt's interesting how closely tied this is to other controversies, like medically assisted suicide. States (including mine) have legislated to relax the requirements on doctors regarding terminal patients, but that seems like a state\\-by\\-state choice.\n\nRelated second question about the legal claims:\n\n**Are the other claims, e.g. \"Texas politicians will have effectively overturned Roe v. Wade.\" accurate?**\n\nNote: I\"m not at all opposed to the ACLU, but I do try to read carefully.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law actually does ban abortions, when a fetal heartbeat is detected. [Here](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961) is the law. Sec. 171\\.204 says\n\n> (a) Except as provided by Section 171\\.205, a physician **may not**\n> knowingly perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman if the\n> physician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child as required\n> by Section 171\\.203 or failed to perform a test to detect a fetal\n> heartbeat.\n> \n> \n> (b) A physician does not violate this section if the physician\n> performed a test for a fetal heartbeat as required by Section 171\\.203\n> and did not detect a fetal heartbeat.\n\nYou could say that it is an \"ineffective ban\", because it does not impose criminal penalties for violating the prohibition, but it is a prohibition nevertheless. [As pointed out by Ohwilleke](https://politics.stackexchange.com/a/26738), \"Laws without penalties are actually rather common\".

However, it's important to note that while the law prohibits these abortions, it does not impose criminal penalties for violations. This makes it an \"ineffective ban\" in some ways, but it is still considered a prohibition. The law applies to physicians, not directly to women seeking abortions, and it does allow for abortions in cases where no fetal heartbeat is detected after the required test. The use of the term \"ban\" in this context is considered appropriate, even without criminal penalties, as laws without penalties are relatively common."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37809/can-someone-in-california-record-a-phone-call-without-consent", "docs_id": 37809, "title": "Can someone in California record a phone call without consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can I prosecute someone in California for secretly recording my conversation with them? \n\nI had a private call and the woman is stating publicly she recorded it, though I had no knowledge of that at the time.

According to California law, secretly recording a conversation without all parties' consent is both a criminal offense and grounds for civil action. Criminally, it can result in a fine of up to $2,500 and up to 1 year in prison. Civilly, the injured party (Bob) can sue for either $5,000 per violation or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater. Importantly, the $5,000 minimum does not require proof of actual damages, making it possible for Bob to receive compensation even without demonstrating specific harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only mentions the criminal aspect and ignores the possibility of civil action. Option B is incorrect because while Bob can sue in civil court, he does not need to prove actual damages to receive the minimum $5,000 compensation.

Abbreviations may also be found for *common words or legal phrases. Such citations and abbreviations are found in court decisions, statutes, regulations, journal articles, books, and other documents* \\[emphasis added].\n\nThough these statements are currently unsourced\\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_needed \"Wikipedia: Citation needed\")] and **may not represent a [worldwide view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias \"Wikipedia: WikiProject Countering systemic bias\") of the subject**, they seem to suggest that (A) might be true. Is there a formal legal definition for this somewhere?\n\nFor (B), definitions for \"IANAL\" and \"TINLA\" seem to be absent from common legal definitions at this time, for example, [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legal_abbreviations \"Wikipedia: List of legal abbreviations\") and some of the online resources linked there:\n\n* ALLACRONYMS [Legal Abbreviations](https://www.allacronyms.com/legal/abbreviations)\n* Cardiff University's [Index to Legal Abbreviations](http://www.legalabbrevs.cardiff.ac.uk/site/index)\n* The Law Librarians' Society of Washington, D.C.'s [Common Abbreviations and Legal Citation Examples\nfor Selected Federal Government Documents](https://www.llsdc.org/assets/sourcebook/common-abbreviations.pdf)\n\nYet definitions for \"[IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL \"Wikipedia: IANAL\")\" seem to be commonly found online, and similarly for \"TINLA\" (perhaps less\\-so, but still common) \u2013 so common as to be entirely unambiguous, by my assessment. So is this sufficient for them to qualify as valid legal abbreviations for their respective full form disclaimers of \"*I am not a lawyer*\" and \"*this is not legal advice*\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Stating \"This is not blue\" or \"TINB\" on something that is self\\-evidently blue is of no legal effect\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Legal advice](https://hirealawyer.findlaw.com/do-you-need-a-lawyer/what-is-legal-advice.html) has the following characteristics:\n\n> * Requires legal knowledge, skill, education and judgment\n> * Applies specific law to a particular set of circumstances\n> * Affects someone's legal rights or responsibilities\n> * Creates rights and responsibilities in the advice\\-giver\n\nIf the advice you give meets these criteria then it is legal advice.\n\nHowever, if you are clear that you are not a lawyer and that you are not giving legal advice then this undermines the characteristics above. That is, what would be legal advice without such a disclaimer *may* lose that characteristic if the disclaimer is genuinely given in the particular circumstances. Context matters: \"this is not legal advice (wink, wink)\" is not a disclaimer and doesn't turn legal advice into not legal advice.\n\nSimilarly, the disclaimer must be genuinely understood by the recipient so that they are adequately warned to do their own research or seek actual legal advice before taking the course of action outlined. Using an abbreviation is more likely to be misunderstood but, again, context matters. In the context of this particular site (see various [meta](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=legal%20advice) questions), which goes out of its way to explain that this is not legal advice the disclaimer is hardly necessary and the abbreviation would be fine.\n\n---\n\nMore generally\n--------------\n\nCommunication is always under tension between clarity and brevity. It should be detailed enough that it can be understood by its audience but not so long that its audience switches off. \n\nAbbreviations, acronyms, symbols and jargon (all of which I\u2019m going to abbreviate to abbreviations) sacrifice clarity for brevity. Depending on the context and the target audience an abbreviation may or may not need to be spelled out in full. \n\nIn formal writing, it is good practice to spell them out when first used and put the abbreviated form in parenthesis immediately afterward. Alternatively, scientific and engineering reports may use a glossary at the front or back to list them all in one place. \n\nIt is *extremely* good practice to explain these abbreviations in any document that is intended to have direct legal consequences like legislation or a contract. Here clarity is *waaaay* more important than brevity. In a similar vein, it is quite common for such documents to explicitly define real words that already exist to narrow or broaden their scope in the interests of clarity.\n\nHowever, sufficiently common abbreviations may not be spelled out even in these. For example, USA, UN, UK, and EU are in such common usage that they would not need to be spelled out. Similarly, state or province abbreviations would not need explanation *within their own country* \\- while an American should know what IA means they might struggle with NSW.\n\nSimilarly, some contractions may be so common within a profession or industry that no explanation is needed. For example, no scientist or engineer would need to be told what Pa, N, and m mean.\n\nIn more informal settings (like texts or WhatsApp chats) spelling them out would make you look like a pompous dickhead.\n\nIf it's sufficiently clear that a reasonable person in the position of the recipient would understand it then legal consequences can flow from it.

This will generally have the result of broadening the actions that are afforded the protection so that actions that were not protected by the Federal law now might be protected by the State law.\n\nIt's also possible that by enacting a State law that may (intentionally or not) engage other state laws including, for example, one that gives a right to sue or engages criminal or civil penalties for breaching State law that may not exist for a breach of Federal law only.\n\nIt also throws precedent into confusion. While it is likely that existing precedent would apply to the State based law its also possible (because the statutes are not word\\-for\\-word identical) that there would be some confusion leading to more litigation until the precedent settles.

Courts generally assume that new legislation has a purpose, even if it seems to cover already protected rights. This often results in a broader interpretation of the protected actions. The new state law may also interact with other state laws, potentially creating new avenues for legal action or penalties that didn't exist under federal law alone.

This happens so often that as he approaches nobody even needs to say a word: They hand him their camera, and then step back so he can take their picture with it.\n\nBut in this hypothetical scenario something extraordinary happens: As he takes their picture a commercial airplane doing an emergency landing hits the river *in the frame of the photo*. So he happens to have pressed the shutter button on what turned out to be a very valuable picture. Let us supposed that a media buyer offers $10k to license the photo. Who owns the copyright to that photo?\n\nOn the one hand, the camera owners could argue that the photographer exercised no more \"creative expression\" than does a tripod or selfie stick. They just didn't have one handy, so they composed the photo and the photographer was just a mechanism to hold the camera and release the shutter. Therefore, they must own the copyright.\n\nOn the other hand, the photographer could argue that he \"fixed the expression\" of the creative work. As an experienced photographer he made subtle decisions regarding framing and timing of the photo that were outside of the control of the couple. Alternatively, if he hadn't been volunteering to photograph the couple with their camera, he could have instead been holding his own camera and captured the valuable element of the photo, which was the serendipitous emergency landing.\n\nDoes any law or jurisprudence inform who owns the copyright in this scenario?\n\nIf the aforementioned facts suggest it is the couple (and owners of the camera), then let us change one fact: After taking the couple's desired photo, the photographer sees the airplane out of the corner of his eye and, with no time to spare, shifts the camera to capture a separate spectacular photo of the water landing. Does he now have firm claim on the copyright to that photo?\n\nAnd if so, can the photographer enforce his property rights in the photo, given that it was captured and is stored on equipment he does not own and cannot legitimately possess? I.e., can't the camera owner say, \"OK, you own the photo copyright, but I own the medium where you put its only copy, and I will not sell or grant you access to that medium except for the full value of the photo.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What a lovely question!\n\nUS Copyright law is clear: the author of a creative work owns the copyright unless it is work for hire. In this instance, the photographer is not doing work for hire so they own the copyright.\n\nHowever, the photographer does not own a copy of the photograph \u2013 that is owned by the owner of the camera. The photographer cannot demand that they give him a copy but the parties can agree on such a transfer on whatever terms they like.\n\nAs the owner of a \u201cphysical\u201d copy they can do what they like with that copy but they cannot duplicate it except as fair use or as licensed. They could sell the memory card to whomever they like but the new owner couldn\u2019t copy it either so it would seriously limit publication. Similarly they could move the file provided there was only one copy. Arguably, they could make a print of it providing they deleted the electronic version without copyright violation.\n\nWhich brings us to who owns the copyright *now*. The camera owner can argue that the photographer has gifted the copyright to them. This is quite a strong argument as the parties' intentions at the time of arranging the taking of the photograph is that the photographer would have no further interest in it \u2013 after all he probably doesn\u2019t want to hang a photo of some strangers on his wall. However, in many jurisdictions, including the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), copyright transfers must be in writing.\n\nAs a fallback position the camera owner can argue there is an *implicit* license given even if copyright was not transferred. The scope of the license then becomes an issue. It is probably indisputable that the license is perpetual and royalty free. What is arguable is if the license allows commercial exploitation or only personal use. This is where the battle lines would be drawn and I don\u2019t know how it would play out.\n\nOther jurisdictions are different\n---------------------------------\n\nFor example, in Australia, copyright in a photo commissioned \u201cfor valuable consideration\u201d for a \u201cprivate or domestic purpose\u201d vests in the commissioning party, not the photographer; even though this is not work for hire by an employee.\n\nFor the circumstances you describe, the purpose is \u201cprivate or domestic\u201d but there is no \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d so the photographer owns the copyright in this case.

Doctors can pretty much bill a patient whatever they want for their service, similar to how a grocery store can charge whatever they want for their fresh deli cheese. Generally, they charge every single person the same amount. It just gets *discounted* depending on the insurance you have and how much they're willing to pay.\n\nOne of the huge benefits of having medical insurance (outside of them paying for your medical expenses) is that they build contracts with service providers, known as their network. Those contracts specify prices (both preset and algorithmic) for certain services that you receive through those providers \\- the insurance provider will only pay that much and the doctor cannot charge the patient more than what is paid.\n\nIf a claim was processed through a different insurance provider, the price will likely be different since each provider will have a separately negotiated contract with different price points for different services. It's not a system of \"this is the insured price and this is the uninsured price\" but rather a system of \"this is the contract you established saying you'd accept this much from us for this service.\"\n\nFor an uninsured person, though, you have no insurance provider and more importantly no provider contract backing you up. So you'd have to face the full force of the non\\-discounted price of those services. You'll face the same problem even with insurance if you go out\\-of\\-network, where the provider does not have contracts and therefore will only cover up to a certain amount that they would normally pay out for a similar service, requiring you to cover the rest of the amount of whatever the doctor decided to bill for that particular service. Without that insurance contract preventing the doctor from billing you the remainder of what they'd normally charge, you'll likely be slapped with a bill for that remainder.\n\nDirecting back at your original question: there is no reason that a medical provider would ever legitimately bill someone a different amount because they are insured or not, thus there are no laws preventing it. It's that they already agreed to accept this certain amount from patients covered under this specific insurance. Again, they bill every patient the same amount \\- the insurance company is just saying \"we're giving you this much and the rest of this, yeah that needs to go away.\"\n\nIf you've ever looked at an EOB (Explanation of Benefits) from your insurance company, you'll see that the actual billed amount from the doctor is almost always much, **much** higher than what is actually paid out by you or the insurance, often known as the insurance discount.

This scenario illustrates the concept of contractual adjustments in medical billing. When a medical provider has a contract with an insurance company, they agree to accept a predetermined amount (in this case, $600) as payment in full for specific procedures. The difference between the original billed amount ($1000) and the contractually agreed amount ($600) is written off by the provider as a contractual adjustment. This is not considered charging different amounts to insured and uninsured patients (ruling out A), nor is it illegal or a violation of regulations (ruling out D). The patient is not responsible for the $400 difference (ruling out B) because the provider has agreed to accept the insurance company's allowable charge as payment in full.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they suggest that shareholders have more rights or options than they actually do in a bankruptcy proceeding. Shareholders cannot exercise appraisal rights as in a merger (A), they don't retain voting rights on the bankruptcy plan (B), and they cannot petition for a reassessment of the company's valuation to increase their compensation (C).

However, oil reserves often extend beyond property boundaries. While John has the right to extract oil from his property, he may need to negotiate with neighboring landowners if the extraction process (such as slant drilling) requires access to or affects their property.

The FTT said that it was, since either the Duchy or the Duke were carrying out certain functions of public administration (as the harbour authority for [St Mary's Harbour](https://www.stmarys-harbour.co.uk/) on the Isles of Scilly), and whichever one it was, the Duke was in charge of the Duchy; and meanwhile, the Duchy appeared to have some elements of legal personality, as cited in the question above. This decision was appealed to the Upper Tribunal, [*The A\\-G for the Prince of Wales v the IC and Mr Michael Bruton* \\[2016] UKUT 0154 (AAC)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5784f4b7ed915d622c000119/GIA_0158_2012-00.pdf), which disagreed as to the Duchy being a body with its own separate identity \\- see paragraphs 71\\-102 \\- and reversed the ruling below.\n\nThe basic issue is that the Duchy of Cornwall was brought into being by a royal charter of 1337\\. It predates modern common\\-law or statutory developments about bodies corporate, income tax, corporation tax, and so on. It also precedes the not\\-exactly\\-modern developments of the limited scope of royal authority and the prerogative, norms of statutory construction, the Crown as separate from the royal person, and other apparatus of *constitutional* monarchy. It is true that it sits uncomfortably in the modern world, as a *sui generis* feudal creation that is not something we would create today. However, as a matter of law, the UT said that what counts is what the Duchy is, not what it ought to be. Figuring out the law means looking at the actual law as opposed to ancillary indications, such as what Duchy officers have said from time to time, or administrative actions of the Health and Safety Executive. Parliament has had the opportunity to consider the position of the Duchy several times and has so far declined to change it.\n\nThe [charter of 1337](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/11/0), which was deemed to be an Act of Parliament by a court case in 1606 (!), grants land and privileges to the Duke of Cornwall, whoever that might be from time to time, and with a reverter to the Crown when there is no Duke. The UT found that this \"creates something that has similarities to a trust, but without trustees\" (there was a nascent body of law relating to trusts in 1337, but it was nowhere near its modern flourishing). Unlike with the creation of the Duchy of Lancaster, this charter does not incorporate the Duchy as an entity in its own right \\- the \"Duchy\" is just a word used to describe the possessions of the Duke or King held under the charter. If it *is* a separate entity then that is not because of the charter.\n\nThe UT examined various of the claims made in the FTT but rejected them, saying that \"such examples cannot create such an entity or body and each investigation of the submissions based on them that took place before me showed such statements or implications to be wrong (e.g. that the Duchy owns Highgrove was shown to be wrong by the\nproduction of the Land Certificate).\" It also rejected the idea that the people who administer the Duchy could be regarded as some form of partnership or unincorporated association, finding that they had not come together in that fashion. It said that therefore, the only remaining route to the Duchy being a corporation would be if the other primary legislation dealing with its management had created it as such by \"necessary implication\".\n\nThose Acts, of [1844](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/7-8/65/contents), [1863](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/26-27/49/contents) and [1982](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/47/contents), deal with accounting and management for the Duchy of Cornwall. From their context and content, the UT said that they seem to envisage the property in question as belonging to the Duke (not the Duchy) as \"the legal owner of the assets etc. comprising the Duchy estate\", and that \"the relevant officers and employees work for the Duke, or the Duke\u2019s guardian when he is a minor, or the Sovereign when there is no Duke, and not for an entity or corporation called the Duchy.\" Therefore:\n\n> \\[T]he Duchy of Cornwall or the Duchy is no more than a name that has been used correctly to describe the possessions of the Duke of Cornwall (the Duchy estate), or to the Duke (or his title), or collectively and conveniently to describe the officers and persons who from time to time act for and on behalf of the Duke as the owner of the Duchy estate.\n> \n> \n> Save to the extent that it is a reference to the Duke as a natural person the Duchy of Cornwall has no legal personality and is not a person, body or entity that has its own functions and powers or a separate identity of its own.\n\nAlthough this was not before the UT, it would seem to follow for tax purposes that if the Duchy is not a body corporate, then it is not liable for corporation tax under the [Corporation Tax Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/4/contents) \\- see section 1121, which defines \"company\" for that and the companion Corporation Tax Act 2009\\. It also does not fall within section 443, \"Companies controlled by or on behalf of Crown\", firstly because if it's not a company, then that section fails immediately, and secondly because \"Crown\" here refers to the Crown in the sense of governmental public functions, not the Queen (or her family members) personally.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of the Duchy of Cornwall?\n\nA) The Duchy of Cornwall is a separate legal entity with its own corporate identity, subject to corporation tax.\n\nB) The Duchy of Cornwall is a public authority due to its role in administering St Mary's Harbour on the Isles of Scilly.\n\nC) The Duchy of Cornwall is not a separate legal entity, but rather a term describing the possessions and administration of the Duke of Cornwall.\n\nD) The Duchy of Cornwall is a trust-like entity created by the 1337 charter, with the Duke as the trustee.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Upper Tribunal ruled that the Duchy of Cornwall is not a separate legal entity with its own identity.

The passage indicates that the last time a monarch even considered refusing assent was in 1914, and it was only in consideration of averting a national disaster.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while refusing Royal Assent could potentially cause a constitutional crisis, providing a mechanism for resolving such crises is not the primary purpose of the practice.

Virtual child pornography is not 'intrinsically related' to the sexual abuse of children\".\n\nThe opinion in *Ashcroft* included the statement that:\n\n> Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value. This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See *Book Named \"John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v. Attorney General of Mass*., 383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966\\)\n\nUnder [*Ginsberg v. New York*, 390 U.

If a state obscenity law is thus limited, First Amendment values are adequately protected by ultimate independent appellate review of constitutional claims when necessary. Pp. 413 U.

(I'm assuming that deceit, reliance, litigation etc are clear, see assumptions at end of Q).\n\nA attempts to be safe by asking a professional valuer (V) for an opinion on the asset before signing, but V was negligent and the valuation was defective.

Reasons for A wishing to hold F liable for the entirety of loss might be:\n\n* V is now living overseas and hard to litigate against;\n* V did not actually have insurance, or there would be no assets to pay the claim if successful;\n* V is a personal friend of A and A wants to avoid suing his friend and breaking a friendship;\n* A incurred various unrecoverable expenses in claiming against V, and he feels that F should be liable for all losses flowing from the deceit;\n* An associate or relation of A (called \"B\") has also suffered from the deceit and purchase of the asset but B lacked a contractual relationship with V and was not foreseeably reliant on V's defective valuation, and therefore B's only recourse is against F for the loss flowing from a deceit, not V.\n\nLegal arguments\n===============\n\n* A argues that, but for the deceit, neither A or B would have been exposed to a defective valuation or defective asset in the first place, so their entire losses flow from F's deceit and the subsequent valuation error is irrelevant: without F's deceit they wouldn't have put themselves in a position of relying on V in the first place.\n* F argues that he isn't liable for any material amount of damages to A or B, or for any unrecovered outlay A incurred in suing V, because ultimately A and B only suffered loss in the end due to an unconnected third party's negligence (V). In the alternative, F argues that if found liable, he is only liable for part of the losses claimed by A and B, due to contributory negligence by V.\n\nIs there clear precedent in case law that backs either of their positions?\n\nOr, put another way, is there case law precedent for a deceiver being liable for loss due to a *subsequent problem*, on the legal ground that \"but for the deceit the claimant would never have put themselves in a position where they would have been exposed to the risk of that *subsequent problem*, in the first place\"?\n\n*NOTE: Assume for this question that UK law applies, and all criteria for the claims are met: the fact of any deceit or negligence is blatant and uncontested, the fact of reliance or mitigation is uncontested, and so on.

I believe that assumption is wrong.\n\nThe gist of the question is this:\n\n> Suppose a fraudster's deception causes a person to take a course of action they wouldn't have otherwise taken. As part of that, they suffer losses due to a second person's tort. Is that loss recoverable from the fraudster as well?\n\nIn the scenario given, there are clearly two parties that are to blame for the loss:\n\n1. The fraudster, who perpetrated the fraud.\n2. The professional attorney, who gave defective advice.\n\nThe fact that there also exists a second party that may have *contributed* to the loss does not in any way *absolve* the first party from blame or from being liable for his actions.\n\nIn a tort case, it is always the person that caused the loss in the *first place* (the tortfeasor) the victim (A) should seek relief from first. So F is in *no way* \u201csafe from litigaton\u201d.\n\nIn the event that the tortfeasor is not being able make full restitution (e.g. he is already bankrupt), A may sue V for professional negligence to recover his loss. However, to prevail, A vould must be able to prove that V has made critical errors that no \u201creasonable attorney\u201d would have made. That is sometimes pretty hard to prove (it obviously depends on how clever F's deception was, and whether the number of hours A allowed V to use for due diligence should have been sufficient to uncover the deception).\n\nAs for legal precedent, I am not aware of a *single* case where a fraudster has *not* been held liable because the victim of the fraud has sought professional advice (but it is of course not easy to locate precedent for something has *not* occured).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a fraudster (F) deceives a buyer (A) about an asset, and A subsequently relies on a negligent valuation from a professional (V) before purchasing, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding F's liability?\n\nA) F is not liable for any damages, as V's negligence is an intervening cause that breaks the chain of causation.\n\nB) F is only liable for partial damages, with V being responsible for the remainder due to contributory negligence.\n\nC) F is fully liable for all losses incurred by A, including those stemming from V's negligent valuation.\n\nD) F is only liable for damages directly related to the initial deception, but not for any losses resulting from V's negligence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the principles discussed in the given information, a fraudster is typically liable for all losses resulting from their fraud, whether or not those losses were reasonably foreseeable. The fact that a second party (V) contributed to the loss through negligence does not absolve the original fraudster (F) of liability. The \"but for\" test applies here - but for F's initial deception, A would not have been in a position to suffer losses from V's negligent valuation. Therefore, F remains fully liable for all of A's losses, including those that arose from V's subsequent negligence.

By not paying the fine or showing up to court, you could be subject to [RCW 46\\.64\\.025](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=46.64.025), so that the department of licensing is notified. You have [15 days to respond](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.63.070) to the notice. We assume that you are a resident, because [if you are a non\\-resident](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.64.035) (and not resident of another state with a reciprocal agreement), they would have required you to pay a bond at the time of the ticket (though that isn't possible with automated infraction\\-detection).\n\nWhen the Dept. of Licensing gets the notice of the unpaid ticket, they may suspend or revoke your license. At this point, you will have received notice that your license was suspended (unless you changed your address and mail isn't forwarded, in which case you have a different problem, that you're supposed to apprise DOL of your current address, and didn't do so). At that point (after they send the letter), you have 15 days to respond. One response is to pay the ticket plus the added fines, or, you can request an administrative review (to appeal the suspension).\n\nThe point of going to court to plead your case would presumably be to modify the judgment against you, for instance to reduce or eliminate the added fine. You would then need to give a good reason for not being punished: RCW 46\\.64\\.025 already has you covered, because the suspension process starts with *willfully* failing to appear. You would then need to show that your failure to appear was not willful.\n\nIt does not legally matter whether you are a foreigner or have problems understanding the language. Speeding tickets usually say pretty clearly that you must pay the ticket within a specified time frame, or appear in court, but people don't always read tickets. It is entirely plausible that one's grasp of the language is low enough that there really was a misunderstanding. If you can provide credible evidence that your failure was not willful, by law you would only be liable for the ticket.\n\nIn other states and countries, the situation could be somewhat or quite different (e.g. Norwegian traffic laws are stricter). In New Mexico, it is more serious to fail to appear. NM Statute [66\\-8\\-126](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-8/part-2/section-66-8-126/) states that \"It is a misdemeanor for any person to violate his written promise to appear in court, given to an officer upon issuance of a uniform traffic citation, regardless of the disposition of the charge for which the citation was issued\". Your license can/will be suspended (it is not clear whether suspension is automatic), but additionally since failure to appear is a misdemeanor, you can be arrested. Unlike Washington law, there is no willfullness requirement for such a penalty. Given the criminal nature of failure to appear, a traffic attorney would need to suggest an appropriate belated response.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A foreign tourist receives a speeding ticket in Washington state but misunderstands it as a warning due to language difficulties. They fail to respond within 15 days. What is the most likely sequence of events that will follow?\n\nA) The tourist will be immediately arrested for a misdemeanor and have their license suspended.\nB) The Department of Licensing will be notified, potentially suspend the license, and send a notice giving 15 more days to respond.\nC) The tourist's home country will be notified, and they will be banned from re-entering the United States.\nD) The ticket will be automatically dismissed due to the language barrier, with no further consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Washington state law, when a person fails to respond to a traffic ticket within 15 days, the Department of Licensing is notified (RCW 46.64.025). The department may then suspend the license and will send a notice giving the individual another 15 days to respond. This process applies regardless of the person's nationality or language proficiency.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate arrest is not the standard procedure in Washington for failing to respond to a traffic ticket, and misdemeanor charges are not automatically applied.\n\nOption C is incorrect as there's no mention of notifying the tourist's home country or imposing travel bans for unpaid traffic tickets.\n\nOption D is incorrect because language difficulties do not automatically dismiss the ticket. The law doesn't provide exceptions based on language comprehension.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the actual process in Washington state, allowing for potential license suspension but also providing an additional opportunity to respond or appeal."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56824/where-is-the-line-between-assault-and-self-defense", "docs_id": 56824, "title": "Where is the line between assault and self defense?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that someone of whom one is not fond walks up to you while you are having a conversation with another and stands quite too close for comfort and you ask them to get out of your personal space.

Does this mean I can't even work in the same city as the client for up to 12 months? 12\\.6 and 12\\.7 almost looks as if they're just fishing to see if any of these are invalid then the next one down will apply. How should I interpret this?\n\nThe country is Australia.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the restraint is on you working is for a client with whom you had direct dealings within the last 12 months of your employment (see 12\\.2\\.1\\) or your poaching any of your colleagues (see 12\\.2\\.2\\)\n\nSecond, as written, you can't do that in the same *state*. However, that is because they clearly have the subclauses of 12\\.4 in the wrong order. If this is fixed then the limitations are 12 months for a 15km radius, 6 months for a 50km radius and 3 months for the same state.\n\nThird, 12\\.6 and 12\\.7 are pretty standard types of clauses (although I've not seen something like 12\\.7 before). The reason they are here is because restraint of trade clauses are void if they exceed what is reasonable to protect the legitimate interests of the business.

The clause limits work with clients the consultant had direct dealings with in the last 12 months of employment (12.2.1), for up to 12 months (12.3.1) within a 15km radius of their primary work location (12.4.3).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misinterprets the geographic scope, applying the broadest area (state-wide) to the longest time period, which is not how the clause is structured.\n\nOption C is overly broad and not supported by the contract, which does not impose a blanket ban on working in the technology sector across all of Australia.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the clause specifically limits the definition of \"client\" for government entities to only those departments or divisions that were actual customers of COMPANY_NAME in the last 12 months of employment (12.2.1)."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25086/my-parents-purchased-a-condo-under-my-name-can-they-legally-take-the-condo-back", "docs_id": 25086, "title": "My parents purchased a condo under my name, can they legally take the condo back?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in Ontario, Canada. Due to conflict with my parents, they are claiming that by law they can force me to give back the condo to them (or repay them the amount of the purchase) since they paid for it. Is this true?\n\nThe condo was paid in full and it is under my name only. I did not sign anything in relation to the condo with my parents; they basically sent me a cheque and asked me to deal with a real estate agent who is a friend of theirs.\n\nThe original intent was giving me the condo as a gift, but there isn't any written agreement.\n\nI have also been paying the property taxes and condo fees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it looks like a gift and sounds like a gift and there is no evidence that it should not be considered a gift, well, what else could it be?\n\nGiven the value of a house and depending on jurisdiction, there may be a gift tax involved. This is normally an obligation placed on the giver, not the receiver. It is unlikely to be a concern to you but a separate check would be wise for your own sake.\n\nIf all ownership documents are clear that you *and you alone* own (and pay regular costs of, and maintain) the house, it is extremely unlikely that any private individual can take it away from you, regardless of their relationship to you.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any legal basis for their claims; they are hoping you will bow to social and emotional pressure. Your best course of action is to call their bluff.

In this scenario, all evidence points to the condo being a gift: it's solely in the child's name, there's no written agreement indicating otherwise, and the child has been paying property taxes and condo fees. The original intent was to give the condo as a gift, and without any contrary evidence, it would likely be treated as such legally. The parents have no legal basis to force the return of the property or demand repayment. Option A is incorrect because the parents' ability to prove payment doesn't override the gift nature of the transaction. Option C is incorrect because even an oral agreement would be difficult to enforce given the circumstances, and there's no mention of such an agreement. Option D is incorrect because gifts, once given, cannot be unilaterally reclaimed by the giver without legal cause."}}
