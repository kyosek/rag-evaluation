Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The auction house can legally refuse to sell John the vase because the owner's undisclosed reserve price wasn't met.\n\nB) John has no legal recourse because auctions are always subject to undisclosed reserve prices.\n\nC) John can sue for breach of contract and likely succeed in forcing the sale or recovering damages.\n\nD) The auction house can cancel the sale but must compensate John for his time and travel expenses.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the provided information, when an item is put up for auction without mentioning a reserve price, the sale is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion (usually by the fall of a hammer). In this case, the auctioneer accepted John's bid and announced the sale as complete, forming a binding contract.\n\nThe key point is that \"any after-the-fact declaration of the existence of a reserve bid has no bearing on the formation of the contract.\" The only thing that matters is whether the property was put up for auction subject to a reserve price, which it wasn't in this scenario. Therefore, John can sue for breach of contract and is likely to succeed in either forcing the sale or recovering damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the undisclosed reserve price is not legally binding if it wasn't announced before the auction. Option B is false because auctions are not always subject to undisclosed reserve prices. Option D is incorrect because the auction house cannot unilaterally cancel a completed sale, and mere compensation for expenses would not be sufficient remedy for breach of contract."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67823/can-lack-of-dual-citizenship-be-a-job-qualification-in-canada", "docs_id": 67823, "title": "Can lack of dual citizenship be a job qualification in Canada?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some organizations in Canada have an official preference for hiring Canadian citizens, and say so in job announcements.

In general, when parties sign a contract on different dates, the contract is formed when the last person signs, unless the contract specifically states otherwise.

But that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be legal consequences.\n\nIt would be powerful evidence in a perjury prosecution (surely enough for a conviction even standing alone long after the trial is over but within the statute of limitations for perjury in the jurisdiction from the date of the sworn statement, if any), and would be a waiver of 5th Amendment rights against self\\-incrimination, generally, in the perjury case.\n\nIt might also be strong evidence (enough to convict standing alone) in a timely obstruction of justice prosecution. This statute of limitations could also run from the date of the sworn statement, or from the date of a false unsworn statement that caused a conviction to be reopened.\n\nIf the statement made in court was favorable to the prosecution, it might bring these charges after the conviction in the underlying case is final. But, the out of court statement would probably be grounds for the party benefitting from the original statement to seek a mistrial or to have a judgment set aside if the verdict or judgment is consistent with the sworn statement.\n\nIf the out of court statement was made before the trial was over, the witness could be recalled and the out of court statement could be used to impeach the in court statement.\n\nIt might constitute a probation or parole violation.\n\nIf the witness were testifying pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the out of court statement would probably breach the deal and deny the witness the benefit of the cooperation deal.\n\nThe out of court statement might constitute contempt of court if made while the proceeding in which the statement was made was still pending.\n\nDepending on the nature of the statement, the out of court statement might constitute defamation for which some one whose reputation was tarnished might sue for money damages. (There is immunity from civil liability for in court statements.)\n\nIt would violate the ethical rules of many professions. For example, an attorney would probably be disbarred for doing that. Arguably, in this situation, the statute of limitations could run from the later unsworn statement date rather than the date of the sworn statement.\n\nIf the witness is a state or federal government employee, this could lead to impeachment proceedings, in the state legislature, or Congress, respectively.\n\nThe aftermath of the Lewinsky Scandal (link below) involving Bill Clinton touches on many of these possibilities:\n\n> Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment\n>  of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.

Instead, the hard cases are the cases where there is strong evidence that the statement made in court, under oath was true. \n\nFor example, suppose Ted Cruz is asked in court: \"[Were you the Zodiac killer?](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/8/11179492/ted-cruz-zodiac-killer)\" (A crime ridiculously attributed to him despite the fact that it is something that happened when he was a small child who live many hundreds of miles away.) And he says, \"No\" in court, but then leaves the courtroom and says in a press conference on the court house steps: \"I am the Zodiac killer, I lied about that under oath in court today.\"\n\nSimilarly, suppose that a DNA test on [a certain blue dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal) shows a perfect match to President Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton says under oath in court, that the substance tested came from him on a certain day, in a certain place, when a certain person was wearing it, in a certain way (also confirmed by a witness and surveillance video). Then, he leaves the courtroom and says in a press conference on the court house steps: \"Someone else was the source of that genetic material. I never met that person, and I was in Kenya on the day alleged and I've never set foot in the White House. I lied about all of this under oath in court today.\"\n\nIn these cases, there is no plausible way to make an obstruction of justice or perjury charge stick, or to upset a verdict or judgment consistent with the truthful sworn statement.\n\nContempt of court is still possible, as would professional ethics violations, but other consequences would be less obvious, because the act would come across more as absurd instead of something that genuinely confounds the truth. \n\nThe legal consequences associated with the conduct in the original post are mostly aimed at sanctioning genuinely fraudulent conduct.

And the argument that a [dog is a *fur\\-bearing animal*](http://www.pawculture.com/pet-wellness/pet-grooming/dog-hair-or-dog-fur-is-there-a-difference/) can be established by an expert witness if the burglar's lawyer resorts to vexatious \"defenses\".\n\nThe statutory language \"*any fur\\-bearing animal*\" obviously encompasses domestic fur\\-bearing animals, notwithstanding that [MCL 324\\.40102(1\\)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ngh4veyz0hmmxgkl45323zzu))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-324-40102) defines *animals* as \"*wild birds and wild mammals*\".

The act of committing burglary precludes the defendant from claiming just cause. Additionally, MCL 324.43103 states that a person cannot knowingly and willfully kill or injure any fur-bearing animal owned by another person without the owner's consent. The context of burglary clearly indicates lack of owner consent. The burglar's illegal entry into the home eliminates any legal justification for harming the dog, even in an attempt to escape.

To be clear, I'm not asking whether it was socially acceptable in England of the 1790's to publicly pass gas on someone's picture (nor whether it is acceptable to do so today), but whether it fit the legal definition of Treason under any statutory or common law offense that would have been in effect in 1798\\.\n\nMore specifically, either of the following scenarios seems plausible:\n\n* This was literally treason in 1798, and the cartoon's purpose is to point out the absurdity of treating toilet humor shenanigans as legally equivalent to murdering the king or waging grim war against him.\n* This was not actually treason, but the point of the cartoon was a warning against contemporary trends in expanding the scope of criminal offenses to cover unusual or non\\-obvious scenarios. In other words, this was an exaggeration to emphasize that criminal law was getting so ridiculously broad that farting on a picture might soon be prosecutable as a major offense if the cartoon's readers didn't start advocating for more narrow and sensible laws.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The cartoon may call back to events of 1795, where George III had stones thrown at him while he was on his way to the State Opening of Parliament. In response, the government \\- headed by Pitt the Younger, who is the man in the picture saying \"That is treason, Johnny\" \\- passed [\"An Act for the Safety and Preservation of His Majesty\u2019s Person and Government against Treasonable and Seditious Practices and Attempts\"](https://statutes.org.uk/site/the-statutes/eighteenth-century/1795-36-geo-3-c-7-treasonable-and-seditious-practices-act/), 36 Geo. 3 c.7\\. We now call it the Treason Act 1795\\. It was one of a series of Acts that suspended habeas corpus, banned political meetings, and so on, in the wake of the French Revolution.\n\nSection 1 deals with treason, at some length, but a fart probably doesn't count. The conditions are that somebody would:\n\n> within the Realm or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend Death or Destruction, or any bodily Harm tending to Death or Destruction, Maim or Wounding, Imprisonment or Restraint, of the Person of our same Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors, or to deprive or depose him or them from the Style, Honour, or Kingly Name of the Imperial Crown of this Realm, or of any other of his Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Countries; or to levy War against his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, within his Realm, in order, by Force or Constraint, to compel him or them to change his or their Measures or Counsels, or in order to put any Force or Constraint upon, or to intimidate, or overawe, both Houses, or either House of Parliament; or to move or stir any Foreigner or Stranger with Force to invade this Realm, or any other of his Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Countries, under the Obeisance of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors; and such Compassings, Imaginations, Inventions, Devices, or Intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or declare, by publishing any Printing or Writing, or by any overt Act or Deed\n\nThe text is substantially preserved in the [Treason Felony Act 1848](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/11-12/12/contents), section 3\\. The 1795 Act also created a \"High Misdemeanour\" for anyone who\n\n> shall maliciously and advisedly, by Writing, Printing, Preaching, or other Speaking, express, publish, utter, or declare, any Words or Sentences to excite or stir up the People to hatred or Contempt of the Person of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or the Government and Constitution of this Realm, as by Law established\n\nThis is closer to the fart; it is a l\u00e8se\\-majest\u00e9 provision aimed at general disrespect for the King. The provision was due to expire in 1798\\. I do not know the detailed timeline of its expiry and proposed renewal in relation to when the cartoon was published, but this is a plausible connection to why it was a live issue again.\n\nIn Scotland, but not England, there were common\\-law offences of sedition and \"leasing\\-making\" covering the same sort of idea. They were abolished [in 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/13/part/2/crossheading/abolition-of-offences-of-sedition-and-leasingmaking) but were long obsolete. Hume (*Commentaries on the Law of Scotland*, 1797\\) distinguishes between them by saying that leasing\\-making is solely verbal, a species of slander, whereas sedition is words or deeds \"for the purpose of producing public trouble or commotion, and moving His Majesty's subjects to the dislike, resistance, or subversion of the established government and laws, or settled frame and order of things.\"\n\nIn any event, the political cartoon is *satire* and does not necessarily represent a legal reality. It is mocking Pitt's heavy\\-handedness in the Act of 1795, and perhaps challenging the authorities to define this very cartoon as criminal. Newton's mentor, William Holland, had been imprisoned for seditious libel for publishing Thomas Paine's *Letter Addressed to the Addressers, on the Late Proclamation*. The proclamation in question was [the one of 1792 against seditious writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_Against_Seditious_Writings_and_Publications), also the work of Pitt, and aimed at Paine's *Rights of Man*, a work advocating for (among other things) freedom of the press and abolition of the monarchy.

The cartoon was most likely a satirical exaggeration, aimed at criticizing the broad and repressive nature of recent legislation, particularly the Treason Act 1795. This act, while not explicitly making farting on a royal picture treasonous, did create a \"High Misdemeanour\" for expressing contempt for the monarch.

In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification.\n\nThis is amplified by [Recital 57](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-57/) which says:\n\n> If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation.

The controller finds that this combination of information matches two different user accounts in their system. What is the most appropriate action for the controller to take?\n\nA) Deny the request outright, as the provided information is insufficient to uniquely identify the data subject.\n\nB) Provide the personal data for both matching accounts to the requester.\n\nC) Ask the requester to provide additional information, such as the email address, to confirm their identity.\n\nD) Randomly choose one of the two matching accounts and provide that data to the requester.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to ask the requester for additional information to confirm their identity. This aligns with GDPR Article 12(6), which states that when a controller has reasonable doubts about the identity of a person making a request, they may ask for additional information to confirm the data subject's identity. \n\nOption A is incorrect because outright denial without attempting to verify identity further is not in line with the spirit of GDPR's data subject rights. \n\nOption B would be a security risk and potentially a data breach, as it would involve disclosing personal data to a potentially unauthorized individual. \n\nOption D is arbitrary and could lead to providing incorrect data, which violates GDPR principles.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows the controller to fulfill their obligation to verify the requester's identity while also potentially enabling the data subject to exercise their rights, as supported by GDPR Recital 57 and Article 11(2)."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46585/cross-examination-ethics", "docs_id": 46585, "title": "Cross examination ethics", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Due to an ongoing case, I was wondering the following.\n\nCan any complaint be made if a barrister suggests something plainly absurd (e.g. the witness made it up when there is CCTV evidence) and also how can anyone claiming to have any ethics lead with that sort of abusive question when he knows there isn't a cat in hell's chance for it to be true.\n\nI am aware of the belief that everyone deserves a fair trial which many lawyers put forward as the reason why they take such cases, bit distressing questioning based on what the lawyer knows to be a lie seems to be more a case of attempting to subvert a fair trial than give the defendant one.\n\nNote the second part is of course being asked within the bounds of 'professional\\-ethics; I have no doubt that the person indulging in this *especially when he knows for sure that it is not true* is acting in an evil manner.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no \"truth\" in court\n----------------------------\n\nThere are only facts that are either contested or uncontested.\n\nUncontested facts are those agreed to by the parties, usually well before the hearing. They might be used in cross\\-examination to point out testimony that is inconsistent with what the parties have agreed and so cast doubt on the credibility of the witness.\n\nContested facts are, by definition, not agreed upon. Assuming the CCTV footage is admitted as evidence, it may be contested who the people in the images actually are or when the footage was actually shot or that the footage has been subsequently edited \\- such contested facts are perfectly legitimate matters to seek evidence on. \n\nThe lawyer doesn't know the facts \\- they only know what they have been told. It's likely that they have been told many conflicting things. Ask any group of 6 people what was decided in a meeting that concluded 20 minutes ago and you are likely to get 7 different answers. It's not that people are liars (although they sometimes are) is just that memory is not a hard drive, immutable and unchanging. Every time you access your memory you change it, overlaying the circumstances of each recollection onto it. Now imagine that there is some strong incentive on you for your memory of an event 18 months ago to be a certain way \\- say not going to jail or a lawsuit worth millions of dollars \\- this colors your memory. People remember things the way they wish they were rather than the way they actually were \\- this is not intentional (mostly).\n\nThe purpose of testimony is for these conflicting things to be tested \\- to be presented to the trier of fact so that they can decide which witnesses they believe and which they don't and draw their own conclusions as to what the facts (legally) are which may and often does differ materially from what each witness believes the facts are or even what the facts objectively are (presuming there is such a thing as an objective fact \\- law is not science; its a lot closer to history as an academic discipline).\n\nLegal Limitations\n-----------------\n\nIn addition, there are strict limits on what is and is not allowed in cross\\-examination and the opposition council is very aware of what they are and will be very pro\\-active in requesting the judge enforce them by making an objection. A cross\\-examiner cannot lead (\"At 8 pm that day, you were at the deli, correct?\"), ask compound questions (\u201cDid you determine the time of death by interviewing witnesses and by requesting the autopsy report written by the coroner?\u201d), ask for a narrative, be argumentative (\u201cDid you stop at the stop sign on 5th and Main?\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cSo, to be clear, you ran the stop sign?\u201d) or be vague (\u201cWhen did you see it happen?\u201d). However, if opposing counsel doesn't object the witness must answer.\n\nTactical Limitations\n--------------------\n\nNobody likes a bully. Overly aggressive cross\\-examination can be counterproductive and endear the witness to the fact\\-finder and make you look like a d^\\&k.\n\nEthics\n------\n\nA lawers ethical duty is not to the facts or, heaven forbid some notion of \"truth\", it is to present their evidence and to test their opponent's evidence so that their client's narrative (a non\\-fiction narrative) prevails.\n\nIn a civil case, that means showing that your version of the events is more likely than your opponents (balance of probabilities). In a criminal case, it means that the prosecutor must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that *all* elements of the charge were perpetrated for a defendant \\- for a criminal defense lawyer, it means demonstrating that there is reasonable doubt in at least one of those elements.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that only contested matters go to trial \\- settlement, mediation, arbitration and plea bargains are far more common \\- and only the contested facts are the subject of cross\\-examination. Particularly in a civil trial, an agreed statement of facts is prepared to identify what's agreed and what's contested and evidence is only sought about the contested matters.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, what is the primary ethical duty of a lawyer in court?\n\nA) To uncover the objective truth of what happened\nB) To present their client's evidence and test the opponent's evidence\nC) To ensure all facts presented are verifiably true\nD) To aggressively cross-examine all witnesses\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The passage states that \"A lawyer's ethical duty is not to the facts or, heaven forbid some notion of 'truth', it is to present their evidence and to test their opponent's evidence so that their client's narrative (a non-fiction narrative) prevails.\" This directly corresponds to option B. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage emphasizes that there is no absolute \"truth\" in court, only contested and uncontested facts. \n\nOption C is wrong because lawyers work with the information they have, which may be conflicting, and their job is to present their client's case, not to verify all facts as true.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage actually warns against overly aggressive cross-examination, stating it can be counterproductive and make the lawyer appear unsympathetic."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72548/does-res-judicata-prevent-you-from-filing-separate-claims-for-different-causes-o", "docs_id": 72548, "title": "Does res judicata prevent you from filing separate claims for different causes of action with overlapping facts?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: (UK law, small claims.)\n\nThis is a follow\\-on question to one I asked earlier.\n\n[Splitting a claim into several small claims](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60843/splitting-a-claim-into-several-small-claims)\n\nA reply to my question stated:\n\n> You can only sue once on the same facts on the same defendant\n> The issue here is res judicata \\- once a case between 2 parties has been resolved, that matter can never be litigated again.

The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.\n\nA more recent statement of the law appears in *Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd* \\[2014] AC 160; [\\[2013] UKSC 46](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0013-judgment.pdf):\n\n> Res judicata is a portmanteau term which is used to describe a number of different legal principles with different juridical origins. As with other such expressions, the label tends to distract attention from the contents of the bottle \u2026 Fifth, there is the principle first formulated by Wigram V\\-C in *Henderson v Henderson*, which precludes a party from raising in subsequent proceedings matters which were not, but **could and should have been** raised in the earlier ones.\n\nThese principles apply when one claim is decided, and in subsequent proceedings, the plaintiff raises issues which \"could and should have been\" addressed in the first claim.\n\nConsolidating pending cases\n---------------------------\n\nYour question raises a slightly different situation, where two overlapping claims are brought at the same time.\n\nDoing this to avoid paying court fees is likely an [abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process).

To simplify matters, Fletcher came to possess a painting, (purportedly) believed that it was painted by Doig, and sought to sell it for a large amount of money. Doig stated that he did not paint the work. Doig acted to prevent the sale of the painting \u2013 that is against the law.

This aligns with option B, which correctly states that the original lawsuit sought declaratory judgment.\n\nThe outcome of the subsequent litigation is also correctly captured in option B.

One is \"are sidewalks on (state) universities public property\", and the other is \"when do I have to provide identification in a state with no stop and identify law\". I will focus on the second question. As it happens, property ownership is not relevant to that determination. The universal fact is that only a peace officer (variously identified) can force you to identify yourself, no matter where you are. In [Ohio](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2921.29), which has such a law, the law requires you to give name, DOB and address if they suspect you and you are in a public place. Being in Kroger is being in a public place, even though Kroger is private property. [Alabama](http://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2006/14214/15-5-30.html) likewise allows officers to stop and question a suspect in a public place. [Arizona](http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/02412.htm&Title=13&DocType=ARS) doesn't even limit the requirement to \"public places\". In [Illinois](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf), you will not be convicted of obstructing. That is because 725 ILCS 5/107\\-14 a peace officer \"may stop any person in a public place\" and \"may demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of his actions\". However, they forgot to include a part where the suspect has to answer in the statute. As far as I know, Washington state has no law allowing such questioning and again as far as I know you can refuse to respond. So: if you are a suspect, and the state has no stop and identify law, they cannot require you to identify yourself, and then in some states, you would even need to be in a public place.\n\nAnd then there is [Arkansas](http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-5/subtitle-6/chapter-71/subchapter-2/5-71-213), where it looks like failure to identify can be taken as evidence of loitering (one would have to read the Arkansas case law to see if it's really that bad).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a state university located in Illinois, a campus police officer stops a student on a university sidewalk, suspecting them of a crime.

According to the information provided, Illinois does not have a \"stop and identify\" law that requires individuals to provide identification to officers, even when suspected of a crime.\n\nC is incorrect. While the officer may have reasonable suspicion, this alone does not create a legal requirement for the student to identify themselves in Illinois.\n\nD is incorrect. In Illinois, refusing to identify oneself is not considered obstruction. The documentation states that in Illinois, \"you will not be convicted of obstructing\" for refusing to provide identification, as the statute doesn't include a requirement for suspects to answer officers' questions.\n\nThis question is challenging because it requires synthesizing information about state-specific laws, the distinction between public and private property, and the limits of police authority in different contexts."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36822/i-have-doubts-about-the-github-licensing-issue", "docs_id": 36822, "title": "I have doubts about the Github licensing issue", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I will go straight to the point, I already read the terms I looked for some information on the issue of licenses I looked at sites but nothing, I did not understand anything is that I have a project that is totally done by me, but I want anyone who dares to share or do something to dump the credits on me, what license do I use for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Given the broadest interpretation of your question, the MIT License is the simplest license that would meet your stated requirements.

That the money is not there now is not evidence that she didn\u2019t. it\u2019s evidence that something happened to it between then and now.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s not let the flawed example obscure the question. Let\u2019s pretend instead that Alice said the money was there now.\n\n[Misrepresentation](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/disputeresolution/document/393747/567M-26H1-F18B-71BK-00000-00/Actionable_misrepresentation_and_negligent_misstatement_overview)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPre\\-contractural false statements of fact by one party that induce the other to enter the contract give a cause of action in contract law; they are not a tort. There are torts that are similar like deceit and negligent misstatement.\n\nThe link provided is talking about fraud \\- the criminal equivalent of deceit (and the word fraud is often used when technically it\u2019s talking about the tort of deceit). The out\\-of\\-pocket rule applies to torts so Bob can recover his losses. Personal time invested is not an out\\-of\\-pocket loss as it represents an opportunity cost, so, Bob cannot recover what he or his excavator might have earned instead. He can recover his fuel costs and depreciation on the excavator as those are \u201creal\u201d out of pocket expenses. If Bob had been an employee of a plaintiff company, they could recover his wages but not what they might have sold his time for. That\u2019s just how it is with torts.\n\nMisrepresentation is a different beast. It\u2019s a contractural claim so the damages are the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d, in this case $500\\. However, this is only available if the misrepresentation was fraudulent (Alice knew the money wasn\u2019t there), Alice had no reasonable grounds for believing the statement to be true, or at the court\u2019s discretion. Further Bob must prove that it was this statement that caused him to enter the contract and that he would not have entered it otherwise.\n\nAlice\u2019s statement may give Bob more than one cause of action and it\u2019s up to him which he chooses to pursue. If he spent less than $500 on fuel he stands to get more with a misrepresentation claim but if his out of pockets are more than $500 he\u2019s better off with a negligent misstatement claim. In either case, these are tough causes to prove.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Bob, an excavator, enters into a contract with Alice to dig for $1000 allegedly buried at a specific location, with an agreement to split the money 50/50 if found. Bob spends a week digging but finds nothing. Alice claims she honestly believed the money was there. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's legal options?\n\nA) Bob can only pursue a tort claim for negligent misrepresentation and recover his out-of-pocket expenses like fuel costs and equipment depreciation.\n\nB) Bob's best option is to pursue a contract claim for misrepresentation, as he can recover the full $500 as \"benefit of the bargain\" damages.\n\nC) Bob has no valid legal claim since Alice's statement was not intentionally fraudulent.\n\nD) Bob can choose between pursuing a tort claim for negligent misstatement or a contract claim for misrepresentation, depending on which would result in higher damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because Bob has multiple potential causes of action available. He could pursue a tort claim for negligent misstatement, which would allow him to recover out-of-pocket expenses like fuel costs and equipment depreciation. Alternatively, he could pursue a contract claim for misrepresentation, which could potentially allow him to recover the \"benefit of the bargain\" ($500) if he can prove that Alice had no reasonable grounds for believing her statement was true or if the court exercises its discretion. The best choice depends on which would result in higher damages. Option A is incomplete as it doesn't consider the contract claim. Option B is incorrect because the \"benefit of the bargain\" damages are not guaranteed in all misrepresentation cases. Option C is incorrect because Alice's lack of fraudulent intent doesn't negate all potential claims."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35535/buying-a-house-in-a-partnership", "docs_id": 35535, "title": "Buying a house in a partnership", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am buying a house with a colleague in California. \n\nI am paying 80% and he is paying 20%.\n\nHe is going to live in the house, and pay rent for my 80% stakes in the house. \n\n1.

Yes such an arrangement can be made legally.\n2. Owners cannot be **evicted**. But a contract could provide for regular payments (rent) and that the right to use/occupy the property is contingent on those payments being made. It could even provide that if the payments are sufficiently behind, that a portion of that party's share would be forfeit to cover the amount due. It should probably not reduce the minor partner's equity by more than the amount of payments due. All this would need to be spelled out in detail in your contract.\n3. Property tax is a joint obligation of the owners. Your contract could specify who pays it or from what source it would be paid. One option would be for each party to pay into a fund (similar to an escrow account for a mortgage) from which the tax would be paid. Your contract should specify such an arrangement if it is wanted, and what happens if one party does not pay or is late. The government will not care about your agreement, they will want their tax money in full and on time, or they will charge penalties and/or seize the property, in accord with local law. Either owner could be liable for the full amount.\n4. Much the same applies to insurance, and to any utilities. All are joint obligations of the owners, and a contract may specify who is to pay and how, or how payment is to be divided, and what happens if someone does not pay as agreed.\n5. If you want the right to sell off parts of your share, your contract should cover this, and what notification , if any, is required. It may be that the law will require you to get your partner's consent, I am not sure. Will any new owner become a party to the contract? If so that probably needs the consent of existing parties but it may be possible to specify that such consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld\".\n\nI strongly suggest that you discuss with your partner in detail what options you both want, or are willing to agree to. Be sure that you have a \"meeting of the minds\". Having done that, take it to a local lawyer with knowledge of both real\\-estate law and partnership law, and ask that lawyer to draft a contract that implements your desires, as closely as the local law allows.

There is no contemplation that their presence will prevent the opponents from attacking in order to show mercy on their compatriots. Instead, the POWs are being used to deceive the enemy's automated systems that the attacking force is friendly despite the implausibility of that given their actions.\n\nIt is really more analogous to forcing a prisoner to write a misleading letter or make a misleading phone call, while under duress.\n\nWhile the use of fraud and deception in warfare may be dishonorable, usually actual war crimes involving POWs entail mistreatment of a POW or putting a POW in harm's way (even if presenting only a risk of death or injury).\n\nAlso, of course, much of the Geneva Convention's requirements regarding the treatment of POWs is a treaty imposed obligation, binding morally because both combatants at one point consented to it, rather than necessarily being a universal and mandatorily applicable component of customary international law. The fact that the Geneva Convention might be violated in some detail, if true, doesn't automatically make it a war crime in this context.\n\nIn the same vein, the Geneva Conventions make a distinction between the treatment of uniformed and non\\-uniformed combatants, but this distinction, established by a treaty agreed to by many nations, is not necessarily inherently relevant to determining if something is a war crime in a war with a non\\-signatory. It is a provision that relies of cultural meaning that is shared by the treaty signatories, but may not make sense vis\\-a\\-vis non\\-human sentient aliens.\n\nIn the same vein, one wouldn't think that in a war with intelligent dragons, the fact that the dragons were or were not wearing uniforms, when dragons customarily fight naked, was significant, unless the dragon nation agreed to the Geneva Conventions in a duly ratified treaty.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical interstellar conflict between humans and an alien species, humans capture alien combatants and use their bio-signatures to bypass the aliens' defense systems.

Adding a copyright notice doesn't grant permission to use the content.\n\nOption D, while potentially safer than A or C, still risks creating unauthorized derivative works based on Nintendo's intellectual property.\n\nOption B is the safest approach among these options, as it places the responsibility for content on the users and doesn't directly incorporate Nintendo's IP into the app itself. However, the app developer should still be cautious and consider implementing measures to address potential copyright issues with user-uploaded content."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76992/why-was-the-video-evidence-heavily-debated-in-the-kyle-rittenhouse-case", "docs_id": 76992, "title": "Why was the video evidence heavily debated in the Kyle Rittenhouse case?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: During the Kyle Rittenhouse Trail, on days 6 and 8, questions were raised about the program used to enhance the video evidence. The program, Amped FIVE, was used for the drone footage. To do this, Amped FIVE employs interpolation algorithms. Because of this, a dispute broke out between the prosecution and defense. These debates ranged from what is an interpolation, to whether the program added colors. James Armstrong, the senior forensic imaging specialist responsible for producing these enhanced videos, was brought in the courtroom to explain the process. What followed was truly interesting.\n\nMy main concern was with how the defense went about justifying why the drone footage should not have been used. I admit I do not understand court procedures and several things had me scratching my head. I would like to preface this by saying I understand it is the job of the defense to protect Kyle Rittenhouse. However, I felt did not make the best case.\n\nWhen questioned about the algorithm, on multiple occasions the defense would ask Mr. Armstrong how the interpolation worked. However, every time he was asked, he could only provide them with what kind of interpolation was used. He admitted that he did not understand how it was programmed. And why would he? Interpolation is an incredibly complex process that requires advanced mathematics and computer science. Not only that but, companies purposely do not disclose this information to prevent people from reverse\\-engineering their products. These questions could only be answered by a computer scientist or mathematician who worked on the program. So why wasn't one brought in? Also, because of his ignorance, wasn't a majority of the questioning a waste of time?\n\nAnother problem arose when the defense was trying to explain interpolation, they used an example that oversimplified the concept so much that it seemed to no longer make sense. The red, purple, and blue pixel example was very flawed in how it was presented. I believe the example wouldn't even work for the nearest neighbor because it would not have turned the pixels in the middle purple. Although this was a poor example, the judge used this as a basis for his understanding of interpolation which worked in the favor of the defense. Also, the defense kept trying to make Mr. Armstrong admit things he did not feel comfortable with because of his lack of knowledge. They asked the same question about adding colors repeatedly and he could never answer. And the language they use like \"add\" and \"manipulate\" implies that the enhanced footage was deceptively altered to give the prosecution an advantage. Because of this, they tried to argue that the video was unreliable. Ironically, the defense submitted evidence that was altered similarly.\n\nLastly, why was a peer\\-reviewed process using an industry\\-standard program not allowed to be used? I am aware that the judge said the burden of proof is on the prosecution but didn't they already prove that the footage was perfectly suitable for use in the trial? The prosecution asked Mr. Armstrong whether the procedures were acceptable for forensic imaging.\n\nI guess to sum everything up, why wasn't this handled better by both the defense and prosecution. I felt like the discussion went nowhere and all parties were incredibly ignorant.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The defense has an opportunity to question the witness the prosecution had called to provide foundation for the evidence, and in this case the defense's perspective is that the prosecution was trying to introduce evidence that they had improperly digitally manipulated. Part of their questioning was trying to figure out how the witness had manipulated the image prior to offering it as evidence. It's the prosecution's burden to prove that the evidence they are offering is accurate, the defense's purpose in asking the witness questions he could not answer is to try to prove to the judge that the prosecution has not laid proper foundation for the evidence because it has been manipulated from its original form in a way the prosecution cannot explain or justify as remaining fair and accurate to the events captured by the original footage.\n\nThis case in particular had a lot of video evidence, and most of these issues were handled in *motions in limine* before the trial started. However, the drone evidence in question was dropped at the prosecutor's office after the trial started, so the prosecution did not really have time to hire and *voir dire* an expert witness on Amped 5 (keeping in mind that the defense similarly had little time to review and account for the new evidence in the middle of trial). Since the defense in this case were cross\\-examining the witness, they have some leeway to present an argument with their questioning like they chose to do with the red/blue pixel drawings. As I recall the judge allowed the evidence as\\-is, so it does not appear that the defense's arguments were persuasive to the judge.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, the defense questioned the admissibility of enhanced drone footage.

By repeatedly asking questions that Armstrong couldn't answer due to his lack of in-depth technical knowledge, the defense aimed to challenge the foundation for admitting the enhanced footage as evidence. This approach was intended to cast doubt on whether the prosecution had adequately proven that the enhanced footage remained fair and accurate to the original. While the question states that the judge ultimately allowed the evidence, the defense's strategy was to challenge its admissibility by highlighting the limitations in the witness's understanding of the enhancement process."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94527/in-france-can-the-insurance-not-apply-if-my-motorcycle-has-racing-parts", "docs_id": 94527, "title": "In France, can the insurance not apply if my motorcycle has racing parts?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a motorcycle in France that is insured.

If he thinks the probate judges are bound to deny marriage certificates to same sex couples, why is he concurring to dismiss, instead of dissenting?

So what am I missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **One\\-side recording prohibited without knowledge or continuous consent of all parties**\n\nUnder CIPA, it is prohibited to record even merely your own side of any telephone conversation without first informing the informing whoever that is a party to the call \u2014 let alone both. (*Gruber v. Yelp Inc.*, 55 Cal.App.5th 591, 269 Cal. Rptr. 3d 790 (Cal. Ct. App. 2020\\))\n\nThis may include communications where the recording party is the only party communicating since being provided information in confidence, for purposes of the California Invasion of Privacy Act, is communication protected by CIPA. (The first hand dissemination is prevented by recording that one has been informed of certain information.)\n\nThis makes it pretty clear that recording the *other* party or parties communication is at least equally protected and hence prohibited without the other parties\u2019 knowledge.\n\nIn fact, \u201cfor purposes of section 632, the privacy rights affected are the same regardless whether a conversation is secretly recorded by a machine or monitored by a human being.\u201d (*Kight v. Cashcall, Inc.* (2012\\) 200 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1393\\)\n\nHowever, \"a conversation is confidential \\[only] if a party to that conversation has an objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded.\" (*Flanagan v. Flanagan*, (2002\\) 27 Cal.4th 766, 768\\)\n\n1. No reasonable person would believe they can get up\\-to\\-date daily information (for e.g. news queries to Alexa) without first sending the request to the Internet. (It is theoretically possible to just download the whole thing \u2014 the Internet as updated since yesterday \u2014 every morning, but as absurd as it sounds to read this, it would sound equally absurd from a sane person to assert they believed that\u2019s how Alexa worked)2 Consent is not the crux of the inquiry, but a requisite to the privacy protection: An objectively reasonable expectation of privacy that an averge person would deem reasonable.\n\nOne knowing that they will be or are being recorded rebut to them any expectation of privacy for purposes of CIPA, and an implied consent factual finding goes along with it if communication is not ceased \u2014 including verbal objections to the recording.\n\n1. And this is the key, one typically needs an account for an Alexa device to be set up:1 The devil hides the details \u2014 that\u2019s where you consented likely continuously, and acknowledged by agreement your understanding that the operation of the device requires one to be recorded along with that you will inform everyone getting near that thing.\n\nFurther,\n\n> when TechCrunch reached out to the major players in the smart\\[\\-]home space, only one device maker had a transparency report \\[on how many requests, subpoenas and search warrants they received, and how many of those they complied with,] and most \\[of these \u201cplayers\u201d] had no future plans to publish one \u2014 leaving consumers in the dark on how these companies protect your private information from overly broad demands.\u201d ([Judge orders Amazon to turn over Echo recordings, TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/amazon-echo-recordings-judge-murder-case/))\n\nAll this apart, inviting someone into your home unaware of Alexa ear\\-dropping is a CIPA violation, a matter of criminal law, by the person who knowingly allowed that to happen.\n\n1 \u201cWhen you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon's cloud, where we process your request and other information to respond to you.\u201d \u2014 [What happens when you speak to Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V) ([Wayback archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20221008041731/https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V))\n\n2 \u201cIs Alexa recording all my conversations?\u201d Yes. \\[\u2026] Audio is sent to and stored in the cloud unless the device fails to detect the wake word or is not activated by pressing a button.([https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId\\=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V))", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered a violation of privacy laws regarding the use of an Amazon Alexa device?\n\nA) A homeowner uses Alexa to check the weather forecast while their friend is visiting, without informing the friend about Alexa's presence.\n\nB) A user sets up an Alexa device after agreeing to Amazon's terms of service, which explain that voice recordings are sent to Amazon's cloud.\n\nC) An Alexa user asks for daily news updates, understanding that the request must be processed via the internet.\n\nD) A person speaks to Alexa after being informed by the device owner that their voice may be recorded.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A is the correct answer because it violates CIPA.

Even if the homeowner has consented to Alexa's recording through Amazon's terms of service, they have a responsibility to inform guests that their conversations may be recorded.\n\nOption B is not a violation because the user has agreed to Amazon's terms, which typically include consent for recording and processing voice commands.\n\nOption C is not a violation because the user has a reasonable expectation that their request will be processed online, implying consent for the necessary data transmission.\n\nOption D is not a violation because the person has been informed about the potential recording, thus eliminating any reasonable expectation of privacy in this context."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45616/is-there-a-database-containing-all-court-cases-publically-available-in-the-uk-an", "docs_id": 45616, "title": "Is there a database containing all court cases publically available in the UK and or US?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a Cyber Security student just starting on a course the depends heavily on the use of court cases that used electronically stored information to determine the verdict of a case. \n\nAre there a few database\\-like resources that would allow me to easily search for such cases? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **U.S. answer only.**\n\n> Are there a few database\\-like resources that would allow me to easily\n>  search for such cases?\n\nIt is balkanized.

In both cases, access to these filings is not free except to parties, and has lots of data with access restricted to parties and the court. Published appellate court decisions are also available at an Internet based source. None of these covers administrative law decisions in Colorado, however.\n\nAdministrative law decisions are usually kept by the agency and also often by a commercial firm that compiles them. Some of them do not give the public access to the decisions in the absence of a FOIA or open records act request.\n\nCommercial firms like Westlaw and LexisNexis and several less well known firms (including a free one run by Cornell University), keep databases of published decisions of appellate courts plus a somewhat random assortment of unpublished decisions, with federal court trial court decisions getting much more heavy coverage than state court trial decisions and unpublished state appellate court decisions. But, these are only key court orders, not all filings in the case, and are not the true source documents.\n\nThere is also a non\\-profit consortium that maintains a database of court records from the 75 most populous counties in the United States, and there is a private firm that keeps selective track of jury verdicts to the fullest extent that it can obtain them. \n\nSome credit reporting agencies (both consumer credit and business credit agencies) maintain databases of judgments and liens.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a Cyber Security student researching court cases involving electronically stored information, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the availability and accessibility of such cases in the United States?\n\nA) All federal and state court filings are available in a single, unified database that is freely accessible to the public.\n\nB) PACER contains almost all federal court filings, while each state has its own system for state court filings, with varying levels of accessibility and unification.\n\nC) LexisNexis and Westlaw provide comprehensive databases of all court filings, including administrative law decisions, for both federal and state cases.\n\nD) The Colorado E-Filing system contains all court filings for every type of court and administrative decision in Colorado, serving as a model for other states.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

I wouldn't even know what an answer to that question would look like.\n\nThere are many guiding principles of interpretation, the starting place of which is to attempt to implement the intent of the legislature (something known as the \"[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule_(law))\" of statutory interpretation in English common law) as expressed in the language of the statute to the extent that no other stronger interpretive principles apply.\n\nBut, basically, it is a problem to be worked out on a case by case basis in cases addressing alleged ambiguities in the meaning of a particular part of a particular statue. Most of the time, there is no ambiguity and so it isn't even recognized as an issue. What is ambiguous is frequently impossible to tell on the face of a statute until you are presented with facts in a case that create a context in which the meaning of a particular phrase or word or grammatical construction is unclear.\n\nStatutory interpretation is a bottom up process in a legal system like India's, not a top down process. Questions arise one case at a time and bubble to the top, the issues aren't foreseen and resolved in advance.\n\nSome of the other canons of interpretation which are buried in case law are to construe statutes in a way that makes them constitutional, to assume that there is not an intent to displace common law rules unless the text or comprehensive nature of a statute suggests otherwise, to give meaning of every part of the statute, to avoid absurd interpretations, and to consider legislative history when the proper interpretation is unclear.\n\nUltimately, statutory interpretation is not a mechanical problem like the order of operations in a mathematics equation.

One of the core tenets of these treaties, as stated in Article 15 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), is that \"Everyone has the right to a nationality\".\n\nIt is worth noting that the United States is not a party to either of these treaties, and further claims that Hoda Muthana was never a citizen as her father was a diplomat.

Why haven't these people been sued out of existence?\n\n(this does not affect me personally; I have been vaccinated and I am not sick)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Merely encouraging people not to vaccinate via educational and political communication without purporting to provide individualized medical advice is probably not the practice of medicine and protected by the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech, rather than constituting medical malpractice.\n\nAlso, many anti\\-vax individuals (I couldn't quote a percentage) do so out of religious conviction and are protected not just by the freedom of speech in the First Amendment, but also by the free exercise component of the freedom of religion under the First Amendment. Generally speaking, it is harder to find a legal grounds for disregarding the free exercise of religion than it is to find a legal basis to regulate otherwise free speech.\n\nFor example, commercial speech is subject to more rigorous regulation than private political and educational speech, which is why there are no private businesses taking anti\\-vax positions in their advertising.\n\nThe theory is that courts are not in a good position to make general determinations of the truth of policy positions or statements about general truths as opposed to what happened in a particular transaction or occurrence. This is in part because a ruling by the right court at the right time can preclude the correctness of its determination from being revisited indefinitely and from time to time, accepted conventional wisdom and scientific consensus at one time are revealed later on to have been wrong with more discussion and investigation. I think that this is unlikely to be the case in the vaccination area, but the whole point of the First Amendment's protection of these kinds of issues is that we can't know in advance what will continue to be widely accepted and what will turn out to be mistaken. \n\nBut, if someone in a medical diagnosis and treatment profession (e.g. M.D., D.O., physician's assistant, or nurse), were to advise a patient in a capacity as a medical care provider not to vaccinate, and as a result that person's child got sick from a disease that vaccination could have prevented, there probably would be medical malpractice liability.\n\nA somewhat similar issue arises when health insurance companies or government agencies set rules on providing care. In those cases, it isn't uncommon to have a physician or other medical professional placed on a committee or in an office such as medical director, with that person making the call and exposed to liability although not in the same way as a treating medical professional. A [case about a month ago](https://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/2019/03/these-practices-by-former-health.html) found malpractice by an insurance company's medical director (the company was United Health) to be a huge liability for both the medical director and the insurance company.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of anti-vaccination speech in the United States?\n\nA) Anti-vaccination speech is always considered medical malpractice and can be grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nB) Anti-vaccination speech is protected by the First Amendment, but only if it's motivated by religious beliefs.\n\nC) Anti-vaccination speech is generally protected by the First Amendment as political and educational communication, unless it constitutes individualized medical advice from a healthcare professional.\n\nD) Anti-vaccination speech is completely unrestricted and can never be grounds for legal action, regardless of the speaker's profession or context.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that general anti-vaccination speech is typically protected by the First Amendment as a form of political and educational communication. However, this protection does not extend to individualized medical advice from healthcare professionals. If a medical professional advises a patient against vaccination in their capacity as a care provider, and this results in harm, it could potentially lead to medical malpractice liability. \n\nOption A is incorrect because anti-vaccination speech is not always considered medical malpractice; it's generally protected speech unless it's individualized medical advice from a professional.\n\nOption B is partially correct but too limited. While religious motivations can provide additional protection, anti-vaccination speech is generally protected by free speech rights regardless of religious motivation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's too absolute.

Is that inference true ?\n\nIt seems to me (as said in the movie On the Basis of Sex) that a US court of appeals and the Supreme Court work like the french Court of Cassation, in that it only (re)judges questions of law, and not questions of facts.

If they are not, how could a poorly\\-defended case be prevented from setting a terrible jurisprudence precedent ? Final question, is there a difference between how these rules bind judges and justices (i.e in Courts of Appeals vs in the Supreme Court) ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: David Siegel's answer correctly explains how appellate courts consider laws and arguments not addressed in the courts below. To clarify on the comparison to the Court of Cassation, though:\n\nA trial court is generally limited to considering the facts that are properly introduced by the parties, though a court may also take \"judicial notice\" of certain facts that are highly unlikely to be disputed.\n\nOn review, courts of appeal are generally limited to facts supported by the evidence in the trial\\-court record, though they may also take judicial notice of other facts. A party is generally unable to introduce new evidence during an appeal.\n\nIt is not correct that an appellate court will not review factual determinations, as those reviews probably happen in more cases than not. But \\-\\- just as with legal determinations \\-\\- those reviews can happen with varying levels of deference.\n\nFor instance, if a case is tried to a jury, an appellate court will be exceedingly deferential to the jury's factual determinations, on the theory that the jury is best positioned to evaluate the evidence, gauge credibility, make reasonable inferences, etc. A judge who makes a factual determination based on in\\-court testimony will enjoy a similar measure of deference.\n\nBut if a court makes a factual determination based only on documents submitted in support of a motion, or otherwise lacks an opportunity to evaluate a witness in person, the appellate court will be more open to different interpretations of the evidence.\n\nLegal determinations are likewise subject to varying levels of deference.\n\nAt one end is the abuse\\-of\\-discretion standard. If a trial court determines that evidence is admissible or inadmissible, for instance, an appellate court will apply the abuse\\-of\\-discretion standard, which (to oversimplify) asks not whether the ruling was incorrect under the controlling law, but whether the ruling was reached without regard to the controlling law.\n\nOn the other end is *de novo* review, in which the appellate court gives virtually no deference to the trial court and undertakes its own independent legal analysis.\n\nPerhaps even more deferential is plain\\-error review, which asks (to oversimplify) whether the trial court's error is so apparent that it barely needs to be debated.

As the question noted, there are many IDEs and creating another one generally similar to those is not a violation of anyone's IP rights.\n\nThe \"look and feel\" of a piece of software has been held by US courts to be protected by copyright.\n\n*Broderbund Software. Inc., v. Unison World, Inc.*, 648 F. Supp. 1127 (N.D. Cal. 1986\\), was a relativcly early case in which the visual display elements of a software program were held to be protected by copyright. In the decision it is said that;\n\n> On the \u201cChoose a Font\u201d screen, no mechanical or practical factor compelled \\[defendant] to use those exact words (\u201cChoose a Font\u201d).

Softklone Distributing Corp.*, 659 F.Supp. 449 (N.D. Ga. 1987\\). In this case, the Defendant \"oftklone intentionally set out to \"clone\" or copy the functionality and interface of the popular program *Crosstalk XVI* (I was a user of thwt program many years ago). The court wrote:\n\n> In the instant case, however, the arrange\\- ment of the status screen involves consider\\- able stylistic creativity and authorship above and beyond the ideas embodied in the status screen. It cannot be said that the idea of the status screen, i.e., using two symbol commands to change the operations of the computer program and reflecting that fact on a screen listing the computer program\u2019s parameters/commands with their operative values, could not have been expressed in a large variety of ways. The defendants have never contended that they could not have arranged the parameters/commands in a wide variety of patterns without hampering the operation of their program.\n\nand found copyright infringement on that basis.\n\nSection 310 of [*Copyrightable Authorship:\nWhat Can Be Registered*](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf) by the US Copyright office, says:\n\n> The U.S. Copyright Office will not consider the so\\-called \u201clook and feel\u201d of a work.

The more one copies interface elements and choices from a specific source, the stronger the case for infringement is. Using elements and choices that have become common industry practice in multiple works froim multiple developers and companies is probably safe. Clearly and extensively imitating the visual appearance and interface of a single specific work of software might well be infringement.\n\nOne would be wise to consult a lawyer with experience in copyright law, and specifically \"look and feel\" issues, beforign publishing such a work of software.\n\nThis issue is discussed extensively in [*Look And Feel In Computer Software*](https://www.computerlaw.com/articles/look-and-feel-in-computer-software) (1993\\) by Jack Russo \\& Jamie Nafziger, published by Computerlaw Group LLP, which seems to be a law firm specializing in computer law.\n\n[*The Law of Look and Feel*](https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/90_529.pdf) by Peter Lee (Professor of Law and Chancellor\u2019s Fellow, University of California, Davis.) \\& Madhavi Sunder (Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of Law, University of California, Davis.) is a 60\\-page law review article dealing with this topic. There is far more detail in these publications (and many others to be found on the net) than I can summarize in an SE answer.\n\nConfigurable Interfaces\n-----------------------\n\nThe question asks whether the use of a configurable interface which could, but does not by default, imitate an existing interface would be infringement.\n\nI have not been able to find any case on point, or any discussion in a reliable source of this issue. Therefore, I am going to speculate.\n\nIf there is a single choice between overall \"themes\" or \"shells\" and one of them imitates the interface from a protected program without permission, that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped with that interface. It might or might not be infringement, depending on the details, as discussed above.\n\nIf there are many settings, but the program is shipped with instructions advising a combination of settings that imitate another interface (or the developer or distributor provides such advice to users), that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration. If the developer provides a few preset configuration files which control these interface settings, and one such file results in settings that imitate another interface, that would also probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration.\n\nIf there are many settings and there is no particular guidance or advice to a user on what combination to use, nor any predefined settings file, but users must discover (if they choose) a group of settings which imitate another interface, that is probably not infringement.\n\nI repeat that this section of the answer is based on general principals, but not on specific case law, nor on specific legal scholarship, and a court faced with this issue might rule otherwise.

Two years later, they receive a traffic violation resulting in 2 demerit points. Assuming no other violations, what will be the net effect on their driving record at this point?\n\nA) They will have 1 point credited to their record\nB) They will have 2 demerit points on their record\nC) They will have 3 points credited to their record\nD) Their record will show 0 points (neutral)\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The 3-point credit from the defensive driving course is only valid for a 2-year period. After 2 years, this credit expires and is removed from the driving record. When the driver receives 2 demerit points for the traffic violation after the 2-year period, these points are added to a now-neutral record. Therefore, the net effect is 2 demerit points on their record.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the 3-point credit has expired.\nOption C is incorrect because the credit has expired and new demerit points have been added.\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the new demerit points.\n\nThis question tests understanding of both the temporary nature of the defensive driving course credit and the timing of demerit point application, making it a challenging question for examinees."}}
