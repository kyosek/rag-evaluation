My na\u00efve distinction between *not authorizing* and *forbidding* federal direction is starting to feel shaky.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, ...\n--------\n\nCongress does not have to repeal a law when they pass a new law that contradicts it. Courts assume (without evidence) that Congress is sane and sensible and that if they say something now that contradicts what they said before that what they want now is what they are saying now. So to the extent that a newer law contradicts an older law, the newer law wins to the extent of the contradiction.\n\nHowever, it's good legislative practice to repeal or modify older laws so that the code of law is internally consistent on its face without having to work out which law came later.\n\n... but ...\n-----------\n\nCongress probably doesn't have to power to impose a national curriculum.\n\nThe Federal government only has three sources of power \\- 2 come from the Constitution and the third comes from being a nation\\-state. It can only legislate/regulate within its powers. If it has the power and it makes a law that conflicts with a state's law \\- too bad for the state. However, if it doesn't have the power then only the states can make laws on that issue.\n\nThe three sources of power are:\n\n1. [The enumerated powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_powers_(United_States)): The powers that the Constitution explicitly grants to the Federal government. Education isn't one of them.\n2. The implied powers: The Constitution gives the power \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" This means that if in order to do something it can do, there is something that is necessary but not a power explicitly granted, then it can do that necessary thing. How broad this power is, depends on the current fashions in the Supreme Court. Setting curricula for primary and secondary education doesn't seem to be strictly necessary.\n3. Inherent powers: These are powers that are fundamental to being a nation\\-state that the founders didn't think it necessary to put in the Constitution.

Given the existing legal framework, including Section 2302 of the Every Student Succeeds Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 6692), which of the following statements most accurately describes the potential legal implications of such legislation?\n\nA) The legislation would be immediately invalidated due to a direct conflict with Section 2302, which explicitly forbids federally determined curricula.\n\nB) The legislation could be enacted without conflict, as Section 2302 only states that it doesn't authorize federal control, rather than prohibiting it outright.\n\nC) The legislation would likely face constitutional challenges based on the limits of federal power in education, rather than a direct conflict with Section 2302.\n\nD) The legislation would require a simultaneous repeal of Section 2302 to be legally valid and avoid contradictions in federal law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Section 2302 (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 6692) doesn't explicitly forbid federally determined curricula; it only states that the subchapter doesn't authorize federal mandates, direction, or control. This makes option A incorrect.\n\n2. While B seems plausible based on a narrow reading of Section 2302, it overlooks the broader constitutional issues at play.\n\n3. The key issue isn't a direct conflict with Section 2302, but rather the constitutional limits of federal power in education. As explained in the documentation, education is not an enumerated power of the federal government in the Constitution, nor is it clearly an implied or inherent power.\n\n4. Option D is incorrect because Congress can pass new laws that contradict older ones without explicitly repealing them. Courts generally interpret newer laws as taking precedence over older ones to the extent they conflict.\n\n5. The most likely scenario is that such legislation would face constitutional challenges based on the limits of federal power in education. This would involve complex legal arguments about the scope of federal authority under the Constitution, rather than a simple statutory conflict.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a hypothetical scenario, and understand the nuances of statutory interpretation and constitutional law."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89897/even-when-english-law-lets-suspects-to-remain-silent-when-ought-suspect-choose", "docs_id": 89897, "title": "Even when English law lets suspects to remain silent, when ought Suspect choose to talk to the police without a lawyer?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Presuppose that at the time of stating something to the police, no lawyer represents Suspect, and English law lets suspects exercise the qualified right to silence.

If you stay there over the objections of the owner or the owner's agent, you are trespassing.\n\nThe law applicable to government property owners and private property owners is basically the same in this regard.\n\nRealistically, on government property, furthermore, the standard by which the government employee may legally terminate your license to be there and exclude you from the property is low.\n\nBasically, it must merely not violate any constitutional right you may have, and you do not have a constitutional right to be present on government owned property, except in a quite narrow subset of cases (e.g. the \"town square\").\n\nMore exactly, you do not have a right to be on government property *per se*, but you can't be excluded from it for a constitutionally impermissible reason. The government gets to decide what parts of property it owns are available to the general public and for what content\\-neutral purposes.\n\nThus, the right to be present on government owned \"public\" property (which doesn't include private areas of government owned property) can be subjected to reasonable and content\\-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions.\n\nFor example, a town could legally decide that the town square is closed from midnight to eight a.m. every day.\n\nThe quoted material from the case *Chicago v. Morales*, 527 U.S. 41, 53\\-54 (1999\\) cited in the [answer by bdb484](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/90245) is narrower than a plain reading out of context would suggest. In that quotation, the term \"public place\" is being used in a sense much more restrictive than in the broader sense of property that is merely government owned. It is referring to places where the government has expressly or implicitly allowed members of the general public to be present on land that it owns (as opposed, for example, to a government office area of a building, or a maintenance facility in a government owned park, or a conservation area in a government owned park). This narrow sense of the word resolves what would otherwise seem to be a contradiction in the law.\n\nBut, the government has the authority to make something that once was a public place into a non\\-public place going forward.\n\nFor example, historically, the Civic Center park in front of the capitol in Denver, Colorado has been a public place. But, the government can and did close it off to the public for many months for maintenance and out of public health concerns when heavy use of it by homeless people and drug dealers caused the premises to be seriously damaged and created a public health risk from it being used to dispose of dirty, used, injection\\-drug syringes, and for people to defecate.\n\n**A Hypothetical**\n\nSuppose that Chris is the sole librarian in one of the towns of [College Corner](http://www.lyndonirwin.com/ccorner.htm), which is on the Ohio\\-Indiana border, which are in different time zones. In that capacity, Chris has the authority to set library policies including the hours of the library and the rules for its use without the approval of anyone else.\n\nChris has a hot date at 5:30 p.m. But, at lunch time, Chris learned that the hot date was at 5:30 p.m. in Ohio and not an hour later at 5:30 p.m. in Indiana, but the library's official closing time is 5 p.m. in Indiana, because Ohio was observing daylight savings time, but Indian was not, at the time when this happened.\n\nChris, as the sole government official in charge of the library, decides to close the library before its posted closing time at 4:00 p.m. Indiana time (5 p.m. Ohio time) in order to be able to make it to the hot date.\n\nChris quietly asks everyone left in the library to leave at 4 p.m. Indiana time, and everyone but you does. But you, who are homeless, really want to stay the extra hour before getting out in the cold and finding a bridge to sleep under, so you refuse to leave saying that the library is still open until 5 p.m. Indiana time, as stated in its posted hours.\n\nChris orders you to leave and warns you that he is calling the police to remove you if you don't do so voluntarily. The police arrive and restate the complaint of Chris. The police arrest you for trespassing and you are charged with this crime in the appropriate court by the appropriate prosecuting attorney.\n\nYou had done nothing wrong whatsoever prior to being asked to leave and refusing to do so. But, Chris has not violated your constitutional rights by ordering you removed for some unconstitutional reason. Chris then goes on the hot date; it is love at first sight, and Chris gets married the next week. As an apology for putting you out for the sole convenience of Chris, Chris invites you to the wedding.\n\nDo you have a valid defense to the criminal trespassing charge on the grounds that the librarian's actions were unconstitutional? No. You might have a \"good faith claim of right\" defense, however, to the criminal charges.\n\nDo you have a valid claim for money damages for a violation of your constitutional rights? No.\n\nIndeed, ordering you removed for \"no reason\" that has anything to do with your conduct, as in this case, is probably more likely to be legal and constitutional, than having you removed for \"some reason\" other than just \"because I the librarian say so\" that doesn't involve wrongdoing on your part.\n\n*A Variation In The Hypothetical*\n\nIf instead, your were being ordered to leave the library because you were wearing an National Rifle Association cap (and the library didn't prohibit wearing caps), this affirmative reason, which is contrary to the First Amendment freedom of expression, would be a violation of your constitutional rights, which would definitely be a basis for a civil lawsuit against the librarian and police involved in you being arrested.\n\nI don't know the details of constitutional defenses in criminal law well enough to know if the violation of your constitutional rights would be a valid defense to the criminal trespassing charge (or a failure to obey a police officer's order to leave charge) resulting from you failing to leave in that circumstance, and I can see legitimate arguments both ways.

As long as the reason for asking someone to leave is not constitutionally impermissible (e.g., based on protected characteristics or violating freedom of expression), the request is legally valid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no absolute constitutional right to remain in a public library against the wishes of its staff. Option B is wrong because the employee is not required to provide a reason for asking someone to leave.

A prosecutor can't bring a case unless he knows who did it. And, the police may be wise not to try to investigate a crime that previous experience has proven to them is a dead end most of the time for a crime of modest economic value.\n\nMost cases of simple larceny are never solved. And, institutionally, the police have to balance the cost of investigating the crime against the seriousness of the crime. Murders and kidnappings are almost always going to take priority for police resources over stolen phones, particularly if investigating the phone theft may require international cooperation that makes the investigation more costly.\n\nA key point is that the mere fact that a phone is pawned doesn't mean that the person pawning it is necessarily committing a crime, so even if you find out where the phone is in some pawn shop (possibly in Albania or Turkey, by now), that doesn't mean that the job is over. That person could have bought it innocently and at fair market value from a flea market, from someone who could have gotten it from someone who received it innocently as a gift, from a friend of a criminal fence, who may have bought it not innocently from a true thief. In fact, because criminals respond to incentives like anyone else, it is far more likely that the phone was swiftly \"laundered\" along the lines I suggest in this example, than it is that it is still in the possession of someone close to the thief.\n\nBut, only the fence and the thief would have criminal liability. \n\nIt is a lot harder to solve the crime of a stolen cell phone than you would think, and the agency may simply not be able to justify the resources it would take to investigate that case properly to a situation where someone had a phone stole that was worth maybe 400 Euros in used condition.\n\nThe more you can do to solve the crime, the more likely it is that they will find that it is worth further investigating until a thief can be identified and apprehended.

In California, [Penal Code sect. 518](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=518-527) defines extortion:\n\n> Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent,\n>  or the obtaining of an official act of a public officer, induced by a\n>  wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right.\n\nThe statutes do not clarify what \"wrongfully\" means, and the Calcrim jury instructions are also no help. I presume that this distinguishes the case where you create fear in the perpetrator and solicit payment for silence, versus the perpetrator becomes fearful on his own and offers money to \"compensate\" you (which is legal). So then sect. 519, states what can induce fear: \n\n> Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat of\n>  any of the following:\n> \n> \n> ...\n>  2\\. To accuse the individual threatened, or a relative of his or her, or a member of his or her family, of a crime.\n> \n> \n> 3. To expose, or to impute to him, her, or them a deformity, disgrace, or crime.\n\nYou would be threatening cause of fear number 2 (and 3\\). Then the question arises, were you successful? Note that extortion is defined in terms of *obtaining* property. If you actually obtain the property, that violates section 520:\n\n> Every person who extorts any money or other property from another,\n>  under circumstances not amounting to robbery or carjacking, by means\n>  of force, or any threat, such as is mentioned in Section 519, shall be\n>  punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170\n>  for two, three or four years.\n\nIf you only make the threat, and the threat is written, then per sect. 523, the same punishment results:\n\n> Every person who, with intent to extort any money or other property\n>  from another, sends or delivers to any person any letter or other\n>  writing, whether subscribed or not, expressing or implying, or adapted\n>  to imply, any threat such as is specified in Section 519, is\n>  punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were\n>  actually obtained by means of such threat.\n\nBut otherwise (if you do not obtain the property, and the threat is not written), per sect 524 there is a lesser penalty:\n\n> Every person who attempts, by means of any threat, such as is\n>  specified in Section 519 of this code, to extort money or other\n>  property from another is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail\n>  not longer than one year or in the state prison or by fine not\n>  exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000\\), or by both such fine and\n>  imprisonment.\n\nThere is no law prohibiting you from telling a person that they must return the money they scammed from you, and there is no law requiring you to report an attempt to scam.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Reporting the crime to law enforcement is the proper legal channel for addressing fraud, and doesn't risk the client committing extortion.\n2.

While option B suggests obtaining a patent, which could potentially protect certain aspects of the app if it meets patentability criteria, this is not directly addressed in the given information and may be premature without a functional prototype.\n\n3. Option C, releasing the video publicly with legal disclaimers, does not effectively protect the idea, as the documentation clearly states that ideas are not protected regardless of how they are described or illustrated.\n\n4. Option D provides the best balance of protection and marketing potential.

The key points from the documentation are:\n\n1. Article 15 of the Indian Constitution prohibits discrimination based on religion, but this applies only to the State (government entities).\n2. India lacks a comprehensive law outlawing religious discrimination by private parties.\n3.

This is because the judiciary, which is one of the branches of government with the power to interpret laws, plays a key role in determining the meaning and application of laws in practice.\n\nThe separation of powers doctrine aims to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful by dividing power among different branches.

This means that the judiciary has a degree of discretion in interpreting laws, and laws may be written in a more general and flexible way to allow for this.\n\nAdditionally, laws in these countries are often written to be applicable to a wide range of situations and cases. This is because it is difficult to predict all of the different ways that a law may be applied, and to anticipate all of the specific circumstances that may arise. Therefore, laws are often written in a more general way so that they can be applied in a variety of situations.\n\nIn short, laws in countries with separation of power may be more vague because they are written to allow for flexibility and adaptability in their interpretation and application, and to be applicable in a wide range of situations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A newly democratic country is drafting its constitution and considering adopting a strict separation of powers doctrine.

Furthermore, would Pence have the standing to participate in debates as both the VP candidate against Harris and as the presidential candidate against Biden?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a single \"candidacy\". Each of the 50 states and DC holds an election for a slate of electors, and those electors later participate in the actual election for President and Vice President in the Electoral College.\n\nFor each state's election for electors, the ballot usually prints the name of the \"candidate\" for President and Vice President submitted by the party. The rules on under what circumstances the names on the ballot can be changed varies by state, and it may also depend on how close to election date it is, as it may be infeasible to change it once ballots have started being printed.\n\nHowever, even if a state's ballots print the name of certain candidates for President and VP in the election for the slate of electors, that does not necessarily mean that those electors, once chosen, will necessarily have to vote for those candidates. So if a party's candidate withdraws too close to the election for the ballots to be changed, or withdraws after the election but before the Electoral College votes, the party's leadership will probably instruct all of the electors of that party (i.e. electors in the states that that party's candidate for President won in) to vote for a new ticket of President and VP in the Electoral College.\n\nWhether the electors will or can follow those instructions is a little tricky. Some states have laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the Presidential and VP candidates that won in that state, and I am not sure whether the parties can change the Presidential and VP candidates after the election. This would vary by state. In some states, the pledge requirement has no penalty for violation; in some states, there is a fine; and in some states, the state will replace an elector who does not vote for the pledged candidate. (And the Supreme Court ruled in *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020\\) that it is legal for states to fine and/or replace faithless electors.)

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the complexity of the legal situation. \n\nThe concept of \"invitation to treat\" mentioned in the documentation suggests that displaying a price is typically not considered a binding offer.

All three of the possibilities that you suggest (and more) are the right answer in some circumstances.\n\n**Choice of law by agreement**\n\nUnless the choice of law for some reason violates public policy (e.g. because the law of country A does not make something illegal, but the law of country B where the contract is to be performed does make something illegal) a [choice of law made within a clause an international contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_of_law_clause) that has any connection to the parties or the contract will be honored (which is your possibility number 2\\).\n\n**General choice of law rules when there isn't a contractual choice of law**\n\nBefore you have a contract, the issues of contract formation, and other contract law issues to the extent that there is no choice of law clause in the contract that does not violate public policy, could be governed by the law of the place where the contract is signed, by the law of A or B since they are parties to the contract, or, for example, by the law of the place where the contract is to be performed.\n\nThe leading choice of law rule in the United States in these circumstances is to apply the law of the one of those options with the most significant relationship to the contract, which is a test that is just as fuzzy and indeterminate and open to case by case interpretation as it seems.\n\nAlso, there isn't necessarily only one set of laws that will apply to the contract. The legal term for applying different laws to different issues that arise in the same legal case is called [d\u00e9pe\u00e7age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9pe%C3%A7age).\n\nFor example, the law of the place where the contract is signed might govern the issue of contract formation, while the law of the place where the contract is to be performed might govern performance of the contract.\n\nConsumer protection laws are often applied to contracts with consumers based upon the place where the consumer is domiciled or is located when the contract is entered into by the parties.\n\nIt isn't unusual for a contract to be subject to the law of more than one place on issues other than issues of contract formation, and other than on issues of contract interpretation. But, any given legal issue related to a contract is ordinarily subject to only a single jurisdictions laws (unless it is a public policy regulation).\n\nUnless anyone argues in court that the law from another place should apply to an issue and that law is different from the legal rule in the place where the court is located, in a court case, a court will apply the law of the place where the court is located (called the \"law of the forum.\"\n\n**Exceptions to the general rule**\n\nThere are some international treaties which create exceptions to the general rule and instead provide that a contract will be governed by law established in an international treaty (which is your possibility three). There are at least two such treaties to which the United States is a party which are notable and come up with some frequency.\n\nOne of them is the CISG, which is the [Convention on the International Sale of Goods](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/salegoods) that governs international contracts for the sale of goods that are not expressly excepted from the treaty (mostly business to business sales of goods), when both the seller and the buyer are associated with a country that is a party to the treaty.\n\nAnother is the [New York Convention](https://player.siriusxm.com/#/main) a.k.a. the \"Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards\" a.k.a. the \"New York Arbitration Convention\" which governs governs contracts with arbitration clauses in them that involve parties from different countries that are both parties to the Convention.\n\nIn addition to these treaty provisions, some international contracts are governed in the United States by [admiralty law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_law), rather than by the federal and state laws that would otherwise apply to these contracts. Obviously, the affected contracts are contracts with a maritime dimension, either in international waters or in the \"navigable waters of the United States.\"\n\nI am certain that this list of exceptions governed by special laws is not complete (e.g. certain international treaties apply to contracts involving international airline travel), but the question doesn't identify anything about the contracts that make them stand out.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about international contract law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A technology company based in the United States and a manufacturing firm in Japan are negotiating a contract for the production of specialized computer components.

This fee is not a consequence for any of my misbehavior, is not mentioned in my contract, and they are not allowing anyone to opt out of using the online system to avoid the fee. To me this seems unfair and possibly mildly illegal, since I did not consent to this in any way. **Is my landlord within their rights to do this?** \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a landlord and not a lawyer. For this reason, I have not done any legal research, however, given my experience, I will answer with a short:\n\n**No. Your landlord likely cannot do this.**\n\nHere is my reasoning behind this.\n\nEach state law is different or course. I am answering as a licensed and bonded landlord and property manager in Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n\nWhether you have signed a lease with the landlord or not, you are under a lease provided by the state as state law where no lease was provided. This is for your protection. You will have to read the lease carefully. You will find your lease has terms which includes your monthly rent and any fees governing late fees and any other fee typically covering pets, additional persons not on the lease, parking, etc. No lease can contain an open clause that allows the landlord to simply add fees at will. This would not be enforceable under contract law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, no additional burden can be added within the term of the lease and in many cases requires notice even for month to month leases. For example, if you have a 1 year lease, the terms of the lease cannot be changed until the lease term has expired 1 year after signing and even then may require 30 day notice under the law.\n\nIn other words, if it is not in the lease or in the law, the landlord cannot change the terms of the lease to create an additional burden. It is a contract and falls under contract law, landlord tenant law, and possibly other laws.\n\nWhile I understand the desire to have electronic payment, an additional fee is unnecessary and the requirement not likely legal. For example, not everyone is able to or can afford to make online payments. It requires a computer, computer skills, an Internet connection, etc. Even without these things, it could require making a payment using a computer at the library or at a payment center. Not everyone is able to travel at will such as the elderly or poor. Additionally, this likely requires a bank account. Many do not have bank accounts and make payments using a card such as one provided for social security or disability payments. Often, these folks have little options except to use cash, money orders, or cashiers check. Simply requiring an electronic payment, even if specified within the lease, can be a burden that is not enforceable or wise.\n\nAlso consider State and Federal Law. It may likely be illegal to refuse cash payments or payments via money orders or cashiers checks. While some businesses can require payments other than cash, many businesses cannot refuse cash payments. It has been a long while since I researched this, however, as an example, a retail business likely cannot refuse cash.\n\nAlso consider that electronic payments of one type may not be legal. For example, while it is wise to require a variety of electronic payment options, requiring only one payment method may require a burden that cannot be enforced. It is possible that some states require that if an electronic payment is to be required, then a variety of payment methods will be required. Some may require accepting payments from payment centers which can be a store or bank.\n\nOne last consideration. Some states define commercial rental businesses as being more than *X* units and have different laws that govern how they can operate. These are often significant. It is possible that if your landlord is a commercial rental business, they are required to take cash, checks, money orders, cashiers checks, etc., and require an office with standard office hours for such things.\n\nFurther research on this may be required and would be wise.\n\nAs a personal opinion, electronic payments are not always as easy to track or as convenient as your landlord thinks. I used to make and take electronic payments and have stopped simply because it is a pain. Each payment method has its rules and laws that are harder to keep track of.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The fee is likely legal if the landlord provides a 30-day notice before implementation\nB) The landlord can impose the fee if it's applied equally to all tenants\nC) The fee is probably illegal as it represents a unilateral change to the lease terms\nD) The fee is permissible if the landlord offers an alternative free payment method\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided information. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"No lease can contain an open clause that allows the landlord to simply add fees at will. This would not be enforceable under contract law.\"\n\n2. It's mentioned that \"Unless otherwise stated, no additional burden can be added within the term of the lease.\" The $20 fee represents an additional financial burden not originally agreed upon.\n\n3. The answer emphasizes that this is likely illegal, aligning with the expert's statement: \"No. Your landlord likely cannot do this.\"\n\n4. This situation represents a unilateral change to the lease terms, which goes against contract law principles discussed in the documentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even with notice, adding fees not specified in the original lease is generally not allowed during the lease term. \n\nOption B is a distractor based on the misconception that equal application makes a policy legal; however, the legality is based on the lease terms and contract law, not equal application.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while offering alternative payment methods is advisable, it doesn't make the imposition of a new fee legal if it wasn't in the original lease.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple legal concepts and application to a real-world scenario, going beyond simple recall of facts."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24000/interpretation-of-this-purpose-clause-in-an-nda", "docs_id": 24000, "title": "Interpretation of this Purpose clause in an NDA", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a contractor and have come to familiarise myself with the standard wording that comes with most NDAs.

After three months, the passenger still hasn't received the compensation. What is the most appropriate course of action based on the regulation?\n\nA) Wait patiently, as the regulation doesn't specify a time limit for compensation payment\nB) File a complaint with the national enforcement body, as the airline has exceeded the 7-day payment deadline\nC) Accept the alternative flight as sufficient compensation and withdraw the claim\nD) Threaten legal action against the airline for violating the 30-day response time guideline\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests the application of EC 261 regulation in a real-world scenario, requiring analysis of multiple aspects of the regulation.

It isn't 100% risk free, however.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nAll of the questions in this answer are governed entirely by federal law. Both basic copyright law, found in Title 17 of the United States Code, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (which amended Title 17 of the United States Code in part, and also added 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001 related to movie licensing) are federal statutes that do not have parallel state law counterparts.\n\nCopyright cases are in the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts when they arise in the United States. *See* 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (\"\\[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to ... copyrights .... Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in ... copyright cases.\").\n\n### This isn't a DMCA case\n\nThis strategy doesn't really utilize Section 230 of the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) (DMCA), however, which protects online hosts of sites from liability for user generated content, if the host honors DMCA takedown notices (subject to an exception for human trafficking content). DMCA takedown notices aren't strictly speaking applicable in this fact pattern.\n\nWhen Bob is the website's author, his content isn't user generated content from which he is protected from liability by Section 230\\. His Internet Service Provider is protected from liability for his content, but Bob isn't protected from liability for his content, because he isn't a third\\-party user of his own website.\n\n### The Basic Copyright Law Analysis\n\nOnce you understand that nuance that this isn't a DMCA question, the question collapses into a simple copyright infringement issue.\n\nThe bottom line in this copyright analysis is that if you take a snipper of material from a copyrighted source and link to the source copyrighted material, are you not likely to face copyright liability.\n\n**Links Are Basically Liability Risk Free**\n\nThe link itself, pretty much categorically, and without lots of additional relevant facts (basically some sort of conspiracy behind the scenes that can't be discerned from looking at the work itself), [will never give rise to copyright infringement liability](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/linking-copyrighted-materials).\n\n**Snippets Are Copyright Infringements That Fair Use Usually Excuses**\n\nSo, the remaining issue is whether a snippet of a copyrighted work flagged for educational purposes, creates risk of copyright infringement liability.\n\nThere is always some risk any time you publish a copy, no matter how small, of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nThe snippet is undeniably a publication of a copy of copyrighted work (by virtue of the premise of the question). This is a prima facie case of copyright infringement and your inclusion of a link to the source makes it fairly likely that your publication of this copy will be discovered by the copyright owner. So, this is a copyright infringement that gives rise to copyright liability unless this liability for copyright infringement can be overcome or excused by [the affirmative defense to copyright liability of fair use](https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use).\n\nThe risk that the snippet will not be considered fair use, and therefore will be found to be a copyright infringement giving rise to copyright liability is relatively higher if the snippet is a photograph or a sound recording than it is if it is merely quoted words from the source.\n\nBut, usually, a reasonably small snippet of a copyrighted work published for educational purposes will come within the fair use defense, even though that really needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\n### Practical Context And Analysis\n\nThe fact that this mode of expression, with a snipped and a link on a blog for educational purposes is pervasive on the Internet, as a practical matter, means that generally speaking, this will be considered fair use.\n\nUsually, this strategy will prevent someone who uses it from facing litigation for copyright infringement, even though, in theory, the determination is highly fact and context specific.\n\nIt isn't a guarantee of no liability, but it is low risk.\n\nMost marginal cases where someone arguably slightly exceeds fair use are resolved with a cease and desist letter (with which Bob should comply even if he thinks his use is fair use), rather than litigation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that integrates multiple concepts and tests critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: Bob runs a popular tech blog where he shares tutorials and product reviews. He wants to enhance his credibility by quoting instructions from product manuals and linking to official websites. Which of the following strategies would best minimize Bob's legal risk while still achieving his goals?\n\nA) Quote entire sections of manuals verbatim and rely solely on DMCA takedown compliance for protection\nB) Use short, relevant snippets from manuals, provide links to official sources, and include a disclaimer about copyright ownership\nC) Paraphrase all manual content without direct quotes and avoid linking to official sources to prevent copyright issues\nD) Only use product information from third-party review sites to avoid any potential copyright claims from manufacturers\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of multiple legal concepts in a real-world scenario. The correct answer, B, represents the best balance of minimizing legal risk while achieving Bob's goals. Here's why:\n\n1. Using short snippets falls under the fair use doctrine, which is likely to protect Bob from copyright infringement claims, especially when used for educational purposes.\n2. Providing links to official sources is generally risk-free from a copyright perspective and adds credibility.\n3. Including a disclaimer about copyright ownership shows good faith and clarifies that Bob doesn't claim ownership of the quoted material.\n\nOption A is incorrect because quoting entire sections verbatim is more likely to exceed fair use, and relying solely on DMCA takedown compliance doesn't prevent initial infringement.\n\nOption C is overly cautious and defeats the purpose of using authoritative sources to build credibility. It also doesn't completely eliminate copyright risks, as paraphrasing can still be considered derivative work.\n\nOption D avoids direct copyright issues with manufacturers but doesn't achieve Bob's goal of using official sources for credibility and may introduce other potential legal issues with third-party content.\n\nThis question requires analyzing the balance between copyright law, fair use doctrine, and practical risk management in content creation, testing the ability to apply legal concepts to a complex, real-world situation."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/745/youtube-ad-revenue-guitar-tutorial-video-can-i-make-ad-revenue-from-teaching", "docs_id": 745, "title": "Youtube Ad Revenue + Guitar tutorial video - Can I make ad revenue from teaching copyrighted guitar songs?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On youtube, can i do the following whilst collecting ad revenue?\n\n`Teach someone to play a copyrighted song on guitar (i.e. ed sheeran)?`\n\nIs this an infringement of copyright?

See [*Housen v. Nikolaisen*, 2002 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1972/index.do):\n\n> On a pure question of law, the basic rule with respect to the review of a trial judge\u2019s findings is that an appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the trial judge with its own. Thus the standard of review on a question of law is that of correctness ...\n> \n> \n> There are at least two underlying reasons for employing a correctness standard to matters of law. First, the principle of universality requires appellate courts to ensure that the same legal rules are applied in similar situations. ...\n\nIt is not open to the lower court to come to a conclusion that is different from that which the appellate court declares to be the correct one on a question of law. Even if lower court's interpretation would be one \"open to a reasonable person,\" it will be overturned if it does not match that of the appellate court.\n\n### Questions of law are reviewed on a lower standard (*reasonableness*) in judicial reviews of administrative decisions\n\nThe alternative standard, *reasonableness*, is applicable in the judicial review many administrative tribunals and agencies, even on questions of law. That is unless the statutory scheme invites more strict review by courts or if it is a constitutional question or a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or relate to jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies, in which case, the administrative decision\\-maker's interpretation of law *will* still be reviewed on a *correctness* standard. See [*Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov*, 2019 SCC 65](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18078/index.do).\n\nBut even in this regime of judicial review, a decision will not be upheld simply because it was *open to a reasonable person* to come to the decision. The review looks like this:\n\n> A reviewing court must develop an understanding of the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process in order to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. To make this determination, the reviewing court asks **whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision**\n\nThis is significantly more robust that merely inquiring whether the outcome was open to a reasonable person.\n\n> a court conducting a reasonableness review properly considers both the outcome of the decision and the reasoning process that led to that outcome was recently reaffirmed in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, \\[2018] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 12\\.

Virginia as precedent\nD) The Full Faith and Credit Clause would apply differently because Massachusetts is a state, not D.C.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a novel scenario. The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"the full faith and credit clause was never used to force a state to recognize a marriage it did not wish to recognize.\" Furthermore, the cited case law (Pacific Employers Insurance v. Industrial Accident) establishes that there are limitations to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, especially when it conflicts with a state's own statutes or policy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the Full Faith and Credit Clause was not used in this way for marriages. Option C is incorrect because Loving v. Virginia dealt specifically with interracial marriages, not same-sex marriages, and predates this hypothetical scenario.

The IRC service provider/operator would be the data controller and would be held ultimately responsible for the data stored/processed through the IRC service, including backups and logs kept etc, and this would mean any sub\\-processors they select (such as hosting provider) would also have to be GDPR compliant. Due to the nature of IRC chats being entirely public in the same way forum board posts and comments are public, the contract terms between the IRC service provider and the IRC users would need to be very clear that this is the case, and the IRC users would need to give consent for this processing (this is more complicated for children, see Article 8 regarding consent from the holder of parental responsibility).\n\n**For IRC users (personal use):** If you wish to keep the chat records for personal use only (i.e. not in connection with a business or your employment at a business), then an exemption applies:\n\n> 2.

While the information may be published or considered to be in the 'public domain', for you to take a copy of it without permission and use it for a purpose they haven't consented to would not be allowed under GDPR. Additionally, to go through the process of removing personal data from the chats/logs would in itself be considered 'processing' under GDPR and therefore would be unauthorised without a legal agreement with the data controller. Practically therefore, your best options under this circumstance would be if:\n\n1. The IRC service provider implemented a 'favourites' feature to save within their own system the chat conversations you wish to retain and refer back to in future. Since they hold the data and you already have a user agreement with them there is no further complications (this is probably the best option);\n2. The IRC service provider implemented a feature to download an *anonymized* copy of a chat conversation (not ideal as there are no guaruntees a user will not include personal data in their messages, though the user agreement could state that message content will be considered to exclude personal data, in a similar way to how StackExchange do for this website, see the paragraph titled \"Information You Choose to Display Publicly on the Network\" on the [StackExchange Privacy Policy](https://stackexchange.com/legal/privacy-policy)).\n3.

Option A (anonymizing usernames) is insufficient because it still involves unauthorized processing of personal data, which the documentation states would be against GDPR without proper agreements.\n\n2. Option B (storing logs with consent) is problematic because the software company would not be the data controller in this scenario.

(a) GENERAL.\n> \n> \n> (1\\) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of ...\n\nSo, it's very clear for the purposes of this Act what an \"endangered species\" is. Red squirrels are an endangered species and you are going to jail if at the time you killed one the secretary of the Environment Department had determined they were and had promulgated that decision as required by the act.\n\nHowever, that just begs the question ...\n----------------------------------------\n\nLet's assume the Act did not define \"endangered species\". It doesn't have to. So what happens?\n\nWhen you go to trial, the judge will determine what \"endangered species\" means and whether red squirrels fit within the definition.\n\nIf you are not the first person tried under the act, then there will be a precedent that the judge will either be required to follow (if it's from a court higher in the hierarchy) or is likely to follow (if it's at the same level or lower in the hierarchy or in a parallel hierarchy).\n\nIf you are the first person, then they will probably start with a dictionary. Merriam Webster is a solid US based dictionary and it [says](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endangered%20species):\n\n> a species threatened with extinction\n\nThe lawyers for both sides will introduce evidence as to what that means and if it does or doesn't include red squirrels. The polls will be inadmissible because opinions aren't allowed as evidence unless they come from an expert. So your trial is likely to see a bunch of zoologists, ecologists, climatologists, etc. giving their opinion on what endangered species are and if red squirrels are one.\n\nIt is possible that on a case decided at a given time, red squirrels are no endangered under the accepted definition and that another time, they are endangered.

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation. The U.S. Marshals Service was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, making it the oldest federal law enforcement agency in the United States. It predates the formal establishment of the U.S. military as we know it today and other federal investigative agencies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there was no transition from military to civilian status; the Marshals were never part of the military. Option B is a distractor that confuses the Marshals' status with that of other agencies that have changed departmental oversight. Option D is incorrect as it suggests a much later origin during the Civil War, which conflicts with the actual 1789 establishment date.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts, including the Marshals' founding date, their continuous civilian law enforcement status, and their relationship to other federal entities.

Some of the facts you are presenting are entirely wrong.\n\nPatents have inventors, copyrights have authors. Inventorship has strict rules.\n\nInventorship cannot be denied without consequence in almost any jurisdiction, but you'll need to get local legal advice. In the US, \"A patent is invalid unless it lists the first and true inventor or inventors of the claimed invention.\" (See Stark v. Advanced Magnetics, 119 F.3d 1551, 1553, 1556 (Fed.

I just wonder what would have happened had I said nothing.\n\nI just phoned my insurance company to arrange my car insurance for next year. We went through all the details and I was about to accept the offer when I mentioned that my brother was visiting from the US. At that point the salesperson informed me that the insurance would not cover my brother, as they must be resident in the UK. At no point prior to this had they mentioned such a requirement. I therefore declined their offer. I have done this many times before an it has not been an issue. However had I not mentioned this I would have accepted the offer. They may well have sent me a verbose contract with that term in there, but I may not have read it and my brother would have driven the car assuming they were insured.\n\nIf this had occurred would my brother have been insured?\n\nFrom answers it seems it may be relevant how frequent such a clause is. I have two old car insurance contracts and neither mention such a residence requirement. I have found many more \"Certificate of Insurance\" with my brother as a named driver and they make no mention of the requirement. It is those that must be shown to the police on request to prove one has insurance. [I have found a policy document online that does not appear to mention such a requirement](https://assets.wearemarmalade.co.uk/shared/assets/files/privatecar/Classic-PolicyWording.pdf).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In any sane jurisdiction, the clause would hold.\n\nBy and large, the legal fiction is that one has read and agreed to execute the entirety of the contracts they signed. If it was otherwise, no contract of substantial length would ever be enforceable upon individuals; yet such contracts are routinely offered and enforced (look at the terms\\&conditions of any internet website that sells stuff).\n\nIt is absolutely normal that a phone sale would gloss other minor details of the contract, and implicitly refer to the written text for the finer points. If the specific point had been raised in the phone call, and the salesperson erroneously told you X when in fact the contract read Y, you might have a case, but even then it is not necessarily a strong one (you signed the contract *after* having called; you might have changed your mind when reading the actual text, and you paying the insurance monthly bill is evidence that you agreed with the contract as\\-formed).\n\nThere are some exceptions to that general principle:\n\n1. **General conditions of validity of a contract.** For instance, in [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), a contract must have a [\"definite and legitimate content\"](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032040911). If we sign a contract for \"a few apples against a few euros\", and then I give you five apples, you owe me zero euros because the contract was not specific enough to be enforceable. If the whole contract is unenforceable, the clause falls with it.\n2. **General conditions of a validity of a clause.** Specific clauses can be invalidated without bringing down the whole contract (for instance, \"in case X fails to perform their obligations under clause 70Z, Y is allowed to take a pound of flesh from X\").\n3. **Specific conditions on certain clauses.** Consumer laws in some jurisdictions make certain clauses of certain contracts either invalid entirely, or only valid if they were read aloud to the prospective buyer, or only valid in certain forms. (For instance, in France, a sale of real estate between individuals must be notarized.)\n\nI would be extremely surprised if the rule in the OP\u2019s example (residence condition to bring another driver on the insurance policy) would fail under any of those.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A customer arranges car insurance over the phone, pays for it, and later receives documentation containing an undisclosed clause stating that drivers must be UK residents to be covered.

In the event of an accident, which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur from a legal standpoint?\n\nA) The insurance company must honor the coverage, as the clause was not explicitly mentioned during the phone call.\nB) The insurance is invalid for the brother, but remains valid for UK resident drivers.\nC) The entire insurance policy is void due to the undisclosed clause.\nD) The customer can claim coverage based on previous policies that didn't include this clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of contract law principles and insurance practices. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. In most jurisdictions, the legal principle is that one has read and agreed to the entire contract they've signed, even if some details weren't explicitly discussed during the sale.\n\n2. The undisclosed clause about UK residency would likely be considered valid, as it's a specific condition rather than an unreasonable or illegal term.\n\n3.

[Tulsi Gabbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) is a Hawaii Army National Guard major. She is also a serving member of the House of Representatives. \n\nOn the face of it, it seems to be a violation of the separation of powers for any person to retain an officer commission while also being a legislator. She may, after all, (at least in theory) have to take orders from the commander\\-in\\-chief, who is in a different branch of the government.\n\nI do not think that her situation is unique. I am sure there have been many other legislators who were either in reserve or on active duty.\n\nWas there a SCOTUS case which provided guidance on why this is allowed? Or does this arrangement rely on a good faith belief that (a) a President would not interfere with the legislature by issuing orders which may interfere with an enlisted legislator's Congressional duties or that (b) such a legislator would not use her position to influence the armed services?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, this issue doesn't come up for people on active duty. [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 973](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/973) forbids active\\-duty military officers from holding or exercising the functions of an elective federal office; [DoDD 1344\\.10](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/134410p.pdf) extends that to all active\\-duty personnel. Both the law and the directive also apply to reservists or retirees on long\\-term active duty (more than 270 days).\n\nSecond, for status reasons, this is much less likely to come up with enlisted personnel. The sort of people who serve in Congress are generally also the sort of people who'd be officers. Many of the relevant restrictions apply to people holding *office* in the executive branch, and enlisted personnel do not hold office (only commissioned and warrant officers do).\n\nThird, an interesting quirk that makes this even more significant: Retired military personnel do not technically leave the military. They're no longer in active service, but they are still military personnel, bound by the UCMJ, and subject to both voluntary and involuntary recall. In fact, people retired from active\\-duty components are bound by the UCMJ at all times, whereas non\\-retired reservists are only bound by it when called up. If this is an issue for reservists because they might be called up, it's also an issue for retirees.\n\n---\n\nNow that we've handled preliminaries, the central issue comes from the Incompatibility Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n> \\[N]o person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House \\[of Congress] during his continuance in office.\n\nThe question is whether reservists count as holding an \"office under the United States.\" If it does, you have to resign from the reserves before entering Congress. However, *Congress* decides whether or not someone is qualified to be a member, and Congress has generally refused to explicitly decide if reservists are allowed (implicitly meaning that yes, they are).\n\n[6 Cannon's Precedents \u00a7\u00a7 60\\-\\-62](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/pdf/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-11.pdf) covers the situation as of World War I: the House Judiciary Committee recommended that members of Congress who had accepted National Guard commissions be considered to have forfeit their seats in Congress, but the full House didn't act on the recommendation. After the war, the House decided to pay members who had been on military service the difference between their congressional pay and military pay. In the second debate, the House considered the difference between temporary and permanent office. It was pointed out that in past wars, members had served as officers in short\\-term volunteer units and then returned to their seats at the end of their service. It was also pointed out that an \"office\" is an inherently permanent thing: a temporary commission for the duration of a war might not necessarily be an office.\n\n[2 Deschler's Precedents \u00a7 14](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2-1-4-6.pdf) discusses how things played out in World War II and beyond. Here, the US involvement was much longer, and there was more consideration given to the problems with holding both offices. The *executive* branch was the one that complained; they decided that serving in Congress was more important than serving overseas, and that military personnel who were also in Congress would be told to pick one (either go back to Congress and serve there, or resign from Congress and be in the military). In 1965, the Defense Department issued an order (currently found in [DoDD 1200\\.7](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/120007p.pdf)) which provides for the involuntary transfer of people in key positions (including all members of Congress) from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve. Congress did not like that, and they (finally) struck back in the 2016 NDAA: they amended [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 10149](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/10149) to ban transfers to the Standby Reserve based on service in Congress. This certainly seems to promote the idea that Congress thinks reserve service is allowable, but when Barry Goldwater tried to get a resolution to that effect in 1963, Congress didn't act on it.\n\nSo in summary: Congress (which enforces the Incompatibility Clause) hasn't explicitly said simultaneous reserve service is allowable, but has essentially let it happen. The executive branch has tried to discourage it, but Congress has opposed that (personally, my guess is that members of Congress want the political benefit of saying \"I'm currently in the military,\" while the military would prefer not to have them).\n\n---\n\nI've discussed how Congress handles it, and Congress does have the final authority to judge the qualifications of its members. There was one Supreme Court case (cited in Deschler's Precedents) where a group tried to get the two positions ruled incompatible, but it was dismissed on standing grounds (the group could not establish that *they* were particularly harmed by the alleged violation). A lower court had held that the offices were incompatible, but that ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, there was another opinion issued in 2006 where the courts couldn't duck the question. Sen. Lindsey Graham was also an Air Force lawyer (he's since retired), and while a Senator he was tapped to be a military judge on the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. An airman was convicted at court martial and appealed to a panel that included Graham, then appealed again to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. There's no question that a criminal defendant has standing to challenge whether his judge can legally be a judge, and Congress does *not* have the final say over whether someone's qualified to be a military judge. In *US v. Lane*, the CAAF held that Graham's office in the Senate was incompatible with service as a military judge. However, the CAAF cannot tell Congress \"you can't be an active reservist and a sitting member of Congress.\" Even the Supreme Court is limited in its ability to interfere with Congress's decisions on the qualifications of its members: the Court did hold that Congress can't add qualifications, but this is a question of \"does this provision apply to this person,\" which Congress has final authority over.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A newly elected member of Congress, who is also a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army Reserve, is appointed to serve on a military court.

The correct answer is D, based on the precedent set in the case of US v. Lane involving Senator Lindsey Graham. \n\nWhile Congress has generally allowed its members to serve in the reserves (option C is incorrect), and has authority over qualifications of its own members (making option A partially true but not the best answer), the situation changes when it comes to judicial appointments in the military. \n\nThe US v. Lane case established that a member of Congress serving as a military judge creates an incompatibility that can be successfully challenged in court. Unlike general reserve service, which Congress has implicitly allowed, judicial roles in the military are subject to scrutiny by the courts when challenged by affected parties (such as defendants in military trials).\n\nOption B is incorrect because the 270-day rule applies to active duty service preventing holding elected office, not to incompatibility of congressional service with military judicial roles.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to integrate multiple concepts (Incompatibility Clause, Congress's self-regulation, judicial precedent, and the distinction between general reserve service and specific judicial appointments) and apply them to a novel scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38324/has-the-scope-of-share-alike-narrowed-between-cc-3-0-and-4-0", "docs_id": 38324, "title": "Has the scope of Share Alike narrowed between CC 3.0 and 4.0?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **What's the issue?**  \n\nThe wording of CC BY\\-SA licenses changed significantly between versions 3\\.0 and 4\\.0, but I don't believe Creative Commons (CC) intended to narrow the scope of share alike (I explain why later).

Section 1.a of the 3.0 license defines an Adaptation as a work where the original is \"recast, transformed, or adapted.\" In this case, the illustrations are used in their entirety without modification, so they are not recast, transformed, or adapted.\n\nThe question challenges common misconceptions about the scope of share-alike clauses and requires careful consideration of license terminology.

The correct answer is D because it's the least effective and realistic option for a restaurant chain to replicate a tech company's tax optimization approach.\n\nOption A is plausible because it involves intangible assets (brand name), which the documentation mentions as a key factor in tech companies' tax strategies. Restaurants can indeed license their brand names, as exemplified by McDonald's.\n\nOption B is viable because it involves creating proprietary software, which is an intangible asset similar to those used by tech companies. This could potentially be used to shift profits offshore.\n\nOption C is a realistic strategy that some restaurant chains already employ, using franchise models to optimize their tax structure.\n\nOption D, however, is the least effective because:\n1.

Early examples of originally trademarked words that entered the general lexicon are \"elevator\" and \"escalator\".\n\nFor example, the word \"grok\" coined by Robert Heinlein, is now part of the general lexicon, as is the word \"quark\" coined by James Joyce (although its current meaning has shifted). The word \"robot\" from K. \u010capek's play R.U.R. \u2018Rossum's Universal Robots\u2019 (1920\\), would be another example of a word coined in fiction that has entered general use.\n\nThe scene a faire doctrine also authorized public domain use of tropes and terms that have achieved wide use in a genre. As a rule of thumb, if three different authors have used a term to mean the same thing, or an author who is no longer in copyright has done so, it can be used freely.\n\nFor example, regardless of who originally used it, the term \"mecha\" would not be protected by the doctrine due to its used by multiple authors and commentators in a particular science fiction sub\\-genre.\n\n\"Mentat\" is a close case, because it is overwhelmingly used in a specific series of books written by Frank Herbert and his son with licensing from his estate, and because the series has produced so many published properties, not only in books, but in TV and movies, it has been close to maximally protected from an IP perspective by the Herbert Estate, his publishers, and his audio\\-visual licensees.\n\nThere is at least a colorable argument that use of the term in a fictional setting would be a derivative work, intended to evoke and be derived from the extended series of creative properties.\n\nThe best counterargument that the term has entered the general lexicon, or in any case is not a protected derivative work, would comes from use of the term in a non\\-fiction sense which is not negligible, even though it isn't terribly common.\n\n[Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat_(disambiguation)) two (probably unlicensed) commercial uses, one as a trademark and the other as an IT company name, in addition to two minor fictional uses, one with a similar meaning and one with a somewhat shifted meaning.\n\nFurther, to the extent that the non\\-fiction use was great enough to show that it entered the general lexicon, at that point, fictional use would no longer be a derivative work because the work could be derived from many sources in which the Herbert estate does not have copyrights.\n\nA Google N\\-gram search could be used to evaluate that argument empirically. The use of the word in the early 19th century (before Herbert was born) is particularly promising, although the senses in which it was used pre\\-Herbert would have to be evaluated, and the context in which it was used post\\-Dune would also have to be evaluated (if all the uses are in his licensed books, it hurts the cause).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)\n\nA quick scan suggests that in the early 19th century that it was often used as a Latin or French word used untranslated for foreign flavor in English language works, so there is an argument that it is really a loan word not specific to Herbert. Much of the modern use is in fair use commentary expressly referencing Herbert's works and in obvious misspellings of the word \"mental\".\n\nParticularly encouraging in the N\\-gram search are the uses of the word in independent science fiction novels including \"The Search for Snout\" (2014\\) by Bruce Coville, \"Dorsai!\" (2013\\) by Gordon R. Dickson, \"Eye of the Storm\" (2009\\) by John Ringo, and \"The Ghost Brigades\" (2007\\) by John Scalzi. Also, particularly notable is the use of the word in an independent non\\-Dune novel in \"Clockwork Lives\" (2015\\) by Kevin J. Anderson and Neil Peart, since Kevin J. Anderson was a co\\-author of some of the Dune novels and would have contractual obligations to the Herbert Estate as well as copyright obligations; signifying a concession of non\\-ownership of the term by the estate. This use in five independent fictional cases in the same genre in works published long enough ago for the statute of limitations for infringement to have lapsed (with late filed suits used to muddy the waters). This strongly advances the scene a faire doctrine validation of the word.\n\nThe term is also used in a scientific journal article in 2008 in the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, but in a related but not identical sense of the word.\n\nAnother litmus test regarding whether a word is part of the general lexicon is whether it appears in more complete dictionaries, such as the OED, or Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, or in a notable published thesaurus, None of the dictionaries and no thesaurus that I have in hard copy have that word, but this could be because mine are dated. An updated dictionary and thesaurus search would be probative evidence of this question. A thesaurus search for \"genius\" or \"prodigy\" that came up with \"mentat\" listed would be a good thing to look for.\n\nA third issue for general lexicon v. derivative work analysis would be whether the word can be derived by obvious use of affixes and suffixes and retroflex letters from words that are in dictionaries. For example, a word plus \\-ology (for the study of), or \\-itis (for medical conditions) would not generally be beyond the scope of legally permissible public domain use. This again is a close call in the case of \"mentat\".\n\nSingle words are also harder (but not impossible) to protect as derivative works, if not trademarked as well, than extended passages either verbatim or paraphrased or translated, which would weaken the derivative work claim, although it wouldn't be entirely without merit just because it was a single word.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing a AI-powered data analysis tool and wants to market it as a \"Mentat System\" to evoke the idea of superhuman analytical capabilities.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. The term \"Mentat\" is in a legal grey area. While it originated in Frank Herbert's Dune series, there's evidence of its use in other contexts, both fictional and non-fictional.\n\n2. The documentation mentions several factors to consider:\n   - The scene a faire doctrine, which might apply if the term has been used by multiple authors in the genre.\n   - Whether the term has entered the general lexicon, which can be assessed through dictionary inclusions and usage patterns.\n   - The potential for the term to be considered a derivative work, which depends on its context and associations.\n\n3. A comprehensive analysis would include:\n   - Researching the term's usage in other works of fiction and non-fiction contexts.\n   - Conducting Google N-gram searches to evaluate usage patterns over time.\n   - Checking updated dictionaries and thesauri for inclusions.\n   - Analyzing whether the term can be derived from common affixes or suffixes.\n   - Evaluating the specific context of use in the marketing materials.\n\n4. Consulting legal experts is crucial given the complexity of the issue and the potential risks involved in commercial use.\n\nOption A is overly cautious and may not be necessary if the term has entered general use. Option B is too risky without proper research, as the term's status is not definitively settled. Option D attempts to sidestep the issue but doesn't address the underlying legal questions and may still carry risks.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and make a nuanced decision based on complex factors, aligning with higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73881/why-do-solicitor-advice-procedure-regulations-require-collection-of-landlord-det", "docs_id": 73881, "title": "Why do solicitor advice procedure regulations require collection of landlord details at client intake when solicitors advise on tenancy issues?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been informed by a law firm that they are required by national regulations of the solicitors' authority to collect a landlord's name and address (not the address of the property in question, but the landlord's own operating address) before they can book in an advice session on a landlord\\-tenant issue, because it is required by regulations. I asked them what this is used for, and why it's required by the regulations (ie, what is the rationale and principle of the said regulation), and they couldn't tell me.\n\nI was hoping someone here could shed some light on this question instead. I am quite interested in the princple and rationale behind the requirement (and, why can advice not be dispensed simply on a hypothetical basis?), however, more significant is where it gets sent, what its collection's purpose is, and what it's used for.\n\nEdit: It would also be great if you could supply a citation of the specific regulation that imposes this requirement.\n\nNote: a bit new here, but don't really know necessarily what the most suitable tags to be used are, so if any others have suggestions for more applicable and relevant ones, please don't hesitate to suggest!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The purpose is to avoid the possibility that the solicitor will inadvertently end up providing advice to more than one side of the same dispute or transaction, putting the solicitor in a conflict of interest situation.\n\nIn the simplest case, the solicitor might already represent the landlord that the tenant is seeking to discuss legal rights vis\\-a\\-vis.\n\nEven if the advice is merely hypothetical, this is not O.K. A solicitor has a very high duty of loyalty to the solicitor's clients. Providing aid of any kind to someone adverse to the solicitor's clients that benefits that person, even if another solicitor would probably say the same thing, is a serious breach of that duty and is forbidden and sanctionable. It could get the solicitor kicked out of the profession in a worst case scenario. The duty of loyalty includes a duty to take reasonable care not to inadvertently or negligently act disloyally.\n\nThere is also a risk of a more subtle sort of conflict that has to be evaluated since many disputes and transactions are not just two sided.\n\nFor example, perhaps a solicitor a big commercial tenant client on the brink of a settlement with a particular landlord after lengthy and extensive negotiations (perhaps in a business lease renewal deal), and another prospective tenant client might, for example, have an interest in leasing the same property as your existing client at a higher rate. Representing both tenants/prospective tenants could creating a conflict between your two tenant clients. Screening clients based upon their landlord relationships helps solicitors to identify these conflicts and to prevent them from arising.\n\nMore generally, the best practice is for a solicitor to make sufficient inquiry prior to providing any legal advice to a prospective new client, to avoid having clients that have a conflict of interest with each other. This regulation (to the extent that it is really as specific as suggested) is simply a codification of this general rule in a specific, commonly recurring situation.\n\nIn large law firms, every single legal professional in the firm typically spends the first half hour or so of every day reviewing lists of new prospective clients and parties related to them in order to screen for potential conflicts of interest.

[Article 6(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) lists all situations where processing of personal data is allowed.\n\nIf I understand your question correctly, Company A has a learning platform to teach about the products it sells. Company B buys products from Company A. Company B wants its employees to know how to use those products.\n\nIn that case Company B has a legitimate interest to add its employees to the learning platform.

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: \n> \n> \n> (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nBecause you say it are pharmaceutical products, there might also be a legal obligation because prescribing a wrong product is dangerous. But I don't know if that is the case.\n\nAlso note that in many EU countries, consent would not even be possible because there is a imbalanced relationship between an employer and an employee, see for example the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/when-is-consent-appropriate/) or [this page](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/how-my-personal-data-protected/can-my-employer-require-me-give-my-consent-use-my-personal-data_en) from the European Commission:\n\n> The employer\\-employee situation is generally considered as an imbalanced relationship in which the employer wields more power than the employee. Since consent has to be freely given, and in light of the imbalanced relationship, your employer in most cases can\u2019t rely on your consent to use your data.\n\n---\n\nBut besides that, the GDPR also requires data minimisation.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) is likely the most appropriate legal basis for processing in this employer-employee context, rather than consent.\n2. Using company email addresses adheres to the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) by limiting the use of personal data to what is necessary for the purpose.\n3.

The correct answer is C because \"solicitors\" refers to the law firm as an entity, not necessarily multiple individual lawyers. This usage stems from historical practices where solicitors operated as firms, either as sole traders or partnerships. Even when a single lawyer manages a case, they are acting on behalf of the firm, hence the plural \"solicitors\" is used.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the term has historical roots, it's still in active use in many jurisdictions. Option B is a misinterpretation of the plural form.

(I guess the detail would stay at the detention facility to watch over their charge.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most secret service details are protection for heads of government/state and thus their details would be afforded Sovereign Immunity (Such as POTUS, VPOTUS, and First and Second Families) OR Diplomatic Immunity (visiting dignitaries and leaders of other nations). Typically there are more diplomatic ways to handle the cases in the latter.\n\nIn the former case, thus far, it has not been handled. During visits, the traditional Executives and Families are usually closely guarded by the Service with additional law enforcement form local jurisdictions called in to aid in the protection, usually to secure routes the Motorcade will take to a designation (I speak from personal experience, POTUS coming to town is a nightmare on traffic). If they are speeding, they are typically doing so down a completely empty highway with police escort.\n\nFrom this point, most under of the Service would be monitored and controlled so closely, at least one Agent would notice if any protected was committing a crime and would have to write it up in a report. There is also considerable debate in legal circles if the President and Vice President could be arrested for a crime while in office, with the general acceptance being that they could not and would need to be impeached by congress. Secret Service will continue to protect former Presidents and Vice Presidents for life, along with their spouses and children up to a certain age.\n\nWith all that in mind, it would not so much be that the Secret Service would prevent arrest of an individual under their protection so much as the Secret Service would be the arresting authority. As they are law enforcement agents under the Federal Government, they can legally arrest people and then hand them to the proper law enforcement agency to effect the arrest. This would mostly happen with candidates for office OR former presidents OR family at any point in time as the scenario described is a bit harder to make a legitimate arrest.\n\nIn fact, the Secret Service does have arrest authority with one of the highest conviction rates of any Law Enforcement Agency in the Country. It's just most crimes they arrest have nothing to do with threats to those under their protection. The Secret Service is also charged with investigation of counterfeiting of US currency and they are very good at it. This was actually their original sole function in the U.S. government and they still exist under the Treasury Department to this day. At this point, if you're wondering how they got the job of protecting important people in the executive branch from that, well, it's simple. At the time of his assasination, the legislation to create the USSS was on Licoln's desk. At the time of their creation, the only other Federal Police services were the U.S. Park Police, the Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Marshals. The first two had specific jurisdictions and the Marshals were undermanned so the USSS was tasked with investigating all sorts of financial crimes and quickly became the most successful U.S. Law Enforcement Service. They were also the first U.S. Intelligence and Counterintelligence agency (though they no longer are part of the Intelligence Community) until the FBI took on those duties.

In those jurisdictions, even if you have the copyright holder's permission, you must still respect the moral rights.\n\nLet's make some things explicit by considering a particular artwork. Say, this one:\n\n[![Leonardo's Mona Lisa](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)\n\nThis particular piece is not subject to copyright because a) it was created before there was such a concept, and b) da Vinci died in 1519, so if there had been a copyright law, copyright in this work would have long expired. So, you can make as many copies of this as you like.\n\nNow, let's consider what the situation would be if Leonardo's alchemical pursuits had been more successful and instead of dying in 1519, he died last Tuesday.\n\nIf you want to make a copy of this image, you must have Leonardo's heir(s) permission or be operating under an exemption under copyright law in your jurisdiction.\n\nWhen you train your AI, you will need to make a copy of the image.

All rental agreements are month\\-to\\-month.\n\nedit: i guess what i'm asking is if anti\\-discrimination laws DO extend to tenants' guests, or if i am not legally liable for discriminating against this guest with tourette's in the interest of Right's reasonable enjoyment of property.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Ontario [Residential Tenancies Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK85) says that:\n\n> 64 (1\\) A landlord *may* give a tenant notice of termination of the\n>  tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental\n>  unit *or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant* is\n>  such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of\n>  the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or\n>  another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right,\n>  privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.\n\nThere are statutory provisions whereby a landlord is prohibited from himself interfering with a tenant's quiet enjoyment of the premises, which would not be applicable. Given just this, you may, but are not required to.\n\nThe [Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (23\\)(1\\)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c34#BK22) says:\n\n> In a conveyance made on or after the 1st day of July, 1886, there\n>  shall, in the cases in this section mentioned, be deemed to be\n>  included, and there shall in those cases be implied, covenants to the\n>  effect in this section stated, by the person or by each person who\n>  conveys, as far as regards the subject\\-matter or share thereof\n>  expressed to be conveyed by him, with the person, if one, to whom the\n>  conveyance is made, or with the persons jointly, if more than one, to\n>  whom the conveyance is made as joint tenants, or with each of the\n>  persons, if more than one, to whom the conveyance is made as tenants\n>  in common:\n>  In a conveyance for valuable consideration, other than a mortgage, the\n>  following covenants by the person who conveys, and is expressed to\n>  convey as beneficial owner, namely, covenants for...ii. quiet\n>  enjoyment...according to the forms of covenants for such purposes set\n>  forth in Schedule B to the Short Forms of Conveyances Act, being\n>  chapter 472 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980, and therein\n>  numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5, subject to that Act.\n\nIn other words, if the lease doesn't say anything about quiet enjoyment, there is an implied covenant whereby \"the landlord, by letting the premises confers on the tenant the right of possession during the term and impliedly promises not to interfere with the tenant\u2019s exercise and use of that right to possession during the term\". The implied covenant pertains to interference by the landlord, not to interference by other tenants (see [this analysis](https://renx.ca/the-tenants-right-to-quiet-enjoyment-how-far-does-it-go/)). Again, you would have a right to evict a noisy tenant, but not an obligation.\n\nHowever, the [Canadian Human Rights Act(6\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html#h-3) states that:\n\n> It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of commercial\n>  premises or residential accommodation (a) to deny occupancy of such\n>  premises or accommodation to any individual, or (b) to differentiate\n>  adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of\n>  discrimination.\n\nwhere 3(1\\) states:\n\n> For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination\n>  are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex,\n>  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status,\n>  family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for\n>  an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which\n>  a record suspension has been ordered.\n\nThe [Canadian Supremacy Clause](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (52(1\\) of the Constitution Act, 1982\\) says that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law\n>  that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to\n>  the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nand furthermore:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada includes (a) the Canada Act 1982, including\n>  this Act\n\nThe Constitution act (15\\)(1\\) [also states](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html):\n\n> Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right\n>  to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without\n>  discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on\n>  race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental\n>  or physical disability.\n\nSo under the Canadian Constitution, the national anti\\-discrimination requirement is superior to the provincial RTA. Since no provincial law actually requires eviction of a tenant with a noisy guest, there is no conflict.\n\nOntario also has an [anti\\-discrimination law](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h19#BK3) (The Human Rights Code):\n\n> 1. Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of\n>  race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship,\n>  creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,\n>  age, marital status, family status or disability.\n> 2. (1\\) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to the occupancy of accommodation, without discrimination because of race,\n>  ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed,\n>  sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age,\n>  marital status, family status, disability or the receipt of public\n>  assistance.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Every person who occupies accommodation has a right to freedom\n>  from harassment by the landlord or agent of the landlord *or by an\n>  occupant of the same building* because of race, ancestry, place of\n>  origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation,\n>  gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family\n>  status, disability or the receipt of public assistance.\n\nRight must therefore refrain from hassling Left.\n\nA problem could arise if there is a lease clause whereby you guarantee tenants a noise\\-free environment and promise to remove noisy neighbors. In that case, Right could sue you, and you would have to defend yourself by reference to the fact that Canadian and provincial law prohibits you from pursuing eviction in this case.\n\nAn alternative would be to ask Left to not have the noisy individual over. But that would not be a wise choice. The anti\\-discrimination laws are not stated as protections against tenants who have the protected characteristics, indeed all tenants have some sex, religion, race etc. You can't start eviction proceedings because the tenant is white, black, Catholic, or atheist, and you likewise can't evict a person for having a guest who is white, black, Catholic, or atheist. You also can't \"have a talk\" with a tenant \u2013 creating a \"poisoned environment\" \u2013 because they or their guest are white, black, Catholic, or atheist. Having a mental disability is included in this set.\n\nAll that said, this is clearly a case that needs to be looked at by an Ontario landlord lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A landlord is facing a complex situation with two tenants, Left and Right. Left frequently has a guest with Tourette's syndrome, causing noise disturbances. Right is complaining about the noise and threatening to go to the tenant board. Given the intersecting legal considerations, what is the most appropriate course of action for the landlord?\n\nA) Evict Left for substantially interfering with Right's reasonable enjoyment of the property\nB) Ask Left to stop inviting the guest with Tourette's syndrome to avoid discrimination complaints\nC) Inform Right that they must tolerate the noise due to anti-discrimination laws\nD) Offer to relocate Right to a different unit within the property at no additional cost\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation involves multiple intersecting legal considerations. The Ontario Residential Tenancies Act allows landlords to terminate a tenancy if a tenant or their guest substantially interferes with others' reasonable enjoyment. However, this is permissive, not mandatory. More importantly, both federal and provincial anti-discrimination laws take precedence. The Canadian Human Rights Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code prohibit discrimination based on disability in housing accommodation. Tourette's syndrome is a protected disability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because evicting Left would likely constitute discrimination based on their guest's disability. Option B is also problematic as it could be seen as creating a \"poisoned environment\" and indirectly discriminating against a person with a disability. Option D, while potentially helpful, doesn't address the legal issues and could be seen as treating Right differently due to their complaint about a person with a disability.\n\nOption C is the most appropriate action. The landlord should inform Right about the anti-discrimination laws that protect Left's guest. The Ontario Human Rights Code specifically states that occupants have a right to freedom from harassment by other occupants based on disability. Right must refrain from hassling Left about this issue. While the noise may be disruptive, it's a result of a protected disability, and tolerance is required by law.\n\nThis solution balances the legal requirements to avoid discrimination while acknowledging Right's concerns. The landlord should document all communications and consider consulting with a legal professional specializing in Ontario landlord-tenant law to ensure full compliance with all applicable regulations."}, "66": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65473/does-the-netherlands-concept-of-free-speech-extend-to-online-media-platforms", "docs_id": 65473, "title": "Does the Netherlands concept of free speech extend to online media platforms?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What protections does Netherlands provide to users of online platforms incorporated in their country? Currently, the United States treats online platforms as private property and so the users are granted no rights of freedom of speech on those platforms. Does the Netherlands provide any additional rights over the United States?\n\nI know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights. If so, are these rights extended only to citizens of the Netherlands, or are these rights universal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Freedom of speech in the constitution\n-------------------------------------\n\nI think this is a very broad question, but I'll attempt an answer. To my knowledge, there is no specific Dutch law that considers freedom of speech *on the internet*. Instead, there is one article in the Dutch constitution that considers freedom of speech and a prohibition on censorship. That's [article 7 of the Dutch constitution](https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/id/via0istdaus2/artikel_7_vrijheid_van_meningsuiting) (link in Dutch).\n\nIt consists of 4 sections. The first deals with freedom of speech in print, the second deals with radio and television, the third deals with (translated by me) *revealing thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* and the fourth states that the aforementioned sections don't apply to commercial advertisements.\n\nSince you are asking about freedom of speech online, the third section applies. The section states that no permission is needed to *reveal those thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* but it adds two conditions:\n\n1. In Dutch: *\"behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet\"*. This means that the freedom is subject to one's responsibilities under the law. In other words, other laws may curtail one's freedom under this section. This phrase is also included in the first two sections.\n2. The second condition which is specific to this section is that the law may restrict access to *performances* (*vertoningen* in Dutch; not sure if it translates well) to people under the age of 16 to protect good moral (*goede zeden* in Dutch; again not sure if it translates well).\n\nRestrictions under the law\n--------------------------\n\nSo the above about constitutional freedom of speech doesn't tell you a lot, it's very general. To answer your question you'd need to know what specific exceptions there are. These exceptions don't need to be specific to statements made online, if it's not allowed in public then the same rule would apply online.\n\nTo give these exceptions I'll summarize the information on [this page from the Dutch Amnesty International site on freedom of speech in the Netherlands](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland).\n\nHate speech and calling for criminal acts\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Amnesty article starts with some information on articles of criminal law:\n\n* [Article 137](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel137d/) forbids hate against or discrimination of people based on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, or mental handicap.\n\nAccording to [the Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) this covers holocaust denial (considered unlawful discrimination) but not homophobia (when it expresses fear of or aversion to someone's sexual orientation).\n\n* [Article 131](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel131) and [article 132](http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/Wetboek%20van%20Strafrecht/132.html): calling for a criminal act or violent action against public order.\n\nSome interesting jurisprudence regarding your question and articles 131 and 132 is this case: [ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232). It's a Dutch Supreme Court case that considers calls for 'participation in the armed jihad' in the context of the war in Syria. The calls were made in Facebook posts (containing photos of dead victims, photos of ISIS flags, and statements in Dutch supporting jihad). The linked ruling confirms that these posts were in violation of articles 131 and 132 and that the posts were not protected under religious freedom nor as freedom of speech.\n\n* Libel [article 261](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel261) and slander [article 262](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel262) are also limitations on freedom of speech, even online.\n\nPreventing publication of military secrets\n------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the [Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) censorship (as in ruling some statement against the law before publication) is not something Dutch courts may normally do. It names one exception: when military secrets may be revealed. Then a court may prevent publication, unless the military secrets are such gross violations of human rights that publication would be warranted.\n\nRights on a platform\n--------------------\n\n> I know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights.\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to here but I don't think it refers to freedom speech. In any case, after some googling I found a case that is about this: [someone filed summary proceedings](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2020:4966) in the Netherlands because they disagreed with Facebook removing pages on its platform that didn't conform with Facebook's policy on Covid\\-19\\. As far as I can see from skimming the court ruling, the ruling holds that freedom of speech does not extend to companies like Facebook having to host your posts. I think it's basically a long ruling that boils down to [the well\\-know XKCD on free speech](https://xkcd.com/1357/).\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling also points to the service agreement between Facebook and the user. Part of those terms and conditions are entered as facts in the proceedings. Since it's a civil case, I assume users might derive some rights from that if the agreement touches on that.\n\nAnother thing that sounds familiar (based on that quote from your question) is [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality). Like in the US, that's mostly about network providers having different rules for different content, which isn't allowed in most cases under net neutrality.

Fair housing, which is a federal concept, pertains to issues such as using prohibited personal facts to determine whether to accept an offer. (Hazardous materials disclosures are also mandated at the federal level, but are are included in state requirements which can get pretty broad). \n\nIf you are buying in Washington state, [RCW 64\\.06\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.06.020) says what and how you must disclose. The list of disclosures is very detailed, covering title and covenants, water, sewer, structure, systems and fixtures, environment, and mobile home related. The only one of the 86 questions about smoke is whether smoke alarms are present. Thus smell of smoke is not a legally material fact that must be disclosed, in this state. The California disclosures, even longer, are [here](http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/re6.pdf), and there is likewise no \"smells bad\" disclosure.\n\nIt is unlikely that any state in the US mandates such a disclosure, since it is somewhere between a subjective evaluation and a self\\-evident fact. Some people are very sensitive to certain smells while others do not care. The burden is on the buyer to pursue matters of personal concern (in writing!), such as whether any dog has been present in the house in the past 5 years (some people care). You have to look carefully at the response. \"Don't know\" is usually a safe bet, unless you actually have factual knowledge.\n\nFrom what I can determine, Massachussetts is on the opposite end of the spectrum from California. There are some requirements imposed on real estate agents, and there is the federal lead paint disclosure, but otherwise it appears that nothing is mandated by law. [This form](http://startpoint.com/DocLibrary/SellerDisclosure.pdf) seems to be used by the real estate association, and there is a question about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure\". The reasonable interpretation of that is \"has the house caught fire and suffered damage\", so \"no\" from a cigar\\-smoker would not be fraudulent. If the intent of the question were to reveal if someone has smoked frequently in the house, that would he the question they'd ask. You can check whether you have this form and see what it says, but \"smoke damage\" would not normally be interpreted as meaning \"smells a bit funny\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A homebuyer in Massachusetts discovers a persistent tobacco smoke odor in their newly purchased house, along with hidden air fresheners and smoke residue, three weeks after closing.

Which of the following actions is most likely to provide the buyer with a legal remedy in this situation?\n\nA) File a complaint with the Massachusetts Real Estate Board for violation of mandatory smoke odor disclosure laws\nB) Sue the seller for fraudulent misrepresentation based on the concealment of the odor with air fresheners\nC) Request mediation with the seller through the local housing authority to negotiate compensation\nD) Pursue a claim against the home inspector for negligence in failing to detect the smoke odor\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided information and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Massachusetts has limited mandatory disclosure requirements for home sales, and there is no specific law requiring disclosure of smoke odors.\n2. The seller's actions of concealing the odor with hidden air fresheners could be considered an active attempt to hide a material defect, potentially constituting fraudulent misrepresentation.\n3.

Could stock markets or the authorized distributors of their data bring about any consequences legally to someone who republishes the data without permission?\n\n*Assuming financial market quotes can't be copyrighted,* can the distributors of the information (exchanges or their authorized distributors) use a contract (terms of service) to prevent someone from redistributing the data that they don't own (the copyright to) in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe that it varies by country. The law provides protection for databases and data sets, where sufficient creativity/choice/curatorship has gone into its creation. It's separate from but similar to copyright law. So far it exists in several countries including the EU but I'm hazy whether it exists in the US (from memory it doesn't) and the exact criteria. \n\nIn any case such a website may not meet the criterion for copyright \\- although the original data creator (the stock exchange whose data is being used/reused) may have. \n\nI don't know about IP law \\- is the fact of a current price (or dataset of such facts at different times) protectable as IP instead? Are facts generally? Can I declare facts such as my street address, or a number, as IP? Clearly commercial effort goes into it, and clearly it can be protected by contract but copyright/IP law is less clear to me. The question of copyright protection for a commercially valuable *number* **has** been [tried in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy), however, as has the question of [a commercially valuable number which is constructed into a number that is notable for noncommercial reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).\n\n(As a possibly similar thought\\-question that might shed light on it \\- suppose a website is hosted using stock settings of some \"off the shelf\" website software, can they sue for copyright/look and feel over the appearance of their site? Probably not since they didn't put creative/novel/original effort into it. But the original software creator probably could.)\n\nHope this partial answer helps.\n\n**Updated to answer follow\\-up comment**\n\nFirst off, you can't force a person to do something based on a contract with someone else. Only the websites contract with the end user (terms of use etc) can do that. So the supplier's contract with the stock price website cannot in any way force an end user to do or not do anything. It can however require the vendor to set specific terms and enforce them. It can require the vendor to sue an abuser of the website terms (or allow the supplier to do so in their place and at their risk) if the supplier says to do so. Or it can allow for anything else agreed between the data supplier and the stocks website.\n\nThe flip side is that this would be a contract case for damages. Unless there are statutory damages (which don't exist in most countries and exist but might not apply in the US), the supplier would have to prove the harm and loss forseeably and directly suffered and would only be compensated for that alone. A lot of breach of contract cases just aren't worth taking to court for that reason \\- because you could prove the contract was breached but not that you lost anything, much less that your loss was a direct result and foreseeable by the end user.\n\n(In the EU, you'd also have to be able to show that the terms were not unreasonable as the law protects consumers from gross disparity if ability to set contract terms, and fixed terms deemed unfair, but that probably wouldn't be an issue here).\n\nThe latter part of the followup is essentially discussing nondisclosure agreements. You don't have to own the data for that \\- there is legal consideration by each party and that's enough (each has given something to the other: \"I will show you some information if you agree to these conditions\"). But that's contractual too, and the same applies, if the user shared the data anyway or disclosed it, your damages would quite likely be limited to the loss you could prove, whatever the contract says.\n\nLast the law on databases/data sets isn't something I know huge amounts about. Where such a law existed, a supplier would probably argue that sufficient original effort went into the collation and organisation of the data and the user would probably counterargue that this was mere storage of data and no original work was involved, or that any damage (if any) was negligible and would have to be proven. As databases have their own law and not pure copyright law, they might be right or wrong, depending on the jurisdiction and wording of the law.\n\nWikipedia articles of relevance to databases/datasets:\n\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_generis_database_right> (global information)\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive> (EU specific and more detail what's covered)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup has developed an app that aggregates and displays real-time stock market quotes from various sources without explicit permission.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Copyright protection for stock quotes is questionable.

However, the answer notes that \"The law provides protection for databases and data sets, where sufficient creativity/choice/curatorship has gone into its creation.\" This suggests that while individual stock prices might not be copyrightable, the curated database might have some protection.\n\n3. The documentation also mentions that data can be protected by contract, stating \"clearly it can be protected by contract but copyright/IP law is less clear.\"\n\n4. The follow-up explanation discusses how breaches of contract could lead to legal action, although damages would need to be proven.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states uncertainty about copyright protection for stock prices. Option B is too absolute, ignoring potential database rights and contract law.

Rather, the entire discourse poetically describes a youth, presumably under the legal adult age of 18 (given restrictions on smoking cigarettes and owning adult literature in the second verse), who faces restrictions upon his or her rights by his legal guardians, in this case a mother, father, and teacher.\n\nWhereas the dictionary definition of the verb form of \"Party\" is defined by Oxford Dictionary as \"Enjoying oneself at a party or other lively gathering, typically with drinking and music.\" As established, the subject of the proposed treaty on this right is legally barred from drinking, though a party may exist without alcohol and thus would not prevent the subject from engaging in an act of partying.\n\nA party or lively gathering would meat the definition of \"Freedom of Peaceful Assembly\" under the First Amendment Rights of the United States Constitution as well as \"Freedom of Association\" under the same amendment. Said party may additionally be for any purpose so long as it is peaceful.\n\nThe state may impose reasonable restrictions on the party, such as noise ordinances, age based restrictions on minors including \"Adult Contents\", cigarettes and alchohol, as discussed. While typcial, they're absence does not prevent the assembly from rising to the level of \"party\" as previous defined.\n\nBeastie Boys contends that the restrictions place upon the subject of their discourse on the Right to Party is unreasonably restricted by the confiscation of several items, enforced school requirements, and dress code as defined by the legal guardian in their right as authority of the youth's rights. Beastie Boys offers little evidence that these restrictions are unreasonable or prevent the subject from \"partying\" as defined above. Beastie Boys do propose that the authority known as the father can not restrict the use of cigarettes by the youth as the father \"smokes two packs a day\". While Beastie Boys is correct that this meets the definition of hypocritical, the father is assumed to be of legal age to purchase cigarettes and is legal allowed to restrict access to them based on reasonable age restrictions and possible heath risks the father wishes to prevent in the youth that he may or may not be suffering from. As there are no formal requirements for a peaceful assembly to rise to the level of party, it can be presumed that these restrictions would not affect the party as defined. It should also be noted that in the Beastie Boys discourse, that the authority figure referred to as mother did not restrict the youths ability to listen to the content of the discourse, nor were any restrictions described tailored in such a fashion as to restrict the discourse specifically.\n\nWhile there is no amendment defining the right to party in the United States Constitution, the 9th Amendment does clearly state that citizens rights are not enumerated in the constitution and other rights not discussed in the constitution may exists and be claimed by the individual.\n\nFrom an originalist standpoint, it is widely accept that a good number of The Framers of the Constitution quite frequently met the accepted definition of the phrase \"Drunk off their Ass\" and thus, would not reasonably be against what can be defined as a \"party\". Additionally, many were participants in an event that was known as the \"Tea Party\", which was agreed by many to be quite the lively gathering at its time and was still viewed as quite the \"radical\" affair of the day, many wearing costumes such as those who attended in clothing traditional of Native Americans. They were also most likely not drunk during the course of this party. Thus, the intent of the framers was never to restrict or deniegn such a right\n\nThus, a reasonable court in the United States would hold that the Right to Party does exist for all U.S. citizens and is inalienable.\n\nBeastie Boys also argues that it is acceptable to fight for one's right to party. This does not conflict with the First Amendment Right to petition government for grievances so long as it is again a peaceable affair. Given the poetic nature of the discourse, we can presume that \"Fight\" would mean to defend or struggle in a non\\-violent manor for such a right. This is backed up through originalism as the restrictions placed on many citizens of Boston for their actions during the Tea Party were subsequently fought against for many years, culminating in the Constitution.\n\nThus, it can be assumed that the United States does recognize the right of the people to party and the right of the people to fight for the aforementioned right. This right would still be subject to reasonable time, manner, and place restrictions so long as said restrictions are content neutral to the message of the party.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A group of college students plans to organize a large-scale party in a residential area, citing their \"right to party.\" Local authorities are considering shutting it down due to noise complaints.

I recently browsed through a book by Antonin Scalia in which he outlines a number of specific principles he endorses and does not endorse, with citations to earlier case law. Apparently there is some debate about the merits of such principles and how (or whether) judicial interpretation of legislation comports with legislators' understanding of what they are doing.\n\nIt is clear that many of these \"canons\" can be overridden on a per\\-law basis by including language in the law that explicitly goes against some judicial principle that would otherwise apply. However, my question is, are the principles themselves subject to legislative control in a broader sense? Can legislatures pass \"meta\\-laws\" which define how other laws are to be intepreted? For instance, could the US Congress pass a law saying \"Wherever ambiguity arises in statutory interpretation, the statute in question shall be understood as to favor the least powerful party in a dispute\"? Or \"No special deference shall be given to interpretation of statute by administrative agencies\" (i.e., to curtail Chevron deference)? Or more generally, can a legislature pass a law saying \"The law shall be understood as X\", where X is some principle of intepretation that is not specific to the law in which it is contained, but is meant to constrain interpretations of all other laws (or some subset of other laws)? Would such laws be valid?\n\nI'm interested mostly in the situation in the US, but would be interested to know how the issue could play out in different countires, or in particular US states.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, legislative bodies can pass legislation that constrains the interpretation of the rest of their legislation.\n\nIn the U.S., see [1 U.S.C \u00a71\\-8](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/chapter-1).\n\nIn Canada, see [The Interpretation Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-21/FullText.html).\n\nIn British Columbia, see [The Interpretation Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96238_01).\n\nAs an example of a back\\-and\\-forth between the courts and congress regarding a setting a standard of review, consider the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).

S. 872 (1990\\), the Supreme Court held that \"neutral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden the exercise of religion usually do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment\".\n* Congress desired a stricter test that prohibited the burdening of religion *regardless* of whether the laws are neutral or generally applicable.\n* Congress passed RFRA in 1993, which required that \"\\[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that application of the burden\nto the person \u2014 (1\\) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest; and (2\\) is the least restrictive means\nof furthering that compelling governmental interest\".\n\nRFRA was passed with the goal of setting the standard of review for all other legislation that burdens a person's exercise of religion. Without RFRA, the standard of review would have been that used in *Smith*, based solely on First Amendment protections. *With* RFRA, the standard of review became stronger, basically strict scrutiny.\n\nAn example of Congress setting the factors to be used in a balancing test is the addition of fair use via the Copyright Act of 1976\\. Prior to 1976, courts had been applying a fair use exception based on common law rather than statute. The act encoded in statute the four factors that Congress wanted to be considered and listed several purposes for which fair use was explicitly applicable.

While legislatures can pass laws guiding statutory interpretation (as evidenced by examples like 1 U.S.C \u00a71-8), courts generally retain some discretion in how they interpret laws. The most likely outcome is C because:\n\n1. Courts typically resist attempts to completely constrain their interpretative authority, viewing it as a core judicial function.\n2. However, courts also generally give weight to legislative directives on interpretation when they exist.\n3. The principle of separation of powers suggests that while the legislature can provide guidance, it cannot entirely dictate judicial methodology.\n4. Courts often seek to balance new interpretative directives against established principles and canons of interpretation.\n5. This approach allows the court to acknowledge the legislature's role in shaping interpretation while preserving judicial discretion and the ability to resolve ambiguities effectively.\n\nOptions A and B represent extreme positions that are less likely. A would cede too much judicial power, while B might unnecessarily create conflict between branches.

This process is not necessarily related to flight risk or evidence tampering, which are often reasons for pre-trial detention but not for the initial arrest and arraignment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the arrest may have a public impact, its legal purpose is not to demonstrate severity or deter future crimes. This would contradict the presumption of innocence principle mentioned in the question.\n\nOption C is incorrect because immediate questioning and evidence gathering are not typically part of the arraignment process. These activities would generally occur during the investigation phase, prior to indictment.\n\nOption D is incorrect because preventing the defendant from influencing witnesses or jurors is not the primary purpose of the arrest for arraignment. Such concerns would be addressed through other legal mechanisms if deemed necessary.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the purpose of arraignment, the distinction between arrest and detention, and the principle of presumption of innocence.

How can I locate the relevant information (IRS and Dep. of State) that accommodates this scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Congress and the president control processes such as passport issuance by passing laws, which are subject to judicial review. Within the framework of the three\\-way checks and balances, therefore, the federal government as a whole is responsible for determining the rules for such a process.\n\nThe income tax process is also defined by federal laws. Since the federal government controls both processes, it is free to create interdependencies between those processes. For example, it can require passport applicants to give their social security numbers if it wants to be able to cancel the passports of those who are delinquent in paying their taxes.\n\nThe \"bill by congress\" does not become binding law until signed by the president, as you no doubt are aware. Independent government agencies may create requirements for inter\\-agency business by agreement, as long as that does not conflict with the law. Some statutes will say things like \"... or as so\\-and\\-so may by regulation provide.\" This hints at the existence of another important code, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

[In particular](https://www.albertaregulations.ca/pdfs/hunting-regs/Licensing.pdf):\n\n> Hunters must possess a valid Wildlife Certificate and the applicable\n> hunting licence to hunt big game or game birds.\n\nThis includes bow hunting. And, as you note, Section 52 of the Wildlife Act, which prohibits shooting within 200 yards of an occupied building (unless it's your own). Realistically, there aren't many places in an urban municipality that are not within 200 yards of an occupied building.\n\n**If your conduct endangers the public or obstructs others rights**\n\nIn many circumstances, shooting arrows with a bow could constitute a common nuisance.

During the rainy seasons of 2017\\-2018 and the very wet 2018\\-2019, the tenant reported, on multiple occasions, leaks from the roof. These never seemed to have been properly addressed.\n\nMore recently, there was a severe enough leak that caused some damage by splattering as it dripped. The water is a dark rust color, and stains everything it touches.\n\nMore recently, water trapped in the ceiling insulation (which is held up by a plastic barrier) proved to be too heavy for the plastic and it ruptured, leaking all over numerous belongings. The landlord is unwilling to cover this damage, telling me that's what the tenant's insurance is for. The tenant has insurance that should cover this, but one of the few obligations the lease places on the landlord is to keep the roof in good working order.\n\nWhat are the legal options? It's very hard to search for information for commercial leases; almost everything online is about residential leases.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIs the landlord typically liable for damage to contents in a situation like this (that is, when they've failed to maintain the roof in proper working order, and the resulting water ingress damages the contents)? Or is it some kind of standard practice that the tenant's insurance should pay, and then the insurance company deals with the landlord?\n\nThe next question is, what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing?\n\nThe most important thing is to get the landlord to fix the roof to prevent further damage. Talking to other tenants suffering similar damage, it seems they're reluctant to fix it, and downright unwilling to pay for damages.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, keeping the roof in working order is the obligation of the landlord in a commercial modified gross lease. It would honestly be quite unusual for the tenant's insurance to cover it, and it would likewise be unusual for the landlord not to have insurance that covers an incident like this to the extent that it is insurable (usually, deterioration of a roof is not covered by anyone's insurance unless it is caused by a specific event like a hail storm, or toilet seat from an aircraft that blew up in mid\\-flight crashing down on it (if you miss the allusion to \"Dead Like Me\", don't sweat it)).\n\nIf the tenant's insurance does pay, it would normally have a right to subrogate against the landlord (i.e. sue the landlord for the money that it was out), but many commercial leases have an anti\\-subrogation clause that prohibits a tenant's insurer from pursuing a subrogation claim against the landlord (not all leases have such a term, but many do), since this is really the landlord's responsibility.\n\nThe landlord ordinarily would be liable to the tenant for damage foreseeably caused by the failure to the landlord to do what the landlord is obligated to do, but this is complicated because the tenant has a duty to mitigate damages if reasonably possible. So, rather than just allowing its stuff to be water damaged, the tenant is obligated to do what is necessary to prevent the damage (at least, if this is cheaper than allowing the damage to occur) and then sue for the cost of mitigation, rather than for the damage itself.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in many commercial leases, the landlord's obligation to repair is not triggered until a demand is made, the landlord refused, the tenant gives a written notice of default to the landlord, and the landlord does not address the problem within a \"cure\" period of a specified number of days after receiving the notice of default. A review of the lease for such provisions is in order.\n\nIf the landlord is allegedly in default, it may be possible to bring a lawsuit to compel the landlord to do the repair, or better yet, for the tenants to give the proper notices, then to make the repair, and then to withhold rent in the amount of the alleged damage or to sue the landlord for the cost of mitigation and to collect a judgment by withholding rent as a setoff against the judgment. If the lease is long enough for the litigation to run its course and still have enough of the lease left to setoff against rent due to collect, that may be a viable option.\n\n> what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing?\n\nReal estate, business law, commercial litigation and business litigation would all be common specialties for a law firm that handles this kind of dispute to advertise.\n\nLawyers who primarily do criminal law, immigration law, custody cases, personal injury, personal bankruptcy cases, and defense of residential evictions, would typically be inappropriate.\n\nThe lawyer will not be cheap, but usually, in a commercial lease situation, the dollar stakes are considerable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A commercial tenant in San Fernando, CA, has been experiencing recurring roof leaks for two years, resulting in significant damage to their belongings.

The correct answer, D, is the most strategic approach because:\n\n1. It follows the proper legal procedure often outlined in commercial leases. Many leases require a formal notice of default and a specified cure period before the tenant can take action.\n\n2. It gives the landlord a documented opportunity to address the issue, which strengthens the tenant's position if legal action becomes necessary.\n\n3. If the landlord fails to act, it allows the tenant to mitigate damages by making repairs, which is a legal obligation mentioned in the documentation.\n\n4.

US $100 bills are a prime example of \"money\".

Anyone can print or otherwise \"emit\" objects with economic value, and such objects can be voluntarily accepted in trade. State and local governments can incur debts and thus spend money now that they do not yet have, as long as there is no legal limit on a government's ability to go into debt. California could issue IOU\\-bucks with the intent that a holder could redeem them as real federal money or as gold or silver at some point.\n\nThis limits the ability of a state treasury to print money, since in principle and practice\nit is redeemable in gold or silver. Each state has some set of laws and constitutional provisions that prevent writing rubber checks *ad infinitum*, for example only allowing debt for large capital projects (building) and requiring voter approval; requiring expenditures to not exceed projected revenues; granting emergency debt\\-mitigation powers (e.g. hiring freezes) to the governor when a state does go into unauthorized debt. In California, [Art IV \u00a712](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2012.&article=IV) of the state constitution requires a balanced budget, meaning that the state cannot create infinite obligations without infinite revenues.\n\nFrom the legal perspective, private banks do not create money, although non\\-legally, [people may talk about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) what banks do as \"creating money\".

But it would be difficult to show that people browsing through cars have intent to commit a crime, because the car dealership is in the business of selling cars, people have to get into a car to evaluate it, and during business hours, people enter the cars without salesmen.\n\nFlorida laws doesn't clearly differentiate between locked and unlocked doors when entering a conveyance or building; but obviously there would damage to a car by forcing entry by braking a window or crowbarring the door, and that is a separate crime covered under the same chapter of law.\n\nThe second point is the qualifier that \"...unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited.\"\n\nOne could argue that the dealership \\- by not securing the car lot with a fence or signage that states \"no trespassing\" during certain hours \\- is still open to the public, even though the dealership is obviously private property. And by remaining accessible after hours, the public has been invited onto the property.\n\nIf you looked, you may see boilerplate signage at the dealership that states it is open after hours, though they are not responsible for injuries, etc.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A group of friends decides to visit a car dealership after hours to casually browse vehicles without salespeople present. They find the lot accessible and some car doors unlocked. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in a burglary charge under Florida law?\n\nA) The friends open unlocked car doors and sit inside to test the comfort, without touching anything else.\nB) One friend takes a branded keychain from an unlocked car's glovebox as a souvenir.\nC) The group takes photos of car interiors through the windows without opening any doors.\nD) A friend accidentally breaks a side mirror while squeezing between two closely parked cars.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the Florida burglary statute and application to a real-world scenario. The key elements to consider are:\n\n1. Intent to commit an offense\n2. Entering a conveyance (in this case, a car)\n3. Whether the premises are open to the public or the group is invited\n\nOption A doesn't likely constitute burglary because there's no clear intent to commit an offense. The dealership's business involves allowing people to enter cars, and leaving them unlocked could be seen as an implicit invitation.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it involves entering the car (a conveyance) with the intent to commit an offense (theft of the keychain). This meets the definition of burglary under Florida law, even if the car is unlocked.\n\nOption C doesn't involve entering the cars, so it doesn't meet the definition of burglary.\n\nOption D, while potentially involving property damage, is accidental and lacks the intent required for burglary. It might result in other charges, but not burglary.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring students to integrate multiple concepts from the law (intent, entering, and public access) and apply them to a nuanced real-world scenario. The distractors represent common misconceptions about what constitutes burglary, particularly focusing on the importance of intent rather than just the act of entering an unlocked vehicle."}, "95": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41579/gdpr-can-we-ask-the-building-owner-to-share-and-or-destroy-data-about-ones-rfi", "docs_id": 41579, "title": "GDPR: can we ask the building owner to share and/or destroy data about one&#39;s RFID activity?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: this is a follow up of [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/84184/do\\-rfid\\-key\\-cards\\-track\\-the\\-user\\-through\\-entry\\-ways](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/84184/do-rfid-key-cards-track-the-user-through-entry-ways)\n\nIt seems most buildings store the activity of one's RFID key activity.\n\nIn the era of GDPR, I was wondering whether I would be allowed to ask for that data or ask for that data to be destroyed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would start by enquiring as to WHICH Personal Data they have about you and if any was obtained via \"Track and Tracing\" (RFID).\n\nIf the answer is YES, I would further inquire about the Lawful Base (since, and assuming you have not Consent to it), plus processing \"purpose\" and \"scope\".\n\nIf they argue Legitimate Interest, you can request the performed Impact Assessment and based on the answer you have documented grounds to demand it's erasure or at least a confirmation of processing \"scope\" limitation, that you may resort to if a dispute arises.\n\nIt helps to get documented proof... and this is one linear way to do it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A multinational company uses RFID key cards to track employee access in its buildings across Europe.

It starts by asking which personal data is collected, including whether it's obtained via RFID tracking. This establishes the scope of the inquiry and ensures the employee understands what information is being processed.\n\n2.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"arbitration is final and binding,\" which is a fundamental principle of arbitration agreements.\n2. While the original arbitration agreement did not require FCRA claims to be arbitrated, the consumer chose to proceed with arbitration for their FCRA claim. By doing so, they effectively agreed to be bound by the arbitration outcome for this specific claim.\n3. The discovery of new evidence does not typically provide grounds for overturning an arbitration decision. The documentation mentions only very limited grounds for appealing an arbitration decision, such as arbitrator misconduct or decisions against public policy.\n4. The question tests the understanding that participating in arbitration without raising jurisdictional issues at the outset precludes raising such issues later.\n\nOption A is incorrect because once the consumer chose arbitration for the FCRA claim, they can't simply switch to litigation after losing.\n\nOption B is plausible but incorrect. The binding nature of arbitration generally doesn't allow for new hearings based solely on new evidence.\n\nOption D is a distractor based on the 28-day appeal period mentioned in the documentation.

Does this reduce the risk of genericization? Is there any other legal advantage to doing this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is capitalized because the word NEXIUM has a conspicuous definition. In other words, they're using it in the specific way they have defined it to mean. This is to differentiate it from any other meaning it may have in some other context. Obviously with NEXIUM, it's a word they just made up and it's very unlikely that it could ever be confused with anything other than their particular drug.\n\nBut what if the drug were called PRAXIA? The word praxia might be confused with the medical term. It's also the name of a city in Romania (I just learned that while looking that word up). But PRAXIA in all caps refers specifically to their drug, and there can be no ambiguity between that and other uses of the term.\n\nThis is especially important for drugs, since they are legally required to disclose the side effects in their advertising, and you wouldn't want someone potentially confusing the name of the drug with the condition it treats.\n\nYou see this in contracts as well. When a contract provision is written in ALL CAPS, it is done to conspicuously call attention to the text, either because it is redefining an established legal term or is modifying rights you may have under the law (e.g. LIMITED WARRANTY, SEVERABILITY, BINDING ARBITRATION, etc.)\n\nThere is no established rule for this, by the way. It's mostly a matter of style. Some laws require conspicuous disclosure of certain provisions in contracts, so ALL CAPS has traditionally been used to meet that requirement.\n\nNOTE: The term \"Nexium\" (not in caps) is simply the registered trademark for the drug. It simply protects their intellectual property (i.e. the name), and isn't intended to describe or define anything in a legal way.\n\n---\n\n**Fun fact:** Subway got sued for making \"Footlong\" sandwiches that were not actually 12 inches in length. They tried to argue that \"Footlong\" was a trademark and not intended to convey the length of their sandwiches. They settled the lawsuit, because really, that's a jackass move right there.
