If Website B downloaded the free image from Website A and is selling it without permission, it would be safe to use the image from Website A under the Creative Commons license. This scenario aligns with Case 2 in the documentation, where Website A is the original source of the image and has the right to offer it under a Creative Commons license.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if Website A purchased the image from Website B, they wouldn't automatically have the right to re-license it under Creative Commons unless explicitly granted that right.\n\nOption C, while similar to B, doesn't necessarily guarantee that Website A has the right to offer the image under Creative Commons. The original creation is important, but the key is that Website A is the source of the Creative Commons license.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's not safe in all scenarios.

They got this information from ISPs with a permission from the court. They are asking for about 4,500 Swedish Krona (\\~514 USD) as a fine for downloading a copyrighted movie material (on behalf of a bunch of film makers/producers). They also mentioned that if subsciber don't pay this amount, they will increase the fine and/or they will file a lawsuit against them! \n\nThe surprising thing is that they are a 100% legal company and the letter seems legit! I can confirm this is not a scam, as we contacted police and our ISP.\n\nConsidering almost all internet subscribers today have wifi routers and open internet access, its too vague who had really download such copyrighted materials. If they really file a lawsuit against the subscribers (in case of no payment), can subscibers claim they had a wifi router and they provided the username/password to so many people and its not clear who is the \"guilty person\" ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Literal Answer:** Anyone can file a lawsuit for anything, doesn't mean you will win or that the judge will let it go as far as trial, but you can certainly file a lawsuit.\n\n**Deeper answer:** Yes they can file a lawsuit assuming they have been given authority to represent the copyright holders.\n\nThe problem with succeeding in such a lawsuit is proving who is liable. This is contractual, but as the ISP customer it's possible that you signed that you would be responsible for the traffic going to your ISP. If this is not the case, it can be hard to prove who is responsible. \n\nThere is also the issue of did the movie actually download? Just because you clicked a link to download, does not mean a download happened and that could be hard to for the other side to prove.\n\nThen there is the question of what is the intent of the letters? Do they want people to be aware that they will be caught and stop pirating or do they really want 4,500 X 25,000 Swedish Krona?

While claiming to have an open WiFi network and providing access to multiple users can make it difficult to prove who exactly downloaded copyrighted material, it doesn't automatically absolve the subscriber of all responsibility. The subscriber's liability may depend on the terms of their contract with the ISP, which could potentially hold them responsible for all traffic associated with their account. This defense can complicate the lawsuit but doesn't guarantee immunity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply stating they have an open WiFi network isn't enough to avoid all liability.

This is evident from the documentation provided, which emphasizes that attorneys should be paid for doing work with the client's best interests in mind. The concern is that paying referral fees might influence recommendations based on financial incentives rather than what's best for the client.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while established firms might benefit from such rules, protecting their financial interests is not the primary intent. Option C is not the main focus of these rules, as they don't directly address profession exclusivity. Option D is also incorrect, as limiting competition is not the stated purpose of these ethical guidelines.\n\nThe correct answer, B, aligns with the explanation that paying referral fees could lead to recommending an attorney based on financial incentives rather than the client's best interests, which is the core ethical concern these rules aim to address."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16438/was-cannabis-legal-in-the-u-s-in-1969-1970", "docs_id": 16438, "title": "Was cannabis legal in the U.S. in 1969-1970?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In 1969, Timothy Leary challenged the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 in *[Leary v.

The Narcotics Control Act of 1956 and the Boggs Act depended on the now-invalidated Marihuana Tax Act, so they were not enforceable. The Pure Food and Drug Act only imposed labeling requirements and did not prohibit cannabis. In this interim period, cannabis regulation fell primarily to individual states. Some states had adopted laws based on the Uniform State Narcotic Act, while others may have had their own regulations or no regulations at all. Therefore, while cannabis wasn't explicitly legal at the federal level, there was no direct federal prohibition in place until the Controlled Substances Act was enacted in October 1970.

While contract modifications typically require new consideration from both parties to be enforceable, employment contracts are a special case. The ability of an employer to offer pay raises without new consideration from the employee is so common in all industries that courts consider it to be an implicit term in employment contracts.

Generally, one party provides the actual text of such contract, which, depending on circumstances, could potentially be modified by the other party prior to execution (especially when dealing B2B or between somewhat equal entities).\n\nRealistically, in most circumstances, a multipage document is not legally required in order to execute most agreements like rent or services. However, the perception exists that the legalese must be signed. Vast majority of contracts don't explicitly specify the \u00a9 copyright for the text of the contract itself.\n\nFrom a copyright perspective, you can't really just take some work and republish it, even if the work in question may be missing the \u00a9 copyright symbol, as it may still be copyrighted. However:\n\n* What's the situation with reusing the text of the contracts you've been a party to? Would that by default be prohibited by whoever the copyright owner of the contract may be? And how would you even find out the owner, or if there is one? Is copyright even at stake here, as neither the general public nor the copyright owner would possibly be aware of this copying and derivative work taking place?\n* Does it at all invalidate the agreement itself if the party that supplied the contract doesn't actually own the copyright to it? After all, if you're not legally allowed to have a copy of the text that specifies the terms of the contract, how would it be possible to adhere to such terms?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Multipage contracts, like any multipage texts, will likely bear some level of originality and so they will have a copyright owner. Absent a license allowing you to reuse the text, you will not be allowed to do so.\n\nThe fact that you were a party to a contract represented by the text does not change your position: your contract does not have anything to do with the copyright of its text, therefore you still need to honor the copyright as if you were not a party to the contract.\n\nIt is not uncommon that the copyright will be owned by the lawyer who drafted the text. Your business partner who supplied it would have employed/contracted one. Or, the lawyer could have provided the text to your business partner together with the copyright (less common).\n\n> Why wouldn't fair\\-use be at play here? Don't you already get the permission to copy and modify the contract from the original party when they send it to you? (Is such right only limited to original execution?)\n\nThe original party, whether it is the copyright owner or just a license holder, can send the text to you for possible copy and modification in the course of executing the contract **with that party** only. The copy that you receive is provided solely with the express purpose to make you an offer (so that you know the terms of the contract) and give opportunity to suggest modifications i.e. make a counter\\-offer.\n\nTo reuse the text with another party you need a permission/license from the copyright owner. Fair\\-use won't play here because you'd be using the text for the purpose it was created for\u2014executing contracts\u2014as opposed to, say, writing a research paper on language/phrases used in legal documents.\n\n> Does it at all invalidate the agreement itself if the party that supplied the contract doesn't actually own the copyright to it? After all, if you're not legally allowed to have a copy of the text that specifies the terms of the contract, how would it be possible to adhere to such terms?\n\nMost contracts do not even need to be in writing. The text will be just one of the *evidences* if your contract, not the contract itself. No matter whether you obtained the text legally or not, it still does its job as evidence.

The copyright of a contract's text typically belongs to the person or entity that created it, which is often the lawyer or law firm that drafted it. Even though Sarah was a party to the contract, this doesn't grant her copyright permissions. The large corporation may not own the copyright either, but rather have a license to use it.

They are also, often, conceptually a division of state government, even if the DA is locally elected. So, any criminal defense engagement in the same state court system would also be a conflict of interest, and the reality of joint task forces discussed below would also make almost any federal case criminal defense engagement in the same state a conflict of interest in most cases because state prosecutors would gain confidential information about pending federal criminal prosecutions (and vice versa).\n\nIn theory, a criminal defense engagement in the next state over, for example, say, in Gary, Indiana for a prosecutor employed in Chicago, Illinois, would not be a conflict of interest, but it would still be prohibited in most cases because the prosecutor is a full time salaried employee whose full efforts are required to be devote to that position. (In practice, *de minimis* civil transactional work for the assistance of friends and family members, even for a small fee, or representation of such persons in small civil lawsuits would probably be tolerated, however, and maybe even a defense of a civil ordinance violation like a traffic ticket brought by a separate local government as discussed below, for a friend or family member for free, might be tolerated.)\n\nLocal governments such as cities, towns, and counties, however, sometime have an office separate from the DA's office or State Attorney General's office often called a city attorney, town attorney, or county attorney, who works part\\-time on a contract basis for that government and has limited authority to prosecution violations of that local government's own ordinances in the name of that governmental entity, rather than on behalf of the People as part of the state government.\n\nIn those cases, it is generally ethically permissible for the city attorney (for example) to serve as a criminal defense attorney in cases outside that city that do not otherwise pose a conflict of interest from having been adverse to various criminal defendants in the city attorney role. But there might be a conflict of interest, if, for example, there was a joint task force of the city attorney, the local DA, and the federal assistant U.S. attorney to prosecute people in a coordinated fashion on federal, state and local charges of various kinds, in connection with a rash of gun violence. And, if one of the city attorney's clients were arrested for an ordinance violation in the city, a non\\-conflicted counsel would have to be retained by the city for that case.\n\nOften, in those cases, however, even though it is not a prohibited conflict of interest, the lawyers involved would view a criminal defense representation as a \"business development conflict\" that would risk non\\-renewal of the city/town/county attorney position if undertaken.\n\nIncidentally, government attorneys, unlike almost all other government employees, are usually employees at will, as a matter of legal professional ethics, unlike almost all other fixed term contract or civil service employees, even if they have other contractual or civil service employee rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A full-time prosecutor working for a District Attorney's office in California wants to take on pro bono criminal defense work in her spare time.

The U.S., like all other countries, is fully sovereign in executing its laws over its territories (land, air, space, aircrafts, ships etc.) regardless of the legal fiction of passing through the customs and border controls, subject to its laws and international treaties it has agreed to and ratified.\n\nEven in a country with exit control or separate areas for international departure, its law still fully applies after exit control or at the departure area, but certain legal provisions may not apply in a certain area for certain purposes (customs, taxation, VAT, etc.), **only because that country's law says so**.\n\nFor example, with respect to criminal offences, the Tokyo Convention limits (and extends) the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over an aircraft in flight:\n\n> *Art. 1, para. 3* For the purposes of this Convention, an aircraft is considered to be in flight\n> **from the moment when power is applied for the purpose of take\\-off** until the moment\n> when the landing run ends.\n\n> *Art. 4* A Contracting State which is not the State of registration may not **interfere with an\n> aircraft in flight in order to exercise its criminal jurisdiction** over an offence\n> committed on board except in the following cases:\n> \n> \n> * (a) the offence has effect on the territory of such State;\n> * (b) the offence has been committed by or against a national or permanent resident of such State;\n> * (c) the offence is against the security of such State;\n> * (d) the offence consists of a breach of any rules or regulations relating to the flight or manoeuvre of aircraft in force in such\n> State;\n> * (e) the exercise of jurisdiction is necessary to ensure the observance of any obligation of such State under a multilateral\n> international agreement.\n\nhowever, Art. 4 is a limitation of the manner of exercising a State's criminal jurisdiction over foreign vessels (you cannot interfere with operation of international flights except in limited circumstances); it does not abrogate the claimed jurisdiction itself, nor does it limit the State's authority of aircrafts registered under its laws:\n\n> *Art. 3, para. 3\\.* This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in\n> accordance with national law.\n\nThe United States (the federal government) claims a [special aircraft jurisdiction](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1405-special-aircraft-jurisdiction-us) as well as a special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States in regard to [various offences](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46506) (e.g. offences against aircrafts, murder, certain sex offences etc.). For the purpose of the special aircraft jurisdiction which applies to certain foreign aircrafts (that have a scheduled destination or departure point in the U.S.),\n\n> An aircraft is \"in flight\" from the moment when all external doors are closed following embarkation until the moment when one such door is opened for disembarkation, or in the case of a forced landing, until competent authorities take responsibility for the aircraft. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46501(1\\).\n\nSo in cases where this jurisdiction could apply (or be considered to be as if it would apply), you do not leave the jurisdiction until your aircraft is ready for disembarkment. Of course, this line of argument could be a slippery slope that leads to the conclusion that you never \"leave\" (even if you never \"entered\") the U.S. (or any given country) since there are also offences that the U.S. (or another country) claims worldwide jurisdiction.\n\n---\n\nFor cases related to your linked question\n-----------------------------------------\n\nCBP publishes a guide on [diverted flights](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Sep/CBP-Memo-Carriers-Flight-Diversion-20190516-seal-508.pdf), which states\n\n> Passengers and crew on flights departing the United States for foreign destinations that make an\n> unscheduled stop in the United States due to any emergency, including but not limited to fuelrelated, weather\\-related, mechanical\\-related, illness on board, or other emergency reason,\n> **generally** are not be processed by CBP, but treated as a domestic arrival.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A flight departing from New York to London is forced to make an emergency landing in Boston due to a medical emergency on board.

Still, we will have to wait to see what the courts rule, if it goes that far. We should start with [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), 392 U.S. 1, which found that\n\n> in justifying the particular intrusion, the police officer must be\n>  able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together\n>  with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that\n>  intrusion. The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only\n>  when it is assured that, at some point, the conduct of those charged\n>  with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral\n>  scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a\n>  particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances.\n>  And, in making that assessment, it is imperative that the facts be\n>  judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the\n>  officer at the moment of the seizure or the search \"warrant a man of\n>  reasonable caution in the belief\" that the action taken was\n>  appropriate?\n\nThe Montana officer did \"articulate\" a reason, in saying \"Ma\u2019am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here\". In articulating an excuse, the officer has not passed the test of providing \"rational inferences from those facts\". Of course, the law also does not require an officer to explain his reasoning to the suspect. In *Terry*, the officer\n\n> had never seen the two men before, and he was unable to say\n>  precisely what first drew his eye to them. However, he testified that\n>  he had been a policeman for 39 years and a detective for 35, and that\n>  he had been assigned to patrol this vicinity of downtown Cleveland for\n>  shoplifters and pickpockets for 30 years. He explained that he had\n>  developed routine habits of observation over the years, and that he\n>  would \"stand and watch people or walk and watch people at many\n>  intervals of the day.\" He added: \"Now, in this case, when I looked\n>  over, they didn't look right to me at the time.\"\n\nThe reasoning in these cases is quite parallel: an appeal to a subjectively felt unusualness of a circumstance. There may be a factual dispute over how often Spanish (or Nakhota) is spoken in public in Havre, but we may assume that Spanish is spoken much less often than English. Still, a well\\-grounded belief that a person speaks Spanish (let us stipulate that it is fluent) is not at all evidence that a person has committed a crime. The inference is no more rational than McFadden's inference from \"I don't know you\" to \"You must be a criminal\". \n\nSee [US v. Brignoni\\-Ponce](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/422/873/), 422 U.S. 873, which held that\n\n> an officer whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a\n>  particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country\n>  may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about\n>  their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain\n>  suspicious circumstances... To allow roving patrols the broad and\n>  unlimited discretion urged by the Government to stop all vehicles in\n>  the border area without any reason to suspect that they have violated\n>  any law, would not be \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment...The\n>  Fourth Amendment therefore forbids stopping persons for questioning\n>  about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they\n>  may be aliens.\n\nThe court has\n\n> refused to find that Mexican ancestry alone supported such a \"founded\n>  suspicion\"\n\nSpeaking Spanish is as much evidence of foreign ancestry as speaking English is (referring to the Nakhota situation, ethnic Nakhota speak English all the time, but *they* do not have foreign ancestry).

Manzo Jurado](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1374519.html)\n\n> Given...inability to speak English, proximity to the border, and\n>  unsuspicious behavior \\- law enforcement lacked reasonable suspicion\n>  that Appellant and his co\\-workers were in this country illegally.\n\nMoreover, the Manzo Jurado event took place in Havre MT.

Based on cases like Terry v. Ohio, US v. Brignoni-Ponce, and US v. Manzo Jurado, speaking Spanish alone does not constitute reasonable suspicion for detention. The Supreme Court has ruled that Mexican ancestry (or by extension, speaking Spanish) is not sufficient grounds for suspicion of illegal status. Furthermore, the case of US v. Manzo Jurado specifically addressed the issue of Spanish speakers in Havre, Montana, finding that even the inability to speak English near the border was not enough to justify reasonable suspicion. Therefore, the officer's actions in detaining the women for 40 minutes based solely on hearing them speak Spanish likely violates Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because case law has established that speaking a foreign language is not inherently suspicious. Option B is wrong because an officer's explanation does not make an unlawful detention legal. Option D is incorrect because while there are some expanded powers within 100 miles of the border, they still require reasonable suspicion, which speaking Spanish alone does not provide."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80758/short-term-rental-application-process-and-security-deposit", "docs_id": 80758, "title": "Short-term rental application process and security deposit", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was looking for an apartment for 6 months in New Jersey and found one apartment.

That does impose on you an obligation to read the paperwork and any materials referenced by the lease. When you have accepted the offer (especially after you have handed over money as a deposit), they cannot unilaterally change the offer. Signing the lease is legal proof that you have accepted the contract, but your prior conduct (giving them money) is also proof of acceptance.\n\nThey are free to politely (or impolitely) *ask* you to pay them extra money, so you just have to bear in mind that you have no legal obligation to comply with their wish.

According to the information provided, the exclusionary rule would typically apply to evidence obtained through an illegal search. However, the independent source doctrine creates an exception for evidence that is obtained independently of the illegal search. In this case, the police officer's testimony about the discovery would be inadmissible as it directly results from the illegal search. Similarly, any physical evidence found during the initial illegal search would also be inadmissible. However, the victims' testimonies are considered an independent source of evidence, as they are not directly derived from the illegal search itself. Their testimonies would be admissible in court, and could potentially lead to the admissibility of physical evidence through independent discovery. Option A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the exclusionary rule. Option B is partially correct but wrongly includes the admissibility of physical evidence from the initial search.

This will be a hypothetical example. \n\nHypothetically, if a 19 year old male (living overseas, say in Turkey) sexts/exchanges nudes with a female who says she is 18 (living in the US) and then it turns out that she lied about her age and she's 16 or 15, for example, and 2 years later her parents discover about this sexting and decide to take legal action against the person living overseas, what could be done? (Assume that there's no screenshots of when she lied about her age and said she's 18\\)\n\nWould he be extradited? And under which jurisdiction?

But I still would like the opinion of people well\\-versed in law please. Assume it happened on a fake Facebook account or the Kik app for instance. \n\nAs you know, there's a lot of scams like this but my question assumes that the situation isn't a scam. So for the sake of example, please assume that there is no scam and that the situation is 100% real. \n\nWould you tell this guy to calm down, or that he should wait till the statue of limitations (7 years I guess) for this kind of thing is over, for example? He is legitimately considering hanging himself because his parents live in the US and he doesn't want his mom to see him behind bars for something he did 2 years ago. I talked him out of hanging himself recently and told him that nothing is going to happen and he should breathe easy. But he's genuinely afraid and keeps getting paranoid. If you have noticed, I keep posting here about related subjects trying to find answers for this guy. He contacted a lawyer who basically said that the chances he will be prosecuted are slim but not impossible. This even made him more paranoid. It could be a scam and it could be a 50 year old man who lied and said he's an 18 year old female, but I want to take a worst case scenario to calm my friend down and tell him the worst consequences possible. (Assume he owns the router and Wi\\-Fi connection but the rent is registered with another family member's name)\n\nThank you. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several elements working in your friend's favor. The first is \"guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" In an entrapment case, the police have recordings or documents claiming that the \"girl\" was underaged. If there is no such smoking gun from the (real) girl, the case (probably) would not be prosecuted in the U.S. He doesn't have to prove that she told him she was 18; \"she\" (or the police) has to prove that she told him she was \"not.\"\n\nThe second factor is \"remoteness\" in time, and distance. Two years after a U.S. state sent me a \"nasty letter,\" I asked my lawyer if the state would ever come after me. He answered, \"If they were going to do this, you would have heard further by now.\" The other factor, distance and cross border, (three countries: Turkey, the U.S., his home country) further militates against prosecution except for highly aggravating circumstances such as drug dealing, gambling, or sex for pay. \n\nA third factor is that your friend would not come close to qualifying as a \"serious offender.\" This would be someone like a drug dealer, or the head of a \"call girl\" ring. The cops concentrate their effects on big \"busts\" like this that make their careers, not \"small fry\" like your friend. But of course they use the publicity from the big catches to scare everyone else.\n\nWhile there is no \"guarantee\" against \"the worst possible consequences,\" the chances of them happening are similar to his getting hit by lightening, and less than his chances of being hit by a car crossing the street. No one stresses out about *those* chances.

The husband earns 150K before tax, has no saving, no properties and won't take anything from the 2 houses. \n\nThe wife doesn't want any alimony but only child support. The 2 kids are to stay with mom. What would be a fair amount for child support?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are statutory guidelines that are based upon the gross income of each parent, the number of children, the extraordinary expenses of the children, and number of nights a child spends with each parent, which are adopted by states in order for the states to be eligible for federal welfare programs; although standards vary somewhat. Income can be imputed if a party has an ability to earn income but does not exercise it. But, assets owned aren't considered unless they produce or could produce income.\n\nIn the absence of a showing of unfitness sufficient to terminate the parental rights of a parent for abuse or neglect, or some extremely unique circumstance (e.g., one parent is on the space station 365 days a year), no parent ever has 100% of the nights with the children.\n\nWithout having a more realistic estimate of the number of nights with each child, and a fair guess of the capacity of mom to earn income including income from stock trades, it isn't possible to make a realistic estimate.\n\nTo get the correct estimate, you would need to do a full fledged child support guidelines calculation, but this question doesn't have enough information to do that. A good rule of thumb is that child support for two children is typically about 25% of the difference in income of the couple times the number of days that one parent has a child more than the the parent, divided by the number of days in the year. \n\nFor a pretty typical parenting time division, that would work out to about 10% of the difference in income between the parties paid by the higher income party to the less high income party within a normal range. But this is strictly a rule of thumb.\n\nHowever, in a case like the one you describe, the rental value of one of the houses would probably be imputed as income to the wife, as would the profits she makes in an average year from stock trades. The rental value of a $1\\.25 million house is probably about $72,000 a year. It is hard to value stock trades which depend upon the size of the portfolio and the skill of the trader. \n\nIf the stock trades generated $28,000 of income a year and the wife has the kids 5 nights a week, and there were no extraordinary expenses, child support might typically be on the order of $416 a month. If wife made $78,000 from stock trades, child support would be nominal (they would have equal incomes, but she would have a few more days a year).\n\nBut, that involves some very specific assumptions.\n\nAlso, in situations like this one where the facts are so extraordinary relative to a typical divorced couple and the family is very affluent on a combined basis, the judge has wide discretion to deviate from the guidelines on a case by case basis. In reality, no case like this has a clear fair or typical resolution and it would depend a great deal upon how the case was argued and how the facts were developed by the parties and their counsel.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a divorce case, a wife owns two houses valued at $2.5 million and earns income only from stock trades.

Child support calculations are based on statutory guidelines that consider various factors, including both parents' incomes. In this case, while the husband has a regular salary, the wife's income from stock trades would be considered. Additionally, the rental value of one of the wife's houses would likely be imputed as income. The guidelines typically consider the gross income of each parent, the number of children, any extraordinary expenses, and the number of nights each parent spends with the children. The value of assets alone (like the houses) isn't directly considered unless they produce or could produce income. The wife's request for no alimony doesn't automatically affect child support calculations.

When this was included in the GDPR, the drafters decided to keep the personal use exemption *unchanged* from the article 3(2\\) of [Directive 95/46](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046&from=EN). (There as a lot of lobbying for removing \"purely\" from the sentence \u2013 but drafters wanted to keep it.)\n\nThere also an unofficial description in [Recital 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/), that say:\n\n> (1\\) This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. (2\\) Personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. (3\\) However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities.\n\nThis says that you're *not* exempt for processing that has connection to a professional or commercial activity. But it is very ague on what *makes* you exempt. Does \"social networking\" include maintaining your own blog, or are they only referring to your activities on Facebook and similar \"social\" media where you obviously are *not* the controller (the controller is who owns and runs the platform)?\n\nA key question, partly arising from a lengthy discussion thread under the answer by @Greendrake in this [related question](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28070/957), is whether this means that\na publicly accessible, personal blog is *excluded* from the scope of the GDPR?\n\nTo answer this question, one need to consider that the GDPR [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) definition 1 says that:\n\n> \u2018personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n\nWe know from EU case law that this also includes *IP\\-addresses*, since such online identifiers *indirectly* makes people who is visiting such a publicly available personal blog *identifiable*.\n\nAlso, note that the *scope* of the GDPR is *processing* of personal data. This is defined in GDPR [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) defintion 2:\n\n> \u2018processing\u2019 means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\nSome critics of the GDPR have objected that such a definition of \u2018processing\u2019 is *over\\-reaching*. However, it being over\\-reaching does not mean that we should ignore it.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to link to two seminal cases heard by the ECJ:\n\n* [C\\-101/01](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=48382&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=322419)\n* [C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=160561&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=322511)\n\nCentral to both cases was the question of whether the processing activities of an individual was covered by personal use exemption under article 3(2\\) of Directive 95/46\\. In both these cases, the ECJ took an extremely restrictive view, and concluded that the personal use exemption did *not* apply to the processing done by these individuals.\n\nThe questions is: Is it *possible* for a publicly accessible, personal blog to make use of the personal use exception of the GDPR to avoid having to comply with the regulation? If \"yes\": What need to be considered by its owner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that one cannot answer a question such as \"Will the personal use exception in the GDPR apply to personal blogs?\", because it is unclear if you refer to:\n\n1. personal information published on the blog pages\n2. personal information collected from the Website, by way of forms, cookies, server logs, strictly collected and processed for the purpose of operating the Website for your own personal purposes as a blogger (by yourself of through a subcontractor in the sense of GDPR)\n3. and not personal information collected from the Website's operation, transferred or provided to third parties for their own purposes (this would include cookies used to identify and track users across multiple domains)\n\n**Regarding 1\\.**, a personal blog wanting to benefit from the exemption should not publish third party's personal information without their consent or another legal basis, and [C\\-101/01](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01) certainly applies here.\n\n**About 2\\.**, if the information is strictly collected and used for the own personal purpose of the operation of the blog, I would tend to agree that it should benefit from the exemption. I feel that [C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-212/13) would not necessarily be an indication that because the blog is publicly accessible it is then \"directed outwards from the private setting\" in the sense of this ruling, and should not be considered as \"purely \u2018personal or household\u2019 activity\".\n\n[C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-212/13) case was relating to a camera installed by an individual on his family home for its own security purposes which was also monitoring a public space. The persons filmed on this public space had absolutely no direct connexion with the person collecting their images.

I was given many duties well outside of the job description I signed when I took the job. Also, an employee that left was not replaced and I had to take on many of his duties as well. I have been stressed to the point of affecting my health and working endless hours of overtime that I don't get paid for because I'm on salary.\n\nNow that I have accepted another job (similar pay, less stress/hours), I am being asked to repay the education budget and realizing that the job offer did stipulate 2 years of employment. I am trying to negotiate with the employer based on the fact that I wouldn't have accepted the job without the education.

It is possible that some image is in the public domain, or that it has a license that would allow you to copy such images, but verifying that any such image is \"available\" is extremely difficult. Depending on the subject, the majority of images of famous people that appear under Google Images are probably *not* with permission (Google does not host them, they simply collect URLs of images that other people post).

So unless you are a school policymaker, *you* cannot violate FERPA. Of course, the school probably has nondisclosure agreements or other policies in place to ensure that educational records are not released improperly. You need to also consult those rules to determine your obligations.\n* FERPA is very poorly enforced by the federal government. At least as of the last time I looked at this question, no school had ever lost any funding due to a FERPA violation.

Water and gas, being material substances, are considered property and would fall under the general theft provisions of the Act.

Basically, the test is whether a prior acquittal would be inconsistent with a new criminal charge.\n\nFor example, even though there is an additional element of the crime of murdering a postal officer to the crime of murdering someone on federal property, double jeopardy would probably bar a retrial of a murder on federal property case simply because the victim happened to be a postal worker and that element wasn't charged in the original indictment. This is because the acquittal of the first murder charge would almost always imply a jury determination that a murder didn't take place which would be inconsistent with a murder of a postal worker charge.\n\nOn the other hand, a trial on a murder charge would probably not bar, for example, a trial on a burglary charge (which at common law involved trespassing with an intent to commit a crime), even if the burglary charge arose from the same conduct. This is because an acquittal on a murder charge isn't necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a trespass, or with the intent to commit some crime other than the murder for which the defendant was acquitted.\n\nBut the exact way that the line gets draw is tricky and while what I have described is a good general summary of the cases interpreting the double jeopardy clause, it isn't a perfect one. This issue has been litigated many, many tines over the years, so there are a lot of cases that are squarely on point addressing specific fact patterns in precedents that are binding case law that are not always a perfect fit to the general principles. In these circumstances, the binding case law is going to control, at least until a court with appellate authority over the court whose case established the precedent in question decided to overrule a prior precedent from the lower court, or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court precedents, until the U.S. Supreme Court revisits one of its own prior precedents as wrong decided or wrongly interpreted, which happens now and then, although it is a rare event.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is acquitted of second-degree murder for the death of his neighbor.

Under the 24th Amendment, their right to vote cannot be denied for that particular offense. (If it were tax evasion, i.e. concealing facts in order to avoid paying, that would be different matter, if I'm not mistaken.)\n\nMy question is whether that has ever happened, i.e. a person convicted of a felonious failure to pay a tax has been allowed to vote while serving a sentence because of the 24th Amendment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 24th Amendment states:\n\n> Section 1\\. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any\n>  primary or other election for President or Vice President, for\n>  electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or\n>  Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the\n>  United States or any State by reason of **failure to pay any poll tax or\n>  other tax.**\n> \n> \n> Section 2\\.

Usually, one is incarcerated in prison on tax charges for fraud in connection with one's tax obligation which is different from failure to pay. (A misdemeanor conviction does not result in the loss of an ability to vote, even while in jail.)\n\nRefusal to pay, on grounds other than lacking the money (inability to pay isn't a criminal offense), when done without full compliance with other tax return filing obligations, is tantamount to tax litigation abuse and abuse of process, not mere failure to pay a debt.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under the 24th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which of the following scenarios would most likely allow a person convicted of a tax-related felony to retain their right to vote while serving their sentence?\n\nA) A person convicted of tax evasion by deliberately concealing income on their tax returns\nB) An individual imprisoned for tax fraud involving the creation of false documents\nC) Someone incarcerated for willful failure to file tax returns for multiple years\nD) A person convicted solely for the inability to pay their taxes due to financial hardship\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The 24th Amendment prohibits denying the right to vote based on failure to pay any tax. However, the key distinction is between simple failure to pay and fraudulent or evasive actions related to taxes. Options A, B, and C all involve deliberate attempts to deceive or avoid tax obligations, which would likely be considered separate felonies beyond mere failure to pay. Option D, inability to pay due to financial hardship, is the closest to a simple \"failure to pay\" scenario protected by the 24th Amendment. \n\nIt's important to note that in practice, as mentioned in the documentation, people are rarely if ever incarcerated solely for inability to pay taxes. Usually, tax-related imprisonments involve fraud or evasion. However, if such a case did occur, it would be the most likely scenario where the 24th Amendment might protect voting rights."}}
