If the lease does not specify a pet deposit or fee, the landlord cannot charge one retroactively or unilaterally impose new fees. The tenant is bound by the terms of the lease as written and signed, even if it was a mistake on the landlord's part. The landlord cannot enforce a policy that isn't included in the lease agreement.

The materials were discovered while a potential buyer was touring his house. \n\nAlthough I vehemently condemn the KKK, doesn't this officer have the right to display whatever he wants in his home so long as it doesn't actively and deliberately call for violence? Aren't these articles protected under the first amendment? I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \n\nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point. Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech.](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28831/37) The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question \\-\\- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off\\-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government *is* involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In [*Pickering v. Board of Education*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/563/), the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. *Pickering* imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see [*Pappas v. Giuliani*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1355900.html), where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off\\-duty time.\n\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job *requires* maintaining good relations with the community. In *Pappas*, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer in a public department is found to have KKK materials displayed in his home.

In cases involving government employees and free speech, the Pickering balancing test applies. This test, established by the Supreme Court, requires weighing the employee's First Amendment rights against the government's interest in efficient operation. For police departments, maintaining public trust and community relations is a significant consideration. \n\nOption A is incorrect because government employees' speech rights are not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances. \n\nOption B is too narrow; the department can consider factors beyond just direct job performance, including potential damage to public trust and department effectiveness. \n\nOption D is incorrect because even offensive speech may have some First Amendment protection, and immediate termination without any balancing of interests would likely be unconstitutional for a government employer.\n\nThe courts have given police departments considerable leeway in disciplining officers for speech that could undermine public confidence, even if the speech occurs off-duty and in private. However, this still requires a careful balancing of interests rather than automatic termination."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58474/can-i-use-the-governments-seals-and-logos-without-its-permission", "docs_id": 58474, "title": "Can I use the government&#39;s seals and logos without its permission?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it permissible to use a governmental seal for editorial purposes in a magazine?\n\nFor example, in a news story about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, could I use ATF's logo to accompany the story?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n====\n\nThe First Amendment permits you to use the seal of a government agency to illustrate a story about that government agency. The government can no more prohibit you from displaying its seals for expressive purposes than it can prohibit you from displaying its flag.\n\nThe questions raised about possible trademark violations and implied endorsement are red herrings. [Section 2(b) of the Lanham Act](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-15-commerce-and-trade/chapter-22-trademarks/subchapter-i-the-principal-register/section-1052-trademarks-registrable-on-principal-register-concurrent-registration) prohibits registering a trademark that \"consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of any State or municipality,\" so the government therefore may not trademark its seals. [*In re City of Houston*, 731 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-city-of-hous) (\"As the nature of the mark is not disputed in this appeal \u2014 Houston admits that its city seal is an insignia under \u00a7 2(b) of the Lanham Act \u2014 the Board properly affirmed the examining attorney's refusal to register Houston's city seal.\")\n\nEven if the seal were a protected trademark, the context of its use \\-\\- in an editorial setting rather than for commercial purposes \\-\\- is protected by the First Amendment. For instance, in [*Renna v. Cty. of Union, N.J.*, 88 F. Supp. 3d 310, 323 (D.N.J. 2014\\)](https://casetext.com/case/renna-v-cnty-of-union-6), a county tried to stop a television host from using its seal in advertisements for a show about community affairs. The court noted first that the seal was not protected by trademark law, and that even if it was, the county's efforts to limit the host's expression would run afoul of the First Amendment:\n\n> Consider that the First Amendment prohibits a State from criminalizing the desecration of the United States flag as a form of political protest. ... Should a county, by means of an artful extension of trademark law, be permitted to quash political expression that uses its Seal? I think such an extension would be both unwarranted and Constitutionally risky.\n\nThe same is true of implied endorsements. The First Amendment does not permit the government to limit your expression because it thinks people might mistake it for government speech.\n\nFor instance, [*Rothamel v. Fluvanna Cty.*, 810 F. Supp. 2d 771 (W.D. Va. 2011\\)](https://casetext.com/case/rothamel-v-fluvanna-county), a county government adopted a law \"prohibiting the display of the Fluvanna County seal unless expressly authorized by the Fluvanna County Board of Supervisors.\" The law was prompted by concerns about a blogger who had been using the county's seal in stories about county government, and there were reports that some people thought the seal indicated that the stories were official county publications. When a blogger challenged the law, the federal court entered a permanent injunction against enforcing it:\n\n> The County takes the position that the showing of the seal by private citizens is not a form of expression at all; rather, the seal is government property, like a government vehicle or other form of personal property. ... While the County is correct that Rothamel does not have the right to take possession of a physical seal owned by the County, the County cannot control all privately\\-owned images or representations of the seal simply by declaring an interest in managing its own property.

I've actually  [answered this exact question](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56796/3209) from a pure US point of view, but your EU reference does throw a wrench into that analysis. Briefly summarizing my answer, *Kirtsaeng* does indeed shield the importer from liability under US law.\n\nHowever, here the book is being imported into Poland and so the transaction may not necessarily be legitimate under Polish/EU copyright law. You are correct in assuming that EU first sale doctrine is not as generous as the US counterpart. Per *[Infosoc (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32001L0029&from=EN)* Article 4(2\\), first sale doctrine is only triggered in the EU on first sale within its territory, unlike the US where the doctrine is triggered on first global sale. Therefore, under Article 4(1\\), the distribution rights of importing a book into Poland from outside the EU remains with the copyright holder.\n\nEdit: Though the transaction might itself be illegal from Amazon's perspective, being a commercial violation of distribution rights, even if you're considered the importer, there's a chance you are yourself not in violation of copyright law. EU law allows countries to implement personal use exceptions (Article 5(2\\)(a), Article 5(4\\)). From what I recall, most of continental Europe does indeed implement some form of personal use exception, though details vary by country. I've run out of time for now, but I'll probably later research Polish specific law here (though I don't know the language, so no idea how far I'll get).\n\nNow the reason I said there was some guesswork, is that there are details you wouldn't necessarily be aware of that would make this legal, and Amazon as a large enterprise would generally take into account legal considerations. Just because the book says unauthorized for distribution outside India, doesn't mean the publisher / copyright holder didn't later make separate contractual relations with Amazon to allow it.

Under EU copyright law, specifically the Infosoc (Copyright) Directive Article 4(2), the first sale doctrine only applies to first sales within EU territory. Since this book was initially sold in India, the EU first sale doctrine would not apply. The distribution rights for importing the book into Poland from outside the EU would still belong to the copyright holder, making the transaction likely illegal under EU copyright law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Kirtsaeng case applies to US law, not EU law, and the EU has different rules regarding first sale doctrine.\n\nOption C is not necessarily true. While Amazon is a large company, we cannot assume they have secured all rights for every international edition they sell.\n\nOption D, while highlighting an important point about personal use exceptions, is not the most accurate answer.

Both persons conceal the relationship from each of their spouses.\n\nDuring the course of the long relationship a lot of intimate, incriminating personal information regarding Person A and Person A's spouse is revealed to Person B.\n\nPerson A decides to end the relationship, ghosting Person B.\n\nWhat legal repercussions might Person B get into if Person B copied every message onto a thumb drive or paper and gave them all to Person A's spouse?\n\nAssuming everything is true and correct and was copied without modification directly from the online service?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Extortion**\n\nB might be subject to prosecution for second\\-degree extortion, in Washington state. [RCW 9A.56\\.110](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.110) defines \"extortion\" as\n\n> knowingly to obtain or attempt to obtain by threat property or\n>  services of the owner, and specifically includes sexual favors\n\nand second\\-degree extortion relates to the nature of the threat \u2013 it includes \"To reveal any information sought to be concealed by the person threatened\". However, the prosecution would have to establish that B attempted to obtain something from A, which would presumably be the continuation of the relationship.\n\nUnder the comment\\-modified scenario where the spouse knows of the relationship, the threat would be to reveal whatever the criminal activity is that the A's are engaged in. In that case, there is a potential defense under [RCW 9A.56\\.130(2\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.130):\n\n> In any prosecution under this section based on a threat to accuse any\n>  person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against\n>  any person, it is a defense that the actor reasonably believed the\n>  threatened criminal charge to be true and that his or her sole purpose\n>  was to compel or induce the person threatened to take reasonable\n>  action to make good the wrong which was the subject of such threatened\n>  criminal charge.\n\nThe question then would be, how believable it would be that B's action was solely an attempt to get A to stop their criminal behavior? There is a path leading to a criminal conviction, but whether B is taken down that path depends on a lot of facts (and impressions) to be established at trial. Since A's spouse seems to know about the relationship and is unaffected by the information, giving over the thumb drive would not have any of the consequences outlined under the definition of \"threat\" in the law, such as revealing secrets, or harming a relationship. \n\n\"Threat\" is defined ([RCW 9A.04\\.110(27\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.110)) as \"to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent to...\" (list then follows, including \"do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person threatened or another with respect to his or her health, safety, business, financial condition, or personal relationships\"). That means that a threat is communicating an intent to do something: it is *not* doing the thing. In order to constitute a threat against A, B would have to communicate to A the intent to reveal, rather than just directly revealing. If we assume that that did not happen, the act would not fit the description of a threat.\n\n**Wiretapping**\n\nThere is also [Ch. 9\\.73](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73&full=true#9.73.030), which includes the \"wiretapping\" law. (RCW 9\\.73\\.030, labeled \"Intercepting, recording, or divulging private communication\"). Washington is an all\\-party consent state meaning that all parties have to consent to a recording. Since email is an electronic means of communication and that is all that is required to be within the scope of the law, it might seem that this could be a violation of the wiretapping law. Nevertheless, the law says that\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for\n>  any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or the state of\n>  Washington, its agencies, and political subdivisions to intercept, or\n>  record\n\nand notice that the word \"divulge\" is not included in the law. Both parties clearly know that the conversation is being \"recorded\". The section does eventually include \"divulging\" as a permitted (not prohibited) acts:\n\n> (4\\) An employee of any regularly published newspaper, magazine, wire\n>  service, radio station, or television station acting in the course of\n>  bona fide news gathering duties on a full\\-time or contractual or\n>  part\\-time basis, shall be deemed to have consent to record and divulge\n>  communications or conversations otherwise prohibited by this chapter\n>  if the consent is expressly given or if the recording or transmitting\n>  device is readily apparent or obvious to the speakers.\n\nThe section has a number of places where it is specified that one can legally divulge a communication, and nowhere does it prohibit divulging information (recording and intercepting are prohibited, but not divulging). Consequently, those parts of the statutes are without effect. In such a case, the courts are likely to re\\-interpret the wording of the statute so that it is sensible to talk about \"divulging\" (the court always find an intent underlying the words of a legislative body). It might then turn out that the court would find that the statutes also prohibit divulging without consent. One [local attorney](https://rhodeslegalgroup.com/recording-conversations-and-communications-in-washington/) claims that the law \"punishes you if you publish the recording\", without explaining the authority for that conclusion (anyhow, passing on a copy of the emails is not \"publishing\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Washington state, Person B has copies of intimate online conversations with Person A, who is married.

(I don't care if I lose my US citizenship, but I am not willing to naturalize in the UK if it costs my me Irish citizenship)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In summary:\n\n1. Statute law allows Ireland to revoke your naturalisation on the grounds of acquiring another citizenship.\n2. But this law has recently been found unconstitutional.\n3. In practice, the government does not do this anyway.\n4. In the case of the UK, it is particularly unlikely.\n5. As an Irish citizen, there is no particular reason to pursue UK naturalisation.\n\nThe law\n-------\n\nAs of now, the possibility deprivation of Irish nationality for any reason is unclear, because of a ruling of the Supreme Court (*Damache v Minister for Justice* \\[2020] IESC 63\\) that declared the statute allowing for this to be unconstitutional. That was because the law (section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956\\) did not provide enough procedural safeguards. The Minister would initiate the process and make the final decision after expert advice, but was not an \"independent and impartial decision\\-maker\". It is now for the legislature to replace section 19 so as to cure the defect.\n\nUnder section 19, the grounds for revoking a certificate of naturalisation include:\n\n> (b) that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State\n\nand\n\n> (e) that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership, acquired another citizenship.\n\nThe issue in *Damache* was (b) following the appellant's conviction for terrorism offences in the United States. Regarding (e), it would seem on its face that acquiring UK nationality might trigger the possibility of revocation. However, in the scenario envisaged, that would leave you without any EU nationality, and in the *Tjebbes* case of 2019 (ECLI:EU:C:2019:189\\) the European Court of Justice found that such deprivation would only be possible after consideration of the specific consequences for the person concerned and their family. This point was not reached in *Damache* but would also tend to rule out any \"automatic\" loss of nationality; it would have to be the result of some longer and more involved process. Whatever replaces section 19 would have to be of this kind.\n\nSpecial considerations also apply if loss of Irish nationality would leave you stateless, but that is not the issue in question.\n\nThe policy\n----------\n\nAside from cases of immigration fraud and terrorism, the State has rarely initiated processes under section 19\\. In fact, official guidance on immigration and nationality admits a policy of dual nationality being allowed.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, there are many people who are dual British and Irish nationals. The understanding between the governments with respect to the Common Travel Area, the Good Friday Agreement, and the general historic situation, would make it very unlikely that Ireland would treat acquisition of British nationality as a problem. The British\\-Irish Agreement of 1998 includes that both governments respect the \"right to hold both British and Irish citizenship\" for the people of Northern Ireland. Even if you are not a person of Northern Ireland, any action by the government of Ireland that would be seen as potentially touching on this right is politically untenable.\n\nIrish citizens have full rights in the UK anyway\n------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder UK law, an Irish citizen can enter without a visa, live there as long as they want, get a job, claim benefits, vote in elections, be elected as an MP, and do everything that a UK citizen can normally do. There may be a vanishingly few exceptions for national security jobs.\n\nBecause of this, there isn't much reason why being naturalised in the UK would be worthwhile. You could do so for sentimental reasons but as far as the UK's concerned, you already hold a status that's just as good.\n\nExtra note: UK honours\n----------------------\n\n(In response to a comment below.)\n\nThe British Crown does grant honours, including knighthoods, to non\\-UK citizens and dual/multiple citizens, in some circumstances. It depends on whether the other nationality has King Charles III as head of state, and the attitude of the foreign government. Therefore, Canadians do not get knighthoods (Charles is King but the Canadian government would rather not), Belizians do (Charles is King and the government is fine with it), and Americans can get it as an honorary award that does not come with the Sir/Dame title.\n\nFor Ireland, Terry Wogan is an example of how this works. He was an Irish citizen who lived and worked in the UK for many years. In order to receive a British knighthood, he had to take up British citizenship (which was granted on an expedited basis), becoming Sir Terry. On the other hand, Bob Geldof is an Irish citizen (only) who holds an honorary British KBE, and is not formally entitled to be Sir Bob \\- much like American recipients such as Rudy Guiliani. The Irish government does not object to either possibility, although some individuals do.\n\nAn American\\-Irish\\-British triple citizen would be able to receive a UK knighthood and use the title Sir, assuming that the British government was willing to grant it, and unless there were some foreign legal blocker (e.g. the U.S. government does not allow federal officeholders to receive overseas decorations).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A person born in the United States with dual US-Irish citizenship is considering moving to the UK and becoming naturalized as a British citizen.

According to the information provided, while Irish law technically allows for revocation of citizenship upon acquiring another nationality, in practice this rarely happens. The Irish government has a policy of allowing dual nationality, and there are special considerations for UK-Irish relations due to the Common Travel Area and Good Friday Agreement. Additionally, a recent court ruling (Damache v Minister for Justice) has made the process of revoking Irish citizenship more complex. Furthermore, given the close relationship between Ireland and the UK, it is particularly unlikely that Ireland would revoke citizenship for someone acquiring British nationality. Therefore, the person would likely retain their Irish citizenship upon naturalization in the UK."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29558/who-is-responsible-for-posts-on-internet-forums-particularly-in-russia", "docs_id": 29558, "title": "Who is responsible for posts on Internet forums, particularly in Russia?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are users or is the site owner responsible for posts on the forum?\n\nCould it be different:\n\n* with or without a license agreement available on the site?\n* with or without a registration?\n\nMy concern is about Russian law primarily.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When users sign up for forums they agree to the site's terms.

If the user goes against the terms, then they're the one who's responsible; if the forum owner is promoting things that are illegal, then they're the one who's responsible. For example, if they started a thread linking to pirated content and others comment on it, it's still the owner's responsibility for having posted it in the first place even if they didn't know it was pirated at the time. The site owner could change the terms at any time, but changing the terms won't change who was responsible for going against the country's laws. \n\nIn short, if a user posts something against Russian law, it's usually the user who's responsible and if the forum owner wants to moderate those sorts of things it's entirely optional.

If it doesn't apply, then an IP block is superfluous.\n\nWhether GDPR applies is determined by Art 3 GDPR. For this, we must distinguish where the data controller is operating from. It is irrelevant where the site is hosted, but primarily relevant where the data controller (your colleague) has an \u201cestablishment\u201d, e.g. where he resides or typically works from.\n\n* Per Art 3(1\\), GDPR applies to all processing activities in the context of an European establishment, regardless of where the users are.\n\nSo if your colleague were running this site from Europe, they wouldn't be able to circumvent GDPR by blocking European users. However, if your colleague is running this site from outside of Europe, then Art 3(1\\) doesn't trigger.\n* Per Art 3(2\\), GDPR can apply to processing activities where there is no European establishment.\n\nThere is the Art 3(2\\)(a) \u201ctargeting criterion\u201d: if your colleague \u201coffers\u201d goods or services to people who are in Europe, regardless whether paid or gratis, then GDPR applies to all processing activities related to this offer. I'll discuss this more below.\n\nThere is also the Art 3(2\\)(b) criterion: if your colleague monitors the behaviour of people that occurs in Europe, then GDPR applies. For example, an app collecting geolocation information or a website creating interest profiles for ad targeting might trigger this criterion.\n\nAn IP block can help to establish that no offering/monitoring related to people who are in Europe is happening, but it might not be necessary.\n\nIt may be worth talking a bit more about the targeting criterion.\nThe GDPR explicitly says that mere availability of a website in Europe doesn't imply that GDPR would apply. Instead, it is necessary to establish the data controller's *intention* \u2013 are they soliciting users from Europe, or otherwise expecting that people from Europe might use those services? Recital 23 gives a couple of non\\-exhaustive factors that can be considered here, for example:\n\n* the site uses a language or currency used in the EU but not used in the controller's own country\n* the site mentions users or customers from Europe, e.g. in testimonials\n\nThis means that a lot of US websites, written in English or Spanish, only mentioning payment in USD (if any), not mentioning any European countries, will not be subject to GDPR.\n\nThen, occasional European visitors are irrelevant. It wouldn't be necessary to IP\\-block potential European users. However, such an IP\\-based block would help establish that the data controller really doesn't intend for those services to be offered to people who are in Europe. My personal opinion is that it's wasted effort to block users from foreign countries in case their foreign laws claim to apply, but if such a block brings peace of mind that might be worth it.\n\nWhile geoblocking might not be *necessary*, is it *sufficient*? There is no clear guidance on this subject, but it seems to be generally accepted that IP\\-based geoblocking is fine, even though it is trivially circumvented using VPN services. Of course, if a website were to block European IP addresses but were to also advertise that people in Europe can use their services via VPNs, that would probably still be an \u201coffer\u201d and might defeat the point of doing any geoblocking.\n\nThe Art 3(1\\)(a) targeting criterion is most easily applied to things like ecommerce where physical goods are shipped to the customer in return for payment \u2013 so essentially whenever the data controller participates in the EU Single Market.

That certain people have been known as philosophers, and have put forth particular ideas are facts, not subject to copyright, as long as no one else's description of those ideas is copied or closely imitated.

In most US states any such rights end with the persona's death, or only continue for a few years after death (10 years in some cases). The year of birth is not, as far as I know relevant. The exact length of such rights should be checked if any person being pictured is alive or has died fairly recently.

However, they ultimately lost. As reported by [CDAS](https://cdas.com/einstein-publicity-rights-deemed-expired-by-california-federal-court/):\n\n> United States District Judge A. Howard Matz rejected Hebrew University\u2019s claim that New Jersey common law provides for an indefinite duration of the postmortem right of publicity, or that it alternatively is coextensive with copyright law and lasts for a minimum of 70 years after a person\u2019s death. Instead, the Court ruled that New Jersey common law postmortem publicity rights endure for no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. Because Einstein died in 1955, the Court\u2019s ruling means that Einstein\u2019s publicity rights are now in the public domain.\n\n...\n\n> Judge Matz concluded that the New Jersey Supreme Court would likely limit the postmortem right of publicity under New Jersey common law to endure no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. He noted that the New Jersey Legislature has twice declined to enact a statutory postmortem right of publicity, and given the sparse New Jersey case law on the issue, \u201cit is likely that the New Jersey Supreme Court would perceive pitfalls in allowing an unlimited or lengthy term to the right of publicity.\u201d Comparing the right of publicity to New Jersey\u2019s common law right of privacy, the Court recognized that 50 years was a \u201creasonable middle ground\u201d to allow a deceased celebrity\u2019s heir to benefit from the right of publicity, while still respecting the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in free expression.\u201d\n\n[*Mercury News*](https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/10/18/gms-use-of-einstein-image-tasteless-but-not-illegal-judge-says/) reported on the same case, saying:\n\n> But the judge said descendants\u2019 right to control someone\u2019s image after his death must be balanced with the public\u2019s right of expression.\n\n> He also ruled any right Hebrew University had to sue expired in 2005 \u2014 50 years after Einstein\u2019s death \u2014 because that was the limit on copyright law in 1982, when Hebrew University acquired Einstein\u2019s right of publicity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating an educational card game featuring philosophers, including some born in the last 100 years.

Subsequent cases have refined this relationship over time. For example, Native sovereignty may take priority over certain state\\-level powers, like that of search and seizure. *See* [Inyo County v. Paiute\\-Shoshone Indians of the Bishop Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inyo_County_v._Paiute-Shoshone_Indians_of_the_Bishop_Community), 588 U.S. 701 (2003\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the principle of Tribal Sovereignty in the United States?\n\nA) Native American tribes are completely independent nations outside the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nB) Native American tribes have no self-governing authority and are fully subject to state laws.\n\nC) Native American tribes are considered \"domestic dependent nations\" with limited sovereignty, while their members are also U.S. citizens.\n\nD) Native American tribes have full sovereignty equal to that of foreign nations, but their members are granted U.S. citizenship.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The principle of Tribal Sovereignty recognizes Native American tribes as \"domestic dependent nations\" with a special type of self-governing authority within the United States. This status was established in the 1831 Supreme Court case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia. \n\nWhile tribes have some degree of sovereignty, they are not completely independent from the U.S. (ruling out option A). Native Americans are also U.S. citizens, as granted by the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.\n\nOption B is incorrect because tribes do have self-governing authority and are not fully subject to state laws. In fact, states generally have no authority to regulate Native matters unless explicitly granted by Congress.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Native Americans are U.S. citizens, tribal sovereignty is not equal to that of foreign nations. The \"domestic dependent nation\" status implies a unique relationship with the federal government that is different from foreign sovereignty.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex relationship between Native American tribes and the U.S. government, including concepts of limited sovereignty, U.S. citizenship, and the tribes' relationship with both federal and state governments."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1750/are-remaining-paid-leave-paid-at-the-end-internship-in-france", "docs_id": 1750, "title": "Are remaining &quot;paid leave&quot; paid at the end internship in France?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *I am a **french student**, during a **six\\-month internship** in **France**.*  \n\nThus, my question is restricted to this country only.\n\nMy contract gives me 5 days of *paid leave*.

Our insurance company wrote us a check to cover some of the hail damage.\n\nAfter emphatically explaining how amazing his replacement windows are, he produced an iPad and asked me to \"sign\".

The windows in our house are a bit old, so it would make sense to replace them all at once, and not just the ones that sustained hail damage.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know much about windows (or the legal ramifications of squiggling on an iPad screen). That evening, as a sanity check, I looked at Google/Yelp reviews for the window make/model and saw that almost every review had the lowest possible rating. I reached out to the guy and explained that we could not move forward with his recommendation, and I asked him to quote products that rated highly in Consumer Reports, which he did.\n\nAt that time, he had not ordered any windows from his supplier, so things weren't yet set\\-in\\-stone (even though I had stupidly squiggled on the iPad). A few hours later, we received a quote that was almost twice the previous estimate. Because of the large amount of money at stake, I decided to get a second quote. His quote was 76% more expensive than Lowes for exactly the same product. In cash terms, Lowes was $10k cheaper.\n\nSo, regardless of the squiggle on the iPad, I decided *not* to move forward with the exorbitant quote.

I contacted (by phone) the insurance and they answered by email afterward:\n\n> We regret to inform you that your policy does not cover the loss reported to us. More specifically, your policy does not insure loss or\n>  damage to property you rent, except for the unintentional damage to the premises or contents resulting from fire, explosion, water damage\n>  or smoke insured under this policy. We direct you to Section 7\\.3\\.1 (e) of your insurance policy for the specific wordings. As such, your claim\n>  file is now being closed\n\nI am not sure I fully understand what is included in the term \"premises\". \n\n* Am I supposed to be covered?\n* If yes, what should I do to force Square One to respect our contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume this is the landlord's carpet. Your insurance covers damage caused by fire, explosion, water damage or smoke. The \"premise\" is the place you're renting, and some examples of content that you are renting would be whatever furnishing came with the place, carpets, and curtains. By the written contract (based on their email summary), you are not covered for damage to rented carpeting owing to wine spillage. However, to be certain, you should look for the relevant portion of the contract to see if the language of the contract matches their conclusion about non\\-coverage. There is a tiny chance that the wording is actually ambiguous and they interpret the wording in a way favorable to them, but to make any progress if that is the case, you'd have to sue them, and hope that the court rules in your favor. \n\nOral amendments to contracts are sort of possible, but I think there is no chance that they would agree to your contention claim that that you have an oral modification of the contract. You would need to prove exactly what you asked and how they responded (something better than fervently maintaining that you asked X and they said Y because *nobody* actually remembers conversations verbatim from 2 years ago). Contracts usually have clauses saying that \"this contract is the whole contract\", explicitly denying that there can be oral amendments. This is a general rule for contracts in Canada: see [Gainers Inc. v. Pocklington Financial Corporation, 2000 ABCA 151 (CanLII)](http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2000/2000abca151/2000abca151.html)\n\n> When the deal is complete in the written contracts, and not subject to\n>  an escrow, other evidence (parol evidence) is inadmissible to vary or\n>  contradict a clear written contract: Chant v.

The written policy explicitly states what types of damage are covered (fire, explosion, water damage, smoke), and wine stains are not included in this list. In Canadian contract law, written contracts generally take precedence over verbal agreements, especially when the contract includes a clause stating it represents the entire agreement. The case law cited (Gainers Inc. v. Pocklington Financial Corporation) supports this principle. While the tenant may have believed wine stains were covered based on a conversation two years ago, proving this would be extremely difficult, and courts are unlikely to consider such verbal agreements when they contradict clear written terms. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate the legal weight of verbal agreements in contract law. Option B is incorrect because the policy clearly defines what types of damage are covered, and wine stains do not fall under these categories."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64315/what-are-the-defences-to-a-yellow-parking-violence-notice-in-toronto", "docs_id": 64315, "title": "What are the Defences to a yellow parking violence notice in Toronto?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Three days ago, I got a [yellow parking violation notice](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/tickets-fines-penalties/dispute/new-parking-violation-dispute-process/).

Another way of wording this question is: would federally decriminalizing marijuana mean that state criminalization is contradictory?\n\nProstitution for example is not a crime or even illegal under federal law, though it is a crime in almost every state. Given this example, it seems like marijuana would remain illegal under state law (if applicable), though I'm not confident about my intuition here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If such a bill passes as written, it removes any federal criminal prohibitions against marijuana (assuming their research was sufficiently thorough), and raises marijuana to the same legal status as celery salt, which simply is not mentioned by federal criminal law. There would be no federal declaration that marijuana is now legal, and therefore, when federal law is silent, state law can say something. If silence at the federal level precluded state law on the topic, there could be not any state law \u2013 the Supremacy Clause only addresses *conflicts*. The bill could also be written to include a positive declaration that there shall be no laws against marijuana, and *that* would create a conflict with state law.\n\nOften, conflicts are avoided by crafting a jurisdictional difference, such as having laws that only apply while on federal property, or w.r.t. federal employees. The Constitution is structured to separate what the federal government can do versus what state governments can do, so that conflicts don't arise \u2013 however, the Commerce Clause ends up being used to expand federal power (e.g. the Controlled Substances Act). As Nate Eldredge comments, there is a huge difference between what is allowed under federal vs. (certain) state laws w.r.t. fireworks, and even town\\-to\\-town variations in fireworks laws.

If federal law simply decriminalized marijuana without explicitly legalizing it nationwide, states would retain the authority to maintain their own laws criminalizing or regulating marijuana. This is similar to how states regulate other activities or substances not explicitly addressed by federal law, such as prostitution or certain professional licenses. The Supremacy Clause only applies when there is a direct conflict between federal and state laws, not when federal law is silent on an issue. Therefore, removing federal criminal prohibitions on marijuana would not automatically invalidate state laws on the subject, nor would it require states to change their laws.

To summarize, they imply that they would be legally protected from civil suits from former members who are being disciplined. Would this actually work? My first thought is that it doesn't make sense that a person who leaves cannot revoke their consent, especially since this wasn't a binding contract of any sort.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [Guinn v. Church of Christ](https://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/1989/10494.html), plaintiff withdrew from the church after an internal investigation of her conduct. The church apparently held as a matter of religious doctrine that she must repent of her sins, also that withdrawing from the church is doctrinally impossible. The transgressions were widely publicized within the church; a lawsuit over outrage and invasion of privacy ensued. The upshot of the appeal is that the church can be held liable for post\\-withdrawal actions, but before that, the church has a privilege to communicate such transgressions (the church is not subject to secular judicature of its actions w.r.t. its members).\n\nContract law is not relevant here, what matters is that a person can knowingly and intelligently waive their right to litigate against a party, and while one is a member of the church which has such a waiver as part of their disciplinary doctrine, one cannot sue the church for its doctrinary actions as long as the actions do not constitute a threat to public safety which would justify state interference. Although the church argued that church membership is irrevocable, the court found that \"Just as freedom to worship is protected by the First Amendment, so also is the liberty to recede from one's religious allegiance\". Given that plaintiff had withdrawn consent yet the church subsequently announced the transgressions without her consent, the church was thus found to be liable.\n\nIn [Stepek v. Doe](https://casetext.com/case/stepek-v-doe), the court similarly affirmed that a church enjoys a privilege against charges of defamation, when the plaintiff continues to operate within the church, not having left the church.\n\nSo it can \"work\", to some extent.

Based on the precedent set in cases like Guinn v. Church of Christ, churches have a privilege to communicate transgressions of their members as part of their disciplinary process, but only while the individual remains a member of the church. Once a person leaves the church, they effectively withdraw their consent, and the church can be held liable for actions taken after the individual's departure. Therefore, the church would only be legally protected if they announce John's transgression before he officially leaves the church. \n\nOption A is incorrect because consent can be revoked by leaving the church.

The organization is quite informal. Although it has many regular meetings, all these meetings are open to the public. As such, most of those who attend, even many regular attendees, are not officially registered members of the organization.\n\nThe organization would like to keep track of those who attend for follow\\-up purposes. I have three related questions about what the GDPR permits. In the first two cases, the organization does not make any formal announcement that it is tracking the attendance of whom attends. (However, attendance numbers are occasionally mentioned informally, so it is not a secret, either.)\n\nFirst, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to take a count of how many people attend without recording any names? In this case, the organization groups the counts by the general age (child, teenager, or adult) and gender (male or female) of the attendees, but no names are recorded. These attendance numbers are shared among the organization members and are occasionally announced to all meeting attendees. (I would think that this is authorized.)\n\nSecond, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to record the attendees by name, including their general age and gender as mentioned above? The names are obtained through informal contact with the attendees during meetings; attendees are never explicitly asked if they want their attendance recorded. These attendance lists with names are shared only among organization members on follow\\-up committees. (This is the main case that I have questions about under the GDPR.)\n\nThird, in case either or both of the above cases are not authorized under the GDPR, is there any legal way that attendance by name can be recorded and shared among designated organization members? The primary hesitation to formally requesting authorization is that the organization wants attendance records to be as accurate as possible and if some attendees do not grant authorization, then the records will never be accurate. I have heard that one way to accomplish this would be to verbally announce at the beginning of each meeting that attendance is recorded, or to conspicuously post a written notice to this effect at the entrance. Would either of these fulfill GDPR obligations? Or is there an alternative solution?\n\nIn any answer, I would appreciate it if you could cite specific relevant sections of the GDPR so that I can learn the law better.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The scope of the GDPR is entered when personal data is being processed in a structured manner.\n\nPersonal data is any information relating to identifiable data subjects (definition in Art 4(1\\)). \"Peter attended the meeting on the 14th\" is personal data. \"That woman with the blue handbag said she wanted to return on the 25th\" is personal data. However, aggregate statistics do not relate to individuals, and are typically not personal data. \"On the 14th, we had 25 attendees\" is not personal data.\n\nNot all use of personal data is within the scope of the GDPR. For example, the GDPR would not apply if two organizers talk about who attended the meeting. However, Art 2(1\\) says the GDPR applies when personal data\n\n* is processed wholly or partially with automated means (e.g. computers, smartphones), or\n* forms a filing system or is intended for a filing system (e.g. keeping notes on attendees, keeping attendance lists)\n\nIf GDPR applies, the organization would be responsible for ensuring compliance with its rules and principles, summarized in Art 5\\. Primarily, this means:\n\n* having a clear purpose for processing\n* selecting a suitable Art 6 legal basis for that purpose (e.g. *consent* or a *legitimate interest*)\n* only processing the minimum data necessary for achieving that purpose\n* determining and implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of the processing activities\n* preparing for data subject rights, in particular by providing an Art 13 privacy notice when collecting data from the data subjects\n\nThere are of course some complexities in the details. When the legal basis is \"consent\" (opt\\-in), the organization would have to ensure that this consent was freely given and sufficiently informed. Per Art 7(4\\), consent would not be freely given if that consent was a condition for access to the meeting. Using \"legitimate interest\" (opt\\-out) can be more flexible, but it requires performing a balancing test to show that the legitimate interest isn't outweighed by the data subjects' interests, rights, and freedoms. Roughly, relying on a legitimate interest is appropriate when the data subjects can reasonably expect the processing activity to occur.\n\nRegarding **point 1**, keeping general counts and aggregate statistics about attendees is probably OK since it wouldn't be personal data. If you are very conscientious about this, you could round all counts and use categories like \"0\\-4 attendees, 5\\-9 attendees\" for each facet, which makes it more difficult to make inferences about individuals. But the fundamental point is that all your data should relate to attendees as a whole, never to individuals.\n\nRegarding **point 2 and 3**, this is a question of legal basis. Since you gather names through informal conversations, I think that attendees would be weirded out if they learned that you kept detailed records on their attendance. So I think that you probably wouldn't have a legitimate interest here. However, being upfront with this and offering an opt\\-out could change this.\n\nOn the aspect of keeping detailed notes on data from informal conversations, I'd like to point out H\\&M's EUR 35 million fine back in 2020 (summary on [GDPRHub.eu](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=HmbBfDI_-_H%26M)). In a callcenter, managers used to have conversations with employees. These conversations touched on anything from vacation experiences to health problems, marriage problems, and religious beliefs. All of that is fine. What was not fine is that the managers went full Stasi and kept detailed notes about all of this on a shared drive and used that information for management decisions. This went on until a configuration error made those files accessible to all employees. This violated all the points in the basic compliance process outlined above: the records had no clear purpose, no suitable legal basis, contained way more data than necessary (and even Art 9 special categories of data like information on health or religious beliefs which have extra protection), did not have appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, and did not fulfill data subject rights like the Art 13 right to be informed.\n\nIn case this non\\-profit is a church or religious organization that had its own comprehensive data protection rules before the GDPR came into force in 2018, those can continue to apply per Art 91\\.

It is also common for foreign attorneys to take the New York bar exam \\- several thousand people do that each year \\- in which case they have a springboard to appear *pro hac vice* in other states. The NY exam is well\\-understood in this way, in terms of training and support that might be offered in the country of origin. But one\\-off appearances, particularly by in\\-house counsel, also take place routinely.\n\nMany states, including California, also have a category of \"foreign legal consultant\", someone who is retained to advise on the law of the specific foreign jurisdiction in question, but who isn't allowed to appear in court.\n\nIn the current version of the California Rules of Court, *pro hac vice* is covered in [Rule 9\\.40](https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=nine&linkid=rule9_40). On its face, this rule only applies to attorneys who are \"eligible to practice before the bar of any United States court or the highest court in any state, territory, or insular possession of the United States\". There is a broad exception in 9\\.40(h),\n\n> This rule does not preclude the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal from permitting argument in a particular case from a person who is not a licensee of the State Bar, but who is licensed to practice in another jurisdiction and who possesses special expertise in the particular field affected by the proceeding.\n\n\"Another jurisdiction\" is not facially limited to U.S jurisdictions, so it may be that the higher state courts could admit a foreign attorney. I do not know of an example either way.\n\nIn general, California's licensing requirements for lawyers have often been strictly interpreted. The State Bar Act (Business and Professions Code, 6000\\-6243\\) says that:\n\n> No person shall practice law in California unless the person is an active licensee of the State Bar.\n\nAn attorney appearing *pro hac vice* is temporarily registered with the State Bar once their application has been approved by the court. This general licensing regime, which aims to protect the public against dishonest or incompetent practitioners, has been held (e.g. in *Birbrower v. Superior Court* 17 Cal. 4th 119 (1998\\)) to imply\n\n> a strong public policy favoring the practice of law in California by licensed State Bar members.\n\nOccasional admission *pro hac vice* does not extend to doing regular legal work of other kinds, including giving legal advice, preparing documents, and so on \\- and certainly not to maintaining a permanent physical office in California, or advertising to the public. If you would like to do those things then the state would like you to take their own bar exam, in which case (if you pass!) you are in the same situation as any other California lawyer.\n\nThere is a fairly recent exception for international commercial arbitration (*not* applicable to normal arbitration about things like disputes over personal property).

In that context, saying lewd and suggestive things about the courier whom a member employs over a poker game with the people who run all of her main stops in connection with her job might have a causal nexus for harassment case purposes with her job, effectively enlisting everyone she has to do business with in her job in a campaign of harassment against her.\n\nIn contrast, suppose that someone who is engaging in iffy conduct that doesn't quite cross the line of harassment at work towards this courier goes to that Pessimists Club meeting and targets his crass comments not at the courier but his ex\\-girlfriend towards whom he has engaged in lots of harassing conduct. His comments about his ex\\-girlfriend would not have a causal nexus to the courier's workplace and probably wouldn't be something that could be considered to determine if he was engaged in workplace harassment. This would be true even though small town gossip made his harassment of his ex\\-girlfriend common knowledge which make the courier take otherwise ambiguous conduct from him much more seriously knowing his modus operandi and capacity for escalating the situation.\n\nBut, ultimately, one has to make a rather holistic evaluation of the entire situation to determine if there is a causal nexus or not between non\\-workplace behavior and alleged workplace harassment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large tech company employs Sarah as a project manager.

In this case, John is interacting with Sarah's coworkers and making explicit comments about her, which could impact her work relationships and environment.

I'm wondering how judges decide what is \"reasonable\" when the way the law is written is so subjective . \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judges do not decide, jurors do (however, if a judge is the fact\\-finder, then the judge makes such a determination). The main input that the decision\\-maker gets is a jury instruction. In order to unify \"reasonable doubt\", \"reasonable price\", \"reasonable delay\" and so on, appeal is often made a mythical being, \"the reasonable man\", so reasonable force would be the degree of force the reasonable man would use in a given situation. I will draw from California criminal instructions ('cuz I have them) but similar instructions can be found across jurisdictions. For example, one instructions says \"A natural and probable consequence is one that a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes\". Or from a negligence instruction \"A reasonable person would have known that acting in that\nway would create such a risk\". More detailed appeal to The Reasonable Person is found in the justified homicide instruction:\n\n> Defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and (he/she) must have\n>  acted only because of that belief. The defendant is only entitled to\n>  use that amount of force that a reasonable person would believe is\n>  necessary in the same situation. If the defendant used more force than\n>  was reasonable, the \\[attempted] killing was not justified.\n> \n> \n> When deciding whether the defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable,\n>  consider all the circumstances as they were known to and appeared to\n>  the defendant and consider what a reasonable person in a similar\n>  situation with similar knowledge would have believed. If the\n>  defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have\n>  actually existed.\n> \n> \n> The defendant\u2019s belief that (he/she/ \\[or] someone else) was threatened\n>  may be reasonable even if (he/she) relied on information that was not\n>  true. However, the defendant must actually and reasonably have\n>  believed that the information was true.\n\nThere is no explanation of what it means to be \"a reasonable person\". Since nobody believes that they themselves are unreasonable, a simple and also wrong way of judging the matter is to subjectively judge whether *you yourself* would do the same thing, if you were in that situation. \n\nVery often, instructions do not even bother to say what \"reasonable\" means, so (re interpreting expert testimony) \"You may disregard any opinion that you find unbelievable, unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence\"; (re *corpus delicti*) \"That other evidence may be slight and need only be enough to\nsupport a reasonable inference that a crime was committed\"; \"Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to find the\ndefendant guilty, you must be convinced that the only reasonable\nconclusion supported by the circumstantial evidence is that the\ndefendant is guilty\", \"when considering circumstantial evidence, you must accept only reasonable conclusions and reject any that are unreasonable\"\n\nThe closest the law has come to articulating an objective characterization of \"reasonableness\" is in \"reasonable doubt\" instructions. One characterization is in [People v. Feldman, 71 N.E. 2d 433](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1293&context=faculty). \n\n> It is not a doubt based upon sympathy or a whim or prejudice or bias\n>  or a caprice, or a sentimentality, or upon a reluctance of a\n>  weak\\-kneed, timid, jellyfish of a juror who is seeking to avoid the\n>  performance of a disagreeable duty, namely, to convict another human\n>  being of the commission of a serious crime\n\nA somewhat improved characterization is the Calcrim instruction\n\n> Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an\n>  abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not\n>  eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to\n>  some possible or imaginary doubt\n\nThere is room for improvement, but it points in the right direction.\n\nOn rare occasions, a law is written that actually includes a definition. [The Gas Price Spike Act HR 3784](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3784/text) said\n\n> The term \u2018reasonable profit\u2019 means the amount determined by the\n>  Reasonable Profits Board to be a reasonable profit on the sale.\n\nIt is then up to the board to subjectively determine what that profit is. (BTW this did not become law). \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nIt's actually very difficult to determine what reasoning judges use in those cases where they are the determiners of fact.

The novel portrays Dr. Smith engaging in unethical medical practices. Dr. Johnson, recognizing himself in the character, sues the author for libel. During the lawsuit, emails are discovered confirming the author's intent to base the character on Dr. Johnson.

The lawsuit itself brings public attention to this connection, causing damage to Dr. Johnson's reputation.

For a statement to be considered libel, it must actually identify the plaintiff in a way that the public can recognize. In this case, before the lawsuit, no one other than the author and Dr. Johnson had made the connection between the fictional Dr. Smith and the real Dr. Johnson. Therefore, the original work did not meet the criteria for libel, as it did not effectively identify Dr. Johnson to the public. By filing the lawsuit and making the connection public, Dr. Johnson essentially consented to any subsequent alleged libel. Additionally, since Dr. Johnson suffered no damages prior to the lawsuit, he cannot claim libel based on the original work. The other options are incorrect: A) Intent alone doesn't constitute libel if the public can't identify the subject.

Residential fences are often governed by specific local laws at the municipal or county level in the US, so no generally applicable answer is possible, short of a book giving laws for each locality.\n\nCommon\\-Law Rules\n-----------------\n\nUnder the common law, followed by many but far from all US jurisdictions, the key question is whether a fence is a \"partition fence\" or not. A partition fence is one built on or near the property line that is owned jointly by the owners of the properties it divides.\n\nA fence near the property line is probably a partition fence if:\n\n* The two property owners jointly built or paid for the building of the fence;\n* Parts of the fence are on each side of the property line;\n* The owners have agreed that the fence is common property; or\n* Both owners \"use\" the fence, as by connecting it to another fence running in a different direction, or by relying on it to contain domestic animals.\n\nA Fence is probably not a partition fence if:\n\n* It is entirely clear of the property line;\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests maintains it; and\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests uses it.\n\nThe owner of one of the properties may not remove, demolish, or modify a partition fence without permission from the other. Removing or modifying a partition fence without the permission of the owner of the adjacent property is a tort, and can lead to damages for the value of the fence begin awarded.\n\nThe owners must each maintain a partition fence, often each caring for his or her side. Failing to do so may be a tort.\n\nIf a fence is not a partition fence, the owner of the land is also the sole owner of the fence, and may modify or remove it without permission from, or notice to, the owner of any adjacent or nearby property.\n\nHowever, the above common\\-law rules may be modified by local laws, and one would be wise to check, or consult a lawyer who knows how to check, before making any demands.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The page [\"Removal or Destruction of Fences\"](https://fences.uslegal.com/removal-or-destruction-of-fences/) from US legal reads:\n\n> A fence is an enclosure creating an adequate blockade around a particular land for the purpose of prohibiting intrusions from outside. A landowner can remove a fence, separating his/her land from that of his/her neighbor, when such fence is located wholly upon his/her own land. However, a landowner is not empowered to remove a partition fence without the adjacent landowner\u2019s consent. A partition fence is the joint property of adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> A fence erected on the line between the lands of adjoining owners generally belongs to the parties as tenants in common. Generally, a partition fence is built equally on both sides of the line. Until the contrary is shown, the partition fence is presumed to be the common property of both owners. An owner of adjoining land can remove a partition fence upon formal notice to adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> For an improper removal of a partition fence, an aggrieved party can bring an action for damages. The standard for measuring damages for such removal or destruction is its value at the time. The value is determined by replacement costs minus depreciation for age and use. Moreover, when someone builds a fence on another person\u2019s land without any authority to do so, the landowner can remove or destroy such fence. A person is liable for removing, destroying, or injuring a fence belonging to another person just as one who commits such acts against any kind of property belonging to another is liable\\[i]. Such person is considered a tortfeasor. However, an individual cannot remove or destroy a fence on another individual\u2019s land without his/her consent.\n\n* The page [\"Property Line and Fence Laws in Maryland\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/maryland-law/property-line-and-fence-laws-in-maryland.html) from FindLaw reads, in relevant part:\n\n> Maryland doesn't have specific rules dealing with fences. Instead, the state follows the common law practice that a fence built along a boundary line is owned in common by both property owners when both use the fence, unless otherwise agreed. A property owner is said to use a fence when they \"hook\\-up\" to the fence with another row of fence, or keep animals in the enclosure created by the fence. A fence built and used only by the builder is that person's sole property. When you purchase a new home, you take a property with an existing fence built and used by prior owners. Simply put, if you buy a property with a co\\-owned fence, you likely need to continue your maintenance of the fence.\n\n* The page [\"Is it legal for the neighbor to remove a fence on our shared property line?\"](https://answers.justia.com/question/2019/05/28/is-it-legal-for-the-neighbor-to-remove-a-693710) from Justia's \"Ask a Lawyer\" feature reads:\n\n> If both landowners paid to install a fence directly on a property line in the past, then yes, they need your permission to remove or replace the fence. Many fences are not built on a property line, but are instead just on one property or the other.\n> \n> \n> If you have had your land surveyed, you may be able to determine your exact property line. You or your neighbor are free to build new fences without permission as long as neither the fence nor any construction or excavation encroaches on the other's property.\n> \n> \n> Fences are a common property dispute, and can have long term effects. If a fence encroaches significantly on someone else's land for many years, this can actually become the new legal property line in some cases.\n\nAccording to the \"Fences\" section of the page [\"Disputes between your neighbours\"](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/for-the-public/common-legal-issues/disputes-between-your-neighbours/) from th New Zealand Law Society:\n\nIn New Zealand this is regulated by the Fencing Act 1978\\. Except where modified by individual agreements:\n\n> * Fences must be on the boundary line, though there is provision for give and take where the true boundary is difficult to fence.\n> * The cost of building or repairing a fence is borne equally between adjoining owners, unless one owner damages it, in which case the cost of repairs will fall on that owner.\n> * You can compel your neighbour to contribute to the cost of the fence bordering your two properties by following the procedures set out in the Fencing Act ...\n> * Developers of new subdivisions usually exempt themselves from contributing to the cost of a fence.\n> * Under the Property Law Act 2007, it is possible to apply to a District Court for an order to remove or alter a fence that is detrimentally affecting land or obstructing a view. Usually the cost of any removal falls on the person applying for the order.\n\n* The Booklet [\"Fences and the Law](https://Flsc.sa.gov.au/resources/FencesandtheLawBooklet.pdf) from the Legal Services Commission, South Australia states, on page 2:\n\n> Fences should be regarded as a joint\n> asset between neighbours.

If it is a partition fence, Alice would likely need Bob's permission to remove it. Factors that might make it a partition fence include:\n- If both Alice and Bob jointly built or paid for the fence\n- If parts of the fence are on each side of the property line\n- If both owners \"use\" the fence, as they do in this case by relying on it to contain their dogs\n\nHowever, local laws can modify these common law rules, so the specific jurisdiction's regulations would need to be consulted.

It should be used and interpreted as \u201cand/or\u201d. Just like how allegedly it is used here.\n\nBut the English language does not use it that way. It is seen often in the terse titles of the publications of the press. For e.g. \u201cU.S., EU to discuss Russian war threat Friday\u201d.\n\nAnd for their social consensus that the lack of a grammatical conjunction means the conjunctive operator (\u201cand\u201d), the above statement would mean the following:\n\n> \u201cThe flu kills, I believe, hundreds \\[and] thousands of people every year.\u201d\n\nNow who says that in the U.S.?

There is no such idiom as \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d in General American. And no one says \u201chundreds, thousands\u201d anywhere.\n\nAnd Gorsuch never said that. It\u2019s just another level when it turns out the Wise of the nation has a(t least one) conspiracy theorist idiot among them so he had to back track.\n\nI tried reviewing and rehearing the oral arguments and search for the alleged incorrect version as well as the allegedly corrected version, but found neither versions neither in the [transcript](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/21a240_7648.pdf) nor in the [audio](https://www.supremecourt.gov/media/audio/mp3files/21A240.mp3).\n\nNow, since at most of the time there is silence while one speaks in the oral arguments before the Supreme Court, it is plausible that even the audio was doctored and the part where he would actually say \u201chundreds **of** thousands\u201d (bold type added) the word \u201cof\u201d is deleted and a new audio is up now. But it is theoretically possible that the audio still includes the word \u201cof\u201d.\n\nSo, how does neither the transcript or the audio include these remarks of Gorsuch and where are the actual files that would at least include *one* of the alleged versions?\n\nOn the backwater of this: Has the Supreme Court ever been caught falsifying its own transcripts, for example, to avoid ridicule or considerable face loss or Gorsuch would be the proud first?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Gorsuch said it in the oral arguments on [*National Federation of Independent Business v.

The official transcriber seems to have transcribed that pause as a comma, but you're right that a comma doesn't really make grammatical sense.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't sound to me like an implausible thing to say.

Based on the audio evidence and linguistic analysis provided, the most plausible explanation is that Gorsuch said \"hundreds \u2014 thousands\" with a brief pause, likely correcting himself mid-sentence. This pause was initially transcribed as a comma, which doesn't make grammatical sense but reflects an attempt to capture the verbal hesitation. This interpretation aligns with the audio evidence, where no \"of\" is heard, and the cadence doesn't match how a native American English speaker would typically say \"hundreds of thousands.\" It also explains why the transcript needed to be amended, as the comma created confusion about Gorsuch's intended meaning. Options A and D suggest deliberate falsification, which is not supported by the evidence and would be an extreme measure. Option B is unlikely because \"hundreds and thousands\" is not a common idiomatic expression in American English, especially in this context."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33293/creative-commons-for-erotic-purpose", "docs_id": 33293, "title": "Creative commons for erotic purpose", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a young writer and I need free photos of girls's body ( so with faces covered ) for the cover of my erotic book similar to 50 shades of grey.\n\nCan I use the photos of flickr under this licence [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2\\.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) for my erotic book ?\n\nOr are there some restrictions for erotic purpose?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that the images are in fact released by the copyright holder under the CC\\_BY 2\\.0 license, and not under the CC\\_BY\\_NC or CC\\_BY\\_SA license, you are free to use the image on a book cover.

Here's a fun little example (*Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd.*, [\\[1964] S.C.R. 614](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1964/1964canlii88/1964canlii88.pdf)).\n\nThe plaintiff was a tug boat company who was providing tug services for the defendant who operated an oil refinery. The large crude oil tankers coming into the refinery needed tug guidance and the plaintiff provided this. There was an undisputed verbal acceptance of a written offer for services from June 13, 1961 to July 13, 1961\\. The agreement was expressly extended twice, each for two weeks, into August 1961\\. No further authorization for extension was made.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff continued to provide tug service for the incoming tankers and continued sending monthly invoices to the defendant until February 1962\\. The defendant did not pay and denied liability for all charges after the middle of August 1961\\.\n\nThe trial judge said:\n\n> I find that the defendant knew that the *Ocean Rockswift* continued after August 1, 1961, in commission on call to assist and did assist the large tankers during the period in question, and that the plaintiff expected payment on a rental basis for its being kept in commission. The defendant had ample opportunity to notify the plaintiff that it did not accept any liability on that basis, but did not do so. **The defendant acquiesced in the tug being so employed**.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada quoted from Anson on Contracts:\n\n> So if A allows B to work for him under such circumstances that no reasonable man would suppose that B meant to do the work for nothing, A will be liable to pay for it. The doing of the work is the offer; the permission to do it, or the acquiescence in its being done, constitutes the acceptance.\n\nAnd from Williston on Contracts:\n\n> Silence may be so deceptive that it may become necessary for one who receives beneficial services to speak in order to escape the inference of a promise to pay for them.\n\nBut the Supreme Court of Canada clarified:\n\n> ... mere failure to disown responsibility to pay compensation for services rendered is not of itself always enough to bind the person who has the benefit of those services. The circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.\n\n---\n\nThis answer shows how silence can play a role from a pure common law contract perspective, without considering equitable principles.

As illustrated in the Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd. case, silence alone doesn't imply consent, but silence combined with continued actions (like accepting services) can indicate acquiescence to terms. The circumstances must suggest that a reasonable person would infer acceptance. Here, Company X's continued reception of progress reports without objection to the stated rate, coupled with allowing the work to continue, could be interpreted as implied acceptance of the terms. However, this is not definitive (ruling out option A) and depends on the specific circumstances. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the potential for implied contracts.
