When is a soldier taking \"active part\" in the hostilities?\n\nAre they considered to take an active part when they are sleeping? Awake but eating dinner? Does it matter if they are armed at the time, or merely \"in uniform\"? Are there (other) times when a uniformed member of the military would not be considered \"taking active part\" in the hostilities?

Here's a question based on the provided documentation about the Geneva Convention and the concept of \"active part\" in hostilities:\n\nQuestion: A military unit is stationed in a forward operating base near an active conflict zone. Which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered as a soldier taking an \"active part\" in hostilities according to the Geneva Convention?\n\nA) A soldier who is sleeping in the barracks after completing their shift\nB) An off-duty soldier writing a letter to their family while in uniform\nC) A soldier performing routine maintenance on a combat vehicle\nD) A wounded soldier receiving medical treatment in the base infirmary\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the Geneva Convention's provisions and application to real-world scenarios. The correct answer is C because a soldier performing routine maintenance on a combat vehicle is directly contributing to military operations, even if not engaged in combat at that moment.\n\nOption A (sleeping soldier) and B (off-duty soldier writing a letter) might seem like they're not taking an active part, but the documentation clearly states that sleeping or being off-duty does not make a soldier hors de combat. They are still considered to be taking an active part in hostilities by virtue of being members of the armed forces who are not hors de combat.\n\nOption D (wounded soldier receiving treatment) is incorrect because this soldier would likely be considered hors de combat due to incapacitation by wounds, as specified in the Convention's definition.\n\nThe key point is that members of the armed forces are considered to be taking an active part in hostilities at all times, unless they are hors de combat as specifically defined. Routine activities that contribute to military readiness, like vehicle maintenance, are clearly part of taking an active part in hostilities. This question tests the understanding that \"active part\" is not limited to direct combat actions, but encompasses a broader range of military activities and states of readiness."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53430/why-did-the-show-lucifer-need-the-rights-to-the-dc-character", "docs_id": 53430, "title": "Why did the show &#39;Lucifer&#39; need the rights to the DC character?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For a little bit of background since I don't expect you to watch the show:\n\n* The necessary feature of the show is that lucifer leaves hell and then runs a nightclub\n* The personalities and features of the majority of the characters are different to the source material; they only share a name.\n\nSo if the characters did not share their comic book name (besides Lucifer himself since that's not copyrighted), would the show avoid a copyright strike from DC?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Lucifer TV show is an adaptation of the comic series of the same name, but with a lot of creative license applied to make the show more viewer friendly/dramatic.

The correct answer is C because, even with significant changes, the core premise and inspiration from the original work make it a derivative work. The Lucifer TV show example demonstrates that despite many differences from the source material, a license was still necessary due to the underlying concept and story similarities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because changing everything except the main character's name would likely still be considered a derivative work, especially if the supernatural origin is retained. Option B, while changing more elements, could still be seen as derivative if the core premise remains similar. Option D would likely still infringe on copyright as it retains too many elements from the original work.\n\nThis question tests the understanding that copyright protection extends beyond exact replication to include derivative works, even when significant changes are made.

The correct answer is B because the privacy notice in the email, despite its presumptive language, cannot unilaterally impose legal obligations on the recipient without prior consent or agreement. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, while the notice suggests this, it cannot legally bind the recipient to FERPA or HIPAA requirements simply by sending an unsolicited email.

Am I eligible for workers compensation or a personal injury claim?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably yes. In general, if you are an employee, and you get hurt doing your job (as it seems you did), your employer is liable.\n\nIn most states, employers are required to carry workers compensation policies that pay your injury claim. But even if your employer doesn't have workers' comp, they are still liable, and they still have to pay. \n\nThe theory here is that when do what your employer says, they become responsible for keeping you safe. If they fail to do so, then in the eyes of the law, they may be liable to you. That doesn't necessarily mean they did anything evil or obviously irresponsible. It just means they failed in their duty to protect you.\n\nIf you were an independent contractor (and not an employee), you may not be eligible for workers' comp. But if you were doing what your boss told you to do (in legalese, if you were acting as their \"agent\"), you probably still have a claim.\n\nYou can always file a claim yourself, but many people in your situation choose to hire a lawyer to help them through the process.

The documentation explicitly states that \"If you were an independent contractor (and not an employee), you may not be eligible for workers' comp.\" This distinction is crucial because it determines the legal framework under which the claim would be processed.\n\nIf the individual is a full-time employee, they would likely be covered under workers' compensation, which is a no-fault system designed to provide benefits for work-related injuries regardless of who was at fault. Employers are generally required to carry this insurance for their employees.\n\nHowever, if the individual is an independent contractor, they would not typically be eligible for workers' compensation. In this case, they might need to pursue a personal injury claim, which could be more challenging and require proving negligence on the part of the business owner.\n\nThe other options, while important, don't have the same potential to fundamentally alter the legal approach:\nA) The frequency of exposure is relevant but doesn't change the type of claim available.\nB) The owner's involvement strengthens the case but doesn't change the type of claim.\nC) The lack of immediate severe injuries might affect the compensation amount but doesn't determine eligibility for workers' comp.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the distinction between employees and independent contractors, the basics of workers' compensation, and the potential for personal injury claims.

The second is more around what could they do.\n\nCan it be construed as libel, solicitation or something else I probably should be aware of? Though it might tarnish the image, assuming those statements are true I believe the criteria for libel would not be met. \n\nTo solicitation, they have a broad and basic anti\\-solicitation policy, including \"Any solicitation within any club is absolutely forbidden.\" While provocative, I don't see that this can be defined as soliciting. Even if I were to list competitors, without me benefitting from any sales that still seems at worst a gray area. Am I misinterpreting soliciting?\n\nAs to recourse, sure they can ask me not to wear it. Were I to refuse to remove the shirt, could they bar me from using the membership without refund for doing something that is legal and within dress code, but deemed naughty in their sight? \n\n**Edit: Background**\n\nI joined XYZ 22 years ago. ABC bought XYZ four years ago. At the time of ABC buying the XYZ, my membership was specifically to location A. It remained so after the purchase and we continued under essentially that agreement (I now pay annual dues to ABC in return for membership to location A). \n\nIn late September, ABC accepted annual payment, then announced about five weeks later they were closing \"my\" gym (location A). It is, IMO, a bit disingenuous at this point to accept payment on an agreement they likely knew they were going to alter. On Nov. 30, they closed location A and transferred me to location B.\n\nAs to why it's bothersome, admittedly part of the issue is annoyance with just being told, in effect, \"We broke the agreement, and you'll take what we substitute.\" But more materially it's a matter of:\n\n1. adding 9\\-15 minutes travel to every workout;\n2. being more crowded;\n3. more tightly spacing equipment;\n4. less of the equipment I use;\n5. worse condition of the equipment;\n6. fewer \"spare\" weights; and\n7. smaller open training area.\n\n**Two have asked:**\n\nPrior to reaching this point, I attempted...\n\n* a request over their website without response;\n* speaking to a person in the cancellation department.

ABCGym has substituted an inferior\\-to\\-me option.\n\ncould certainly be considered as defamatory. However, in the US and many other countries, truth would be a valid defense, if the person making the statement could prove that the statement is true.\n\nI don't see how it could be construed as solicitation.\n\nIf worn on a shirt into ABC, the management could surely ask the wearer to remove it. If that request is refused, they could ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer has a valid membership, then it would depend on the exact terms of the membership contract, and provisions of local law, whether ABC could insist that the wearer leave, or have the wearer arrested for trespass should the wearer refuse. Any regulations incorporated by reference into the contract would also matter.\n\nAt least in the US. walking back and forth on a public sidewalk just outside ABC's door, wearing such a shirt or carrying a classic picket sign with such a message would be pretty clearly legal, provided that others are not unduly obstructed, and no valid local ordinance is violated.\n\nIn the wear\\-the\\-shirt\\-inside case, if the wearer refuses to remove the shirt or leave, the management would probably call law enforcement. LE will not want to decide whether wearer has the legal right to remain in the club wearing the shirt. They will probably ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer protests that s/he has a valid membership and thus a contractual right to stay, who knows what they would do. If they still ask the wearer to leave, the wearer would be wise to comply and perhaps take legal action to enforce his or her membership rights, which will depend on the contract details as mentioned above.

Option A is the most likely to expose the member to legal risks while still potentially achieving their goal. Here's why:\n\n1. Wearing the shirt inside the gym and refusing to leave if asked could potentially lead to trespassing charges, even with a paid membership. The documentation states that if the wearer refuses to leave when asked, law enforcement might be called, and they would likely ask the wearer to leave to avoid deciding on the legality of the situation.\n\n2. Option B (picketing outside) is explicitly mentioned as \"pretty clearly legal\" in the US, provided it doesn't obstruct others or violate local ordinances. This makes it a safer option legally.\n\n3. Option C (social media posting) isn't directly addressed in the documentation, but generally, posting opinions online carries less immediate legal risk than confrontational in-person actions.\n\n4. Option D (wearing the shirt to other gyms) isn't discussed in the documentation and likely wouldn't directly impact ABCGym or achieve the member's goals as effectively.\n\nOption A involves the most complex interplay of contract law, property rights, and potential criminal charges (trespassing). It requires the member to balance their right to express dissatisfaction against the gym's right to control their premises and enforce their policies.

Several years ago I went to the ER to have an injury treated. I presented my insurance at the time of the injury. About a month ago (several years after the ER visit) I was contacted by Phoenix Financial Services, a debt collection agency saying I owed a significant amount of money for the physician portion of the services (the hospital was paid separately). \n\nRecently, I found out from my insurance that the physician's billing services never billed them. My insurer notified me that per the insurer's contract with this physician group, the physician group may not bill the patient until they have submitted a claim. So, not only should this group have never sent this bill to a debt collector, they shouldn't have sent me a bill in the first place.\n\nI called the physician group today and they agreed they will write the bill off after confirming that I am eligible for my insurance.\n\nI have Googled around and learned briefly about the concept of debt validation. Here is what I don't understand. Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, it appears that a debt collector can demand payment (with the threat of harming your credit score) until you request a debt validation. Is it true that a debt collector has no responsibility to validate the debt (e.g. make sure it's legit) until **after** you ask them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is correct, per [15 USC 1692g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692g), that the collector can wait until the consumer files notifies the collector of the debt, before sending verification. The law does not state what form that verification must take, and it would suffice if the collector provided evidence that services were rendered and not paid for. The verification can't just be a restatement that \"you owe $10,000\", but it does not have to be in the form of a court's judgment that the consumer owes money. Taking all of the provisions of the act together, the debt\\-holder's ultimate recourse is to take you to court, so that you will be ordered to pay the debt. One of your options is to tell the debt collector to not contact you, which forces the debt\\-holder to sue you. Demanding verification of the debt is an option, potentially useful in case of a mistake, especially in overcoming the assumption that the collector can otherwise make, that the debt is valid. At some point, one might need to prove in court that the debt is *not* valid (and it didn't come to that in your case). In this case, the debt *is* valid (you did receive the services), the problem is something else.\n\nThere is no statutory requirement that an ER must submit claims to a person's insurance company. They may be required to do so as part of their contract with Acme Insurance, if they have a contract with Acme. That is a matter between Acme and the ER, and you cannot sue the ER for failing to follow the terms of their contract with Acme. You might sue Acme if they fail to perform a contractual obligation with you, but they have no obligation to sue an ER to keep you happy. Suing your insurance company would be pointless, because Acme didn't fail to do what they were supposed to do. Suing the ER would also be pointless, because (or, *assuming*) they didn't promise to bill your insurance first. You would need to look carefully at the terms of your contract with the ER Physicians Group (not the hospital). It is likely that they have some kind of liability disclaimer stating that they are not liable for damage arising from insurance screw\\-ups. And finally, suing the debt collector would be also pointless because from your report of the facts, they didn't violate the law and you don't have a contractual relationship with the collector.\n\nOne can always get a free initial consultation with an attorney to see if he thinks there is a case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A consumer in Maryland receives a collection notice for an unpaid medical bill from several years ago. Upon investigation, they discover that the healthcare provider never billed their insurance company, violating the provider's contract with the insurer. Which of the following actions would be the most effective and legally sound approach for the consumer to address this situation?\n\nA) Sue the debt collection agency for violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\nB) File a lawsuit against the insurance company for failing to enforce their contract with the healthcare provider\nC) Request debt validation from the collection agency and inform them of the billing error\nD) Ignore the collection notice, as the statute of limitations for medical debt in Maryland has likely expired\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the given documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, is the most effective and legally sound approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Debt validation: The documentation mentions that consumers have the right to request debt validation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This is a crucial first step in disputing a potentially invalid debt.\n\n2. Billing error: The question scenario mirrors the original post, where the healthcare provider failed to bill the insurance company. Informing the collection agency of this error provides them with important information that may lead to the debt being invalidated or returned to the original creditor.\n\n3. Legal limitations: Option A is incorrect because, based on the information provided, the debt collection agency hasn't violated the FDCPA. They are allowed to attempt collection until the consumer requests validation.\n\n4. Contractual issues: Option B is not viable because, as explained in the documentation, the consumer cannot sue the insurance company for the healthcare provider's failure to follow their contract. This is a matter between the insurer and the provider.\n\n5. Statute of limitations: While option D might seem tempting, ignoring the debt is risky. The statute of limitations varies by state and type of debt, and even if expired, it doesn't make the debt invalid. Additionally, the collector might still report the debt to credit bureaus.\n\n6. Proactive approach: Requesting validation and providing information about the billing error (option C) is a proactive step that addresses the issue directly, potentially resolving it without the need for legal action or long-term credit impacts.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the examinee to evaluate different courses of action, consider legal and practical implications, and choose the most effective solution based on the information provided in the documentation."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28665/can-a-doctor-from-one-country-prescribe-medicine-to-a-person-in-another-country", "docs_id": 28665, "title": "Can a doctor from one country prescribe medicine to a person in another country?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can a doctor from one country prescribe medicine to a person in another country if they both are connecting through an online medium?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You don't say what exactly you mean by \"can\". \n\nFirst, that doctor won't prescribe anything unless they are paid.

The correct answer, C, addresses the most significant challenge highlighted in the text.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that prescriptions issued by a doctor are typically only valid in the doctor's country, often limited to specific local pharmacies.

But this gives you nothing even if you succeed, except that the phone exists there.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: But that a phone number exists in your collection *is* interesting information. Since phone numbers are identifying and so short that they are guessable, hashing does not provide anonymization. Hashing could still be an appropriate safety measure or pseudonymization technique.

What is the purpose of processing?\n\t* Some purposes like national security or purely personal and household purposes are exempt from the GDPR\n2. What is the legal basis for this purpose?\n\t* E.g. consent, legitimate interest, legal obligations, \u2026\n3.

When accounts were leaked in the Ashley Madison data breach, that drove some users to suicide. In some countries, the existence of a Grindr account can be a death sentence. Those are examples involving special categories of data per GDPR Art 9, so likely far more sensitive than the context of this question.

Thus, there can be differences between different cities.\n\nIf you intend to surpass the 120/240 day limit, you must get prior authorization.

The correct answer is A because while Big Co. might pursue various legal strategies, a defamation lawsuit presents the most significant challenge for Bob. \n\nThe documentation suggests that attempts to silence individuals through trademark law or injunctions have largely been unsuccessful, especially when dealing with matters of public concern. The First Amendment provides strong protection for speech on public issues, making it difficult to obtain gag orders or injunctions against individuals publicizing accusations.\n\nHowever, defamation law still presents a potential avenue for Big Co. to challenge Bob's publicization efforts.

An invalid provision of a contract is unenforceable. Likewise, and unenforceable provision of a contract is invalid. Here are the definitions of the two from Black's Law Dictionary. (10th. ed. 2014\\) defines them as follows: \n\n> **Unenforceable Contract** \\- An otherwise valid contract that,\n>  because of some technical defect, cannot be fully enforced; a contract\n>  that has some legal consequences but that may not be enforced in an\n>  action for damages or specific performance in the face of certain\n>  defenses, such as the statute of frauds.\n> \n> \n> \u00a0**Invalid Contract** \\- An agreement that is either void or voidable.\n\nAlso, be aware that invalid and unenforceable are *different* than void and voidable contracts.

Void contract describes a situation where despite the intention of the parties, no contract has been made. \n\n> **Voidable Contract** \\- A contract that can be affirmed or rejected at the option of one of the parties; a contract that is void as to the\n>  wrongdoer but not void as to the party wronged, unless that party\n>  elects to treat it as void. \u2014 Also termed voidable agreement.\n> \n> \n> \n> > \u201cA voidable contract is a contract which, in its inception, is\n> >  valid and capable of producing the results of a valid contract, but\n> >  which may be \u2018avoided,\u2019 i.e. rendered void at the option of one (or\n> >  even, though rarely, of both) of the parties.\u201d P.S.

The question states that the court found the pricing term to be contrary to public policy, which makes it invalid and unenforceable.\n\n2. The contract includes a severability clause, which explicitly states that invalid or unenforceable provisions should be severed from the agreement while the rest remains in effect.\n\n3. According to the documentation, \"invalid\" and \"unenforceable\" are essentially synonymous in contract law. Both terms refer to provisions that cannot be legally enforced.\n\n4. The severability clause is designed to preserve the overall contract even if individual terms are found to be problematic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a void contract is one that has no legal effect from the beginning. Here, only one term is invalid, not the entire contract.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a voidable contract is one that can be affirmed or rejected at the option of one party, usually due to some defect in formation.

The key factors are:\n\n1. Intent: There is no intent to injure or defraud, which is a crucial element in the definition of forgery.\n\n2. Authorization: John gave Sarah explicit permission to sign on his behalf. The legal definition of forgery includes the phrase \"without the authority of anyone entitled to grant it.\" In this case, John, as the payee, is entitled to grant this authority, and he did so.\n\n3. No false completion: The check is not being falsely completed because Sarah has the authority to sign it.\n\n4. Common practice: While not a legal justification, the question notes that this is a common practice among couples, suggesting it's generally accepted.\n\n5.

There is a feature called fork. This is described here: [github fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo). What happens if a user forks a repository that contains illegally uploaded material like ebooks?\n\nI think the first thing is a takedown as a consequence of a dmca takedown request. What can happen afterwards? I have several questions:\n\n1. Can a person that forks such a repository be sued?\n2. There might be dozens or hundred of people worldwide who forked this repository as a way to bookmark it. How is this handled in practise? Does the content owner identify every user and sues them in their homecountry? Or is only the initial uploader sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"illegally uploaded material like ebooks\" I presume is meant content uploaded without permission from the copyright owner or any authorized agent, and not under any license which permits such uploading and use.\n\nForking a repository means making copies of the files it contains. If the files were uploaded without a proper license or permission from the copyright holder that would be an act of infringement.\n\nGithub's documentation about forking (linked in the question) says:\n\n> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n> \n> \n> Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.\n\nHowever, GitHub requires that users upload only content that the user owns or has the right to upload and license. (This means that any user who uploads unauthorized files is violating the Github terms.) Thus a forking user may be relying on that assurance from the uploading user. If the forking user is aware that the files are unauthorized (perhaps pirated) then forking is an act of knowing infringement. If the forking user is not aware, and has no reason to think that the files are unauthorized, then any act of infringement is not knowing, much less willful.\n\nUnder [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law, infringement is actionable even if it was not knowing. See [17 USC 501](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#501), which says:\n\n> Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.\n\nBut under [17 USC 504](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504) if the infringer proves that the infringement was \"innocent\" meaning:\n\n> ... that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright\n\nThen statutory damages may be as low as $200 per work infringed.\n\nOn the other hand US statutory damages can be as high as $30,000 or up to $150,000 if willful infringement is proved. The plaintiff has the option to instead get actual damages, plus any profits made by the infringer. In some cases legal fees and costs may be added to the amount of a judgement.\n\nThe details of copyright laws will be different in different countries, but the general principles will be similar.\n\nThus the copyright holder **could** sue any user who forks a repo containing unauthorized content.\n\nAs a practical matter, a holder is not likely to sue a user who merely forked a repo with no good reason to know that the content was unauthorized. The costs of bringing such a suit would probably exceed the damages. However, if any reasonable forking user would have known or suspected that the files were unauthorized, the situation would be different, and a suit might be more likely.

The correct answer, C, reflects the most likely outcome based on the information provided:\n\n1. DMCA takedown notices are typically the first step in addressing copyright infringement on platforms like GitHub. This aligns with the documentation mentioning \"takedown as a consequence of a dmca takedown request.\"\n\n2.

As stated in the documentation, \"if the forking user is aware that the files are unauthorized (perhaps pirated) then forking is an act of knowing infringement. If the forking user is not aware, and has no reason to think that the files are unauthorized, then any act of infringement is not knowing, much less willful.\"\n\n3. The answer acknowledges that further legal action is possible, but it's contingent on factors like the user's awareness and response to the takedown notice. This aligns with the practical considerations mentioned: \"As a practical matter, a holder is not likely to sue a user who merely forked a repo with no good reason to know that the content was unauthorized.\"\n\n4. The answer implicitly recognizes that pursuing legal action against all 500 users worldwide would be impractical and costly, which is why the initial step would likely be takedown notices.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the legal situation and incorrectly assumes blanket protection for users who fork repositories.

The criminal penalty provisions are [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-578), as authorized by [49 USC 30170](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/30170) \u2013 basically, lying in a report to the government will get you in trouble. You would have to track down all of the provisions in the regulations, but [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/32506) is the bumper prohibition. The rule prohibits manufacture or importation of a car or a part that doesn't meet the standard. Subsection (b) addresses the \"then added later\" question, generally saying that there is little prohibition against you tweaking your car. First, if you \"had no reason to know, by exercising reasonable care, that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with the standard\", you are not subject to penalty. Usually, people have absolutely no reason to know that some part is unsafe, which is not the same as non\\-compliant, but you might pick up a really cheap bumper having been told that it is cheap because it totally ignores the applicable standards: then you would have reason to know. Used cars and parts are not subject to any federal scrutiny.\n\nThe concept of a \"vehicle in violation\" is a legal misconception. Certain acts violate, objects do not violate. The chokepoint that controls car parts is the \"manufacture or sell\" part of the law, which prevents Auto Zone from selling you a bumper made of clay (it does not prevent you from installing such a bumper \u2013 unless your state has a specific law to that effect).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"there is no criminal sanction for installing an 'aftermarket' product on your vehicle\" for non-commercial vehicles. Penalties are usually limited to tickets, not criminal charges.\n\n2. The federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards primarily focus on manufacturers and importers, not end-users.

The concept of a \"vehicle in violation\" is described as a legal misconception. The documentation emphasizes that certain acts violate laws, but objects themselves do not violate.\n\n4.

This means that the shop that built and installed the custom roll cage and suspension might be in violation of federal regulations if these parts do not meet safety standards.\n\n5. While the state law criminalizes operating a vehicle in violation of safety standards, the federal regulations don't typically target end-users for modifications.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the driver is unlikely to face criminal charges based on the information provided. Option B is incorrect because the vehicle manufacturer isn't typically held liable for aftermarket modifications.

The guy led her to believe that he was registered financial advisor (though I didn't find anything to that effect in her contract or their message history). Then she had some bad luck: lost her job, wrecked her car, etc. So she wanted to dip into her savings. She contacted the guy, who agreed to start disbursements from her investments (which he claimed to have a value of several times the principal at that point; he gave an approximate dollar figure). He paid out a couple thousand, then started delaying, temporizing, and making excuses. After a while of this, she started asking for all of her funds to be returned. She continued regularly asking him for her money over the next number of months and this behaviour continued.\n\nNo doubt about it: my friend's trust in this guy was unwise.

Is this a felony?\n\nBoth parties here live in the US state of Washington.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fraud may be a crime, or a tort (civil wrong): only criminal fraud can be a \"felony\". The Washington criminal laws about fraud are [here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.45&full=true), and they are all fairly specific, such as selling or destroying encumbered property (which is a misdemeanor anyhow), or conducting a mock auction. Most frauds are misdemeanors, though forgeries are in the felony category. It also includes identity thefts, again the emphasis being on false documents. Based on your description, this is not a crime, it is a civil wrong, meaning that she will have to sue the guy to get her money back. The Attorney General's office will not get involved unless there is a widespread state interest (for example, very many Washington residents being victimized), and then the involvement would be suing on behalf of the victims.\n\nThat said, if the swindle was carried out by phone, then that is potentially a violation of a federal felony law, [18 USC 1343](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343). It would not matter if the parties are in the same state, because phone service counts as \"interstate commerce\". So the details of phone involvement matter.

The correct approach is to pursue a civil lawsuit (option C) for several reasons:\n\n1. Based on the information provided, this case doesn't clearly fall under specific criminal fraud statutes in Washington state. Most frauds described in state law are misdemeanors and focus on specific acts like selling encumbered property or conducting mock auctions.\n\n2. While the actions described are unethical and likely fraudulent, they don't automatically constitute a felony under state law. The documentation emphasizes that most frauds are treated as civil wrongs rather than criminal offenses in Washington.\n\n3. The Attorney General's office (option B) typically doesn't get involved in individual cases unless there's a widespread state interest affecting many residents.\n\n4. A federal wire fraud charge (option D) could potentially apply if the swindle was carried out by phone, but this isn't guaranteed based on the information provided. Simply requesting additional fees via text or email doesn't necessarily constitute wire fraud.\n\n5. A civil lawsuit allows the friend to seek recovery of her funds and potentially additional damages, addressing the core issue of getting her money back.\n\n6.

For example, if the wholesaler is selling the books on a consignment basis for the publisher and has a right to return the unsold books without payment to the publisher and doesn't have to pay for the books sold until they are sold at retail, the first sale doctrine likewise does not apply.\n\nIt also isn't entirely obvious that the \"first sale doctrine\" makes it illegal to count U.S. sales towards the amount due to the U.S. publisher rather than the U.K. publisher, even if they are sold by WB Books instead of Bathroom Books. (Re the faux names of the publishers, one of the first books I every handled copyright and licensing for, a year out of law school, involved bathroom humor.)\n\nAlso, if the case ends up in a U.K. court before it reaches a U.S. court, the first sale doctrine may or may not apply, but *Kirtsaeng v.

The EU definition of personal data includes \"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person,\" whether directly or indirectly.\n2. IP addresses are explicitly mentioned as a means of identification, falling under the categories of physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identities.\n3.

It turns out that paintings, boats and their parts that are older that 50 years old are on the list for Norway, but not Iraq.

The documentation clearly shows that laws regarding antiquities and cultural objects vary significantly between countries. For example:\n\n1. Age thresholds differ: Norway restricts items over 50 years old, while other countries may have different age limits or no specific age requirement.\n2. Definitions vary: Tanzania includes \"ethnographic objects\" regardless of age, while other countries focus on specific types of artifacts or time periods.\n3.

You definitely want a lawyer as it is a $500 fine and/or 60 days in jail for your case (property damage, no injury or loss of life).\n\nThe good news is that if you can argue the case correctly, it's very easy to get a Not Guilty verdict. Under Florida Law, a Hit and Run must meet the following criteria to legally find someone guilty:\n\n> 1. Disputes as to the identity of the driver;\n> 2. Lack of knowledge that a crash occurred;\n> 3. Lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property;\n> 4. The failure to stop was not willful, but was dictated by circumstances;\n> 5. The defendant stopped as close as possible to the site of the accident;\n> 6. The other driver refused to receive identifying information\n> 7. The other driver became belligerent, necessitating that the defendant leave the scene to call police;\n> 8. The assistance rendered was \u2018reasonable\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\n\nGiven that you had no lack of knowledge that a crash occurred (2\\) AND lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property (3\\.) AND you would have stopped but for the circumstances of the event prevented you from recieiving knowledge of that the crash had occured (4\\) you already fail to meet 3 of the 8 criteria. This should be easy to argue in and of itself, but where you need a lawyer to assist is in criteria 7\\. While you were never fearing the other driver to such a degree that you needed to call the police, his behavior was interpreted by you as \"road rage\" and you had a reasonable fear to not wish to engage him. It's not rules as written, but it could be that the rules allow for leaving the scene because of the plaintiff's behavior and could be valid in other forms. I'll admit, this will vary wildly on the judge's own interpretation of that rule, BUT it's worth a try.\n\nKeep in mind with all of these, the Prosecution will be required to prove all 8 facts against you, while you only have to disprove one, to some level of doubt. As an armchair jury, I have no facts to support your story, but I have no facts to doubt it either. And when doubt happens, you must assume innocence.\n\nIt would help if you had any hint of the officers attitude at the time. Was he friendly? Dismissive? Distracted? What was the guy who hit you's attitude towards the situation? Was he constantly yelling at you and the officer? Was he quiet and separated?\n\nEither way, get a lawyer because 60 days of jail time and a $500 fine is not something you want to fight by yourself.

The correct answer, D, combines multiple strong defense points that directly align with the legal criteria outlined in the documentation.\n\n1. \"Lack of knowledge about the impact\" addresses criterion 3: \"Lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property.\" The driver explicitly states they didn't hear or feel any contact.\n\n2. \"The failure to stop not being willful\" aligns with criterion 4: \"The failure to stop was not willful, but was dictated by circumstances.\" The driver didn't intentionally flee; they were unaware of the accident.\n\n3. \"The other driver's perceived threatening behavior\" relates to criterion 7, which mentions leaving the scene due to the other driver becoming belligerent. While not an exact match, the driver's perception of road rage could be argued as a reasonable cause for not stopping, especially when combined with the lack of knowledge about the accident.\n\nThis combination provides the strongest defense by addressing multiple legal criteria and incorporating the unique circumstances of the case.\n\nOption A is partially correct but misses the crucial element of the failure to stop not being willful.

I can only think of twothree reasons:\n\n1. The forfeit is mutual: I.e., both spouses agree to an identical clause. *Or*, the spouses agree to substantially equal clauses. (E.g., one spouse forfeits *y* if *x*, and the other forfeits *b* if *a*; where a\u00b7b \u2248 x\u00b7y.)\n2. One spouse requires the contract as a condition of continuing the marriage. However, **I am dubious that this scenario is enforceable**. I.e., if I one day say to my spouse, \"I'm divorcing you unless you agree to give up your marital right to *y*,\" I have a suspicion that such an \"agreement\" might not withstand an artful legal challenge for several reasons: The *consideration* I'm offering is something I already pledged. This is like demanding a contract renegotiation once a counterparty has undertaken work. It *seems* like something that would be ripe for estoppel.\n3. (Thanks to @ohwilleke for noting this one:) The spouse forfeiting a right stands to gain something in exchange.

This option involves a specific future inheritance, provides a clear reason for the agreement, and doesn't involve coercion or unilateral demands.

The exception to double jeopardy you're referring to applies to charges from separate sovereigns. When considering whether two entities can both charge someone, you trace back each of them to the sovereign power that gives them their authority. States are considered sovereign, as are Indian tribes with respect to crimes committed by Indians (although for certain serious crimes like murder, Congress arguably stripped tribal courts of jurisdiction with the Major Crimes Act). The United States is of course sovereign.\n\nThe military is *not* sovereign. Military charges are based on the sovereignty of the United States, so double jeopardy applies between military and civilian federal courts. Likewise, US territories (and DC) are not sovereign and have criminal jurisdiction based on the sovereignty of the United States, so territorial (and DC) charges are subject to double jeopardy with each other, with military charges, and with civilian federal charges.

The owner receives no consideration from you in exchange for storing your goods, and an essential element of contracts is an *exchange of considerations*. Thus, he has no obligation to continue storing your goods. \n\nAnother essential element in contract law is that the agreement \\-\\-meaning the conditions thereof\\-\\- be entered knowingly and willfully.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. There is no formal contract between the parties, as there was no exchange of consideration, which is an essential element of a contract. The business owner received nothing in return for storing the items.\n\n2. Promissory estoppel (option B) is unlikely to apply here, as it would be difficult to prove all necessary elements, particularly that injustice can only be avoided by enforcing the promise of indefinite storage.\n\n3.

The owner can legally end the arrangement and request removal of the items.

For example, in Canada and the United States, registering a copyright creates presumptive proof that the copyright exists and is owned by the registrant. In Canada, breathalyzer results are conclusive proof of the blood alcohol concentration if certain conditions are met.\n\nSome of these regimes are not subject to challenge: they are legal facts even if they are not objectively true (e.g. the breathalyser results). Others create presumptions that can be overcome by contrary evidence (e.g. copyright ownership).\n\n### The default: present relevant evidence, including testimonial evidence\n\nBut outside of special regimes, **you prove a fact by introducing evidence**. The default is that **all relevant evidence that bears on a material fact is admissible**. Evidence is relevant when, if is were to be accepted, it would make the fact in issue more or less likely to be true. Evidence comes in many forms: testimony of the parties or witnesses, documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert opinion evidence.\n\nIf you are wondering, \"How do I prove X?\" Ask yourself, why do you believe X? Or, how do you know X? Or, how has the event X left its mark on the world? Whatever has led you to believe X probably is the evidence that you would want to introduce to the court to help prove X. Perhaps you saw X: you can tell the court you saw X. Perhaps you took a photo of X: you can present that photo in court. Perhaps you have a receipt for X: you can show that receipt in court. Perhaps X is a proposition about your own actions: you can tell the court about those.\n\n### Obtaining the evidence\n\nEvidence can be obtained from the other party during the discovery process, or from third\\-parties using subpoenas, subject to objections relating to relevance or privilege.\n\n### Not all (potentially) relevant evidence is admissible\n\nHowever, some evidence will be inadmissible despite it being potentially relevant. I will only present a few categories, some very general and some more specific:\n\n* hearsay (unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay exclusion),\n* privileged material (unless it is a case\\-by\\-case privilege or a discretionary privilege and the person seeking to admit the evidence demonstrates to the judge that it should be admitted),\n* sexual history evidence of a sexual assault complainant when it will be used to support an inference that the complainant is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject\\-matter of the charge or is less worthy of belief (this is because it has been recognized as *not* relevant for this purpose),\n* material that was obtained in contravention of the *Charter* and where the court has decided that the remedy for the *Charter* violation is exclusion of the evidence (in the United States, there is stricter, exclusionary rule),\n* there are many more.\n\nThere are also some meta\\-rules about the evidence that may be used to impugn a witness's credibility, themselves at trial to provide evidence, but for now I am leaving those out of this fairly summary answer.\n\n### Weighing the evidence\n\nThe trier of fact (the judge or a jury) then is to weigh all the admissible evidence, including by weighing the witness and party testimony according to its [credibility and reliability](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/85118/46948) after testing through cross\\-examination, to come to a conclusion on the ultimate question(s) at issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A small business owner is being sued by a customer who claims they slipped and fell in the store due to a wet floor.

We immediately reported that over 50% of the jets were not working or working poorly, and were also not adjustable. Since then we've gone back and forth with the seller, with them insisting that they will only replace the jets if we pay several hundred dollars for a warranty trip fee, plus the cost of the jets and labor if they deem the problem not their fault.\n\nI'm unwilling to agree to the above because I don't believe the warranty trip fee is valid, as they have breached the initial contract by not delivering the spa in working order. So this is a contracts issue before a warranty issue (even if I accepted that a \"warranty trip fee\" is anything other than criminally unethical). Further, I'm unwilling to put the determination of whether they are at fault or not solely in their hands, as that gives them complete freedom to avoid responsibility. In any case, both they and the manufacturer are no longer responding to me.\n\nNormally in a case like this I'd look for the next closest authorized servicer, pay them to come out and do the repair, then sue the seller for the cost of said repairs. However, the next closest servicer is 82 miles away and won't go outside their area. And even if we could get the seller to respond, they will not come out unless we agree to the conditions noted above, which I won't agree to as I believe that would constitute a settlement and negate my right to sue for the charges back. So we're now in the position of owning a $6k spa that doesn't work right, and that cannot be serviced (because the seller will no longer respond).\n\nIn this case I'm unsure how to quantify the damages, as no amount of money will allow us to get a spa in working order as agreed upon in the original contract. Do we sue under breach of contract and demand the return of 100% of our money and for them to come take the spa? Is there some legal value placed upon a warranty that we can sue for? Do we hire a non\\-authorized servicer and sue for their cost plus the cost of any future issues caused by them being non\\-authorized? Do we sue under some theory of 'emotional suffering'?\n\nWhat is the appropriate way to quantify this case for submission to small claims, given that the courts cannot technically compel the seller to service our spa?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of issues here. One is whether they can charge a warranty trip fee: that would depend on what the contract says \u2013 such fees are possible (but may be prohibited by state law). Such a charge could be motivated by the manufacturer not compensating a dealer for warranty repair travel (also by granting a low number of hours of compensation for a warranty job). The second is whether you are at fault, the dealer is at fault, or the manufacturer is at fault: and, what evidence is there for that conclusion. A standard approach is to get an independent expert to look at the problem and determine what the probable cause of failure is \u2013 that may however be impossible. In that case, you are pretty much at the mercy of the dealer's employees, who hopefully will write up an accurate assessment of the problem. Especially if the manufacturer and seller are not responding, you can't count on ordinary business goodwill to ease the process.\n\nIf the seller can legally charge a warranty trip fee, then you can't legally force them to perform service without paying the fee. If they *can't* legally charge that fee, then you have a different problem, because they should have come and repaired the unit. They are not, however, obligated to replace the defective stuff or give a refund (without court order), assuming that your state does not have a spa lemon law (I've never heard of such a thing: lemon laws are about new vehicles).\n\nIf the dealer and manufacturer simply refuse to service your unit, the basic scheme would be to get it repaired by someone else (at whatever cost) and sue after the fact for damages \u2013 that's not at all a risk\\-free proposition. Alternatively, you could sue one or both for specific performance, i.e. get the court to force them to fix the problem, but as you know that is beyond the reach of small claims court. Or, you sue for a refund of the sale price (up to the state limit). The sale price should be easy to establish; dealer and seller refusal should be easy to establish (but be sure that you don't extrapolate from \"refuse to do in a way I want\" to \"refuse\"). Having the evidence in hand is mandatory. Evidence of non\\-functioning shouldn't be too hard, and you would also need to show that you are not the cause of the spa not functioning. If they have some fact in their possession that constitutes evidence that you are to blame, you have a right to see that evidence (through discovery), and they can do likewise to you.\n\nIf their refusal is based on your insistence that they drop the trip fee but they will do the work if you pay the fee, then you could do that, and if the fee is not legal, then you can sue to recover that amount. \n\nThere is nothing special about suing for a refund vs. suing for the cost of repair, in terms of what small claims court does.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchased a $6,000 spa from a local dealer a year ago, but over 50% of the jets are not working properly.

Option C is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It addresses the immediate need to get the spa repaired while preserving legal options.\n2. It follows the top answer's advice: \"If their refusal is based on your insistence that they drop the trip fee but they will do the work if you pay the fee, then you could do that, and if the fee is not legal, then you can sue to recover that amount.\"\n3. It avoids potentially voiding the warranty by using non-authorized repair (Option D).\n4. It's more likely to succeed than suing for emotional distress (Option A), which is typically hard to prove in contract cases.\n5. It's less extreme than demanding a full refund and removal (Option B), which might be harder to win in court given the time elapsed and partial functionality of the spa.\n\nThis approach allows the customer to get the spa repaired promptly while maintaining the ability to recover costs through legal means if the fee is indeed illegal.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The insurance policy explicitly states that the livery conveyance exclusion \"does not apply to a share-the-expense car pool.\" This creates an exception for certain types of carpooling arrangements.\n\n2. Waze Carpool markets itself as a way to \"share the cost\" of commuting, which aligns with the concept of a share-the-expense car pool. However, the documentation doesn't provide a specific definition of what qualifies as a share-the-expense car pool.\n\n3. The question mentions that there's a broad precedent for carpool definitions, but it's unclear if Waze Carpool specifically has been evaluated in this context.\n\n4. The lack of confirmed information about Waze Carpool's status suggests that insurance companies may need to individually assess whether it meets their criteria for a share-the-expense car pool.\n\nOption A is incorrect because marketing alone doesn't determine insurance coverage. Option B is too absolute, ignoring the potential for the share-the-expense exception. Option C misinterprets the policy, which doesn't distinguish between driver and passenger coverage in this context.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, apply them to a modern ride-sharing scenario, and recognize the nuances and potential grey areas in insurance policy interpretation."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49866/will-my-speeding-ticket-in-arizona-be-enforced-abroad", "docs_id": 49866, "title": "Will my speeding ticket in Arizona be enforced abroad?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Good evening, \n\nas a tourist from outside the U.S., I got pulled over for speeding near Page, AZ (outside urbanized area) today.

This is not the case in Wisconsin (at least not usually). So my question is, are there any states/countries you know of where propensity evidence is allowed, whether generally or in exceptional cases?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThe following is in response to @ohwilleke's answer.\n\n> (2\\) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\nThe item *(...) such as proving motive (...)* catches my eye. If I understand correctly, the propensity evidence must suggest motive without invoking an argument reliant on character. Let me explain my (mis)understanding with an example:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for theft. They have a criminal history of theft. The prosecutors say that due to the propensity evidence, the defendant has a thieving character (or more extremely, has kleptomania), and thus, has motives for theft.\n\nIn the above example, the propensity evidence is inadmissible, because it argues **via** character, despite ultimately making a claim about motive.\n\nAn allowed example would then be:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for the theft of ancient Egyptian relics. The defendant has a criminal history of stealing ancient Egyptian relics. The prosecutors use this propensity evidence to suggest the defendant has a collection of Egyptian relics, and/or a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics.\n\nThe first suggestion is not a matter of character, but simply a claim about the defendant possessing a collection. The second suggestion is more borderline, as whether one is to view \"a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics\" as a part of their character, or as merely a non\\-physical possession/quirk is hard to say for me.\n\nSo, is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that propensity evidence can only be circumstantial evidence and that it is generally inadmissible.\n\nBut we should start by clarifying what \"circumstantial evidence\" means. It is not the opposite of legal evidence, but more like the opposite of direct evidence. Direct evidence is evidence that independently establishes a fact in question, while circumstantial evidence is evidence that gives rise to an inference that a fact in question is true. There is a misconception that circumstantial evidence is somehow inadmissible or inferior to direct evidence, but the truth is that the vast majority of evidence is circumstantial.\n\nSo if you are on trial for murder, direct evidence would include your confession, an eyewitness account of the murder, and surveillance video of you killing the victim. Circumstantial evidence would include things like the victim's blood on your clothes, a taxi driver's testimony that he dropped you off at the victim's apartment just before the murder happened, or surveillance video of you exiting the cab and entering the apartment.\n\nPropensity evidence is evidence that a person is likely to have acted one way in this case because they have acted that same way in the past. It is therefore never going to be direct evidence and always going to be circumstantial evidence, because it never explicitly says \"the defendant did it,\" but rather says \"the defendant did it before, so maybe he did it again.\"\n\nThe general rule is that propensity evidence is inadmissible. [Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404). It sometimes comes in anyway, though, for various reasons. If a defendant is facing trespass charges, for instance, a prosecutor would want to introduce evidence that the defendant has previously been convicted of trespassing. The defense will object that it's propensity evidence, but the prosecutor will respond that it's admissible if he's using it to establish something *other than* the likelihood that the defendant did the same thing again. If the prosecutor needs to prove that the defendant knew he was not allowed on the property, the trespass conviction is very strong evidence on that point.\n\nAnother common exception is in sexual\\-assault cases, where some jurisdictions allow this type of evidence. Indeed, Wisconsin is among the states that explicitly permit evidence of the defendant's previous convictions for certain sex crimes to demonstrate that he committed a sex crime again in the current case. [WI Stat \u00a7 904\\.04(2\\)(b)](https://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2012/chapter-904/section-904.04).\n\nLouisiana likewise allows propensity evidence to establish that the defendant has a history of \"sexually assaultive behavior\" or a \"lustful disposition toward children.\" [C.E. 412\\.2\\.](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.2.html) Likewise, the defendant may be able to introduce evidence that the victim previously consented to sex and is therefore likely to have consented to sex in the current case. [C.E. 412](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.html).\n\n**EDIT:**\nTo address your examples, then, I would say that that the first would probably not survive a Rule 404(b) objection, and the second one would stand a better chance. On the second one, the defense should argue that the court should allow evidence of the defendant's interest in Egyptology, but not evidence of the convictions, as that would allow the jury to consider his motive without being diverted into propensity territory. The prosecution should probably counter that the defendant's convictions show more than just the *existence* of a motive, but also the *strength* of that motive, as well as perhaps that the defendant had the prior knowledge and skill that would be necessary to pull off a museum heist. The judge could go probably rule either way without being reversed.\n\nI would clarify one point on how to analyze and characterize this evidence: Rule 404 deals with propensity evidence, i.e., evidence that is meant to demonstrate that a person acted in conformity with his character. Subsection (a) deals with establishing propensity through \"character evidence,\" which is evidence that the defendant's character or character traits are consistent with the conduct in question at trial; while subsection (b) deals with establishing propensity through \"other acts\" evidence, which is evidence that the defendant previously engaged in conduct that is consistent with the conduct at question of trial.\n\nBoth types of evidence \\-\\- character evidence and other\\-acts evidence \\-\\- are inadmissible to establish propensity, but they may be admissible to establish motive, plan, preparation, etc. So when your defendant's previous convictions are offered to prove motive to expand his Egyptology collection and not to establish propensity, the court could allow them into evidence not because they are *admissible* propensity evidence, but rather because they are not propensity evidence at all.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about propensity evidence, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A defense attorney is representing a client accused of embezzlement from their current employer.

The tax law instead looks at the substance of the interaction and the reality of how decent, well mannered people would act under circumstances in which they receive an uncompensated benefit.\n\nUltimately, whether are voluntary payment made through a private individual or business's website is taxable income or is not taxable because it is a gift is a case by case determination to be made in light of all of the relevant facts.\n\nFor example, if your mother donates $7,500 to your website on your birthday, even though all of your other \"donations\" are from third\\-parties whom you have never met in person in amounts from $5 to $100 and you have provided all of those other third\\-parties with some kind of service or benefit through your website (e.g. they were allowed to read free webcomics or listen to music you wrote and recorded without charge over the website), the donation from your mother probably counts as a gift, even though the other donations probably count as income taxable income.\n\nBut, in the absence for any reason for the donation other than gratitude for the performance of the services provided by the website, or for the conduct of the business that the website belongs to, the donation will generally be treated as income under Sections 61 and 83, rather than as a gift under Section 102\\.\n\nThe notion of a gift is normally limited by case law and suggestive related section of the Internal Revenue Code that illustrate its intended meaning in the case of gift loans and bargain sales made for donative purposes, to circumstances in which the person making the gift has received nothing in return for it. A donation to a website usually wouldn't meet this test to show a transfer's character as a gift.\n\nThe most familiar example, upon which there is a great deal of case law and authoritative guidance, is that tips paid to restaurant and hospitality industry workers are income rather than gifts, and are subject not only to income taxation but also to FICA payroll taxation. These tipping situations are closely analogous to voluntary payments made through a website.\n\nThere are a great many tax regulations, court cases interpreting tax law, and authoritative guidances from the IRS (such a revenue rulings) that address the basic concepts that I've set forth above. And, the income tax law authorities are further informed by the statutes and case law governing gift taxation, which is, as intended, interpreted to define a gift in a matter that dovetails more or less perfectly with the definition of a gift for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 102\\.\n\nAs the IRS [explains at its website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/gift-tax) discussing the gift tax for which the concept of a gift is defined consistently with the income tax concept of a gift:\n\n> The gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property by one individual to\n> another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return.\n> The tax applies whether or not the donor intends the transfer to be a\n> gift.\n> \n> \n> The gift tax applies to the transfer by gift of any type of property.\n> You make a gift if you give property (including money), or the use of\n> or income from property, without expecting to receive something of at\n> least equal value in return. If you sell something at less than its\n> full value or if you make an interest\\-free or reduced\\-interest loan,\n> you may be making a gift.\n\nDonations which are not income are gifts and there is a tax on gifts given (paid by the donor rather than the person receiving the gift). But, there is a $15,000 per donor per donee exception per year from gift taxation for gifts under the Internal Revenue Code, in addition to more than $12 million per lifetime per person exemption from gift and estate taxation for gifts in excess of this $15,000 amount (called the annual exclusion) and inheritances left at death. So, usually, if a transfer is treated as a gift rather than as income, no tax will be due.\n\nBut this part of this answer's short summary of the law is the top level conceptual framework for all of those other subordinate tax law authorities.\n\nAlso, this income is also subject to self\\-employment taxation, which is imposed in lieu of FICA on income which is not a wage, salary or employment\\-related tip. Often self\\-employment taxes are due on self\\-employment income even when no federal income tax is owed upon it.\n\n> if there is a clear answer, do states with personal income taxes do\n> the same regarding website donations?\n\nMost states and localities with a personal income tax start from the federal definition of income and modify that definition in ways that the taxing jurisdiction deems fit either to make sense (limiting the tax to income related to the state, for example, at least for non\\-residents), or to fit local policy preferences (e.g. exempting from income taxation, capital gains made in an investment in the state favored by state lawmakers).\n\nAlmost no states or localities have chosen to deviate from the federal definition of income for income tax purposes with respect to donations made to websites that are not non\\-profit entities.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular blogger runs a website featuring free educational content and accepts donations through a \"Donate\" button.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be treated differently for federal tax purposes?\n\nA) A long-time reader donates $100 after finding a tutorial particularly helpful\nB) An anonymous donor contributes $50 with a note praising the overall quality of content\nC) The blogger's sibling makes a $1000 donation on the blogger's birthday\nD) A corporation donates $500 after the blogger reviews one of their products\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided tax law information. The correct answer is C because it represents a scenario that is most likely to be treated as a gift rather than taxable income.\n\nThe key factors to consider are:\n\n1. The general rule that monetary donations received through a website are typically considered taxable income under IRC Section 61 as either \"compensation for services\" or \"gross income derived from business.\"\n\n2. The exception for gifts under IRC Section 102, which are not taxable income.\n\n3. The case-by-case determination of whether a payment is a gift or income, based on the substance of the interaction and the relationship between the parties.\n\nIn options A, B, and D, the donations are likely to be considered taxable income because they are made by third parties with no personal relationship to the blogger, and are given in appreciation for services or content provided through the website.\n\nOption C, however, presents a scenario that more closely resembles a gift:\n- It's from the blogger's sibling, indicating a personal relationship.\n- The timing (on the blogger's birthday) suggests a personal rather than business-related motivation.\n- The amount ($1000) is significantly larger than typical donations, which could further indicate its nature as a personal gift.\n\nWhile not all donations from family members are automatically considered gifts, this scenario has the highest likelihood of being treated as a non-taxable gift under IRC Section 102. The IRS would likely scrutinize the context and relationship more closely in this case, potentially allowing it to be excluded from taxable income.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple tax law concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze the nuances that distinguish taxable income from non-taxable gifts in the context of website donations."}, "61": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49496/could-a-charity-manufacture-patented-medications-for-free", "docs_id": 49496, "title": "Could a charity manufacture patented medications for free?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say there is a patented medication that is very effective and very expensive at the pharmacy, say $1,000/dose.

What is the current standing law with regard to non\\-disparagement clauses in contracts? I recall a recent law prohibiting them in terms of service agreements, but what about employment an other (e.g. severance) contracts? Are they legally enforceable? Does California have an anti\\-SLAPP law?\n2. What is the legal definition of disparagement in the context of a non\\-disparagement agreement? Is it like libel in that it is limited to untrue claims, or are any negative and business\\-impacting claims subject to it even if demonstrably true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: California has a law prohibiting non\\-disparagement clauses in consumer transactions.1 The rule tells us that any waivers of the rule are void. We also learn that the penalty is $2500 for the first violation and $5000 for each subsequent. The consumer can bring the lawsuit.\n\nNon\\-disparagement agreements are valid in employment and severance agreements. So, yes, they are enforceable as a matter of law. (But note that the NLRB and the EEOC have recently come out against certain *broadly* worded non\\-disparagement language.)\n\nCA has an anti\\-SLAPP statute.2\n\nThere is no \"legal definition of disparagement in the context of a non\\-disparagement agreement.\" If the term is not defined in the contract the court will likely apply the plain meaning rule. Generally speaking, the plain meaning of disparagement is speaking or writing about the subject in a negative light. As such the term \"disparagement\" will apply to negative speech, regardless of truth. In fact, most non\\-disparagement clauses will include a word like \"criticize.\" The thing is, false negative comments are already a tort which means that you can get sued for those even without the non\\-severance agreement. However, a non\\-disparagement agreement makes it easier for the plaintiff because they do not need to prove damages and they can include liquidated damages in the contract.\n\nThis might be confusing because *disparagement* is a tort recognized in CA.3 \n\n> A claim of disparagement requires a plaintiff to show a\n>  false or misleading statement that (1\\) specifically refers to the\n>  plaintiff's product or business and (2\\) clearly derogates that product\n>  or business.\n\nThe point is that the disparagement prohibited in employment contracts is not the recently\\-defined tort of disparagement but rather the plain definition of disparagement. The disparagement prohibited in employment contracts applies to true statements. (The caveat being that the definition is subject to a definition included in the contract.)\n\n---\n\n1**[Cal. Civ.

The CEO wants to include a non-disparagement clause to prevent the employee from making any negative statements about the company. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications and enforceability of such a clause?\n\nA) The non-disparagement clause is unenforceable in California due to recent legislation prohibiting such clauses in all contracts.\n\nB) The clause is enforceable, but only for statements that are demonstrably false and damaging to the company's reputation.\n\nC) The clause is likely enforceable, covering both true and false negative statements, but may face scrutiny if too broadly worded.\n\nD) The clause is fully enforceable without restrictions, as California does not regulate non-disparagement agreements in employment contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Non-disparagement agreements are valid and enforceable in employment and severance agreements in California, unlike in consumer transactions where they are prohibited.\n\n2. The scope of \"disparagement\" in these agreements typically covers any negative speech, regardless of its truth. This is broader than the legal tort of disparagement, which only applies to false statements.\n\n3. However, recent developments suggest that overly broad non-disparagement language may face scrutiny from agencies like the NLRB and EEOC.\n\n4. The plain meaning of disparagement in contracts usually applies to speaking or writing about the subject in a negative light, without being limited to untrue claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legislation prohibiting non-disparagement clauses applies only to consumer transactions, not employment contracts. Option B is incorrect as it confuses the contractual meaning of disparagement with the tort of disparagement. Option D is too absolute, ignoring the potential scrutiny of broadly worded clauses. This question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple legal concepts and apply them to a real-world scenario in the tech industry."}, "67": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9178/how-was-hume-williams-impotent-and-personally-involved-in-his-altercation-wi", "docs_id": 9178, "title": "How was Hume Williams &#39;impotent&#39; and &#39;personally involved&#39; in his altercation with a witness?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Source: pp 65\\-66, *The Art of the Advocate* (1993\\) by Richard Du Cann QC.  \n\n Sorry for the long quote; please advise me if and how I can abridge it. \n\n> Tenacity is more than an aspect of courage.

The role of the barrister during cross\\-examination is to ask questions of the witness so that their answers become evidence; not introduce evidence of their own. \n\nWith skill and judgement they will ask a witness to explain inconsistencies within their evidence or between their evidence and other evidence and *allow* the deciders of fact (jury or judge) how to reconcile those inconsistencies.\n\nWe do not know what the witness actually said but it was something to the effect of:\n\n> People in the service of Germany are able to get British secret service agents marooned \\[on the Greek islands] by the orders of the British Government\n\nbecause that is where Williams started to make his mistake \\- he repeated the witness' answer in a \"tone of incredulity\" which the witness took as an opportunity to introduce extraneous information that he had told Williams this before. Williams then compounded the problem by claiming that he and the witness had never met: who cares if they had or had not? He made the evidence about whether he or the witness was lying (or, generously, mistaken); not about if the British Government was being duped by the German's nobbling into its own agents by standing them in the Dodecanese.\n\nInstead of doing this he could have said \"Please explain your role in the British Government or the German Secret Service that allows you to know this?\" or \"That seems to me to be an outlandish assertion, what evidence do you have to support it beyond hearsay?\"\n\nIf the witness had insisted on introducing the *fact* that they had communicated this information to Williams, he could have said: \"I do not believe that we have met, however, even if we had and you had told this to me I do not see how that makes it true.

This aligns with the principle that a barrister should ask questions to elicit evidence rather than introduce evidence themselves or become personally involved in the testimony.\n\nOption A, which Williams actually chose, led to him becoming \"personally involved\" and \"impotent to deal with the situation.\" This approach allowed the witness to control the narrative and shifted focus away from the case itself.\n\nOption C, appealing to the judge, might seem tempting but doesn't address the underlying issue and could make Williams appear defensive or unable to handle challenging witnesses.\n\nOption D, engaging in a point-by-point rebuttal, would further entangle Williams in personal matters irrelevant to the case, similar to his actual approach.\n\nBy choosing option B, Williams could have maintained focus on the relevant facts of the case, challenged the witness's credibility and sources without becoming personally involved, and demonstrated critical thinking and composure in the face of provocative testimony.

Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents*](https://casetext.com/case/bivens-v-six-unknown-named-agents-of-federal-bureau-of-narcotics). My understanding is that *Bivens* created a cause of action for the 4th Amendment. Without the cause of action, you wouldn't be able to sue federal officials for violating the 4th Amendment. Now, my question is this:\n\n* Before *Bivens* was ruled, how would you sue a government official in court for a constitutional violation, as there was no cause of action?\n* According to my knowledge, the Supreme Court has only afforded a cause of action similar to that of Bivens to some amendments. Now, if I wanted to sue a government official for violating the 1st amendment (which, to my understanding, does not have an implied cause of action similar to that of *Bivens*), how would that work?\n\nI'm generally very confused about how this all works and interacts with each other.\n\n**Bivens:**\n[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/\\#tab\\-opinion\\-1949369](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/#tab-opinion-1949369)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The case is [Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/#tab-opinion-1949369).\n\nLiability under *Bivens* applies to federal agents who violate a direct constitutional right in a similar way that state officials, or others acting \"under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory\" may be sued under [42 USC \u00a7 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) for any action that causes \"the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\". Section 1983 does not apply to persons acting under federal laws, and thus *Bivens* becomes a counterpart.\n\nIt is true that *Bivens* applies directly to the Fourth Amendment. But it quotes favorably *Bell v. Hood*, 327 U. S. 678 (1946\\), specifically the passages:\n\n> where federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief \\[*at page 684*]\n\nand\n\n> it is . . . well settled that, where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done. \\[*also at page 684*]\n\nNeither of these passages singles out the fourth amendment. Nor does the logic of *Bivens* depend on anything specific to the Fourth amendment, as opposed to the Fifth, the Sixth, or the First.\n\nI don't know if a case has been brought under *Bivens* alleging violation of these or other federal constitutional provisions granting specific rights to individuals. The logic of *Bivens* would require a firm and clear grant of rights, but, for example the Due Process Clause of the fifth is such a grant.\n\nIf the courts were to hold that a particular claim could not be brought under *Bivens* because the Supreme Court has not authorized such an extension of *Bivens*, then *Bivens* itself describes an alternate procedure. The opinion points out that:\n\n> \\[*at Pages 390\\-391*] petitioner may obtain money damages to redress invasion of these rights only by an action in tort, under state law, in the state courts. In this scheme, the Fourth Amendment would serve merely to limit the extent to which the agents could defend the state law tort suit by asserting that their actions were a valid exercise of federal power: if the agents were shown to have violated the Fourth Amendment, such a defense would be lost to them, and they would stand before the state law merely as private individuals. Candidly admitting that it is the policy of the Department of Justice to remove all such suits from the state to the federal courts for decision, respondents nevertheless urge that we uphold dismissal of petitioner's complaint in federal court and remit him to filing an action in the state courts in order that the case may properly be removed to the federal court for decision on the basis of state law.\n\nThis procedure the Court rejected in *Bivens* as unneeded, but it did not say that such a procedure could not be followed.\n\nI would think that the logic of *Bivens*should extend to the invasion, by federal officials (other than judicial officers), of any right explicitly and specifically granted to individuals under the constitution. But one can never tell how the courts will react when asked to extend a previous decision.\n\nThe *Bivens* did not **create**a cause of action, or at least it did not purport to do so. It simply held that the longstanding rights grantef under the Fourth Amendment could result in money damages even n the absence of a specific statute providing for such damages. The *Bivens* Court wrote:\n\n> \\[*at Page 403 U. S. 402*] The contention that the federal courts are powerless to accord a litigant damage for a claimed invasion of his federal constitutional rights until Congress explicitly authorizes the remedy cannot rest on the notion that the decision to grant compensatory relief involves a resolution of policy considerations not susceptible of judicial discernment. Thus, in suits for damages based on violations of federal statutes lacking any express authorization of a damage remedy, this Court has authorized such relief where, in its view, damages are necessary to effectuate the congressional policy underpinning the substantive provisions of the statute. *J. I. Case Co. v. Borak*, 377 U. S. 426 (1964\\); *Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen \\& Enginemen*, 323 U. S. 210, 323 U. S. 213 (1944\\). Cf. *Wyandotte Transportation Co. v.

S. 201\\-204 (1967\\)\n\nThe OP wrote in a comment:\n\n> What's the point of Bivens if causes of action still exist for amendments like the 1st Amendment, that are not part of Bivens? What's the difference between suing somebody under the 4th amendment through Bivens, and suing somebody under the 1st amendment?\n\nThis is merely a matter of terminology. If the US Supreme Court now recognizes a right to sue **for money damages** directly under the First Amendment, that will be called \"an extension of *Bivens*\". If it rules that such a suit would need a new law from Congress to authorize it (as Sec 1983 authorizes suits against state officials), that would be cal;led \"refusing to extend *Bivens*.

What is the most appropriate legal strategy for the citizen to pursue?\n\nA) File a state tort law claim in state court, anticipating removal to federal court\nB) Petition the Supreme Court to directly extend Bivens to Third Amendment violations\nC) Sue under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for the constitutional violation\nD) File a Bivens action in federal court, arguing for logical extension based on existing precedent\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the Bivens doctrine and related constitutional law principles. The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. While Bivens originally applied to Fourth Amendment violations, the documentation suggests that its logic could extend to other constitutional rights that provide \"firm and clear grant of rights\" to individuals.\n\n2. The Third Amendment, like the Fourth, is part of the Bill of Rights and provides a specific protection to individuals against government action, making it a strong candidate for Bivens extension.\n\n3. Option A, while mentioned in the Bivens opinion as a pre-existing alternative, was rejected by the Court as unnecessary given the new Bivens remedy. It remains a fallback option but is not the most direct approach.\n\n4. Option B is impractical, as the Supreme Court typically doesn't hear cases directly; they would need to appeal through the lower courts first.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 applies to state officials, not federal agents as mentioned in the scenario.\n\n6. Option D allows the plaintiff to argue for an extension of Bivens based on the logic presented in the original case.

Superior courts in the UK have been scrupulous in saying that each case turns on its merits.\n\nThe \u201ccircumstances in which the evidence was obtained\u201d are certainly suss and would not be permitted by a police officer who is required to warn the suspect and advise them of their right to silence. However, that is not sufficient to exclude the evidence.\n\nThe court also needs to consider whether it would have \u201csuch an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\u201d If the confession is the only evidence then admitting it would clearly be unfair. However, if the Crown has mountains of other evidence, then the confession may only have a small probative value.\n\nThere is no \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine in the UK\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFar more likely is that the Crown would not even seek to introduce the confession. It would just slow the trial and give the defence grounds for an appeal.\n\nInstead, they would use the confession to inform their investigation and get other evidence to convict.\n\nLegal privilege\n---------------\n\nIn England and Wales, legal advice privilege only applies where there is a lawyer present. If Badal is a lawyer, then the privilege attaches; if he isn\u2019t then it doesn\u2019t, irrespective of what he led Naina to believe.

Under that standard, a rather novel form of copyright seems impossible to defend: copyleft licenses.\n\nCopyleft, the common descriptor for copyright licenses which allow free use provided any derivative works are released under similarly free terms, attempts to force the spread of open content (most typically software) through clever usage of conditional license grants, most notably used in the GNU General Public License. But how could this possibly be enforced in court? Because this sort of license was designed to guard against violation of one's beliefs, rather than financial damage, in the case of a violation, it would seem one could only claim moral damage.\n\nIn short, how would one possibly justify a copyleft violation suit in a court of law?\n\n**Edit:**\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I'm referring alternately to either *US law* or *EU law*, as I'm curious about both given the clear differences in intellectual property law between the two.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As a general rule, civil suits for copyright violation exist to recover damages caused by the violation, and prevent future damage thereof.\n\nWith respect to US law, that's not entirely accurate.\n\nUnder US law, damages for copyright infringement are governed by [17 USC 504](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504). If infringement can be proved, the copyright holder has two options:\n\n1. Recover \"actual damages\" *plus* any profits that were attributable to the infringement. So suppose Alice licenses her free software under copyleft. Bob uses it in violation of the license to create a product which he sells. Even though Alice was not going to make any money by selling the software herself (so her actual damages are zero), she can still recover whatever profits Bob made from his sales. She doesn't have to prove that she was damaged; all she has to do is show that Bob earned revenue attributable to the infringement (and then it is up to Bob to show how much of that revenue went to expenses instead of profit).\n2. Recover statutory damages. The law specifies statutory damages of $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, to be determined by the court; this can be increased to $150,000 if the infringement was willful, or reduced to $200 if the infringer had no reason to know he was doing so. Again, it doesn't matter that Alice didn't suffer any actual damages, and she doesn't have to prove that she did. It also doesn't matter whether Bob profited from his infringement in any way, and again Alice doesn't have to prove that he did.\n\nSo Alice certainly has options to make Bob suffer for his infringement even if she didn't suffer any financial damage.\n\nI don't know the situation for EU law, so I'll let someone else address it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about copyright law and copyleft licenses, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software developer, Alex, releases a program under a copyleft license.

Most of those cases were dismissed on procedural grounds or dismissed as moot when he left office.\n\n> Could congress pass a law setting a fiduciary standard of care in some\n> fiscal matters, and enforce it (e.g., through impeachment?)\n\nCongress can impeach for any circumstance that it deems to be a high crime or misdemeanor, and its determination of that point is non\\-justiciable.\n\nIt is not obvious whether this obligation could be imposed by statute consistently with the constitution under existing U.S. Constitutional law.\n\nThis would be basically a question of first impression, or at most, a question for which the precedents available are so stale that the continued applicability of these precedents in the light of new legal developments in constitutional law jurisprudence is uncertain.\n\nThere is law that makes fairly clear that such a duty could not be imposed upon the President of the United States acting in his official capacity by state law under the supremacy clause and the general considerations of federalism, however. This is important, among other reasons, because the standing requirements of the federal courts do not apply with full force to state courts applying state law.\n\nOne important constitutional issue in this context would be who has standing to enforce such a duty, since standing is a matter of the subject\\-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n\nCurrent standing jurisprudence does not allow for \"citizen standing\" or \"taxpayer standing\" nor does it usually allow individual members of the U.S. House or U.S. Senate to have standing, nor does it usually allow one part of the Executive branch to sue another part of the Executive branch of the United States government. In most cases, this means that if the President's actions cause only generalized fiscal harm to the United States as a whole, that no individual could have standing.\n\nOne exception might be for a [*qui tam* action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam) in which an individual is deputized to act as a prosecutor for the United States government itself (with the relief obtained payable to the United States) in a civil action in exchange for a statutorily determined contingent fee related to the amount recovered. I'm not familiar with the constitutional dimensions of standing in such cases, which is mostly obscure at the outer limits because the existing statutes that authorize this have been upheld on a piecemeal basis with other their particular procedural details (including a right of the Justice Department to take over such lawsuits against private parties) and the fact that these suits are usually limited to suits against people other than government officials. It is closely related to the largely open question of whether, contrary to Justice Department policy, it is constitutional to bring federal criminal charges against a sitting President.

The most significant challenge to the proposed legislation is the issue of standing, as highlighted in the answer.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D present plausible challenges, they are not as central to the issue as standing:\n\nA) The Supremacy Clause mainly applies to conflicts between federal and state law, not between branches of the federal government.\nC) While presidential immunity is a factor, it's not absolute and doesn't directly address the enforceability issue through impeachment.\nD) Separation of powers is relevant, but Congress already has the power to impeach, so this isn't the primary obstacle.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that \"Current standing jurisprudence does not allow for 'citizen standing' or 'taxpayer standing' nor does it usually allow individual members of the U.S. House or U.S. Senate to have standing, nor does it usually allow one part of the Executive branch to sue another part of the Executive branch of the United States government.\"\n\nThis lack of clear standing presents the most significant hurdle to enforcing such a duty.

For example, if a war broke out and Congress wanted to allocate money to a secret cause, could they enter a closed session and pass a bill, send it to the President, and become law without telling the public?\n\nFirst, is this even possible/legal? Are there any instances of this happening (and later being revealed to the public)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Congress did exactly this in the war of 1812\\.\n\nNormally, laws passed by Congress must be published after being made. In 1789, the First Congress instructed the Secretary of State with the duty of printing new statutes at least three newspapers, and the current law puts it in the hands of the Archivist of the United States; in between, there have been variations.\n\nOn March 3, 1811, Congress passed [a law](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_2/11th_Congress/3rd_Session/Chapter_47) saying simply:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this act, and the act passed during the present session of Congress, entitled \u201cAn act to enable the President of the United States, under certain contingencies, to take possession of the country lying east of the river Perdido, and south of the state of Georgia and the Mississippi territory, and for other purposes,\u201d and the declaration accompanying the same, be not printed or published, until the end of the next session of Congress, unless directed by the President of the United States, any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nThis overrode the normal publication rules in order to hide the existence of the cited earlier law, and of its own existence. The proceedings in Congress also took place in secret session, including the signing of the bills by the President, James Madison. As the title suggests, the earlier statute authorized Madison to use military force to take possession of the disputed territory (which was also claimed by Spain), establish a provisional government there, and use $100k of newly appropriated funds to do so. A further law of 1813, with the same secrecy provision, extended the territory and gave $20k more.\n\nThese statutes were not published until 1818, after the war had ended and a further law reformed the publication of statute law in general. The supposed secrecy was also compromised in practice by the fact that the annexation of West Florida was widely known once it started happening.\n\nAs far as we know, Congress has not experimented any further with suspending publication of its legislative activity. It is allowed to meet in secret session, and the Constitution allows secret material to be omitted from the official journal. Nowadays, we know pretty well when secret sessions have taken place, even if we don't know what happened during them. It would be practically very hard for Congress to hide the fact that it had met and passed a law.\n\nThe closest modern counterpart is not a secret *act*, but the use of a \"classified schedule of authorizations\" or \"classified annex\" to direct spending on things that Congress does not wish to reveal. For example, in the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ103/PLAW-117publ103.pdf) (1068 page PDF), there are references like:\n\n* \"there is appropriated $125,000,000, for an additional amount for 'National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund', to remain available until September 30, 2024, which shall only be used for the acquisition and retention of certain materials, as specified in the classified annex accompanying this Act\"\n* \"The amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 101 for the conduct of the intelligence activities of the elements listed in paragraphs (1\\) through (17\\) of section 101, are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations prepared to accompany this division.\"\n\nThe second bullet point covers billions of dollars of total spending, but it is not revealed that we are spending $7\\.18bn on a project to explode the moon, or whatever. So in this appropriations case, your hypothetical is pretty real: Congress could pass emergency legislation authorizing spending on something, without revealing what the something was.\n\nOther kinds of laws would raise their own issues. For example, a secret criminal statute would very likely fall foul of the Constitutional prohibition on *ex post facto* laws.

And the news reporting the laws mention some constraints.\n\n<https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2463>\n\n[https://eur\\-lex.europa.eu/legal\\-content/EN/TXT/?uri\\=CELEX:52020PC0568](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0568)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [According](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-platforms-child-sexual-abuse-reporting-law/) to a Politico article from July this year\n\n> EU Parliament lets companies look for child abuse on their platforms, with reservations\n> \n> \n> The European Parliament on Tuesday approved a controversial law that would allow digital companies to detect and report child sexual abuse on their platforms for the next three years.\n> \n> \n> Tuesday's vote was the final hurdle for the bill, and will allow companies to scan their platforms for explicit material without fear of violating Europe's strict privacy laws. The bill pitted the European Commission, who proposed the bill, and children's rights activists against the Parliament and Europe's privacy regulators, who fear the bill could undermine the EU's privacy rules.\n> \n> \n> The results showed 537 MEPs voted in favor of the bill, with 133 against and 24 abstaining. Despite the result, \\[some] European lawmakers warned that the rules are \"legally flawed\" and could crumble in front of a court. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> MEPs also said that the blanket scanning of private messages of European citizens to look for evidence of child grooming could clash with another set of privacy rules protecting personal data, the GDPR.\n> \n> \n> To allay the Parliament's concerns, EU countries agreed to modify the Commission\u2019s law to add additional safeguards, including bringing in Europe's network of privacy watchdogs to advise on what technologies should be used to do the scanning, and how they should be used. They also left out audio messages from the bill. The changes prompted Sippel, who was negotiating on behalf of the Parliament, to sign off on the bill.\n\nSo YMMV, but insofar it looks pretty legal unless a court decides otherwise.\n\nIt seems Apple went public with their plan after this EU law was passed, so they probably took it into account.\n\n---\n\nFor what's that worth, there's [an analysis](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rhw8c/download) from someone at Cambridge (in the Compliant and Accountable Systems Group, Department of Computer Science and Technology) that:\n\n> EU law would\n> require that Apple obtain the consent of individual iPhone users for on\\-device scanning. This\n> consent would need to be opt\\-in, rather than opt\\-out; there would need to be a real\n> possibility for users to refuse consent; users\u2019 access to iCloud could not be made conditional\n> on giving consent to CSAM Detection; and users must be able to withdraw consent without\n> suffering loss of iCloud service. This may place a welcome brake on the deployment of on\\-\n> device CSAM detection in the EU. However, these barriers may be removed by future EU or\n> Member State legislation \u2013 just as similar potential barriers for automated CSAM detection\n> by certain messaging services have already been removed by EU legislation.\n\nSo it seems that there would be a way for Apple to do this \"device scanning\" even in the EU with user (clickwrap) agreement...\n\nThe paper enumerates the things than can be made implicit (bundled) in a GDPR agreement, and then goes on to argue that probably none of these apply to Apple's CSAM on device, and so they'll probably need a separate checkbox for CSAM... which the paper's author is pretty sure the users would not check.\n\n> Importantly, because consent must be specific, consent to one purpose (such as processing\n> to detect CSAM) can\u2019t be presumed from consent to another purpose (such as processing\n> for cloud backup). Nor can consent to processing to detect CSAM be \u2018bundled\u2019 with\n> consent to cloud backup. GDPR strongly indicates that \u2018bundling\u2019 \u2013 the practice of making\n> access to a service conditional on giving consent to processing that is not necessary for that\n> service \u2013 is not permitted. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> It is unlikely in the extreme that even minimally informed holders of CSAM would give\n> consent to Apple\u2019s CSAM Detection system.\n\nThe paper more tenuously (IMHO) argues then that Apple needs do the same for their server\\-side scanning in the EU, i.e. get explicit consent, because it's somehow tied to the on\\-device scanning via the iCloud account. (The author also makes their personal disapproval of CSAM in all forms more explicit towards the end of the paper.) But still that someone who disapproves of CSAM entertains that it might be deployed via clickwrap user consent (albeit with a separate checkbox) is noteworthy.\n\nIn this context I'll note (even though the paper doesn't), that there is a 2019 CJEU [decision](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/top-european-court-rules-pre-checked-cookie-consent-boxes-invalid) that pre\\-checking certain kinds of checkboxes (like for \"nonessential\" cookies) is not legal. I suspect\nCSAM will fall in this kind of category... so they won't be able to have the checkbox for it pre\\-checked, unless Apple does something more devious and make it so that image hashes become \"essential\" to something else that the user would more readily like to agree to...\n\nAlso, looking at a current (August 1\\) [Apple description](https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf) of their system, it seems they *only* plan to run the image hashing *on the device* (and upload a threshold\\-encrypted version of the result, so that only multiple, cumulative \"hits\" on several images would be detectable/decryptable on the server), which would basically make their system (as currently envisaged) inoperable without the local hash step. I've also looked at Commission's 70\\-page [impact assessment](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_STU(2021)662598) for their most recent proposal (the one discussed at the beginning of this answer), but it only discusses things like PhotoDNA and server\\-side hashing. So I guess they were unware that someone might plan to do \\[only] client\\-side hashing as part of a CSAM design.\n\nIf this goes to an EU court, I guess an issue will be *when* and why iOS would create those (threshold\\-encrypted) vouchers that contain the images hashes, e.g. if they'd be considered an essential part/step of an otherwise approved purpose...", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tech company plans to implement a system that scans user photos on their devices to detect potential child abuse material.

The correct answer (C) aligns with the analysis from the Cambridge paper, which suggests that under EU law, companies would need to obtain specific, opt-in consent for on-device CSAM scanning. This consent must be separate from other services and cannot be bundled with or made a condition of using cloud storage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it lacks user consent, which is a key GDPR requirement.

Is *Carol* possibly on the hook for the damage this maneuver caused to *Dave*'s car?\n\nI live in Belgium so that's the answer I'm most interested in, but I also welcome insights from other jurisdictions.

The correct answer is B because, according to the documentation, once an offer is accepted, a binding contract is formed. In this case, the company made an offer by sending the contract, and the programmer accepted it by signing and returning it. The documentation explicitly states: \"By sending you their terms they have made an offer to you; by signing and returning it you have accepted their offer: you are now parties to a binding contract.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because it misunderstands the nature of contract formation; the company's signature is not necessary for the contract to be binding.

The correct answer, C, is the most pragmatic approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Legal challenges: As mentioned in the documentation, proving ownership and value of the items would be difficult without receipts or a formal agreement about storing the belongings.\n\n2.

This will be a contract between the customer and Origin. If it prohibits transferring an account or sharing an account between multiple people, such provisions would be valid.

I think the \"inhabitants registry\" (Einwohnermeldeamt) is not allowed to give you her first address in Spain (\"Zuzugsanschrift im Ausland\") (\u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45 Bundesmeldegesetz (BMG)).\n\nThe best option I see is a court auction (Zwangsversteigerung), more precise a \"Teilungsversteigerung\". If one of S's siblings want money for the land, he can ask for a court auction at the local court (Amtsgericht). The court will get S's first address in Spain (\u00a7 34 BMG) and if it cannot deliver its letter to S, there will be a \"public delivery\" (\u00f6ffentliche Zustellung) through a posting in court. It would take a while, but in the end the land could be yours.\n\nBe prepared that the cost for the court auction will be much higher than the 1000\u20ac. If you plan to take this way, ask a lawyer for detailed advice. Also you need one of S's siblings to participate in the process.\n\nIf the trees are really a danger for your house, the heirs could also have an obligation to remove them.

The correct answer, C, is the most legally sound and efficient approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Direct contact with the Nachlassgericht (A) may not provide complete information, especially regarding S, and the property owner may not be entitled to this information.\n\n2. Hiring a private investigator (B) is likely to be expensive and may not yield results, given the difficulties in locating S even for family members.\n\n3. Adverse possession (D) is not applicable in this scenario, as the property owner does not currently occupy or use the land, and the time frame for such a claim is not established.\n\n4. Initiating a Teilungsversteigerung (C) through one of G's known children addresses several issues:\n   - It leverages the legal system to handle the complexities of unknown heirs.\n   - The court can access records to attempt to locate S or declare a public notice if unreachable.\n   - It provides a legal mechanism to sell the property even if all owners cannot be contacted.\n   - It resolves the issue of divided ownership among multiple heirs.\n\nThis approach also indirectly addresses the safety concerns related to the overgrown trees, as the new owner would gain clear legal responsibility for the property.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The original 12th-century poem is in the public domain, but the 1996 translation is protected by copyright.

Under subsection 1, a first offense was punishable by 1 to 6 years in prison, a second offense by 1\\-10 years, a third or subsequent offense by 1\\-20 years. There were also fines of up to about $2000\\-$5000\\. There was an exception in subsection 3 for marihuana possession of less than one ounce: a first offense could alternatively be punished by up to one year in county jail, probably at the discretion of the prosecutor or judge. Second offenses were treated as a first offense under subsection 1, and so on.\n\nSelling and distributing drugs including marihuana was punished more severely. Under Section 62, the punishment was 1 to 20 years in prison for a first offense, and for a second offense, life in prison without possibility of parole. If the drug was distributed to a person under age 21, a first offense was punishable by life in prison, but with possibility of parole after 7 years. There was no exception for small quantities of marihuana.\n\nI didn't find a reference to the specific 25 year term you mention. It's possible that it comes from some version of the law as it existed before or after the 1971 statute; I didn't check. Also, marijuana was (and still is) also illegal under federal law; I didn't check what punishment federal law would have prescribed at the time. It's unlikely that the City of Las Vegas would have had separate laws; this sort of thing would normally be done at the state level.\n\nAs far as I know, this is in keeping with other state drug laws of the time, and given the prevailing politics, I'm not surprised by the law. Drug use was treated very differently under the law than the other \"vices\" you mention.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that under the 1971 Nevada controlled substances statute, there was an exception for marijuana possession of less than one ounce: a first offense could be punished by up to one year in county jail.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the penalties were severe, the specific 25-year mandatory sentence is not supported by the information provided.

The correct answer is B because UPS's terms of service (Clause 55.2) explicitly state that they are not liable for any special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that while the business owner may be able to claim a refund of the shipping costs due to the late delivery, they cannot claim additional damages for lost profits or other business losses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the terms of service, which protect UPS from such extensive liability. Option C is a distractor that suggests a middle ground, but it's not supported by the provided information and could mislead students who don't carefully consider the legal implications of the terms of service. Option D goes too far by suggesting no recourse at all, which is likely incorrect as shipping companies typically offer refunds for late deliveries, even if they don't cover additional damages.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to apply legal concepts to a practical business situation, understand the implications of shipping terms and conditions, and critically evaluate the extent of liability in international shipping disputes."}, "96": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60899/non-fda-approved-covid-vaccine-required-by-employer", "docs_id": 60899, "title": "Non FDA approved Covid vaccine required by employer", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can an employer legally require employees to get the NON FDA approved covid vaccine or be terminated?

In general, the employer can fire for anything they want, unless you have an employment contract that limits the grounds for termination. There are discrimination\\-based grounds that they cannot use, such as race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, disability, age (age 40 or older), or genetic information at the federal level. Mississippi has no specific employment discrimination laws. Other that that, an [employer can fire an employee for any reason](https://www.blr.com/HR-Employment/Performance-Termination/Termination-with-Discharge-in-Mississippi), or no reason (Mississippi is what's known as an \"employment at will\" state).

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The NS Labor Code Section 75(1) allows for personal service of termination notices, which was satisfied on July 19th.\n2. While the employment contract specifies certain methods of service, the personal delivery on July 19th fulfills the primary intent of notice provisions - to ensure the employee is aware of the termination.\n3. Section 6 of the NS Labour Code defers to arrangements more favorable to the employee, but in this case, earlier notification (July 19th) is generally considered more favorable.\n4. Courts typically interpret contracts based on their intent rather than strict literal interpretation when there's no material breach or harm to the employee.\n5. The personal delivery method is more direct and effective than the methods specified in the contract, making it unlikely a court would consider this a breach of contract.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuances of contract interpretation and labor law interactions.
