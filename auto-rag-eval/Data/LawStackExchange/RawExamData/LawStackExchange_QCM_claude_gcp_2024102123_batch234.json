As per the documentation, the primary remedy in such a scam case is against the seller. However, if the seller cannot be identified (which is often the case in scams), there may be no viable remedy available. The platform (Leboncoin in this case) typically disclaims liability for unlawful actions by sellers, as mentioned in their terms of service. Banks usually do not cover losses from bank transfers in such scenarios, and there's no indication that the \"Financi\u00e8re des paiements \u00e9lectronique\" would be responsible for reimbursement.

I am reading specifically in New York law and it seems unambiguous that the only damages allowed for a claim of negligent misrepresentation are \"out\\-of\\-pocket losses\" which can be zero even when a plaintiff has suffered measurable losses.\n\n**Consider this scenario:** Bob is an excavator. Alice approaches Bob and says that she has buried $1000 in a particular location. They enter a contract for Alice to provide the location of the money, Bob to excavate it, and the parties to split it 50/50\\. Bob takes his shovel and spends a week digging at the location and to the depth specified by Alice, but finds nothing.

It doesn't seem equitable for a tort to be recognized but offer no real remedy.\n\nI'm wondering if the problem is that I'm looking at a tort when there is another cause of action under contract law? Contract law appears to offer \"benefit of the bargain\" as a remedy for breach of contract, and in this scenario it does look like Alice breached the contract ... except that the breach was a negligent misrepresentation. Is there a cause of action for that under contract law even though it's explicitly a cause of action in tort?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What misrepresentation?\n-----------------------\n\nAlice said she buried the money there. That the money is not there now is not evidence that she didn\u2019t. it\u2019s evidence that something happened to it between then and now.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s not let the flawed example obscure the question. Let\u2019s pretend instead that Alice said the money was there now.\n\n[Misrepresentation](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/disputeresolution/document/393747/567M-26H1-F18B-71BK-00000-00/Actionable_misrepresentation_and_negligent_misstatement_overview)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPre\\-contractural false statements of fact by one party that induce the other to enter the contract give a cause of action in contract law; they are not a tort. There are torts that are similar like deceit and negligent misstatement.\n\nThe link provided is talking about fraud \\- the criminal equivalent of deceit (and the word fraud is often used when technically it\u2019s talking about the tort of deceit). The out\\-of\\-pocket rule applies to torts so Bob can recover his losses. Personal time invested is not an out\\-of\\-pocket loss as it represents an opportunity cost, so, Bob cannot recover what he or his excavator might have earned instead. He can recover his fuel costs and depreciation on the excavator as those are \u201creal\u201d out of pocket expenses. If Bob had been an employee of a plaintiff company, they could recover his wages but not what they might have sold his time for. That\u2019s just how it is with torts.\n\nMisrepresentation is a different beast. It\u2019s a contractural claim so the damages are the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d, in this case $500\\. However, this is only available if the misrepresentation was fraudulent (Alice knew the money wasn\u2019t there), Alice had no reasonable grounds for believing the statement to be true, or at the court\u2019s discretion. Further Bob must prove that it was this statement that caused him to enter the contract and that he would not have entered it otherwise.\n\nAlice\u2019s statement may give Bob more than one cause of action and it\u2019s up to him which he chooses to pursue. If he spent less than $500 on fuel he stands to get more with a misrepresentation claim but if his out of pockets are more than $500 he\u2019s better off with a negligent misstatement claim.

He could pursue a tort claim for negligent misstatement, which would allow him to recover out-of-pocket expenses (like fuel costs and equipment depreciation, but not opportunity costs). Alternatively, he could pursue a contract claim for misrepresentation, which could potentially allow him to recover the benefit of the bargain ($500), but only under certain conditions (e.g., if the misrepresentation was fraudulent or if Alice had no reasonable grounds for her belief). The best choice would depend on Bob's specific expenses and the strength of his case under each option.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a tort claim for negligent misrepresentation would not allow recovery of opportunity costs. Option B is incorrect because the ability to recover the benefit of the bargain in a misrepresentation claim is not guaranteed and depends on specific circumstances.

Yes such an arrangement can be made legally.\n2. Owners cannot be **evicted**. But a contract could provide for regular payments (rent) and that the right to use/occupy the property is contingent on those payments being made. It could even provide that if the payments are sufficiently behind, that a portion of that party's share would be forfeit to cover the amount due. It should probably not reduce the minor partner's equity by more than the amount of payments due. All this would need to be spelled out in detail in your contract.\n3. Property tax is a joint obligation of the owners. Your contract could specify who pays it or from what source it would be paid. One option would be for each party to pay into a fund (similar to an escrow account for a mortgage) from which the tax would be paid. Your contract should specify such an arrangement if it is wanted, and what happens if one party does not pay or is late. The government will not care about your agreement, they will want their tax money in full and on time, or they will charge penalties and/or seize the property, in accord with local law. Either owner could be liable for the full amount.\n4. Much the same applies to insurance, and to any utilities. All are joint obligations of the owners, and a contract may specify who is to pay and how, or how payment is to be divided, and what happens if someone does not pay as agreed.\n5. If you want the right to sell off parts of your share, your contract should cover this, and what notification , if any, is required. It may be that the law will require you to get your partner's consent, I am not sure. Will any new owner become a party to the contract? If so that probably needs the consent of existing parties but it may be possible to specify that such consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld\".\n\nI strongly suggest that you discuss with your partner in detail what options you both want, or are willing to agree to. Be sure that you have a \"meeting of the minds\". Having done that, take it to a local lawyer with knowledge of both real\\-estate law and partnership law, and ask that lawyer to draft a contract that implements your desires, as closely as the local law allows.

There is no contemplation that their presence will prevent the opponents from attacking in order to show mercy on their compatriots. Instead, the POWs are being used to deceive the enemy's automated systems that the attacking force is friendly despite the implausibility of that given their actions.\n\nIt is really more analogous to forcing a prisoner to write a misleading letter or make a misleading phone call, while under duress.\n\nWhile the use of fraud and deception in warfare may be dishonorable, usually actual war crimes involving POWs entail mistreatment of a POW or putting a POW in harm's way (even if presenting only a risk of death or injury).\n\nAlso, of course, much of the Geneva Convention's requirements regarding the treatment of POWs is a treaty imposed obligation, binding morally because both combatants at one point consented to it, rather than necessarily being a universal and mandatorily applicable component of customary international law. The fact that the Geneva Convention might be violated in some detail, if true, doesn't automatically make it a war crime in this context.\n\nIn the same vein, the Geneva Conventions make a distinction between the treatment of uniformed and non\\-uniformed combatants, but this distinction, established by a treaty agreed to by many nations, is not necessarily inherently relevant to determining if something is a war crime in a war with a non\\-signatory. It is a provision that relies of cultural meaning that is shared by the treaty signatories, but may not make sense vis\\-a\\-vis non\\-human sentient aliens.\n\nIn the same vein, one wouldn't think that in a war with intelligent dragons, the fact that the dragons were or were not wearing uniforms, when dragons customarily fight naked, was significant, unless the dragon nation agreed to the Geneva Conventions in a duly ratified treaty."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical interstellar war between humans and an alien species, human forces capture alien combatants and use their bio-signatures to bypass the aliens' defenses.

The use of alien POWs to bypass defenses is not strictly a \"human shield\" situation as traditionally defined. The applicability of the Geneva Conventions to non-human entities is questionable, and there's no established moral consensus on whether sentient aliens are entitled to \"human rights.\" The situation is more analogous to using prisoners for deception rather than as shields. Additionally, the validity of Earth-based treaties in interstellar conflicts is uncertain.

The characters (as art) are also copyrighted. If you have someone creating unauthorized derivative works (fan art), you don't get \"better\" rights than they do (which is approximately none). There are companies that do not object to fan art until they see it being used to generate a separate revenue stream from which they derive no benefit. \n\nThe copyright symbol is generally irrelevant for works in the USA published after 1989\\. All creative works of original authorship are copyrighted by rule, unless specifically exempt (e.g., works of the US government).

The program, Amped FIVE, was used for the drone footage. To do this, Amped FIVE employs interpolation algorithms. Because of this, a dispute broke out between the prosecution and defense. These debates ranged from what is an interpolation, to whether the program added colors. James Armstrong, the senior forensic imaging specialist responsible for producing these enhanced videos, was brought in the courtroom to explain the process. What followed was truly interesting.\n\nMy main concern was with how the defense went about justifying why the drone footage should not have been used. I admit I do not understand court procedures and several things had me scratching my head. I would like to preface this by saying I understand it is the job of the defense to protect Kyle Rittenhouse. However, I felt did not make the best case.\n\nWhen questioned about the algorithm, on multiple occasions the defense would ask Mr. Armstrong how the interpolation worked. However, every time he was asked, he could only provide them with what kind of interpolation was used. He admitted that he did not understand how it was programmed. And why would he? Interpolation is an incredibly complex process that requires advanced mathematics and computer science. Not only that but, companies purposely do not disclose this information to prevent people from reverse\\-engineering their products. These questions could only be answered by a computer scientist or mathematician who worked on the program. So why wasn't one brought in? Also, because of his ignorance, wasn't a majority of the questioning a waste of time?\n\nAnother problem arose when the defense was trying to explain interpolation, they used an example that oversimplified the concept so much that it seemed to no longer make sense. The red, purple, and blue pixel example was very flawed in how it was presented. I believe the example wouldn't even work for the nearest neighbor because it would not have turned the pixels in the middle purple. Although this was a poor example, the judge used this as a basis for his understanding of interpolation which worked in the favor of the defense. Also, the defense kept trying to make Mr. Armstrong admit things he did not feel comfortable with because of his lack of knowledge. They asked the same question about adding colors repeatedly and he could never answer. And the language they use like \"add\" and \"manipulate\" implies that the enhanced footage was deceptively altered to give the prosecution an advantage. Because of this, they tried to argue that the video was unreliable. Ironically, the defense submitted evidence that was altered similarly.\n\nLastly, why was a peer\\-reviewed process using an industry\\-standard program not allowed to be used? I am aware that the judge said the burden of proof is on the prosecution but didn't they already prove that the footage was perfectly suitable for use in the trial? The prosecution asked Mr. Armstrong whether the procedures were acceptable for forensic imaging.\n\nI guess to sum everything up, why wasn't this handled better by both the defense and prosecution. I felt like the discussion went nowhere and all parties were incredibly ignorant.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The defense has an opportunity to question the witness the prosecution had called to provide foundation for the evidence, and in this case the defense's perspective is that the prosecution was trying to introduce evidence that they had improperly digitally manipulated. Part of their questioning was trying to figure out how the witness had manipulated the image prior to offering it as evidence. It's the prosecution's burden to prove that the evidence they are offering is accurate, the defense's purpose in asking the witness questions he could not answer is to try to prove to the judge that the prosecution has not laid proper foundation for the evidence because it has been manipulated from its original form in a way the prosecution cannot explain or justify as remaining fair and accurate to the events captured by the original footage.\n\nThis case in particular had a lot of video evidence, and most of these issues were handled in *motions in limine* before the trial started. However, the drone evidence in question was dropped at the prosecutor's office after the trial started, so the prosecution did not really have time to hire and *voir dire* an expert witness on Amped 5 (keeping in mind that the defense similarly had little time to review and account for the new evidence in the middle of trial). Since the defense in this case were cross\\-examining the witness, they have some leeway to present an argument with their questioning like they chose to do with the red/blue pixel drawings. As I recall the judge allowed the evidence as\\-is, so it does not appear that the defense's arguments were persuasive to the judge."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, the defense questioned the admissibility of enhanced drone footage.

If you don't copy the previous code that you refer to, you're not copying, and there can be no copyright infringement. That is a question of fact. If you don't have access to the previous source code, you can't copy it.\n\nAs you say the code is relatively simple, you could develop the code in a clean room (ie no previously developed code is accessible to you), and document the process as you do it. \n\nThat would probably reduce the prospects of someone coming to you later and succeeding in a claim for copyright infringement."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer needs to recreate a function they previously wrote for a different company.

Developing the code in a \"clean room\" environment without access to the original source code eliminates the possibility of direct copying, which is the basis for copyright infringement. Documenting the process provides evidence that the code was independently developed.

If he thinks the probate judges are bound to deny marriage certificates to same sex couples, why is he concurring to dismiss, instead of dissenting?

I wouldn't even know what an answer to that question would look like.\n\nThere are many guiding principles of interpretation, the starting place of which is to attempt to implement the intent of the legislature (something known as the \"[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule_(law))\" of statutory interpretation in English common law) as expressed in the language of the statute to the extent that no other stronger interpretive principles apply.\n\nBut, basically, it is a problem to be worked out on a case by case basis in cases addressing alleged ambiguities in the meaning of a particular part of a particular statue. Most of the time, there is no ambiguity and so it isn't even recognized as an issue. What is ambiguous is frequently impossible to tell on the face of a statute until you are presented with facts in a case that create a context in which the meaning of a particular phrase or word or grammatical construction is unclear.\n\nStatutory interpretation is a bottom up process in a legal system like India's, not a top down process. Questions arise one case at a time and bubble to the top, the issues aren't foreseen and resolved in advance.\n\nSome of the other canons of interpretation which are buried in case law are to construe statutes in a way that makes them constitutional, to assume that there is not an intent to displace common law rules unless the text or comprehensive nature of a statute suggests otherwise, to give meaning of every part of the statute, to avoid absurd interpretations, and to consider legislative history when the proper interpretation is unclear.\n\nUltimately, statutory interpretation is not a mechanical problem like the order of operations in a mathematics equation. It requires a judge to employ good judgment and common sense to reach an interpretation that makes sense in the relevant context."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the approach to statutory interpretation in the Indian legal system?\n\nA) Statutory interpretation in India follows a strict top-down process with clear, predefined rules established in the Constitution.\n\nB) The General Clauses Act of 1897 provides comprehensive guidelines for interpreting all Indian laws, leaving little room for judicial discretion.\n\nC) Statutory interpretation in India is primarily a bottom-up process, with issues addressed on a case-by-case basis and principles developed through case law.\n\nD) Indian courts rely exclusively on the literal meaning of statutes, disregarding legislative intent and contextual factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Generally speaking, it is harder to find a legal grounds for disregarding the free exercise of religion than it is to find a legal basis to regulate otherwise free speech.\n\nFor example, commercial speech is subject to more rigorous regulation than private political and educational speech, which is why there are no private businesses taking anti\\-vax positions in their advertising.\n\nThe theory is that courts are not in a good position to make general determinations of the truth of policy positions or statements about general truths as opposed to what happened in a particular transaction or occurrence. This is in part because a ruling by the right court at the right time can preclude the correctness of its determination from being revisited indefinitely and from time to time, accepted conventional wisdom and scientific consensus at one time are revealed later on to have been wrong with more discussion and investigation.

According to the information provided, there are 14 specific states that have implemented laws allowing for the seizure of weapons from mentally unstable individuals under \"extreme risk protection orders\" (ERPOs). These states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all states require individuals to surrender firearms due to involuntary hospitalization. The laws vary by state.\n\nOption C is false because there is no federal law that universally prohibits all individuals with a history of mental illness from owning firearms.

Given that there are may IDE's around and that they all pretty much do the same thing and have very similar interfaces, I'm sure that the functionality alone cannot be copyrightable.\n\nI love the way Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE looks and feels. I'm referring to Visual Studio Desktop (not Visual Studio Code). I would like my program to look and feel the same, if not identically, at least very close.\nMy program would have nothing in common with Microsoft's product except for how it visually looks.\n\nTo be more precise, I'm interested in knowing if copying any of the following is permitted by copyright law :\n\n* Program layout : where various \"sub panels or plugins or widgets\" are positioned on screen.\n* Colors : specific shades of various colors and combinations there of, color palettes etc...\n* Fonts, however in this case, a user might obtain a font license for personal use, and configure the program to use that specific font, but it would be nice to integrate it.\n* Look and feel of various User Interface elements for example buttons are rectangles with text, an optional image, they have a specific width and height, a specific border size and color. Panels top bar have text on the far left, a specific fill pattern in the middle and on the right there is the \"pin\" button, and the \"close widget/panel\" button; the program editor / text editor visually highlights text with specific rectangles, and transparency patters.\n\nThe question is : How far can I go in copying the user interface before it becomes copyright infringement ?\n\nI'm asking because I've seen around many programs that emulate Visual Studio's look and feel, when opening them, a normal user would struggle to tell the difference.\n\nP.S.: I assume the answer is probably no, I can't copy everything and get away with it.\n\nHowever, how much can be copied before it becomes copyright infringement ?\n\n**Related question** :\nGiven the nature of the program I want to create, and the fact that it can be configured i.e.: its look and feel as well as graphical behavior can be changed in the settings menu; Would creating a program with a different default look and feel that can be configured manually to look exactly the same as Visual Studio be allowed (in copyright terms) ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\n**Functionality** in general is not protected by copyright, although it may in some cases be protected by a patent. As the question noted, there are many IDEs and creating another one generally similar to those is not a violation of anyone's IP rights.\n\nThe \"look and feel\" of a piece of software has been held by US courts to be protected by copyright.\n\n*Broderbund Software. Inc., v. Unison World, Inc.*, 648 F. Supp. 1127 (N.D. Cal. 1986\\), was a relativcly early case in which the visual display elements of a software program were held to be protected by copyright. In the decision it is said that;\n\n> On the \u201cChoose a Font\u201d screen, no mechanical or practical factor compelled \\[defendant] to use those exact words (\u201cChoose a Font\u201d). He could have written: \u201cSelect a Font,\u201d or \u201cIndicate a Typeface Preference,\u201d or \u201cWhich Type Style Do You Prefer,\u201d or any combination of these terms. . . .The bottom line is that the designer of any program that performed the same functions as \u201cPrint Shop\u201d had available a wide range of expression governed predominantly by artistic and not utilitarian considerations.\n\nAnother relevant early case was *Digital Communications Associates, Inc. v. Softklone Distributing Corp.*, 659 F.Supp. 449 (N.D. Ga. 1987\\). In this case, the Defendant \"oftklone intentionally set out to \"clone\" or copy the functionality and interface of the popular program *Crosstalk XVI* (I was a user of thwt program many years ago). The court wrote:\n\n> In the instant case, however, the arrange\\- ment of the status screen involves consider\\- able stylistic creativity and authorship above and beyond the ideas embodied in the status screen. It cannot be said that the idea of the status screen, i.e., using two symbol commands to change the operations of the computer program and reflecting that fact on a screen listing the computer program\u2019s parameters/commands with their operative values, could not have been expressed in a large variety of ways. The defendants have never contended that they could not have arranged the parameters/commands in a wide variety of patterns without hampering the operation of their program.\n\nand found copyright infringement on that basis.\n\nSection 310 of [*Copyrightable Authorship:\nWhat Can Be Registered*](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf) by the US Copyright office, says:\n\n> The U.S. Copyright Office will not consider the so\\-called \u201clook and feel\u201d of a work. Invoking a work\u2019s \u201cfeel\u201d is not a viable substitute for an objective analysis of the work\u2019s fixed and creative elements. See 4 MELVILLE \\& DAVID NIMMER, *NIMMER ON Copyright* \u00a7\n> 13\\.03\\[A]\\[1]\\[c] (2013\\) (criticizing the use of \u201cfeel\u201d as a \u201cwholly amorphous referent\u201d that \u201cmerely invites an abdication of analysis\u201d).\n\nThe question asks:\n\n> How far can I go in copying the user interface before it becomes copyright infringement ?\n\nThere is no clear bright line on this matter. The more one copies interface elements and choices from a specific source, the stronger the case for infringement is. Using elements and choices that have become common industry practice in multiple works froim multiple developers and companies is probably safe. Clearly and extensively imitating the visual appearance and interface of a single specific work of software might well be infringement.\n\nOne would be wise to consult a lawyer with experience in copyright law, and specifically \"look and feel\" issues, beforign publishing such a work of software.\n\nThis issue is discussed extensively in [*Look And Feel In Computer Software*](https://www.computerlaw.com/articles/look-and-feel-in-computer-software) (1993\\) by Jack Russo \\& Jamie Nafziger, published by Computerlaw Group LLP, which seems to be a law firm specializing in computer law.\n\n[*The Law of Look and Feel*](https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/90_529.pdf) by Peter Lee (Professor of Law and Chancellor\u2019s Fellow, University of California, Davis.) \\& Madhavi Sunder (Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of Law, University of California, Davis.) is a 60\\-page law review article dealing with this topic. There is far more detail in these publications (and many others to be found on the net) than I can summarize in an SE answer.\n\nConfigurable Interfaces\n-----------------------\n\nThe question asks whether the use of a configurable interface which could, but does not by default, imitate an existing interface would be infringement.\n\nI have not been able to find any case on point, or any discussion in a reliable source of this issue. Therefore, I am going to speculate.\n\nIf there is a single choice between overall \"themes\" or \"shells\" and one of them imitates the interface from a protected program without permission, that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped with that interface. It might or might not be infringement, depending on the details, as discussed above.\n\nIf there are many settings, but the program is shipped with instructions advising a combination of settings that imitate another interface (or the developer or distributor provides such advice to users), that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration. If the developer provides a few preset configuration files which control these interface settings, and one such file results in settings that imitate another interface, that would also probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration.\n\nIf there are many settings and there is no particular guidance or advice to a user on what combination to use, nor any predefined settings file, but users must discover (if they choose) a group of settings which imitate another interface, that is probably not infringement.\n\nI repeat that this section of the answer is based on general principals, but not on specific case law, nor on specific legal scholarship, and a court faced with this issue might rule otherwise. Before implementing this as a business plan, one might be wise to consult a lawyer with IP expertise."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating a new Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and wants to incorporate some visual elements similar to Microsoft's Visual Studio.

While the \"look and feel\" of software can be protected by copyright, providing users with the ability to configure the interface themselves without specific guidance or preset configurations that mimic another product is less likely to be seen as infringement. This approach puts the onus on the user to create any similarity, rather than the developer deliberately copying protected elements.\n\nOption A is a clear case of copying Visual Studio's interface and would likely be considered infringement.\n\nOption C, while offering a choice, still includes a direct copy of Visual Studio's interface as one of the options, which could be seen as infringement.\n\nOption D, even though the default is different, includes a preset configuration that mimics Visual Studio, which legally could be treated the same as shipping the product with that interface by default.\n\nThe key principle here is that while functionality itself is not copyrightable, the specific expression of that functionality through visual design and interface elements can be protected.

If the judge has to rule about his or herself, they will refer to themselves as \"The Court\" i.e. It is the opinion of the Court... which can be read as \"It is my opinion\"\n\nThe Jury must first be sworn in as they assess guilt... usually (Bench Trials, i.e. the Judge also does the jury's job are also possible, and the decision to one is the right of the Defendant. It's often referred to as refusing such a right.)\n\nAs the Prosecution is making the case and because you cannot defend against something without knowing what you're being accused of, the Prosecution will make the first opening remarks, followed by the Defense\\*.\n\nSince the Prosecution must go first so the defense can properly defend against the charges, the Prosecution gets to call it's witnesses first. Each witness is direct examined, then cross\\-examined (there is also a period of re\\-direct and re\\-cross). Each level can only ask questions related to those brought up in the prior questioning line (Cross can only ask questions about direct. Re\\-Direct can only ask about Cross. Re\\-Cross can only ask about Re\\-Direct).\n\nAfter all prosecution witnesses are called, the defense calls its witnesses and the order is held in the same manner (direct then cross).\n\nAfter this, both sides make closing remarks, and the defense will go first (they have had time to prepare remarks, as this basically sums up their defense. Given that it just happened, it's fresher in the jury's mind, so the Prosection will get the final closing remarks to drive his points home and answer the Defense's arguments.\n\nThis is followed by the Judge giving the Jury the final instructions, and the jury is sent to deliberate the guilt or innocense of the defendant. When they finish this, they will read their verdict.\n\n\\*Note that in the United States and most other Common Law or adversarial court systems, it is the right of the Defendant to not testify to anything... up to and including calling no witnesses and offering no rebuttal to his case... this normally doesn't happen as the prosecution needs to show some evidence in pre\\-trial that their accusations have merit and they aren't just accusing defendant because they do not like their face... there is a point in the trial where the defense may ask the judge to close the case because the Prosecution hasn't proven a damn thing (Right after the Prosecution rests), though the judge rarely carries the motion.

This is not what's at question here. At question here is the arrangement in which public IPs are masked by presenting traffic to site operators as appearing to originate from the veneer IPs of the VPN operators.\n\nThis allows (for example) users in a country A to route their traffic through a commercial VPN operator in a country B and access services in country B which are restricted to users from country A. This can be used to subvert both intellectual property restrictions on traffic and legal restrictions that site operators attempt to enforce by geography\\-based restrictions.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem that it would not be impossible to track all veneer IPs and identify them as such publicly. So a knee\\-jerk response to this question might be \"there is no need for such a law.\" However, while it may be possible to track all IPs used by a commercial operator of a VPN which engages *exclusively* in VPN business, it is not possible to track all IPs dedicated to VPN business by an operator which has many other forms of business.\n\nSo, for example, NordVPN's IPs can be identified as belonging to NordVPN, but IBM's or Google's IPs cannot be identified as used exclusively in their VPN business.\n\nSince there is a public policy interest (mentioned in the 3rd paragraph of this question) in knowing which IPs are VPN veneer IPs, Congress may decide to require commercial VPN operators to register those veneer IPs in a way which would make them clearly distinguishable from non\\-veneer IPs used by the same entities.\n\nWould that be constitutional? More specifically, is there any case law which may be relevant to deciding whether this would be constitutional?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a law would be constitutional\n----------------------------------\n\nThe US Congress could decide to require VPN providers to register the IPs that they provide to VPN customers. The use of such techniques would almost surely be considered \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and so Congress would have power under the Commerce Clause of the constitution to legislate concerning it.\n\nThere would clearly be a rational basis for such a law \\-\\- the question outlines such a basis. This is not an area subject to strict scrutiny. None of the previously established limits on the commerce power (and there are few) would seem to apply.\n\nState laws on this topic would probably be preempted by the *dormant commerce clause* if Congress does not act, and clearly preempted if Congress does act, unless Congress explicitly permits concurrent legislation.\n\nWhether Congress **should** act on this matter is a policy question not on topic on Law.se. Whether Congress **will** act is speculation. I can only say that I am not aware of any widespread demand for such action, or any proposed bills, on the topic.\n\nHowever, there is US caselaw to the effect that anonymous speech (or other communication) is protected by the First Amendment , and that laws effectively banning anonymous speech are not acceptable.

These bases now lie there, waiting for someone to discover them.\n\nMy question is: who becomes the owner of the ancient alien bases once they're are discovered? Is it the person or country that discovered them, the Antarctic Treaty signatories, or the aliens themselves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Antarctic Treaty doesn't establish ownership or sovereignty\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle IV of the [Antarctic Treaty](https://documents.ats.aq/ats/treaty_original.pdf) makes clear that the Treaty is *not* a renunciation by any contracting party of any basis of claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica. And \"\\[n]o acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica.\"\n\nSo, while the Antarctic Treaty establishes an arrangement for cooperative shared use of the areas, it is not about sovereignty or ownership.\n\nTerritorial claims\n------------------\n\nThere are (were) however [territorial claims to various areas of Antarctica](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/law-and-treaty/history/antarctic-territorial-claims/). These have not been resolved at international law.\n\nWho owns the centre of the earth?\n---------------------------------\n\nA traditional common\\-law property rule is that ownership extends to the center of the earth (see generally, John G. Sprankling, \"[Owning the Center of the Earth](https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/facultyarticles/131/)\"). Sprankling notes that this was never taken literally until after it was introduced by Blackstone and argues that its time is near an end. But in any case, I think the correct starting point is that the owner of the surface owns what's underneath, at least to an extent.\n\nWho owns the alien bases, and what would that mean?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nApplying Earth law, ownership of the alien bases would be disputed among those nations who are willing to assert territorial claims to the surface under which the alien bases are found. However, if these bases are cultural heritage property (which their age suggests they might be), the 1970 [UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property](https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural) could prevent the import, export, or transfer of any of the material from the bases. The \"owning\" country (if that is ever resolved) might have obligations under international law to preserve the bases. Further, if the dispute over the property results in armed conflict, the competing states could have obligations under the [1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict](https://en.unesco.org/protecting-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-convention) to avoid damaging the cultural property.\n\nIs Earth law the applicable law?\n--------------------------------\n\nIf we take this hypothetical at face value, it implies we are not alone and in relationship with other extra\\-terrestrial culture(s). If members of those cultures were to reach out, that should at least bring us to consider that our law is not supreme. Our law would need to coexist with other law; other law that potentially has very different conceptions of ownership and rights."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information given, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership of hypothetical ancient alien bases discovered in Antarctica?\n\nA) The Antarctic Treaty definitively establishes that any discovered alien bases would be jointly owned by all signatories to the treaty.\n\nB) The person or country that discovers the bases would automatically become the legal owner under international law.\n\nC) Ownership would likely be disputed among nations with territorial claims to the surface area where the bases are found, but this could be complicated by cultural heritage laws.\n\nD) The aliens who originally built the bases would retain full legal ownership rights under Earth law, regardless of how long ago they were constructed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The document states that the Antarctic Treaty does not establish ownership or sovereignty, and that there are unresolved territorial claims to parts of Antarctica. It suggests that ownership of anything found underground would likely be disputed among nations claiming the surface territory.

United States 470 U.S. 598 (1985\\)\n\n> In our criminal justice system, the Government retains \"broad discretion\" as to whom to prosecute. \\[...] This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill\\-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.\n\nDoes this mean that the courts can/will *never* challenge \"decision to prosecute\"?\n\n(Again, I am interested in **theory** and **logic** more than practicality).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A sufficient explanation would be that the ticketed driver was caught and the unticketed driver was not because the officer was already responding to a situation. Had the officer caught the unticketed driver, he would have ticketed him for the same offense. Courts would accept that it would be impossible for the officer to deal with both offenses at the same time.\n\nSelective enforcement is done properly when the prosecutor evaluates the risk verses reward of perusing a criminal prosecution against an individual based on the evidence, the nature of the crime, and the likely\\-hood of a conviction if it goes to trial. For example, while using illict substances is a crime, the government will usually only prosecute on that charge if they find your use while in possession with intent to sell (or in connection to another crime). In this instant, the high school stoner is not going to be as instrumental in the case as the dealer, who can lead to suppliers if he cooperates OR is removed from distributing in his territory if he does not.\n\nIf the stoner is picked up on a minor offense and carrying a small amount on his person, the police might arrest him for the crime but agree to not press charges if he gives them information to who the dealer who sold him the substance is. Again, the risk here is putting a small time criminal into jail at cost of society, when society would benefit more if that cell was housing the bigger fish (a criminal record can prevent getting certain jobs, which will more likely turn stoner high schooler into jobless loser, which would be a drain on public welfare in and of itself, and that's not including the possibility that joining in drug trafficking as a seller would fix his lack of income).\n\nConversely, in cases such as espionage, the death penalty is on the books but is rarely pursued in favor of lesser sentences. Here, the pay off is that they dangle the death penalty over the spies head unless he tells them about all his spying activities, which benefits the spy agency in filling in security gaps and potentially finding more spies.\n\nThe use of lighter charges in exchange for a guilty plea is also favored as trials are costly. If a criminal pleads guilty to a crime that the government has them dead to rights for, the prosecution will reward them with lighter offenses for saving their office the price tag of a full blown trial.\n\nAll this is on condition that selective enforcement is not used as a basis of discrimination, which is illegal for the prosecutors to do."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case of selective enforcement, which of the following scenarios is most likely to be accepted by a court as a valid reason for ticketing one driver but not another who was committing the same offense?\n\nA) The officer chose to ticket the driver in the more expensive car because they could afford the fine.\n\nB) The officer only ticketed the male driver because they believe male drivers are more likely to speed.\n\nC) The officer was already responding to another situation and could only deal with one offense at a time.\n\nD) The officer decided not to ticket the driver who was polite and apologetic about their speeding.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Courts are likely to accept that an officer cannot deal with multiple offenses simultaneously, especially if they were already responding to another situation.

Sometimes laws are enforced less harshly as a matter of law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial discretion against the rich, famous and powerful, than the poor, but they are **subject to the same laws** and the authorities have the same power to enforce those laws against a celebrity or other rich or powerful person, as they do against anyone else.\n\nMost criminal laws provide that factors such as whether someone is gainfully employed, whether they pay restitution for an offense, and whether someone has otherwise good character and be considered as grounds for leniency in sentencing someone for a crime of which that person is convicted, so that can systemically benefit such people at sentencing. \n\nAlso, the famous, rich and powerful may be seen as particularly credible in a trial by jurors.\n\nThey may be able to afford and support highly competent and exhaustively thorough legal representation, while the poor often get an overworked public defender with very little time or resources to devote to their case, or only a very inexpensive private criminal defense lawyer who similarly has limited resources and is rarely the most highly competent person in the field. \n\nSimilarly, the rich and famous can typically more easily be released on bail or on a personal recognizance bond pending trial, and being at large, rather than in jail, prior to being convicted, greatly reduces the pressure to plead guilty, the harm caused by the charge if there is an acquittal, and the ability of the defendant to mount a defense to a charge.\n\nBut, that doesn't change the fact that the same law applies to everyone, although this too has some bias inherent in it, as this famous aphorism illustrates:\n\n> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the\n>  poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal\n>  bread.\n\n\\-\\- Anatole France (16 April 1844 \u2013 12 October 1924\\), born Jacques Anatole Fran\u00e7ois Thibault, a French poet, journalist, and novelist, in *Le Lys Rouge* \\[The Red Lily] (1894\\), ch. 7 (In the original French, the quote is \"*La majestueuse \u00e9galit\u00e9 des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain.*\").\n\nAnatole France's point is true for somewhat deeper than the somewhat flip expression of the idea in this famous quotation suggests. \n\nAs a general rule, economic harms to others that people who cause them can usually remedy by actually being able to pay money as a result of a judgment in a civil lawsuit, are usually not defined as crimes.

This is commonly started by the crewman of the vessel who spots the body shouting \"Man overboard\" once... which triggers every crewman on the deck to also shout the same thing exactly once regardless of if they can see the man who is overboard (The idea is that the call is so all crew on the deck are not announcing the sighting but responding that they know there's an emergency situation in progress... and to muster to the appropriate situations). The boat's helmsman or pilot will then proceed to maneuver to recover the body in the water and bring it onboard the boat, (if traveling by sail, to then as soon as possible transfer to a motor powered vessel or to land which ever is quicker).\n\nAdditionally, should the boat have radio communication, the situation should trigger a mayday communication which will alert other vessels, regardless of purpose and local emergency services to the situation, with GPS tracking aiding all responders. Typically while underway at sea or in large bodies of water, all operators of watercraft are required to respond, regardless of actual purpose on the water (recall the famous \"Miracle on the Hudson\" incident where New York Ferry Operators were the actual first responders to get ALL passengers and crew off the crashed plane to land, where EMS and police services were waiting to deal with the survivors). Most boating licenses these days require a basic understanding of duties with maritime safety and if you come upon a situation while underway, you are a first responder automatically.\n\nRemove the question of water and say that there is person who you are unsure of if they are alive or dead on dry land. Under law, you cannot be held liable for anything you do in the course of saving a life so long as you are acting within your competency to do so, and do not take actions you are not licensed to do as part of training, oversight, and regulations dictate, you cannot be sued for medical injuries inflicted on someone in the course of saving their life (called \"Life over Limb\"... that if the only way to save an unconscious person from death is to amputate a limb, you're not liable for cutting off the limb in question, so long as you are trained to do this. To a lesser extreme example, if CPR is performed right, you will break the victims ribs... since it's a question of keeping the person alive, the temporary pain and handicap of broken ribs is seen as acceptable).\n\nAs a lifeguard (for pools, I wasn't certified for \"wilderness lifeguarding\" but the differences in this respect were minimum) your first thing to do when getting in the water to fish out a swimmer in distress was to get them back to the pool deck before life efforts could occur (there are a few times where you had to start the life saving efforts in water, but I can count them on one hand, and one of those incidents was only after confirming your victim was conscious and even then you still were moving to get them out of the water asap... it's just asap would be a little bit longer. We also weren't trained to pronounce death. If it was so serious that CPR starts, you do not stop unless another guard or EMS relieve you.).\n\nIn these situations, there is proper evidence gathering procedures that will be used to establish what happened. For example, the first responders will be fingerprinted and prints in the areas touched for life saving efforts will be noted as part of the evidence. Additionally, paramedics, EMS and first responders will often alert police to any items of note they saw around the victim that were disturbed in the process of life saving efforts. The police may collect evidence from you to rule you out as a suspect (by showing the evidence on the body was consistent with applied life saving techniques) and to identify evidence not related to you at all (a pink fiber on the body that doesn't match any of your clothes means the body came into contact with the fibers from another source).\n\nThis also establishes \"Chain of Custody\" when you call the body in and stay with it and allow minimum contact with it (many larger ships will store the body in a locked room to keep crew and passenger contact to a minimum). Either way, so long as you tell the police everything you did in rescue and recovery, this isn't tampering with evidence on the face of it. If something that is inconsistent with your story comes up, it's not necessarily incriminating either... in the heat of the moment in a rescue and recovery effort, tunnel vision can form and you aren't expect to recall everything you did. Police should know this and understand that you were cooperating in what for most of the world is an unusual situation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A recreational boater discovers a floating body in a river.

The boater should:\n\n1. Retrieve the body: This is part of proper maritime rescue and recovery procedures, even if the person is deceased.\n2. Bring it aboard: This ensures preservation of evidence and follows the \"man overboard\" protocol.\n3. Initiate a mayday call: This alerts other vessels and emergency services to the situation.\n4.

The bank said I need to talk to the dealership. Can I sue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is probably illegal. Forging a signature is illegal, indeed it is a crime. If you signed a contract with bank A with a certain interest rate, bank A can sell that contract to bank B, but neither A nor B can change the terms (e.g. increase the interest charge). There might be some sketchy clause in the contract that you did sign which they think allows that to change the terms unilaterally under some condition (e.g. \"we reserve the right to sell thig contract to a third parts who may increase the interest by X amount\"), but such a clause would most likely violate law recarding unlawful acts in car sales (example from [Washington state](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.70.180)). It is very hard to understand why the bank would tell you to talk to the dealership, if you actually had a contract with the bank. That suggests that you actually did not have a contract with the bank, you signed a form supplied by the car dealer and the form say something like \"we will try to get you an interest rate at .41%\". Still, they must offer you the opportunity to accept or reject the alternative rate.\n\nUnfortunately, by paying the charge and not complaining, you may be considered to have accepted the modified term.
