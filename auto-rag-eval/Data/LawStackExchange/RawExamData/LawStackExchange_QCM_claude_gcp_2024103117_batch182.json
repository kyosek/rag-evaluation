However both claimant and employer settle before Tribunal Hearings through negotiation of a COT3 agreement.

The ex\\-employee mounts their tribunal claim on the fact that Y \\& Z have not resulted in dismissal for other staff so X must be the reason. If the claimant shares their believe that X is the reason for dismissal, with friends or colleagues, can they later face defamation charges?\n\nI understand Defamation in the terms of [this HSE page](https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/reporting-defamation.htm).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Typically in defamation law, claims made persuiant to litigation are not defamatory, since they are going to be tested for validity if the case goes to trial. I'm not familiar with any differences in what is generally done in settlements between the U.K. and the U.S., but since both are Common Law countries, and Settlements are very common in civil proceedings in the U.S., it's a good start.\n\nGenerally a settlemant can occur anytime before the verdict of the case is rendered, although usually it will happen after preliminary hearings during the Discovery phase. In the U.S., Discovery is very broad and one need not prove that the requested items contain evidence but might contain evidence. This means that, for example, you could request a substantial amount of e\\-mail records from the opposing party because somewhere on the company e\\-mail server, there might be something to help your case. And even if after you sift through the emails and find no smoking guns related to your case, you could find some dirty laundry that's unrelated but still damning... if not more so than the initial case. Many people, especially big compainies, would rather just give the ex\\-employee some what he/she wants, if it means they don't get to see the proverbial man behind the curtain.\n\nAdditionally the practice might fall into a legally gray area of the law that, if it reaches trial, could hurt the company or even the industry if a judge rules against the company, effectively saying that this gray area is now definately illegal. Better to eat the loss of capital with the settling out of court than to take the much larger hit of the buisness practice being illegalized all together.\n\nTypically in settlements, both parties agree to terms and sign a contract. While the whole of the terms are never discussed, almost all include that the plaintiff will drop the case and never bring the matter to court again and that both parties will sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA) meaning that they won't discuss the rest of the settlement terms with anyone not party to them.\n\nIf the plaintiff does break the NDA, the defendant can sue for breech of contract and recover at the least the monitary compensation they awarded in the settlement. Conversely, if the respondent breaks the NDA, the plaintiff can refile their initial suit with the addition of breech of contract (and this time it will get to court... and all the dirty laundry sees the harsh light of day.).\n\nWhile the respondent in a settled case can possibly sue for defamation if the plaintiff said the respondent did what the initial suit claimed they did (legally, it was never proven or disproven), or they were guilty (again, since no verdict was reached at trial, no guilt was established), the breech of contract is a much more airtight case and doesn't open up discovery to the respondent's cupability in the settled case (since the breech is about discussing the settled case at all, not the validity of the accusations of the settled case).

One can drive, slowly, to a nearby police station, or to a well\\-lighted, public place where others are likely to be about.

First, *the ABA has standards for legal commentators* but they are very weak. They say pretty much what you would expect, and, they are *non\\-binding:* they explicitly say they \"*not intended*\" to provide grounds for \"professional discipline.\" Second, there are articles by lawyers indicating there are no state bar standards. Taken together, the weak ABA standards and the articles should give you enough evidence to prove your case in the \"court of buddy opinion.\"\n\nThe [ABA](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/standards/crimjust_standards_fairtrial_blk/) rules on legal commentators were issued in 2013 as part of a *Fair Trial and Public Discourse Black Letter*.

It appears that what is \"over reached\" is an *occupier's* (e.g. a tenant) overriding interest. Also to explain in the context of overriding interest:\n\n1. Normally, when one purchases land \"unencumbered\", one has all the property rights associated with that land.\n2. It is possible to distribute interests in the land to other parties (e.g. tenancy, or granting a right to use a portion of a stream on a given property for fishing).\n3. It is possible to register such interests in the Land Registry; if such interests are not registered, they \"die with the grantor\" or at least with their interest.\n4. There are certain interests that do not need to be registered with parcel in the Land Registry. These are the \"overriding\" interests, that \"override\" the rule that interests need to be registered to survive transference.\n5. The overreaching doctrine allows distributions or sales from trusts to \"overreach\" certain overriding interests into the real property. The overreaching doctrine therefore is a means of \"quieting\" a title to real property.\n\nWith that in mind:\n\n1. \"trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries of the trust\"\n\nImagine scenario \\#1, a trust exclusively of money. The trustee\ndivides the money appropriately, and gives (distributes) it to the\nbeneficiaries. Straightforward.\n\nNow, imagine scenario \\#2, a trust exclusively of property (clothes,\njewelry, automobiles, other goods and yes, real estate). It is quite\npossibly for a trustee to sell such goods on the open market, and\ndistribute the proceeds to the beneficiaries of the trust. Likewise,\nscenario \\#3, in which the trust contains property (it need not be of\nexclusive composition). It is possible, rather than to sell property\nand distribute money, to distribute other property directly to\nbeneficiaries, e.g. one's parents die, and one inherits their house\n(generally that would be through a will not a trust, but the two instruments are similar).\n\nThus, \"The overreaching doctrine is not confined to sale of trust property; it will also apply where the trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries of the trust.\" can be read as \"regardless of whether the trustee sells the property to a third party, or distributes it to the beneficiary, the overreaching doctrine applies\".\n\n2. Those beneficiaries will receive the property absolutely and, since there is no exchange product, there will be no replacement property in which the remaining beneficiaries have an equitable proprietary interest \\[emphasis mine].\n\nImagine a scenario where a trust grants 3 beneficiaries (let's call them Alice, Bob and Charlie) equal stakes in say, a house. One beneficiary wishes to own the house outright ( Alice), and so a fair price for the house is determined (3 pounds, or 3 million pounds) and the first beneficiary pays it to the trust, as in scenario\\#2 above. However, generally what what happens is that the first beneficiary would only actually pay only a fraction of the price, divided proportionally among the other (\"remaining\") beneficiaries. E.g. the house is determined to be valued at 3/3million pounds, so Alice pays 2/2million pounds to be split between Bob and Charlie. The money is the \"replacement property\".\n\nMy reading of the bolded section is that it is clarifying that in the case where the real property is distributed, rather than sold. E.g. Imagine a trust with a 1 million pound house, and 2 million pounds in \"cash\" money; the trust could distribute the house to Alice, and a million pounds each to Bob and Charlie.\n\n\\#3\\.

Which of the following scenarios correctly describes the application of the overreaching doctrine and its effects?\n\nA) The trustee sells the property for \u00a33 million and distributes \u00a32 million each to Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The overreaching doctrine applies, and the purchaser receives the property free from any equitable interests.\n\nB) The trustee distributes the property to Alice and \u00a31.5 million each to Bob and Charlie. The overreaching doctrine applies, Alice receives the property absolutely, and Bob and Charlie have no remaining equitable proprietary interest in the property.\n\nC) The trustee distributes \u00a31 million in cash to each beneficiary and keeps the property in the trust.

The overreaching doctrine applies, but Alice, Bob, and Charlie still hold equitable proprietary interests in the property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B correctly describes the application of the overreaching doctrine in this scenario. When the trustee lawfully distributes trust property (in this case, the \u00a33 million property) to a beneficiary (Alice), the overreaching doctrine applies. This means Alice receives the property absolutely, free from any equitable interests of the other beneficiaries. Since there is no \"exchange product\" (i.e., the property wasn't sold for cash), there is no replacement property in which Bob and Charlie retain an equitable proprietary interest. Instead, they receive their share in cash (\u00a31.5 million each), which is already part of the trust assets.

As @Trish noted, you are legally required to register your new residence within two weeks [\u00a7 17 BMG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bmg/__17.html). In some (most?) German states you can just walk into a B\u00fcrgeramt and register your new residence so it is perfectly straightforward to do that within two weeks and that is expected.\n\nThis is not the case in Berlin, you need to get an appointment to register and these are hard to get. I just searched online for B\u00fcrgeramt in Berlin, picked [one](https://service.berlin.de/standort/122231/) and then you can choose the service your want (register new residence) and look at the available appointments. Right now on July 7th there were appointments available on exactly one date, September 1st. Note that this is nowhere near within two weeks.\n\nTo my knowledge, if you have an appointment at the B\u00fcrgeramt to register your new residence than current legal opinion is that you did fullfill the two weeks requirement regardless of when the appointment actually is.

While German law requires new residents to register within two weeks, Berlin's bureaucracy often makes this impossible due to long wait times for appointments.

This approach allows the person to comply with the law while potentially delaying the transfer of their naturalization application to Berlin.\n\nOption A is illegal, as it violates the requirement to register within two weeks.

In case one goes temporarily missing, is it possible for the other to take over decisions for both of them (e.g. agree to an acquisition)? Is there some kind of deal stipulated when establishing the society that covers these situations, and is it imaginable that they agreed on terms such as \"if Person A can not be contacted successfully for 24 hours, then Person B is allowed full decisional power\" (regardless of how poorly thought through such an agreement might be)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is absolutely possible. Much depends on the type of business, and the type of decision. I'll assume for purposes of this answer that normally the particular type of business decision requires the assent of both of the people involved, like a decision to sell out the business. I'll also assume that both of the people involved actually own the business. There are several different ways that this could happen.\n\nMost business decisions require the assent of people involved in the business, but not the owners. The corporation's board of directors can often authorize things, for instance. Most boards can meet and vote whether or not all of the directors are present, provided proper notice of the meeting is sent to all of the directors. So if Person A goes missing, Person B can still call a meeting, send out notice, meet, and vote. If Person B's presence at the meeting is enough for quorum, then Person B can still vote. That vote will then be the decision of the full Board, even though Person A was not present.\n\nIf the decision requires the assent of the owners, that can usually be handled the same way: notice of a shareholder meeting, attendance by Person B after proper notice to Person A, a vote and it is the action of the shareholders.\n\nIt is also possible that such dramatic steps are unnecessary. For instance, say the business is a partnership between Person A and Person B. In that case, Person B can usually speak for the partnership in all affairs (so can Person A). Person B may ultimately have to answer to Person A for what was done, if it violated some agreement or something, but the decision will stick. For many decisions, the law permits a forward agreement that Person A's assent is unnecessary. For instance, in a Limited Partnership, if Person B is the General Partner and Person A is a Limited Partner, most of the decision\\-making is in Person B's hands. Similarly if Person B is the Manager of a Manager\\-Managed LLC.\n\nSome decisions absolutely require the assent of Person A. For instance, if there are only two owners and a decision is being made to take the company through bankruptcy, both owners may have to assent. In that circumstance, it is still possible for Person B to go ahead. For instance, if Person A delivered a proxy to Person B in advance, then Person B can vote for Person A. If the proxy was discretionary, then Person B can vote however Person B wants for Person A.\n\nIn the most extreme circumstance, Person A can voluntarily make Person B an \"attorney\\-in\\-fact\" by signing and delivering a Power of Attorney to Person B, or else Person B can force the issue by causing Person A to be declared dead or incompetent.

I have this chapter wherein the protagonist, a 21 y.o. normal human male is transformed into a Superman\\-like being, the **only** such \u201csuper\u201d in the world. Powers include flight and invulnerability.\n\nJust a few hours after this freakish transformation, he goes riding on his Harley\\-Davidson Sportster motorcycle, to think (this takes place in Florida). While he is riding along, he runs over a pit in the road, blows a front tire, and pancakes, eating pavement in the process. He slides into the opposite lane into the path of an 18\\-wheeler and gets run over. In the following, he suffers *no* harm whatsoever as he is invulnerable.\n\n![EIGHTEEN WHEELER SEMI](https://i.stack.imgur.com/chB0D.png)\n\nHis path is in purple (*under* the truck). The front tire of the truck hits him and blows as well, causing the truck driver to lose control.\n\nLong story short, he rises to his hands and knees at **X**, in effect becoming an roughly 30 inch tall, immovable, indestructible object. Then he\u2019s struck by the trailer rear tires *(red squares)*. They shear off, all 8 tires and two axles as a unit, go airborne and land across the road in a parking lot on top of a car. A woman inside that car is killed immediately. The truck itself jack\\-knifes and wrecks, turning over.\n\nThe protagonist doesn\u2019t notice crushed car across the road, checks out the truck driver (who\u2019s the sole occupant), sees that he\u2019s belted up, unharmed, and coming to. He looks around; there are no other witnesses\\-\\-it\u2019s a Sunday morning, and leaps over to his slightly damaged bike. Handlebars in hand he rises straight up a thousand feet or so, surveys the scene, hears sirens, and leaves the scene. Why? He\u2019s a physical freak, and he\u2019s nervous about revealing himself so early. Read too many comics ;).\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know about the *fatality* until weeks later when it\u2019s revealed to him. Now he decides to turn himself in, even though the authorities are unaware of him (the truck driver was blamed, even though he swears a motorcyclist caused him to wreck). The protag, remorseful, does turn himself in, although he mentions nothing of his abilities, the super powers that is. Just a clear\\-cut case, he lost control of his bike, the wreck and fatality occurred. He miraculously escaped injury, he claims, and panicked (which I doubt the investigators would buy), not noticing the crushed car across the street.\n\n**First question:** what would he be charged with, since I assume he caused the wreck and he did leave the scene? Maybe involuntary manslaughter?\n\n**Next question:** if found guilty, could he face incarceration? I should add he has *no* record.\n\nWorking toward my next question; during the wait for trial an alphabet agency in DC discovers (long story) that this guy is a freak, a superhuman of *unknown* abilities.

Broad brush, the elements tend to be:\n\n1. Someone was killed as a result of act by the defendant.\n2. The act either was inherently dangerous to others or done with reckless disregard for human life.\n3. The defendant knew or should have known his or her conduct was a threat to the lives of others.\n\nHowever, you're really backwards planning from a jail vs. army decision, so you might actually be after something like **felony hit and run**, which can most certainly result in incarceration. The elements of felony hit and run generally include leaving the scene of an accident regardless of fault (hit and run typically becomes a felony when someone was injured in the accident). Since the elements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it makes sense to look them up wherever the accident will take place in the book. If it takes place in the U.S. [this](http://traffic.findlaw.com/traffic-tickets/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-hit-and-run-state-laws.html) is a state\\-by\\-state compendium.\n\nThen you can tweak the story to satisfy the applicable elements and induce the jail vs. army decision (even if army policy prohibits it, it's still pretty common fiction!).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario described, which of the following charges is the protagonist MOST likely to face for his actions?\n\nA) Voluntary manslaughter\nB) Felony hit and run\nC) Reckless endangerment\nD) Vehicular homicide\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) Voluntary manslaughter typically involves an intentional killing committed in the \"heat of passion\" or under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally disturbed.

It also doesn't specifically address leaving the scene, which is a key element of the protagonist's actions.\n\nD) Vehicular homicide generally requires proving that the defendant's driving was reckless or negligent enough to cause death.

By the plain text of the First Amendment, it protects libel.\n\n---\n\nAside: Yes, the First Amendment does apply to libel cases. A libel case, like all lawsuits, involves the government's judicial branch using its coercive power to make you pay money as a result of your speech, based on a law requiring you to pay money for certain kinds of speech. Tort law is not optional; a libel case isn't \"you promised not to say bad things and then said bad things,\" it's the government saying \"what you did is bad, now pay the person you hurt because of your speech.\" \n\nThe idea that \"you can say it, you just have to face the consequences\" isn't enough and hasn't been for quite a while now. Traditionally, the main point of freedom of speech was that a court couldn't stop you from saying something, but could only seek to punish you after the fact (and for that you get a jury, a public hearing, etc.) But more recently, courts realized that subsequent punishment had similar effects to prior restraint. If you're going to be punished for some kind of speech, you're going to steer clear of saying anything a jury *might* think is that kind of speech.\n\nLibel law is *heavily* influenced by the First Amendment, and has been for over 40 years.\n\n---\n\nThe First Amendment looks like it protects libel, but it also looks like it should protect your right to reprint any book you want. It also looks like it should protect your right to tell someone \"go and murder this person.\" It also looks like it should protect your right to say whatever you want in court, whether or not it's true. It also looks like it should protect your right to falsely shout \"fire\" in a crowded hall, with the intent to cause a stampede (this isn't just a turn of phrase, there was an actual incident in which 73 people were killed which is believed to have started when someone falsely shouted that there was a fire). It also looks like it should protect your right to post a sign saying \"There is a bomb at this elementary school.\"\n\nYet the Constitution explicitly sanctions copyright, and no one would seriously conclude that Congress may not protect the integrity of the judicial process by punishing perjury. Ordering a hit, making bomb threats, intentionally causing panics \\-\\- the fact that speech is a key part of these can't mean that the government isn't allowed to criminalize them. You cannot run a civilized society in which death threats are legal.\n\nSo, the courts interpret. Language in the Constitution that appears absolute is understood to have implied exceptions. The people writing the document were well aware that perjury was generally a crime. The same Congress that proposed the First Amendment passed a law criminalizing perjury. Sure, you're punishing someone based on their speech, but it's clearly not *meant* to be protected. You can't run a court system without perjury laws, and its absence from the First Amendment doesn't mean that the First Amendment thereby upended this basic principle.\n\nThe courts have identified a number of kinds of speech that, by longstanding practice, are not protected. Intellectual property violations are one. Obscenity is another. So are threats. So is \"speech integral to criminal conduct\" (e.g. \"what'll it be, your money or your life?\") And so is defamation. The text of the First Amendment may not exclude it, but courts have uniformly held that it's not something the amendment was ever meant to protect. \n\nThe First Amendment does still pose constraints, which are some of the most defendant\\-friendly in the world (interestingly enough, US law is descended from English law, and English libel law used to be among the most plaintiff\\-friendly in the world). It's not libel if it's true. It's not libel if it's an opinion (unless it's a statement of fact dressed up as opinion). It's not libel unless you were at *least* negligent; if it was about a public figure, you have to have known it was false or seriously doubted its truth.

The property in question is currently an HMO for 8 occupants, which falls under the Sui Generis use class (7 or more occupants). The investor wants to convert it to a single-family dwelling, which is a C3 use class. According to the information provided, you always need planning permission to move in and out of the Sui Generis use class, regardless of location. Therefore, planning permission would be required for this conversion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it's a Permitted Development Right to move between C3 and C4 classes, this doesn't apply to Sui Generis.\nOption B is incorrect because Article 4 Directions typically affect conversions between C3 and C4 classes, not Sui Generis.\nOption D is incorrect because the need for planning permission in this case is not dependent on the property's location in a conservation area."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33879/are-there-anything-misleading-about-this-ads", "docs_id": 33879, "title": "Are there anything misleading about this ads?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [https://skylinktvantenna.com/orderint\\-mod\\-sh/vsl1\\.php](https://skylinktvantenna.com/orderint-mod-sh/vsl1.php)\n\nI removed all tracking links\n\nThere is this statement that I believe is fraudulent\n\n> But how can you watch all this for free?

You don't state the jurisdiction, and your question implies that you are somewhere other than the US, so there's really not much we can do to say what laws there are in your jurisdiction. As far as the fraud issue, suppose we assume for the sake of argument that the claim is false. Assuming that your jurisdiction defines \"fraud\" in manner similar to how the US defines it:\n\n> In the United States, common law generally identifies nine elements needed to establish fraud: (1\\) a representation of fact; (2\\) its falsity; (3\\) its materiality; (4\\) the representer\u2019s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5\\) the representer\u2019s intent that it should be acted upon by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6\\) the injured party\u2019s ignorance of its falsity; (7\\) the injured party\u2019s reliance on its truth; (8\\) the injured party\u2019s right to rely thereon; and (9\\) the injured party\u2019s consequent and proximate injury.\n\n[https://www.mitchell\\-attorneys.com/common\\-law\\-fraud](https://www.mitchell-attorneys.com/common-law-fraud)\n\nYou seem to be presenting \"The law requires broadcast of the content\" as (1\\). So we need this to be false (2\\); again, I don't know what your country or its laws are, but for the sake of argument, let's assume that the claim is false. The third condition is its materiality. This means that it must actually be relevant. This would be difficult to prove. Does it really matter whether it's true? Does its falsity affect the value of the product being offered? Similarly, for (5\\) and (7\\), in what way would buyers being \"acting\" or \"relying\" on this claim? How would a decision whether to purchase something depend on the claim? And there is (9\\): you would have to show that you actually suffered as a result of the claim being false. \n\nI suppose that if there's a show that you want to watch, and you, when you bought the antennae, were expecting be able to watch it using the antennae, but it turned out that you weren't able to, then you would have a case. You would have to show that your belief that you would be able to watch it was caused by the defendant's claim, that your belief was a reasonable inference from that claim, that the defendant intended you to believe that, and that you have damages from not being able to watch the show.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company is selling TV antennas with the claim that a secret law requires cable companies to broadcast their content for free over the air.

However, actions taken by the user \\- such as creating an account, accepting the Terms, contributing content \\- are likely to affirm this view.\n\n### Does changing the logo imply that the site/organisation supports a particular political view?\n\nAgain, it is likely, not definite, that changing the logo will imply that the site/organisation supports a particular political view.\n\nDoes changing the logo impute support of a political view to the user?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this case, however, it is ***highly unlikely*** that the change of logo would impute to the user support of the political view.\n\nIn a case such as this, onus of proof is on the plaintiff \\- were this claim brought in court, it would need to be proven on the balance of probability (or, less likely, on the preponderance of evidence) that a reasonable person would impute support of the marriage equality (and perhaps some other) agenda to the user. *Reasonable* person does not mean any *particular* person, nor does it mean, *all* people.\n\nPart of the imputation must come from the purpose that the user subscribes to the site. Perhaps if StackOverflow were a site that promoted marriage equality or judicial activism, this could support an opinion that the user supports this view. However, StackOverflow is about programming, and programming doesn't imply that kind of agenda. Perhaps if the icon had been changed to something that suggested support for object\\-oriented programming, the icon *could* be taken to suggest that the user supports this agenda. Neither does the user's content suggest support for this cause \\- if they constantly made off\\-hand remarks about it in their posts, then perhaps, again, a reasonable person may make that imputation.\n\nIn any case, the damages awarded to the user would likely be compensatory rather than punitive \\- the user would need to therefore demonstrate actual suffering or loss as a result of the change of icon. If there were actual damages or loss, the way in which the user contributed to them \\- perhaps by posting a thread that would be likely to be inflammatory and attract attention to the user \\- may reduce an award of damages. In the case of no actual suffering or loss, the user could be awarded nominal damages.\n\nInjunctions that could be awarded would need to be proportionate to the breach of license \\- the court could require references to this user to be anonymised. This is easily done. It is unlikely that the court would require all contribution by the user to be removed \\- this is unlikely to pass a public interest test.\n\nIn relation to placing a disclaimer in the footer, US courts have generally accepted disclaimers if they are positioned such that a reasonable user is likely to see it... In the footer? It's not a great place, and easily missed. It could be better than nothing, though, and may help with the likelihood of someone imputing such opinions to a user. \n\n---\n\nEssentially \\- it's extremely unlikely that a reasonable person would impute support of the marriage equality agenda on a user based on a logo change, because the support is not sufficiently connected to the primary purpose of the site, or the user's activities on the site.\n\nEven ***if*** the user were successful in showing that this is the likely conclusion of a reasonable person, the remedies available to them would be limited to damages (which limited to actual losses, including suffering), and an injunction (which is likely to be anonymisation).\n\nA disclaimer may not, on its own, actually preserve the validity of the license, but it may be useful on determining the likelihood of a reasonable person imputing opinions to a user. \n\n---\n\n1\\.

While the Geneva Conventions prohibit attacking those who have clearly communicated an intent to surrender, the previous act of perfidy by another unit from the same brigade complicates matters. The law does not specify exactly how many instances of perfidy are required before a force loses the ability to \"clearly communicate\" an intention to surrender.

The insurer would then have the opportunity\nto claim profits on a timely schedule, while the insured could claim the collateral provided by the insurer, if the requirements both parties agreed upon were to be met.\nThe insurance contracts themselves would be initialized, maintained and eventually resolved through a series of transparent open sourced smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially little programs, that run on the blockchain. The can\nbe reviewed by anyone interested.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is it legally necessary to formally record such a relation between two (or more) private persons? With the crypto space currently being so very unregulated, are there even laws applicable to this matter?\n2. How difficult would it be for users of such a service to declare the income generated through anything related to the platform? Would this be regarded\nas a form of self\\-employment, would they have to register a company or any of the likes?\n3. Would the platform itself, being the service provider, have to be registered in any way? The main aim of the platform would of course be income generation.\n\n**Legal accountability:**\n\n1. Would we need to explicitly declare a disclaimer to prevent being sued if a user considers the rejection of their claim unjust?\nSince this is a peer\\-to\\-peer system, the platform itself will mostly be uninvolved in the decision process. Instead this will be the duty of an independant third party comprised of individual users.\n2. Could the platform be held accountable in case of lost user funds? Only if the platform were at fault? (as in, did the platform's source code cause the issue?)\n3. Can a strictly blockchain based platform even be sued? Only if it is legally registered?\n4.

Although crypto space may be little regulated, insurance is in most jurisdictions highly regulated. Any such arrangement would need to comply with current laws on insurance, until and unless modified laws to cover this sort of thing are passed, and then it would need to comply with those.\n2. Tax authorities generally allow one to declare \"other business income\" or \"other investment income\" without forming a legal entity. I cannot say how such income would be classified in any given jurisdiction.\n3. Whether the platform, or some legal entity associated with the platform, would need to be registered will depend on the current laws and regulations governing insurance, and on the way in which teh contracts are structured.\n4. A disclaimer cannot prevent one from being sued. The contracts would need to carefully and explicitly state who is liable for what.\n5. Programs cannot be held accountable for anything. Legal entities, including operators of programs, can be. If negligence in the creation or operation of a program causes a loss, the operator may well be liable.\n6.

Like witnesses, judges are human and subject to biases and external pressures, and it seems like it would be reasonable to assume that their jury instructions could reflect that.\n\nViewing jury instructions this way I think would mean that it is part of the role of the jury to determine which parts of the jury instructions should be considered fact, and I think it would also mean that jury nullification wouldn't necessarily mean that a jury [returns \"a verdict of 'Not Guilty' despite its belief that the defendant is guilty of the violation charged\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/112); it could just mean that the jury doesn't accept all of the statements in the jury instructions, such as the judge's interpretation of the law, as fact.\n\nCould jury instructions reasonably be viewed as a kind of expert witness testimony? If not, what are the main problems with viewing them this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. There is a clear distinction between:\n\n* evidence (or testimony), which consists of statements of fact given by witnesses on oath (subject to prosecution for perjury), governed by the rules of evidence, and which the jury is required to consider but not accept (in the sense that a verdict which is not supported by the evidence can be set aside on appeal),\n* submissions, which consist of argument by the lawyers for the parties, which the jury is not required to consider or accept, and\n* directions, which consist of statements of law given by the judge, which the jury is required to accept.\n\nThe jury is required by its oath to follow the law as stated by the judge, even if it is wrong. The remedy for erroneous trial directions (an appeal) is different to the remedy for erroneous evidence (a perjury prosecution in the case of deliberate lies; nothing in the case of innocent errors).\n\nBecause the jury has the power, but not the right, to nullify a charge by disobeying the judge\u2019s directions, there is a sense in which the jury is free to reject the judge\u2019s directions just as it is free to reject evidence. However, this is completely inconsistent with the theory that defines the roles of judge and jury. There is no *legal* basis for viewing judicial directions as a kind of expert testimony.\n\n\u2018The power, but not the right\u2019\n------------------------------\n\nObie 2\\.0 asked about this phrase. It coems from the [Case of the Dean of St Asaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_of_the_Dean_of_St_Asaph), which is reported at *R v Shipley* (1784\\) [4 Doug 73](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hSdFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA73). The relevant passage is summarised in Lord Devlin's *[Trial by Jury](https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf)* (1956\\), at p 87:\n\n> **Jury\u2019s Power of Acquittal**\n> \n> \n> There may well be cases in which the killing is not in doubt and the formal direction not to return a verdict of manslaughter is therefore tantamount to a direction to return a verdict of Guilty. Still, if the direction is ignored, the court must, I think, accept the verdict. There is no way in which a verdict of acquittal can be nullified. As Lord Chief Justice Mansfield put it in 1784: \u201cIt is the duty of the judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in *their power* to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.\u201d Mr. Justice Willes said: \u201cI admit the jury have the *power* of finding a verdict against the law and so they have of finding a verdict against evidence, but I deny they have the *right* to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Justice of Australia held to similar effect in *Gammage v The Queen* (1969\\) [122 CLR 444](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/68.html?context=1;query=gammage;mask_path=), writing:\n\n> \\[The jury] have no right, in my opinion, to return a verdict of manslaughter where they are satisfied of murder. But, as I have said, persistence by them in returning another verdict must ultimately result in the acceptance of that verdict. In that sense, but in no other sense, it is both within their power and, if you will, their privilege to return a wrong verdict.\n\nTo answer Obie 2\\.0's question, the jury has the *power* to ignore the judge's directions, because \u2013 at least at the time Lord Devlin was writing in 1956 \u2013 a verdict of acquittal could not be nullified. However, the jury does not have the *right* to do so because the law requires it to follow the directions.\n\nAs Ed999 observes, the law governing jury trials does vary between jurisdictions. In particular, some jurisdictions (which lack the United States' constitutional [double jeopardy clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause)) now allow for a jury acquittal to be set aside on appeal. However, the fundamental distinction between a witness\u2019s evidence and a judge\u2019s directions was established in England centuries ago, and remains applicable throughout the common law world.\n\nIt is worth specifically mentioning the United States because [jury nullification remains a controversial topic in that jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification_in_the_United_States). However, the basic principle that the jury is legally required to follow the judge\u2019s directions was established in *[Sparf v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparf_v._United_States)*, [156 U.S. 51](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/156/51/case.html) (1895\\), and described by Ginsburg J (albeit in a dissenting judgment) as \u2018conclusive\u2019 in *[Honda Motor Co. v.

In this case, the transfers were not made by the bank itself but were the result of fraudulent intervention by a hacker. This fundamental difference likely negates the application of the discharge-for-value defense, even for innocent recipients.

The actual contract is formed at the point of sale when the customer offers to pay and the retailer accepts the payment. This means that retailers are not legally obligated to honor incorrectly displayed prices. The customer has the right to refuse the purchase when they become aware of the higher price at the register, but the shop is not breaking the law by charging a different price than what was advertised.

However, over recent months, Medium has become increasingly focused on their own partnerships and internal publications, to the point where it's hard to argue that there is not an ethical conflict of interest. My question is whether there's a legal conflict of interest.\n\n---\n\n**General Idea**\n\nTo put it into general terms, consider three parties, A, B, and C. Party A offers party B and C the opportunity to profit from an operation, where parties B and C are in competition with one another for a finite amount of revenue in a given month (the total available from subscription fees in this case). Further suppose that the operation relies on party C for success (it seems easy to argue that Medium would have trouble surviving if only their own content was on the platform), and that party A provides biased support to party B. Finally, B and C are paid by A, from the revenue generated by the operation, rather than B and C obtaining the revenue directly from the operation's customers.\n\nIn such a scenario, there seems to be both an ethical issue and potentially legal issue. However, I am not familiar with any specific civil statutes that may come into play. Does it appear that the above scenario might violate any specific statute? The one potential reason why Medium might be saved from a valid lawsuit is that an author does not have to pay for the service. However, they are providing support, in their aggregate, through the massive volume of writing that they provide to the platform, without very much chance of being able to actually generate revenue. Precedent from cases involving pyramid schemes may apply here.\n\n---\n\nMichael Seifert raised an interesting question: \"How would this be different from Publishing House A promoting a more profitable Author B instead of a less profitable Author C?\"\n\nThe difference is that the publishing house does not rely on C's work for sales. To continue this analogy, consider a situation where the publishing house put in a request for chapters for an anthology, where the majority of the chapters came from C, and a few came from B. Further suppose that the publishing house paid its authors based on how many sales the respective authors generated, but almost exclusively promoted author B's website that sold the anthology. Even though readers likely would not purchase the anthology, without the chapters provided by C, because of A's disproportionate support of B, C would receive very little of the revenue stream.\n\n---\n\nBlueDogRanch made a point that Medium's terms of services \"says nothing about being fair, or ethical.\" Agreed. Its terms of services say nothing, and therefore it does not say that they reserve the right to unfair, unequal, or unethical, biases. If the terms of service stated that Medium reserves the right to unequal promotion of work regardless of whether it reduces the potential revenue by other authors, then Medium would have a greater chance of winning in court, and greater justification for their actions. However, without such statements, it becomes less certain that one should assume that a content facilitator that provides revenue streams as part of a ***partner program*** would engage in actions that disproportionately shift revenue streams towards their own content. \n\n---\n\nA final point. It seems that in California, an individual must pass the \"ABC\" test, at least when it comes to wage orders. Specifically, Medium's authors do not pass B: *the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business*. It seems that, contrary to the suggestion that Medium's authors are subcontractors, they are, at least as far as California law is concerned, employees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> *Is Medium at risk of legal action?*\n\nThey are, in as much as anyone or any company is due to the nature of civil law, i.e. just about anyone can take anyone else to civil court. That is where \"legal conflicts of interest\" are worked out. But I'd assume that Medium's lawyers have covered the bases in terms of adhering to state and federal laws that govern their business, their business model of paying authors and changing their business model; and ensure that they have a strong terms of service document for the site, and that document is legally binding for Medium's users.\n\nNow, a disgruntled author could file against Medium, alleging fraud, uncompetitive practices, unfairness, conflicts of interest or anything else and attempt to recover damages for what they allege is a skewed payoff to authors or Medium's self\\-serving policies. That said, authors and Medium are bound by the [Medium Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f). The TOS says nothing about being fair, or ethical, and it clearly states that \n\n> By using Medium, you agree to these Terms. If you don\u2019t agree to any\n>  of the Terms, you can\u2019t use Medium. We can change these Terms at any\n>  time...

If not, what would be the procedure of doing a retrial or a new trial?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, a person is generally protected from being tried for the same offense twice, but they are not necessarily absolutely \"protected\". If a jury convicts a person but the judge enters a directed verdict of not guilty, the prosecution can appeal that action ([Wilson v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/332/), 420 U.S. 332\\). The reason is that the acquittal could be disposed of on appeal without subjecting the person to a second trial. In contrast, in [Fong Foo v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/369/141/), 369 U.S. 141 the trial judge ordered the jury to enter a verdict of acquittal. The appeals court rejected the judges basis for ordering an acquittal: but Fong Foo was \"protected\" because there could not be a second trial (double jeopardy), and it does not follow that the jury would have convicted but for the judge's order.\n\nThe question reduces to the limited circumstances under which the prosecution can appeal a verdict. For instance, the prosecution can appeal a tre\\-trial motion to dismiss, and since there was no trial, there is no second jeopardy. Within a single jurisdiction, the only circumstance allowing a second trial involves bribery of a judge (Aleman v. [Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/138/302/473725/), 138 F.3d 302\\), where the basis for allowing a second trial is that defendant was not in jeopardy with the first trial.\n\nNew evidence does not override a defendant's protection against a second trial, whether it is new DNA evidence or a confession.

Gonzales* holds that the police do not have a duty to enforce the law that may be enforced by a private party in a civil action. Police instead have broad discretion regarding whether they will or will not take action to enforce a law.\n\nBut, when a police officer does take action affirmatively, this case does not apply.

The station as a business and the DJ as an individual would have some legal exposure to \"out\" or reveal affairs on the air, so if the show is not a total act, all callers will have signed or agreed to verbal releases which state that all participants are recorded and the outcomes may be unpredictable, the station and the DJ are not liable, etc. One or two party consent for recording and broadcasting will be respected; if they weren't, the station would be sued out of existence.\n\nThe idea that they ask for consent on the air and act like that is required is simply more of the act. 99% of the listeners have no legal training, and the magic word \"consent\" makes the show sound more real and lawful. As above, there *could* be releases agreed to on the phone before the call is switch to broadcast, i.e. *\"do you agree to let us broadcast you and are you aware of this and any ramifications?\"* and that would be recorded by the station for their legal protection.

The requirement under that '34 Act is to disclose all material information about the company that a reasonable investor would be influenced by in making an investment decision. There are regulations and there is case law governing what does and does not have to be disclosed, but there is still a great deal of discretion in deciding what to include.\n\nBut if your company fails to disclose information under the '34 Act and an investor sues the company for failing to disclose it, and a judge and jury handling the case determine in the court process that the information had to be disclosed under this vague standard and that someone was harmed economically as a result of the non\\-disclosure, then the company (and often people affiliated with the company) have liability to the people who the court finds were harmed by the non\\-disclosure for securities fraud and that liability cannot be discharged in bankruptcy in most cases (and is also eligible for special treatment in the debt collection process to enforce the judgment).\n\n**Application**\n\n> If I run a publicly traded company that's releasing hardware and that\n> hardware is compromised and customer data is harvested, do I have to\n> publicize that leak's existence?\n\nYou do if it is of a magnitude covered by state law, or if the existence of the leak would be material to an investor in the company's securities (either stock or bonds).\n\n> What if the people that found that data are presumed to be trustworthy\n> and are willing to destroy the data upon payment?\n\nThis depends on the language of an individual state disclosure law at the state level. At the federal level, the question is whether the event is material. A variety of factors could influence that conclusion. One is the amount of the payment. Another is the extent that it indicates a problem that is likely to recur, or reflects deeper management problems in the company's IT systems.\n\n> Does that material breach have to be announced?\n\nIf the breach is material, it has to be announced. The timing of the required '34 Act disclosures is a rather arcane matter best left to specialists.\n\n> Note, this is about the Ubiquiti breach which is described as\n> \"catastrophic\".

The documentation indicates that there are two levels of regulation involved in data breach disclosures. First, all fifty states have laws requiring notifications of data breaches, which may apply depending on the specific state's requirements. Second, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, publicly traded companies must disclose all material information that a reasonable investor would be influenced by in making an investment decision. The materiality of the breach would depend on various factors, including the extent of the breach, the amount paid to the hackers, and whether it indicates ongoing security issues. Therefore, the company would be required to disclose the breach if either the state law mandates it OR if the breach is considered material under federal securities law.

In the lease provisions, I added that I wanted him to clear out the back room in August 2018 (signed in May) as well as remove a mounted bed frame that seemed to have been rotted away. He agreed and flew in from his country and took some (albeit not all, and left a lot more of the larger stuff like chairs and couches) and the bed frame still stands.\n\nMy rent has the utilities included, however he added an amendment that he wanted me to take on payment for gas in September. I didn't turn the gas on until November, since the neighbors upstairs and I (shared house) were fine with toughing it out for as long as needed. I have yet to receive any gas bill from the landlord, or any other word on this agreement. In my own fault, I also never brought it up.\n\nHe still has not brought it up, but he also never fulfilled his provisions. The rent was managed by a leasing agent nearby, however I pay rent to the LL directly.

Also, will his failing to follow through on his provisions, effectively cancel out my need to follow through on mine?\n\nI know since I didn't reach out about the bills, I most likely don't have moral high ground.

The tenant agreed to an amendment to pay for gas starting in September, which creates a contractual obligation. However, since the gas wasn't turned on until November, it's reasonable to expect the tenant would only be responsible for payments from that point forward. The landlord's failure to fully clear out the back room doesn't automatically cancel the tenant's obligations, but it might provide some leverage in negotiations. The landlord can still request payment for the months since the gas was turned on, even if they haven't sent a bill yet, as long as it's within the statute of limitations (which is typically several years for contract disputes)."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51447/are-u-s-government-agencies-required-to-disclose-whether-or-not-they-record-con", "docs_id": 51447, "title": "Are U.S. government agencies required to disclose whether or not they record conversations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say I'm inside a U.S. government building, which houses a government agency, and I'm speaking with an employee (or agent) of that government agency.\n\nIf I directly ask them whether they are recording our conversation, and I ask them whether such recordings contain video, audio, or both ... are they legally required to tell me whether they are recording?\n\nWould this be regulated by federal law, or state law?\n\nIt is my understanding that all recordings, including surveillance recordings, obtained by the government on public property (e.g. government property) are public records, unless the government can provide a good reason why publishing such records would pose a credible threat to public safety and security, etc.\n\nTherefore, if you ask the government for a recording of a conversation you participated in, the government is generally required to provide a copy of the recording to you.\n\nHowever, could government agencies realistically try to get around this requirement, by refusing to tell people what types of recordings they have or don't have?\n\nAfter all, if you can't ***prove*** the government actually possesses a particular recording, you can't hold the government accountable for meeting this requirement.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a matter of state law so long as the agent consents to the recording. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2\\)(d) permits recording so long as at least one party to a conversation gives consent.

According to USCIS guidelines, an applicant must \"Show that you have lived for at least 3 months in the state or USCIS district where you apply.\" John moved to Texas on January 1, 2023, so he needs to wait 3 months from that date before he can reapply. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it's the date of his first (denied) application. \nOption B is correct because it's exactly 3 months after John's move to Texas (January 1 + 3 months = April 1).\nOption C is incorrect because it's 3 months after the denied application, not after the move.\nOption D is incorrect because it's a full year after the move, which is much longer than necessary.\n\nThis question requires careful attention to dates and understanding of the specific 3-month residency requirement, making it challenging for test-takers."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21204/instagram-api-platform-policy", "docs_id": 21204, "title": "instagram API platform policy", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just came across this:\n\n> You cannot use \"insta\", \"gram\" or \"Instagram\" in your company or\n>  product name.\n\non the instagram API platform policy, \n<https://www.instagram.com/developer/>\n\nI am wondering: how can they do that? how can they forbid one from using such general terms (i am referring to gram and insta) in a product or company? \nIt is logic to think that they would reject an application that is called in this way and uses their API but the statement seems to be more generic..\n\nupdate: I don't have an instagram app or else in the works, i just want to understand how it works\n\nupdate2: there is no sign of that statement in the [full platform policy](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fairly easily.

The most plausible alternative would be to force an involuntary bankruptcy, but this is not cost effective for you given the small amount still owed. You could join a class action in most circumstances even though you are not a U.S. citizen, but it would not be cost effective for you to make any effort to start one.\n\nYour best bet to get some money would be to call the debtor personally, to ask him to send you the $230, and to explain that the debt collection agency is now defunct.

Rather it defines what is protected by copyright, and specifies some cases in whch a work is not protected. (For nexample, [17 USC 105](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105) provides tht works of the US Federal Government are not protected.) Anything not included in the protection of copyright is in the public domain. This has been confirmed by many cour cases and legal writings. Law generally follows the rule \"Anything not forbidden is allowed.\"\n\n#### Audio as Derivitive Work\n\nAn audio recording of a person reading a text aloud would be a derivative work of that text, and would normally have its own copyright, if created lawfully. (If the recording was of a text protected by copyright, made without permission and outside of fair use, it was not made lawfully and the infringer has no copyright in the recording at all.) But US courts have held that a work created by a mechanical or automatic process, including many computer programs, is not an \"original work of authorship\" and thus is not protected by copyright at all, and is thus in the Public Domain. The case of the \"Monkey Selfie\" is on point. ([\"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, \u00a7 313\\.2\" (PDF)](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf). United States Copyright Office. 22 December 2014\\. p. 22\\. \"To qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being.... Works that do not satisfy this requirement are not copyrightable. The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.\"\n\nMoreover, if the audio were protected by copyright, it would presumably be owned by the person who ran the program, and [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) specifically grants the copyright owner permission to distribute copies.\n\n### Sources\n\n* The [Wikipedia article \"Public Domain\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) reads in relevant part (citations omitted):\n\n> The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. Those rights may have expired,\\[1] been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country\\-by\\-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public\\-domain status for a work in that country.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law. According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property. However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair\\-use rights and limitation on ownership\n\n\\*[\"How Can I Use Copyright\\-Free Works (in the Public Domain)?\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/works-public-domain-permission-29523.html) by Nolo Press reads:\n\n> Copyright law gives creators certain exclusive rights.

Rather, it provides copyright holders with protections for a limited duration.

Anyone can use a public domain work without obtaining permission, but no one can ever own it.\n> \n> \n> An important caveat regarding public domain material is that collections, new editions, and derivative works of public domain material may all be protected by copyright. With collections, an author could collect public domain works in a book or display them on a website, and the collection as a whole could be protected by copyright, even though individual works within it are not.\n\n\\*[\"Welcome to the Public Domain\"](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/) (Stanford libraries) reads in relevant part:\n\n> The term \u201cpublic domain\u201d refers to creative materials that are not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, trademark, or patent laws.

According to the provided information:\n\n1. For CRT small claims (which John's $3,000 claim would be), the order can be filed in the Provincial Court, not the Supreme Court.\n\n2.

A user posted a video that is a copyright infringement. Can the copyright owner sue the website owner for this?\nI have read [DMCA Safe Harbor](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/14) about this:\n\n> In order to qualify for safe harbor protection, a service provider who hosts content must: \\- have no knowledge of, **or financial benefit from**,\n\nIf the website owner gets a subscription fee from users, does Safe Harbor qualify then? How about services like YouTube(they have income from ads from posted videos)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're talking about sites *like Youtube*, so I'll focus on that.\n\nThat quote, which you bolded, was over\\-simplified. The actual law is\n\n> **17 USC 512 (c) Information Residing on Systems or Networks At Direction of Users.**\n> \n> \n> **(1\\) In general.** A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider\n> \n> \n> **(A)**  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(I)** does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(ii)** in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or  \n> \n> \\-\\- **(iii)** upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;  \n> \n> **(B)** does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and  \n> \n> (C says and complies with a DMCA takedown notice).\n\nWhat you're talking about is membership fees (e.g. [Youtube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium))... or general advertisements that would be placed on **any** video without awareness of it being infringing.\n\nThat does not violate Safe Harbor *per se*. At least not on a legitimate site which is dominated by legitimate content and makes an honest, credible effort to keep it that way.\n\nThe important clause in (B) is \"In a case...\" Under (B), they lack the *ability* to control each activity (upload or view).\n\nYoutube's inability is due to receiving 500 hours (30,000 minutes) of uploaded video *every minute*, obviously requiring 30,000\\+\\+ staff seats working 24x7 to curate. That would amount to about 200,000 staff \\- all of Google is around 50,000 right now.\n\nEven if a small site were able to moderate all content, they might still have a Safe Harbor defense if they could credibly say that they did not know the material was infringing. If someone created a \"Juan Brown\" username and uploaded blancolirio's videos from YouTube, they could say \"we did not know that was not the real person\". *But if the video started with an HBO splash screen and tones, then heck no.*\n\nBut non\\-moderation is not an airtight defense. When sites are neglectful toward removal, they can soon develop a reputation as a haven for such infringing content \\- which the sites tend to embrace, since it brings many customers! This was the undoing of several music sharing sites in the 00's, since this awareness of their reputation, plus a lack of diligent removal, failed them on all three arms of 1(A) above.\n\n---\n\nRemember that a competently run website that relies on user submissions is well aware of the DMCA and its case law, and has tailored its rules and enforcement to make it easy to defend a copyright claim. For instance, in the case of music, Youtube uses some human intervention but largely automated means to either\n\n* take it down and give the uploader a copyright \"strike\" leading to a ban (which alienates their biggest contributors, especially when a popular Youtuber like blancolirio winds up with a distant car stereo in background noise, remember the detection is by \"bot\" and no human ever sanity\\-checks it).\n* de\\-monetize the suspect video (uploader gets nothing, but, neither does YouTube).\n* monetize it, but give the revenue stream to the rights holder due to an agreement with them.\n\nThe last one is Youtube's preference with regards to music. As this was vastly easier, more practical and better for the community all\\-around, allowing whole classes of content to be created that would be *prima\\-facie* illegal otherwise.

The site employs automated content recognition systems but doesn't manually review all uploads. If a user uploads copyrighted material without permission, under what circumstances might the website still qualify for DMCA Safe Harbor protection?\n\nA) The website will automatically lose Safe Harbor protection because it receives financial benefit from subscription fees.\n\nB) The website will maintain Safe Harbor protection only if it immediately removes all user-uploaded content upon receiving any copyright complaint.\n\nC) The website can maintain Safe Harbor protection if it doesn't have actual knowledge of infringement, acts expeditiously to remove infringing content when notified, and the subscription fee isn't directly attributable to infringing activity.\n\nD) The website cannot claim Safe Harbor protection because it has the ability to control user uploads through its automated systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the DMCA Safe Harbor provisions, a service provider can maintain protection even if it receives general financial benefits (like subscription fees) as long as it meets certain criteria. These include not having actual knowledge of infringement, not being aware of facts from which infringement is apparent, acting expeditiously to remove infringing content when notified, and not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity in cases where the provider has the right and ability to control such activity. \n\nOption A is incorrect because receiving general financial benefits doesn't automatically disqualify a site from Safe Harbor protection. Option B is too extreme; the law doesn't require immediate removal of all content upon any complaint. Option D is incorrect because the mere presence of automated systems doesn't negate Safe Harbor protection if the volume of uploads makes individual review impractical."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55529/ex-misuses-my-email-for-his-utility-account-can-i-change-it-myself", "docs_id": 55529, "title": "Ex misuses my email for his utility account.

You have no obligation to continue using an email account that causes problems for you. Simply abandoning the account is not the wisest choice, since there is some chance that someone may gain access to the account and they do bad things with it. You are not liable for things that others do with your email, but it may be a nuisance to establish that it was someone else who used your account to do bad things. It is possible that, under the terms of service associated with that account, you are not allowed to \"share\" the account.\n\nYour comments contrarily suggests that you want to change the email associated with that electric service account, despite the fact that the company refuses to do it for you, which is also a standard refusal. If so, the alternative question seems to be, can you legally log into that account (assuming that you know the password to the electric account), and change the email address to something else. This would almost certainly be a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, because you are not authorized to access that account \u2013 it's not your account, despite your email address being associated with it. But because it's not your account, you are not responsible for anything arising from his use of your email, and any negative consequences of not keeping the email address up to date fall on him, not you.\n\nA third possibility is that you are actually at least partially responsible for the account, which seems to have been created years ago when you were living together. That is, it was and is his and your account, therefore you *are* authorized to access the account and change the email address.

This is because licenses are contracts, and contracts only have as much force as the law provides for.\n\nAs [previously mentioned](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/7835/3209) on this site, Creative Commons acknowledges that even a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (the least restrictive CC licence) cannot necessarily revoke all of an author's rights, particularly moral rights. \n\nIn France, [moral rights](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=131517FC37031E1B642057DA59DE084D.tpdila12v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006161636&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&dateTexte=20161027) include a *droit de retrait*.

The \"droit de retrait\" is a moral right recognized in French Intellectual Property law, which allows authors to withdraw their work from circulation. However, this right is difficult to invoke and comes with conditions.\n\nWhile the CC license's irrevocability clause would be invalidated by the \"droit de retrait,\" it doesn't mean the entire license becomes void. French law recognizes the author's right to withdraw their work, but also protects those who have relied on the license. Therefore, the author can exercise their \"droit de retrait,\" but they would likely need to compensate those who have used the work under the terms of the CC license.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because French law does take precedence over CC licenses, and the \"droit de retrait\" does apply to literary works (though not to software).
