We can make some observations.\n\nFirst, the Unlicense is applied to software that's basically free for anyone to do anything with. It's basically making the software available, not warranting it for any particular purpose. If you sell software, it's presumably for a purpose, so there will likely be some sort of legal warranty or liability that can't be disclaimed in the license. This depends on where you are, which you don't tell us.\n\nSecond, if you're planning to make money, consulting a lawyer is a worthwhile investment.

The documentation emphasizes that for a commercial project, especially one in a specific jurisdiction (Poland), consulting with a lawyer is the most prudent course of action. This is because:\n\n1. The Unlicense is designed for software that's free for anyone to use, which doesn't align with the developer's intent to profit from the project.\n2. Open-source licenses typically grant permissions that the developer wants to avoid.\n3. There may be legal warranties or liabilities in Poland that cannot be disclaimed simply through a license statement.\n4.

This involves disclosing recipients of this data per Art 13(1\\)(e), and only engaging data processors in line with Art 28\\.\n\nYour storage provider such as Azure and AWS cannot decrypt this data, so it would not be personal data if processed by them for their own purposes. There is an argument that they did not receive personal data, especially considering the definition of a recipient in Art 4: a person/entity \u201cto which the personal data are disclosed\u201d.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily relevant when talking about sub\\-processors. A processor is anyone who \u201cprocesses personal data on behalf of the controller\u201d. As processors, they're not using the data for their own purposes but are just acting on your behalf. Storage is a kind processing, and they are storing data on your behalf. This data is personal data for you. Thus, I'd consider the storage providers to be your processors.\n\nDue to your use of strong client\\-side encryption, your remaining compliance obligations are mostly boilerplate (signing a data processing agreement per Art 28, sorting out international transfers if necessary, and getting agreement for adding a sub\\-processor from your controllers). Note that encryption is mandatory whenever appropriate (Art 32(1\\)(a)).\n\nSuch client\\-side encryption could even serve as a legal basis for storing the data in jurisdictions that don't offer an adequate level of data protection, such as a data center in the US.

In the US, [copyright in unpublished works](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) lasts for the life of the creator \\+ 70 years. After that, they pass into the public domain. This means that if the composer/arranger died before 1919, then the works passed into the public domain before the formal publication in 1989, and they are still in the public domain now. However, if the creator died after 1919, then their 1989 publication effectively \"resets the clock\" on the copyright, and they will not come into the public domain until (according to the above link) 70 years after the death of the creator or 2048, whichever comes later.\n\nWhat doesn't matter is that the original symphonic works were in the public domain. Even if the *1812 Overture* is in the public domain, I could write an arrangement of it for accordion quintet and I would have the exclusive right to publish it and profit from that arrangement for the standard term. In your case, if the work really is a straight transcription, it *might* not have a copyright; but if the work required some amount of creativity and artistic decision\\-making (which a piano transcription of a symphony certainly would) then the arrangement gets its own copyright when it's published.\n\n### Can I make transcriptions of them if I don't publish them?\n\nProbably, but you should really consult your librarians. It's entirely possible that your proposed copying would fall under \"fair use\"; it would be for scholarship \\& research and you're not planning to include the transcriptions in your final published work. On the other hand, you're talking about effectively copying a substantial portion of a creative work that is still in print, which argues against fair use.

If the composer died after 1919, the 1989 publication would have established a new copyright, lasting for 70 years after the composer's death or until 2048, whichever is later. \n\nOption A is incorrect because arrangements of public domain works can have their own copyright. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of the composer dying before 1919. Option D is incorrect because if the works are still under copyright, the researcher would need permission or to rely on fair use doctrine for their study, and publishing transcriptions would likely infringe copyright."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93780/getting-an-ein-number-for-a-trust-and-section-645", "docs_id": 93780, "title": "Getting an EIN number for a Trust and Section 645", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A person dies with a revocable trust that becomes irrevocable after the person's death.

However, I plan on continuing to develop them on my own time as I work at a company. They are software related.\n\nFirst, the first two highlighted parts seem to contradict each other. The first says whether or not during working hours, the second says it's fine if it's on my own time. Wondering if this is a problem for the contract. Also wondering how valid those statements actually are.\n\nSecond, they like most other companies want me to list my prior inventions. But I've asked this before to a lawyer and they said I can't simply list a title of a project such as \"Photoshop\\-like image editor\", I have to actually go into detail and describe it. And not just a few sentences, but paragraphs of detail. Not so much detail as to be like a patent in its thoroughness, but more detail than a few paragraphs PER INVENTION. But this is a security leak as I don't want to disclose my inventions even if they are simple, it's a matter of privacy. So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation.\n\nAnd last thing is, let's say this company, a software company, is in the field of Sales and Marketing. This means they have a robust application or suite of applications, practices, and tools like CRMs, machine learning stuff, APIs, etc. They also use lots of open source programming tools. Meanwhile, let's say my inventions are in the field of Programming Tools and Application tools. It's not *directly* related to Sales and Marketing, but it's related pretty closely to CRMs and machine learning tools, and APIs. It's not related to their specific APIs, but it's related to APIs let's say. The question is how the line is drawn on what is considered competitive inventions. If I were to invent a new machine learning algorithm while working as a marketer or sales person at a software company, if that is considered competitive and prohibited by the contract.\n\nOh, and \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is very vague. The company could be interested in literally anything these days.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> the first two highlighted parts seem to contradict each other.\n\nNo, in this case they do not. The first highlighted portion refers to works or items produced \"*for or under the direction of the Company*\", whereas the second highlight refers to your creations that satisfy conditions (a) and (b).\n\nWhere contradictions actually exist, the doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) entitles you (the non\\-draftsman of the contract) to adopt the portion or reasonable interpretation that favors your legal position.\n\n> Also wondering how valid those statements actually are\n\nThey are valid and become enforceable as soon as you sign the contract or your subsequent conduct reflects your acceptance thereof.\n\n> it's a matter of privacy. So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation\n\nThe reality is that you are asked to sign a contract that is abusive and ridiculous. \n\nOne vulnerability from describing your inventions (presumably in Appendix A) is that the employer gets \"irrevocable, worldwide, etc\" rights on them as soon as you \"*use or disclose any \\[items listed in Appendix A] when acting within the scope of \\[your] employment*\". This means that if instead of reinventing the wheel you share or apply any portion of your prior creations so as to enhance your productivity, you *knowingly* and *irreversibly* grant to the employer perpetual rights to those items.\n\nLegal disputes regarding APIs can become extremely intricate. And, since judges usually have no decent background on IT, even those few judges with integrity are unlikely to grasp the key subtleties that would lead to a correct ruling.\n\n> \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is very vague. The company could be interested in literally anything these days.\n\nClauses which are too vague or excessively wide\\-encompassing are *supposedly* stricken as unconscionable, unenforceable, etc. However, I personally would foreclose upfront the risk of judicial hassle and decline the abusive contract.\n\nLegal issues aside, keep in mind that you are *offering* your *expertise* (in terms of supply \\& demand, you are on the *supply* side). This fact has a less derogatory connotation than \"asking for a job\".

The only somewhat relevant case is [Busby v. State](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=16410084149983965777&q=\"Convention+on+Road+Traffic\"&hl=en&as_sdt=ffffffffffffe04) in which the court rules that one cannot drive in Alaska with an IDP after having been previously restricted from driving in Alaska. The court does stress out that:\n\n> **The Convention does forbid a signatory country (or subsidiary state) from imposing or enforcing license revocations in a manner that discriminates against residents of other signatory countries.** But Busby does not claim that he was the victim of such discrimination. Busby's license was revoked for conduct that would have led to license revocation if committed by an Alaska resident. (Indeed, Busby's license was revoked while he was an Alaska resident.) And Busby does not claim that he was singled out for prosecution because he was a resident of a foreign country\u2014i.e., that the State would not have charged him with the offense of driving with a revoked license if he had still been an Alaska resident.\n\nThis could possibly mean that the court believes that the Convention only applies to foreign residents, but its not spelled out specifically.\n* Searching for Canadian court cases [likewise doesn't turn up anything useful](https://www.canlii.org/en/#search/type=decision&text=%22convention%20on%20road%20traffic%22).

Here the court rules similar to the decision in Alaska in that having a foreign license does not allow one to circumvent locally imposed license restrictions.\n* Searching for UK case law [doesn't turn up any relevant court cases](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/lucy_search_1.cgi?sort=rank&method=boolean&highlight=1&datehigh=&mask_path=/eu/cases%20/ew/cases%20/ie/cases%20/nie/cases%20/scot/cases%20/uk/cases&datelow=&query=(%22Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic%22)).\n* Australian case law is [likewise mute on the subject](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?mask_path=&method=auto&query=%22convention+on+road+traffic%22).\n\nThere is also a relevant legal opinion by the Department of State quoted in the [Digest of United States practice in International Law, 2002](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/139638.pdf):\n\n> Reading these provisions as a whole, we believe that the State\n>  of Georgia, consistent with the CRT, \n> \n> \n> (1\\) must permit an alien to\n>  drive in Georgia using a foreign driver\u2019s license issued by a country\n>  party to the CRT only if the alien has been lawfully admitted to\n>  the United States; \n> \n> \n> (2\\) **must permit a lawfully admitted alien to drive\n>  in Georgia using a foreign driver\u2019s license of a CRT party only\n>  during the first year after the alien\u2019s admission**; and \n> \n> \n> (3\\) may, in\n>  accordance with Georgia\u2019s residency laws, require an alien resident\n>  in Georgia to obtain a Georgia driver\u2019s license as a condition for\n>  continued authorization to drive. By the same token, nothing in\n>  the CRT would prevent the State of Georgia from applying more\n>  liberal rules with respect to the driving privileges of aliens.\n\nIn [Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in the United States, 2014](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2303904) the author further analyses how the 1949 Geneva Convention is applicable within the United States. First, to settle the definition of \"international traffic\":\n\n> Nonetheless, the United States ultimately accepted that \u201cthe purpose\n>  of chapter II was to establish, in effect, an international code of minimum\n>  safety requirements. By indirection, the rules of the road set\n>  forth in the convention **would apply to the pattern of domestic as well\n>  as to international traffic**.\n\nThe author the meaning behind Article I of the Convention:\n\n> Article 1 states in part that no party \u201cshall be required to extend the benefit of the provisions of this Convention to any motor vehicle or trailer, or to any driver\n>  having remained within its territory for a continuous period exceeding\n>  one year.\u201d \n> \n> \n> This provision, on its face, indicates that the parties recognized\n>  that the treaty would benefit individuals. In no way does this\n>  recognition compel a conclusion that the Convention is self\\-executing,\n>  but **it does suggest that the treaty is of a type that the Senate might\n>  have understood to be directly enforceable.**\n\nAnd finally on the issue of whether or not the treaty is \"self\\-executing\":\n\n> For these reasons, it is likely that courts will continue to treat the Geneva Convention as self\\-executing. Nonetheless, a court might conclude\n>  that, with respect to section II\u2019s rules of the road, the governmental obligation is merely to \u201ctake appropriate measures\u201d\n>  and that such an obligation is too vague to be enforced judicially.\n\n---\n\nSo it seems absolutely clear that the Convention intended for participating countries to allow foreign drivers to drive abroad for up to one year. However international treaties [are not self\\-executing by default in Canada](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-making-power/), unlike the US:\n\n> Canada is bound by the terms of treaties that it enters into and breach thereof may give rise to international claims. However, in Canada treaties are not self\\-executing; they do not constitute part of the law of the land merely by virtue of their conclusion.\n\nSo even though British Columbia is violating the 1949 Geneva Convention one cannot directly rely on said international agreement to enforce their rights.

While the Convention clearly intends for foreign drivers to be allowed to drive for up to one year in signatory countries, its enforceability varies. The United States tends to treat the Convention as self-executing, but in Canada, international treaties are not self-executing by default. This means that even though British Columbia's law seems to violate the Convention, one cannot directly rely on the international agreement to enforce their rights in Canada. The lack of consistent court rulings across different countries on this specific issue further supports the idea that the Convention's application varies depending on how individual countries implement international treaties in their domestic law."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4874/what-is-the-justification-for-curfew-laws", "docs_id": 4874, "title": "What is the justification for curfew laws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It's Halloween, and some municipalities are creating curfew laws intended to prevent people under 18 from being in public during the late night hours, for example [South Brunswick, NJ](http://patch.com/new-jersey/woodbridge/south-brunswick-halloween-curfew-0).\n\nIt seems like this apparently common sort of ordinance could be considered unconstitutional on multiple grounds, in that it is restricting free movement as well as targeting only a specific demographic.\n\nHere is [the actual text of one such ordinance](http://www.wallpolice.org/halloween-curfew-ordinance).\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1.

Therefore, as of now, the law is valid unless and until it is challenged and overturned.\n\n> **2\\. What defenses could a government make if challenged?**\n\nIt depends on what grounds the law is challenged.\n\nYour question about *possible defenses* is highly dependent on the nature of any challenge \u2014 which you have not specified in your question. The U.S. Constitution, for example, prohibits laws respecting a number of things such as freedom of the press, speech, religion, peaceful assembly, bearing arms, etc. to list just a few of the most notable ones.\n\nBut your question does not assert the law in question violates any specific or particular prohibition against it. Although the question mentions \"*restricting free movement as well as targeting only a specific demographic*,\" it does not specify any part of any constitution that prohibits these things. Therefore, your question is unclear as to what might present a constitutional problem for the law. \n\nIt is also unclear which constitution you think might contain prohibitive language. Is it a federal constitutional issue that concerns you? Or is it a state constitutional matter? In either case, which issue specifically concerns you? Your question needs to address these specifics in order to analyze it and respond in a meaningful way.\n\nLook at it like this... just as it is impossible to prove a negative, so is it impossible for anyone to conclude with absolute certainty that any law is ***not unconstitutional*** because no one can predict with certainty every possible future challenge a law might face. There are just too many possibilities to (pre\\-emptively) exhaust them all with certainty. Also, no one can predict with certainty how any future court might rule on the future challenges (*which themselves* are unpredictable as previously argued). Therefore, one can only say I think the law ***is unconstitutional*** and here are my reasons. Then others can analyze the law and the reasons; then offer an opinion.\n\n> **Further, based on precedent, would they likely be successful?**\n\nSee above answer to question numbered 2\\.\n\n### Laws aren't required to be \"justified\" by the constitution.\n\n***Constitutional justification*** for a law is a meaningless phrase. There is no requirement for a law to be \"justified\" by any constitution other than that the legislature is empowered by the constitution to make laws. That's all the justification any law needs.

You would need a legal basis, and a lawyer. When you say that you don't have a contract, I assume you mean that you don't have a piece of signed paper, but you do have an agreement \u2013 which *is* a contract. As far as websites are concerned, there are only a few likely causes of legal action: copyright infringement, and non\\-payment for services.

If we assume that you and the client are operating in Iran, your copyright is protected, but Iran does not enforce other country's copyright laws (they are not signatories to the Berne Convention).\n\nIf the issue is that the client is not paying for services rendered, you can sue them. The civil code (in English) is [here](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/49997adb27.pdf). See article 219 ff. for the specifics, but basically you show the judge that there is an agreement, and that you were not paid. The client can then argue that you didn't actually do the job agreed to, or that you were paid.

Even without a formal written contract, the text and voice message exchanges can constitute evidence of an agreement between the designer and client, which is legally considered a contract. The documentation states that \"you do have an agreement \u2013 which *is* a contract.\" In cases of non-payment for services, the designer can sue the client. The messages can be presented to a judge as proof of the agreement. The civil code allows for such actions, where the designer would need to demonstrate the existence of an agreement and non-payment. Option A is incorrect because a verbal agreement can still be legally binding. Option B is too limited, as the designer can pursue payment for services, not just copyright claims.

You have to prove in an infringement action that one question was derived from the other question (e.g. by showing that the alleged infringer had the textbook allegedly copied and carried over typos into their edition).

In most U.S. states there is a two part test. One part is determined based upon the face of the document, the other is based upon extrinsic evidence.\n\n**Formal Requirements**\n\nTo be formally valid without a hearing unless an interested party requests one in most U.S. states on its face (i.e. to be a \"self\\-proving will\") a will must:\n\n* Be in writing.\n* Be signed by the person making the will who is at least eighteen years of age.\n* Be signed by at least two witnesses who do not have conflicts of interest, who are attesting that the person making the will was competent and that they saw him or her sign it.\n* The signatures of the witnesses must be notarized. If their statements are not notarized, usually at least one witness must testify in a hearing or with a later affidavit.\n* The language of the will must indicate an intent to make a binding disposition of property in the estate of the person making it when they die, and other rights related to their estate and their death.\n\nVarious exceptions to these requirements exist in most state (e.g. a \"holographic will\" is valid if it is in writing, indicates the necessary intent, is signed, and has its material provision substantially in the hand writing of the person writing it).\n\nSome states allow oral wills called \"nuncupative wills\" in very specific circumstances usually limited to soldiers or sailors in circumstances of actual battle or imminent mayhem likely to result in death, with the proper witnesses.\n\nA will is like a dollar bill, a copy is not as good as the original document. If the original document cannot be found it is presumed that the will was revoked by physical destruction of the will, in the absence of evidence to the contrary submitted at a hearing to a judge.\n\n**Extrinsic Requirements**\n\nAny interested party can contest a will that appears valid on its face under the standards describe above on several grounds.\n\nTwo of these relate to the condition of the person signing the will at the time it was signed. The notarized witness statements create a presumption that these two conditions were met. But, that presumption can be overcome with other evidence from witnesses and/or documents or other kinds of evidence. These conditions are:\n\n* The document was procured from the person making it with duress or undue influence, even if the person making it did have \"testamentary capacity.\"\n* The person making it lacked testamentary capacity which is also a two part test. The first part is that the person making it knows who their family and the \"natural objects of their bounty are\", knows in general terms what they own, and knows what a will is intended to do and is capable of understanding the general outlines of what it does. This basically rules out people with severe dementia. The second part is that if the person is not suffering from dementia but is suffering from hallucinations, that the hallucinations have not influenced the nature of the provisions contained in the will.\n\nIn practice, \"[undue influence](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/publications/bifocal/vol_35/issue_3_feb2014/defining_undue_influence/)\" is the predominant ground for contesting wills that are formally valid on their face because testamentary capacity is a very low standard.\n\nA will can also be contested on the grounds involving extrinsic evidence that:\n\n* A later validly executed document revoked the will, or\n* The document is a forgery.\n\nIf any of the issues related to extrinsic evidence are disputed, both the party contesting the will, and the party defending it, has a right to have that issue resolved in a jury trial, although often the right to a jury trial in a case like this is waived by the parties.\n\nThis is determined by making a reasonable inquiry before submitting the will and examining the physical document and the place where it was when it was discovered, closely. The inquiry should be very searching if the terms of the will are surprising, and can be fairly lax if the terms of the will are what was widely expected.\n\nThere is generally a notice given to all interested parties when a will is submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction to be given effect that contains a deadline to raise a contest along these lines. A will that is not submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction usually has no force or effect until that happen in most U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nPublic Policy\n=============\n\nEven if the will is valid in general, some terms of the will may be invalid as a matter of public policy, or modified by statue, in certain circumstances. These exceptions can usually be determined on the face of the document or with minimal additional information (although \"your mileage may vary\" and cases where, for example, the cause of death or date of death is uncertain can be difficult).\n\nFor example, the following limitations are common:\n\n* A term in a will conditioning a gift at death on marrying or not marrying a particular person is void in most, if not all, U.S. states.\n* Under certain circumstances a will is required to leave certain minimum amounts to a surviving spouse and/or minor dependent children.\n* If a will appears to omit a child of the person making it by accident, it is modified in particular ways mandated by statute.\n* Will provisions making gifts at death or giving responsibilities to someone who murdered the person who wrote the will are void.\n* Some states invalidate provisions in favor of an ex\\-spouse upon divorce, unless a post\\-divorce document reaffirms those inheritances.\n* Certain kinds of words are given defined statutory meanings unless the express language of a will says otherwise, such as \"by representation\", or \"if he survives me\", that are not necessarily intuitive or in line with every day use of language.\n\nIt is usually necessary to review the probate court and case law in the state where the decedent was domiciled at death to determine if these limitations apply, ideally with a probate or estate administration lawyer."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John, a 75-year-old widower with dementia, signed a will leaving his entire estate to his caregiver, Sarah.

While the will appears to meet formal requirements (written, signed, witnessed, notarized), there are several red flags that make it vulnerable to contest:\n\n1. Undue influence: The fact that John left everything to his caregiver, Sarah, could suggest undue influence, especially given his age and medical condition.\n\n2.

The \"distribution statement\" on US government documents has to do with sensitive information, not copyright. For instance, in the Department of Defense, a document with a graph of velocity vs. distance for a new bullet might be marked \"Distribution D \\- Critical Technology,\" meaning that the information shouldn't be given to anyone outside the DoD or a DoD contractor (the information might not be *classified*, but it's not something to go telling everyone about). A slide that talks about what the lab did that year and has a bullet point for \"Invented new, longer\\-ranged bullet\" might be marked \"Distribution A,\" meaning that there's no issue with telling everyone that the lab invented a new bullet with a longer range.\n\nAny work produced by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of their official duties is not protected under US copyright law. A work produced by someone else (like a contractor) likely is protected.

The Department of Energy has many contractor\\-operated labs, and it appears that the document you gave was written by a contractor, meaning that copyright would generically apply.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that this document in particular, or the image in particular, is copyrightable.

The distribution statement on U.S. government documents primarily relates to the sensitivity of information and its approved sharing, not copyright status. While works produced by federal employees as part of their official duties are not protected by U.S. copyright law, many government agencies work with contractors whose output may be copyrighted.

It's crucial to investigate the actual authorship and copyright status of the document before assuming it can be freely used, especially for commercial purposes.

There were expensive stereo components in plain sight, which raised a reasonable suspicion. But that reasonable suspicion did not justify a further search, which police nevertheless conducted: they turned the stereo to get the serial numbers. Having phoned in the numbers and learning that the items were stolen, they then had probable cause for a seizure. That cause was, however, obtained via an illegal search.\n\nSuppose that the serial numbers had been visible from the front: then because they would have been in plain view and since the police were there for a reasonable search related to the shooting, then could have legally seized the stereo, since no additional search was required.\n\nThere is no distinction between search and seizure w.r.t. 4th Amendment protection (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\"). Police could not confiscate the stereo without probable cause, nor could they confiscate cash, or any other thing, again, unless they had probable cause. And they could not search for evidence that would give them probable cause to take stuff.\n\nAs SCOTUS said, regarding searches versus seizures, \n\n> We have not elsewhere drawn a categorical distinction between the two\n>  insofar as concerns the degree of justification needed to establish\n>  the reasonableness of police action, and we see no reason for a\n>  distinction in the particular circumstances before us here."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Arizona v.

Hicks that moving the stereo equipment to view its serial numbers constituted a separate search beyond the scope of the original exigency that allowed entry. This action required probable cause, which the officers lacked. The Court did not distinguish between searches and seizures in terms of the degree of justification needed, emphasizing that both require probable cause under the Fourth Amendment.

I've leased this office for many years and currently don't have a lease. The owner of the building has decided to sell, and the new buyer has contacted me and asked me to sign a lease.\n\nThere is absolutely no benefit to me to signing a lease. Office space is plentiful locally, so the new owner needs me more than I need them. However, the buyer informed me today that if I don't sign a lease, the mortgage won't be approved. I don't want to be the guy who killed a real estate deal and end up with both the current owner and future owner mad at me. So the buyer proposed writing a contract \"on the side\" between us that releases me from the lease if I provide 90 days notice. The mortgage lender would be unaware of this contract.

A lease is a contract and, as such, is amenable to mutually agreed modifications.\n\n> my view is that's the buyer's problem, not mine. Am I correct on that?\n\nYes. The problematic scenario might be if you were planning to leave the building in the foreseeable future and the new buyer intentionally concealed that knowledge from the lender. That could be actionable as conspiracy with \\-\\-or abetting of\\-\\- the new buyer. Your description does not reflect any plans of yours to vacate the premises, though.\n\n> Would it be a legal, enforceable contract?\n\nYes. However, it is utmost important that the \"separate\" contract make it clear the superseding effect it has on the full contract that is presented to the lender.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that, when interpreting a contract, a court is supposed to restrict its review to the language of the contract only. Any external records are ignored unless they explicitly relate to the contract, or in situations where the language of the contract lacks guidance as to the controversy at issue.\n\nAlso, without proper reference to the official lease, the separate provision would look as a one\\-sided promise rather than an *exchange* of considerations (by definition, a contract is an exchange of considerations). Thus, you would be more vulnerable to the new buyer's eventual decision not to honor the provision. \n\nStrictly speaking, the separate contract with no references to the official lease could make it clear that your consideration was in the form of helping the new buyer in his mortgage process. However, for obvious reasons the new buyer will refuse to reflect that in the separate contract. Hence, your protection consists of ensuring that the relation between the official contract and the separate contract is explicit in the latter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant is asked to sign a lease to help a new building owner secure a mortgage, but the owner offers a separate contract allowing the tenant to terminate the lease with 90 days' notice.

R. Civ. P. 68\\) offer of judgment (OOJ). Thus far, nearly every jurisdiction's court of appeals has refused to construe these as being binding on the Plaintiff if the offer is denied, even if it offers complete remuneration, especially in a putative class action. The underlying reasons when applied to a certified class differ fairly substantially from an individual plaintiff or a non\\-certified class. However, there are some kinds of cases where a Rule 68 offer could *never* fully compensate (as with cases where subjective or non\\-substantive forms of damage have been requested).\n\nA Rule 68 offer is a cost\\-flipping mechanism, often used by defense attorneys when they are making what they believe is a fair offer (very rarely is the offer one that is equal to the Plaintiff's demand, which is why this issue rarely arises). If a defense attorney makes an offer of judgment, and then the Plaintiff doesn't accept the offer, they need to get a jury verdict in an amount greater than the offer, or the costs are flipped. So, typically, if there is no OOJ and the Plaintiff wins even a nominal judgment (it can be a dollar) the Defendant always has to pay their costs, which can be substantial. When a Rule 68 offer is made, it's a carefully calculated amount that the defendant thinks the plaintiff can't get in a jury verdict, even if they win, but it's typically less than the demand. \n\nThe reason a Rule 68 offer is **almost never** \"full compensation\" is that a Plaintiff's demand for settlement will typically be somewhere in the area of 3x the amount the Plaintiff's attorney estimates the case to be worth. The Plaintiff is informed of this by their lawyer, so they don't have unreasonable expectations. If you think about it, this makes sense from an *ability to negotiate* perspective, with the logic being that the Plaintiff wants to get as close to full value as they can, and the defense needs their client to think they've saved them from some huge judgement. If a plaintiff demanded only what the case was worth, it would have no chance of settling for true value, or if the case were to settle, the Defense lawyer wouldn't be able to move the Plaintiff down off their number in any substantial way. This way, the lawyers can play their game negotiating the case down to a fair value. Plaintiff gets what their case is worth and Defendant feels like their lawyer saved them from catastrophe. It's all illusion.\n\nThe First Circuit recently joined the Second, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits in holding that a Rule 68 offer made prior to class certification and rejected by Plaintiff does not moot the Plaintiff\u2019s claim. The Plaintiff, a private high school, brought the action against the corporate developer of a college\\-entrance exam, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and an analogous state statute related to unsolicited faxes it received. Prior to Plaintiff\u2019s deadline to move for class certification, the Defendant made an Offer Of Judgment, offering Plaintiff the amount it could receive under the two statutes for each fax. Plaintiff did not respond within 14 days, rendering the offer withdrawn under Rule 68, and instead moved for class certification. Defendant then moved to dismiss, arguing that the withdrawn offer rendered Plaintiff\u2019s claims moot and divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, holding that Plaintiff\u2019s claim was not moot, but certified the question of whether an unaccepted Rule 68 offer, made before certification, moots the entire action and deprives the court of jurisdiction.\n\nGenerally speaking, aside from very specific types of cases involving contracts, or specific types of statutory relief, a Plaintiff typically includes counts for things like NIED (negligent infliction of emotional distress), pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of future earning capacity \u2013 these are a few of the types of counts whereby there is no specific value a defendant could ever point to being \"fully satisfied\" \u2013 the reason being, a jury needs to determine the legitimate value of these claims unless the Plaintiff accepts a settlement award whereby he/she/it feels as if it's fully satisfied."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a putative class action lawsuit, the defendant makes a Rule 68 offer of judgment to the lead plaintiff before class certification, offering the maximum statutory damages.

The courts have recognized that even if the lead plaintiff is offered full individual compensation, the interests of the potential class members and the plaintiff's desire to represent the class keep the case active.

For each of those games he lists a snippet of the important moves (which is completely legal) and includes the name of both parties, i.e. the white player is \"Magnus Carlsen\", black player is \"Anish Giri\". Moreover, the event has been played in 2015 at the World Championship (details are fictional).\n\nIs such a publication copyrighted? The games are taken by any database, e.g. <https://www.chess.com/>, <https://database.chessbase.com/>, <https://www.chessgames.com/>, etc. If it is, why do these sites have millions of games (they surely haven't requested permission by each player)?\n\nTo be more precise, what parts of the chess game are copyrighted? Am I allowed to share a selection of different games, including details like names, date, place and so forth \\- all public knowledge?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This answer reflects US law; I don't know German law.\n\n> To be more precise, what parts of the chess game are copyrighted?\n\nThe parts which are *not* copyrighted are the facts of the individual games. These include the moves, the players involved, the venue, the clock times, draw offers, etc. Basically, anything found on the scoresheet.\n\nThe parts which *are* copyrighted are the parts the author actually, well, authored. Commentary and analysis, for example. A discussion of the \"important\" moves of the game would certainly qualify.\n\n> Am I allowed to share a selection of different games, including details like names, date, place and so forth \\- all public knowledge?\n\nSingle games, yes. But you can't take Fischer's \"My 60 Memorable Games\" and publish a collection of just those 60 games, even if you leave out his commentary \\- the creativity that went into selecting which games were included qualifies for copyright as well. (Note that a simple collection of all of a player's games in the order in which they were played would not qualify for copyright, as that's not creative enough.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A chess enthusiast wants to create a blog post featuring 20 games played by various grandmasters.

They are merely a preamble to a contract, and that contract *is* binding.

The current clause is much broader than what the CEO and lawyer claim verbally, potentially restricting the consultant's future work opportunities significantly.\n2.

If it ends up without any board members and has a self\\-perpetuating board, any person affected by the corporation or a suitable government representative (in the U.S., usually a state attorney general in the place of incorporation) can apply to a court to have new board members appointed.\n\nIn a \"for profit\" context, this generally doesn't happen because the people investing in the company want to be able to profit from it and/or obtain a return of their investment. So, the question is largely hypothetical in that case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A complex international corporate structure is discovered where Company A in Country X owns 100% of Company B in Country Y, which in turn owns 100% of Company A, creating a circular ownership loop.

In cases where a circular ownership structure is discovered, especially in a for-profit context, it's likely that legal intervention would be required to resolve the situation. A court would likely step in to appoint new board members or trustees to break the ownership loop and determine the ultimate beneficial owners. This approach is similar to how ownerless non-profit corporations are handled when they lack board members. The court's involvement ensures that the situation is resolved in a legal and orderly manner, rather than allowing the loop to continue (A), immediately seizing assets (B), or automatically dissolving the companies (D). The goal would be to unwind the circular structure and establish clear ownership, which is essential for proper corporate governance and accountability."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60231/how-do-these-no-name-companies-get-rights-to-use-copyrighted-characters", "docs_id": 60231, "title": "How do these no name companies get rights to use copyrighted characters?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I see ads for these companies all the time, they seem like tiny companies and all they have going for them is that they make use of major copyrighted characters in their products.\n\nExamples:\n\n<https://lampsity.com/>\n\n<https://lewdskate.com/> (NSFW)\n\nIs there some legal loophole these companies are exploiting that allows you to use these characters?

To the best of my knowledge, this provision has only been employed against people who were solders or civil officials of the Confederacy during the US Civil War. In that case there was no question of whether supporting the Confederacy constituted insurrection. Whether the Jan 6 even is an insurrection or merely or protest, or perhaps a trespass or other criminal intrusion is not settled.\n\n> 2.

The legislature in question could surely act to expel a member in such a case, if its own rules allow expulsion (Each house of Congress is granted that power explicitly in the Federal Constitution, but a 2/3rds vote to expel is needed.) Presumably other procedures could also be used, but I am not sure what they would be, or what procedures were used back in the 1860s.\n\nIt is not clear that a person would need to be criminally convicted before this could apply, but under Due process some sort of hearing would be required.

In Operation Greylord the 17 judges willfully accepted bribes; it was not a matter of a \"honest\" mistake or false accusation.\n\nNaively, it seems to me a holding a judge accountable for willful criminal acts provides a deterrent. (A similar argument is usually made when the state provides a death sentence and executes its citizens). Or maybe the contra\\-positive is more import \\- a judge who knows he or she is not held accountable is free be be as corrupt as they like knowing they will probably not get caught.\n\nHow is it in the public's interest not to hold a corrupt judge accountable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judicial immunity means only that the judge can't be *sued* by the people negatively affected by his decisions, even if they were made corruptly. \n\nThe idea is that if this were possible, then anyone who lost a case before the judge could sue him, perhaps falsely claiming that he was corrupt. Defending such suits would be a major nuisance and expense for the judge, and some fraction of such cases might be wrongly decided against him (courts do err sometimes). So, a party who said (or insinuated) to the judge that \"you'd better decide my case in my favor or else I'll sue you\" would have a credible threat, and the judge might be intimidated into giving in. This would certainly not be in the public interest, and so judicial immunity removes this possibility.\n\nIt's a trade\\-off: the harm done by false accusations would outweigh the good done by legitimate lawsuits against truly corrupt judges, and you can't allow the latter without creating the possibility of the former.\n\nHowever, judges *can* still be held accountable for corruption \\- just not through the mechanism of lawsuits by the affected parties.

SPARKS case. The purpose of judicial immunity is to protect judges from being sued by parties affected by their decisions, even if those decisions were allegedly corrupt. This immunity is designed to allow judges to make independent decisions without fear of constant lawsuits from dissatisfied litigants.\n\nHowever, judicial immunity does not provide complete protection from accountability. As stated in the case, \"Judges are immune from 1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens.\" This means that while judges cannot be sued for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983, they can still be criminally prosecuted for corrupt acts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests total immunity, which is not the case.

It is more helpful to think of it as the candidate himself.\n* \"Certifying\" a score mostly just means that the commission transmits the score to the hiring officer and promises that it's accurate.\n* So whenever there is an opening for a position, the civil service commission must certify/send a list of scores/candidates for the hiring officer to consider, i.e. choose from.\n* The Rule of Three Scores says that list must have at least two more scores than there are open positions. If the city is hiring 50 police officers, the list must have at least 52 scores (50 positions plus 2\\). If it is hiring three secretaries, the list must have at least five scores (3 positions plus 2\\).\n* It's called The Rule of Three Scores because the existence of a list presumes at least one opening, which necessitates at least three scores.

With 3 positions, this means 5 scores must be certified (3 + 2 = 5). If candidates waive appointment, the rule specifies that \"the appointing officer may request supplementary certification(s) from the next highest score.\" Option A is incorrect because proceeding with fewer than the minimum certification is only allowed when the list is exhausted.

It's not. Most \"illegal\" guns are bought through straw purchases in which a person with a clean record buys a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to own one.\n\nYou can work through a licensed dealer if it makes you feel better. If you don't want to use a dealer, you can simply require that a buyer have a concealed carry license as evidence that they are not a prohibited possessor.

For example, [www.gunbroker.com](http://www.gunbroker.com) is a popular site and follows an eBay\\-style bid structure (I have no affiliation to them).

Under Article III, Section 3, could the act of aiding the caravan be considered treason?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Reading some background on [Stefan Molyneux (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux) would indicate that he is a (Canadian) right\\-wing [provocateur (Merriam\\-Webster)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/provocateur) and there is no legal logic to his claim that anyone involved with the migrant caravan \\- either as a refugee or a person giving aid \\- is committing an act of treason.\n\nProvocateurs \\- on the political left or right \\- seek to incite arguments and/or movements on social or political issues with emotion and not on legal frameworks or logical discussion. Provocateurs use words and phrases that can be identified as [Dog\\-whistles (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics). Calling out \"treason\" and accusing one of being a traitor are examples of dog whistles.\n\nThe legal reasoning *against* leveling calls of treason against anyone helping the caravan members are many; the migrants are not (from the U.S. Constitution:)\n\n> *levying war against them (the US), or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort*....\n\nbecause:\n\n\u2022 None of the countries of origin of the migrants are currently in armed conflict with the U.S.\n\n\u2022 None of the migrants \\- alone or as a whole \\- are armed to engage the U.S. or are a threat to the U.S.\n\n\u2022 The refugees are easily identified as economic migrants, political refugees or those fleeing violence (domestic, communal, sectarian).\n\n\u2022 According to [Refugee law (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_law) and US Federal law, migrants have a right to due process at the border.\n\n\u2022 There is no clear proof of an ulterior motive or funding for the migrants in the the caravans.\n\nThere could be \\- now or in the future \\- Americans or American\\-based aid groups helping individuals or the group as a whole with necessities with food and safety while they travel or after they arrive at the border. But the fact remains that each migrant \\- when and if they reach the US border \\- will be legally assessed individually as a migrant or refugee. The aid they may have received is really no different than what many NGOs provide who help arrange a refugees' processing through legal immigration channels, in some instances in conjunction with a US Government agency or with an arm of the United Nations.

The migrants in the caravan are not considered enemies of the United States, nor are they engaged in armed conflict against the U.S. Therefore, providing assistance to them does not constitute \"adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort\" as required by the treason clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because humanitarian aid to migrants does not meet the constitutional definition of treason. Option B is false because the migrant caravan is not an enemy force levying war against the U.S. Option C, while technically correct about the requirements for treason charges, is not the most relevant or accurate statement in this context, as the fundamental issue is that the actions described do not constitute treason in the first place."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/994/who-regulates-wireless-radio-communication-in-north-america-and-europe", "docs_id": 994, "title": "Who regulates wireless radio communication in North America and Europe?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Wireless technologies, such as [Wi\\-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi), cellular 4G networks and [satellite communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G) are all radio\\-based under the hood.

The FAA has nothing to do with it; they regulate things as they affect airplanes, but the actual *radio* rules are set by the FCC, and since frequency allocation is a purely radio thing the FAA has nothing official to do with it. The breakdown between FCC and NTIA is that the FCC deals with non\\-federal communications, while the NTIA deals with federal communications; they split the spectrum.\n\nNow, with things like Wi\\-Fi, many of the rules are set by non\\-governmental standards organizations. Wi\\-Fi is not regulated by the FCC; it falls within the frequencies and transmission powers that the FCC has deemed to be not regulated. So, the FCC never set aside 2\\.4 GHz for wireless Internet; they set it aside for any low\\-powered transmissions anyone wants to make (subject to interference rules). With LTE and satellite communications, there's more regulatory control; they are high\\-powered communications, and are licensed to individual operators for a specific frequency range. \n\nAs Flup said, there is international coordination for obvious reasons (the ITU actually predates the UN by almost a century). The ITU helps coordinate spectrum usage, and also assigns satellite orbital slots in geostationary orbit (where most communication satellites are)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about radio-based communications regulation is correct?\n\nA) The FAA is the primary regulator of radio frequencies for Wi-Fi and cellular networks in the United States.\n\nB) The FCC regulates all radio communications in the US, including both federal and non-federal uses.\n\nC) The NTIA regulates federal radio communications, while the FCC oversees non-federal communications in the US.\n\nD) Wi-Fi operates on strictly regulated frequencies set aside specifically for wireless internet by the FCC.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Baby slings or \"baby wearing\" is recognized by many pediatric doctors as not just good for the child, but good for the parent too ([read more](https://childrensmd.org/browse-by-age-group/newborn-infants/should-you-wear-a-baby-sling/)).\n\nSome hospitals (it was this way for my children) won't let you leave the hospital after birth without placing the child in an approved child seat. This is hospital policy though, not law. The purpose here was to verify that you are capable of putting your child in the seat, have the seat restraints positioned correctly, and understand the placement in the vehicle. Improper use can result in injury or death and this is a lot easier to examine in the hospital room than it is in your car."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A new parent is preparing to leave the hospital with their 10-day-old newborn.

This is to ensure parents can properly secure their child for car travel. Inside a vehicle, car seats are legally mandated. However, once outside the car, parents can choose any safe method to carry their child, including baby slings or carriers, which are recognized by many pediatricians as beneficial for both parent and child.

See e.g. [this article](https://kayhanlife.com/news/kayhan/sale-of-seized-iranian-tanker-could-be-ordered-for-security-reasons-sanctions-expert-says/). The stated basis for the seizure was that it was suspected of violating EU sanctions by carrying crude oil to a sanctioned refinery in Syria.\n\nWhat was the legal basis in international law for this? Even though the ship was in territorial waters, the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf) specifies that vessels should have either \"innocent\" or \"transit\" passage through international straits. There are some restrictions that coastal states can impose on ships, but none of them seem to relate to carrying cargoes in violation of sanctions.

While UNCLOS provides a non-exhaustive list of activities that are not considered innocent, Article 21 allows coastal states to make and publish additional laws that can affect the determination of innocent passage. In the case of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, the UK (acting through Gibraltar) had published sanctions against Syria, which were used as a basis to deem the tanker's passage as non-innocent. This demonstrates that coastal states can expand on UNCLOS provisions through their own published laws to determine what constitutes innocent passage, making option C the correct answer.\n\nOption A is too narrow, as threats to national security are not the only basis for intervention. Option B is too broad, as not all domestic laws can be applied to foreign vessels in innocent passage.

Heller 554 U.S. 570 (2008\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html) is the Supreme Court's latest and clearest interpretation of the 2nd Amendment.\n\nThe majority's analysis is almost entirely a textualist/original\\-meaning interpretation.\n\nThey took the following to be the text of the 2nd Amendment:\n\n> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nThe capitalization differences were treated as inconsequential in the analysis. The opinion refers to \"the phrase \u201cthe militia\u201d in the prefatory clause\", with no capitalization when mentioning it.\n\nIn interpreting the object of \"keep and bear Arms\", \"Arms\", the opinion immediately removes capitalization in its own discussion of the term. They even explicitly rule out the possibility that \"keep Arms\" has any special meaning:\n\n> No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of \u201ckeep Arms.\u201d Thus, the most natural reading of \u201ckeep Arms\u201d in the Second Amendment is to \u201chave weapons.\u201d\n\nThe opinion also refers to Vermont's adoption of Pennsylvania's \"right to bear arms\", calling any differences in capitalization or punctuation inconsequential:\n\n> In 1777, Vermont adopted the identical provision, except for inconsequential differences in punctuation and capitalization.\n\nNeither of the two dissents make anything of the difference in capitalization.

The Supreme Court's majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) treated the capitalization differences as inconsequential in their analysis. They referred to terms like \"militia\" and \"arms\" without capitalization in their discussion, and explicitly stated that differences in punctuation and capitalization were \"inconsequential\" when comparing similar provisions from different states. Neither the dissenting opinions nor the amicus briefs focused on these differences, and they were not discussed in oral arguments.
