        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A citizen in California wants to propose a change to the state's high-speed rail project through a ballot initiative. Which of the following steps would be most appropriate for them to take next?\n\nA) Submit the initiative idea directly to the California Secretary of State for approval\nB) Start a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the project\nC) Draft specific amendments to California statutes, including sections to be repealed, added, or modified\nD) Seek expertise from public policy professionals on LawStackExchange\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the citizen's initial submission was rejected because it wasn't written as a law. To properly create a ballot initiative in California, the proposal needs to specify exactly how existing statutes would be changed. This includes detailing which sections of California law would be repealed, added, or amended. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the citizen has already tried submitting their idea to the Secretary of State, and it was rejected for not being in the proper legal format.\n\nOption B, while potentially useful later in the process, is not the immediate next step. Funding becomes more relevant after the initiative is properly drafted.\n\nOption D, seeking expertise on LawStackExchange, might be helpful but is not the most crucial next step. The primary task is to draft the initiative in proper legal form.\n\nThe correct approach is to focus on drafting the specific statutory changes, as indicated in option C, which aligns with the example provided in the answer about the California ballot proposition process."

They pay me $100 for the session.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two primary factors that govern the outcome are laws on \"unapproved devices\" and \"practicing without a license\". Carrots are only subject to ordinary food safety regulations in the US, and the outcome would not change by substituting broccoli, mustard, filet mignon, or \"lots of water\". Drugs that are introduced on the market have to be approved by the FDA, but legacy foods do not. We are in the realm that requires no FDA approval of carrots. The line, for product\\-purveyors, is drawn by [21 USC 321(g)(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/321), and [here](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/santhigram-kerala-ayurvedic-co-us-inc-625892-05192022) is an FDA warning letter to an Ayurvedic medical treatment maker / seller.\n\nThere are ample law concerning \"practice of medicine\", and there is the First Amendment which erects a strong barrier against laws which aim to prohibit people from disseminating an officially\\-unapproved viewpoint (to simplify matters, I presume \u2013 contrary to fact \u2013 that no medical authority has endorsed the specific efficacy of carrots). The government cannot punish you for taking approach A or B.\n\nIf you have a license to practice medicine (of the relevant kind), you may be subject to state licensing\\-board sanctions for making unapproved claims (one of the factors that overrides the First Amendment). If you have no license, then the question is whether your activity falls within the realm of \"practicing medicine\" in the state. In Washington, the line is drawn via [RCW 18\\.71\\.011](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=18.71.011)\n\n> A person is practicing medicine if he or she does one or more of the\n> following: (1\\) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise, or\n> prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,\n> deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or\n> imaginary, by any means or instrumentality...\n\nTechnically, you cannot advise a person to take an aspirin if they have a headache. However, this law is within the scope of business regulations, so part of the line not directly encoded in that definition (related to the requirement to have a license) is that you are doing this as a business.\n\nA person must have a state license in Washington to be a \"common school\" (K\\-12\\) teacher. Your gym teacher can tell you to eat carrots to cure your depression or whatever, and there is some (miniscule) chance that the teacher will get punished for giving such advice. A person does not have to have a license to be a university professor, therefore telling a student to eat carrots will lead to no government sanctions, though the employer may fire or reassign you, depending on circumstances. The crucial question is not whether you are advocating eating carrots, but what business you are engaged in, whereby in the course of that business you give advice. A person with a medical degree and license who is a greeter at Walmart is not subject to government sanctions for advising \"Eat carrots to cure your tumor / depression\".",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A self-proclaimed health guru without any medical or psychological credentials offers paid consultations where they advise clients to eat carrots to cure various ailments. Which of the following scenarios is MOST likely to be considered illegal practice of medicine in most U.S. states?\n\nA) Publishing a book titled \"Cure Your Depression with Carrots!\" with a disclaimer about lack of medical credentials\n\nB) Offering free advice on a blog about using carrots to treat general health issues\n\nC) Charging $100 for an in-person session where they specifically advise a client with a diagnosed brain tumor to eat carrots as a cure\n\nD) Hosting a free public seminar on the general health benefits of carrots, including mentions of potential benefits for depression and cancer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is most likely to be considered illegal practice of medicine in most U.S. states. This scenario involves:\n1. Charging money for health advice ($100 fee)\n2. Addressing a specific individual's diagnosed medical condition (brain tumor)\n3. Recommending a specific treatment (eating carrots)\n4. Claiming to cure a serious medical condition\n\nThis combination of factors most closely aligns with the legal definition of practicing medicine without a license, which is illegal in most states. Options A and B are generally protected by free speech, as long as proper disclaimers are provided. Option D, while potentially controversial, is less likely to be considered illegal as it's free general advice not targeted at a specific individual's diagnosed condition."

I did a search of the phrase to see if it is common, and it seems that [many lease agreements](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS784US784&biw=1536&bih=759&ei=tZXFWui-LImTzwL8tqPACg&q=lease%20%22No%20animals%20or%20reptiles%22&oq=lease%20%22No%20animals%20or%20reptiles%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...141384.152587.0.153160.46.40.6.0.0.0.129.3077.31j5.37.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..3.41.3106.6..0j35i39k1j0i67k1j0i131k1j0i131i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i131i46k1j46i131k1j0i22i30k1j33i22i29i30k1j33i21k1j33i160k1.150.WV71bSNbSMQ) use this phrase. Why do these documents, which are otherwise quite precise and carefully worded, make such an odd distinction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because [animal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/animal) has several definitions, specifically:\n\n> **2 b** : Mammal\n\nWhile you are probably thinking of:\n\n> **1** : any of a kingdom (Animalia) of living things including many\\-celled organisms and often many of the single\\-celled ones (such as protozoans) that typically differ from plants in having cells without cellulose walls, in lacking chlorophyll and the capacity for photosynthesis, in requiring more complex food materials (such as proteins), in being organized to a greater degree of complexity, and in having the capacity for spontaneous movement and rapid motor responses to stimulation\n\nWhile reptiles are captured by **1**, they aren't by **2 b**.

The clause aims to prevent disputes arising from different definitions of the word \"animal\". As explained in the documentation, the term \"animal\" can have multiple definitions. One common definition refers specifically to mammals, which would not include reptiles. By explicitly mentioning both animals and reptiles, the lease agreement closes a potential loophole and prevents any misunderstanding or dispute over whether reptiles are included in the prohibition. This wording ensures that all creatures, regardless of their biological classification, are clearly prohibited from the premises.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no evidence that the landlord has a particular aversion to reptiles; this is standard language in many lease agreements. Option B is factually incorrect, as reptiles are indeed classified as animals in scientific taxonomy. Option D is also incorrect, as there is no widespread legal requirement to specifically mention reptiles in lease agreements; rather, this is a practice adopted for clarity and comprehensiveness."

Therefore it is not possible to give an absolute yes/no as to whether masking text with asterisks is or is not lawful.\n\nWe can gain a deeper insight by looking at the GDPR itself. Firstly, the definition of **processing** (Art. 4 lit. 2\\):\n\n> any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction\n\nAs [mentioned by amon](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46652/hiding-order-invoice-information-gdpr#comment89702_46652), the principles relating to processing of personal data (Art. 5\\) are highly relevant, insofar as the activity constitutes processing. In particular, **purpose limitation**:\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\n\n...and **data minimisation**:\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed\n\nI would argue that **making available** the personal data on an invoice is processing. There are two separate operations:\n\n1. Making the data available to authenticated users; and\n2. Making the data available to non\\-authenticated users\n\nThe purpose of making it available to authenticated users may be different to the purpose of making it available to non\\-authenticated users. Again acknowledging [amon](http://amon), the necessity of making the data available to non\\-authenticated users must be examined, as too must the means by which a non\\-authenticated user gains access to an invoice: are they using a URL that contains a token of some kind? Is this unique in some way? It could be that the presentation of a token itself constitutes authentication and thus authorisation to view the entire invoice, in which case further redaction may not be necessary if there is a clear necessity to disclose the entire contents to such a user. Whether the token expires or is limited to a certain referrer would be part of complying with the **integrity and confidentiality** principle and Art. 32 (Security of processing) by implementation of technical measures.\n\nWhen considering pseudonymisation and anonymisation, you will note that the redaction of name and address data from a certain view of the invoice, while nevertheless displaying the invoice number, constitutes pseudonymisation, since it would be possible with unfettered access to the remaining data, to determine the name and address from the invoice number, but not for the non\\-authenticated user whose view is redacted. In such a case, I fail to see how or why the replacement of a string with the same number of asterisks, or starting with the real character is secure or even practical, when the entire field could simply be replaced with a fixed\\-width string of asterisks or other filler, thus providing the user with no right or necessity to view the personal data with no further insight into what the personal data may or may not be.",

It aligns with the data minimization principle, providing only the necessary information (invoice and order details) without exposing personal data.\n2. It avoids the risk of pseudonymization that comes with partially masked data, where the true information might be inferred.\n3. It ensures purpose limitation by restricting access to personal data for non-authenticated users who may not need it.\n4. It provides better security than options A and C, which still reveal partial personal information.\n5. It's less restrictive than option D, allowing some useful information to be accessed without full authentication, which may be necessary for certain business processes.\n\nOptions A and C are problematic because they still reveal partial personal data and the masking method could potentially allow for guessing or inferring the full information. Option D, while secure, may be overly restrictive and impractical for certain business needs."

Some protocols add new rights (like Protocol 1, which adds articles to the Convention), some amend existing provisions, and others (like Protocols 11 and 14 mentioned in the text) have changed the Convention's structure or enforcement mechanisms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because protocols are not entirely separate; they often integrate with or modify the ECHR. Option B oversimplifies the process; not all protocols automatically replace existing articles, and their integration can vary. Option D is too limiting; while some protocols may serve interpretative functions, many (like Protocol 1) clearly introduce new legal obligations and rights.\n\nThis question requires candidates to synthesize information about the varying functions of protocols and their relationship to the main Convention, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the ECHR system."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: (Context Details: UK, renting in London. Agent is Foxtons.)\n\nI've just left a rental property after 3 years there.\nThe landlord has authorised the full return of the deposit, but the rental agency has turned around and said that there's \u00a396 of annual renewal fees outstanding.\n\nI've proved that I paid the fee 1 year ago, and I have several emails from them discussing the \"outstanding balance\" from the points at which the monthly rent changed, but they're now asserting that the outstanding fee is from 2 years ago, and that those conversations were about the RENTAL balance only (and thus don't pertain to any administration fee balance).\n\nAs far as I can tell they are technically right \\- there's an email from 2 years ago asserting that they WILL invoice me for the renewal, but no actual INVOICE for that (that I received) and it looks like all the payments I made add up to cover the rent and NOT the renewal fee.\n\nSo I think their assertions about what happened are correct.\n\nQuestion: Am I actually obligated to pay this fee?\nIf they didn't invoice me CAN they turn around 2 years later and say \"we should totally have charged you for this.\" The Ts\\&Cs do state that there will be such a fee.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it's in the contract, you must pay it. You can claim money up to the statute of limitations which will almost certainly be more than 2 years.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the context of UK rental law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the rental agency's claim for an outstanding renewal fee from two years ago?\n\nA) The rental agency cannot legally claim the fee after two years have passed, as it falls outside the statute of limitations for such claims.\n\nB) The tenant is not obligated to pay the fee because the rental agency failed to provide an invoice at the time the fee was due.\n\nC) If the renewal fee is stipulated in the original tenancy agreement, the tenant is legally obligated to pay it, even if it was not invoiced at the time.\n\nD) The tenant can refuse to pay the fee because the landlord has already authorized the full return of the deposit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In UK rental law, if a fee is stipulated in the original tenancy agreement or terms and conditions, the tenant is legally obligated to pay it, even if the rental agency failed to invoice for it at the time. The statute of limitations for such claims is typically longer than two years, so the agency is within its rights to request payment now. The lack of an invoice does not negate the contractual obligation, and the landlord's authorization of the deposit return does not override other contractual fees owed to the agency. While best practices would involve timely invoicing, the tenant's obligation remains if it's in the contract."

He recently went to the courthouse for a background check and was told there was nothing on file. Which of the following statements is most likely true regarding John's arrest record?\n\nA) The arrest record has been automatically expunged due to the lack of charges.\nB) There is no record of the arrest anywhere since charges were never filed.\nC) The arrest record likely exists but is maintained by law enforcement rather than the courts.\nD) The courthouse is required to keep all arrest records, regardless of whether charges were filed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Even if charges are never filed, there is typically still a record of the arrest. However, arrest records are often maintained by law enforcement agencies rather than the courts. This is why John didn't find anything when he went to the courthouse for a background check. The courthouse generally maintains records of criminal charges and convictions, not arrests where charges were never filed. It's important to note that the absence of a record at the courthouse doesn't necessarily mean the arrest record doesn't exist elsewhere. Law enforcement agencies usually keep these records, and they may appear on comprehensive background checks. Options A and B are incorrect because arrest records typically aren't automatically expunged or erased just because charges weren't filed. Option D is incorrect because courthouses are not usually responsible for maintaining records of arrests where no charges were filed."

In other words, there's no identifiable embodiment of any of the ideas. I left the company years ago and would like to build one of the ideas that we discussed while I worked there. Am I prohibited from building the idea on my own because the idea was conceived while I worked there? I'm sure I signed some kind of NDA when I was hired.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an Australian perspective; other jurisdictions will differ.\n\nPatent\n------\n\nThe only IP protection for ideas is if they are patented; embodying the ideas in a tangible form is a pre\\-requisite for acquiring a patent. You can check if this idea *has* been patented because if it has then it is a matter of public record.\n\nConfidential Information\n------------------------\n\nHowever, there is another method of protecting ideas; keeping them secret. It is highly likely that the information that you gained as an employee is confidential. You say you signed a non\\-disclosure agreement; you will be bound by whatever that says. Even if you hadn't, **confidentiality is an implied term of any employment contract**; an explicit term can reduce its coverage or make explicit what is and is not confidential.\n\nFor breach of confidence to be established:\n\n1. The information must be confidential (it probably is);\n2. The circumstances of the disclosure to you are such that you know or should know it is confidential (they probably were);\n3. Your disclosure of the information must be unauthorised (it probably is) and to the detriment of the company (if you make money off it then they could have and that is to their detriment) and you do not have a *public interest* defence (you don't).\n\nRemedies include:\n\n1. An injunction to restrain disclosure;\n2. An accounting of profits (i.e. what you make, they take);\n3. An order for delivery up or destruction;\n4. an order for seizing evidence.\n\nThere is no statutory limit on how long you must maintain the confidence; presumably until disclosure will not cause detriment.\n\nSolutions\n---------\n\n1. Ask for authorisation: \"Remember that idea we discussed years ago? If you are not doing anything with it do you mind if I have a go?\" You may get a simple \"Sure, go ahead.\" in which case document it (send them an email confirming your conversation) or you may get a \"No\" (that's the risk with this option) or you may get pages and pages of license agreement (deal with that on its merits).\n2. Do it anyway \\- they may not sue, if they do they will have a hard time proving that you are using their ideas in the absence of contemporaneous evidence.",

Even if no patent was filed and no tangible prototype was created, the information discussed during employment is likely considered confidential. Confidentiality is an implied term in employment contracts, even without a signed NDA. The documentation states that \"confidentiality is an implied term of any employment contract\" and that there is \"no statutory limit on how long you must maintain the confidence.\" Therefore, the employee is likely prohibited from using the idea due to these implied confidentiality obligations, regardless of the time passed since leaving the company.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while patent protection is one aspect, confidentiality agreements and implied terms of employment also protect ideas.\nAnswer B is incorrect because lack of tangible embodiment doesn't negate confidentiality obligations.\nAnswer D is incorrect because there's typically no automatic expiration on confidentiality obligations related to employment."

Would Vice President Bill Clinton become President since he is next in line in the [presidential line of succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession)?

It also says that a person who has held the office / acted as President for more than 2 years may only be *elected* once. Under the proposes scenario, B. Clinton would succeed H.

Since the [12th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States#Eligibility) eligibility requirement is stated in terms of \"being\" rather that \"becoming\", the matter would end up in SCOTUS. See Peabody \\& Gant *The Twice and Future President: Constitutional Interstices and the Twenty\\-Second Amendment* 83 Minn. L. Rev. 565\\.

The 22nd Amendment limits a person from being elected to the presidency more than twice, but it doesn't explicitly prohibit someone from becoming president through succession after having served two terms. The 12th Amendment's eligibility requirement for the vice presidency is stated in terms of \"being\" rather than \"becoming\" eligible for the presidency. This creates a legal grey area that would likely require interpretation by the Supreme Court. The key issue would be the interpretation of \"eligible to the office\" in light of the 22nd Amendment's restrictions. Therefore, while Bill Clinton could potentially succeed to the presidency, his ability to serve would likely be subject to a Supreme Court decision."

This is codified in [section 26 of the PDPA 2021](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PDPA2012#pr26-):\n\n> An organisation must not transfer any personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements prescribed under this Act to ensure that organisations provide a standard of protection to personal data so transferred that is comparable to the protection under this Act.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission has issued [advisory guidelines on PDPA concepts](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelines-and-consultation/2020/03/advisory-guidelines-on-key-concepts-in-the-personal-data-protection-act). In chapter 19, it covers issues around transfers. It mentions a number of possibilities how to do that, for example:\n\n* transfers within a group of companies could rely on binding corporate rules\n* the foreign data importer could be bound via a contract, essentially translating the PDPA statutory law into a contract\n* the foreign data importer could have a certification that demonstrates compliance, such as certifications under the acific Economic\nCooperation Cross Border Privacy Rules (\u201cAPEC CBPR\u201d) system\n\nIf that is not possible, then a fallback to \u201cconsent\u201d or \u201cdeemed consent\u201d could be appropriate.\n\nThese data transfer concerns apply to you in two ways:\n\n* first, this may affect which additional services you engage to provide your product, e.g. server hosting providers\n* second, your clients from Singapore likely cannot use your services unless they can legally transfer data to you. For example, you may prepare a suitable contract that you sign, or attain a suitable certification.\n\nNote that ChatGPT cannot give reasonable advice on these matters. While it may not be outright *wrong*, it is not\\-entirely\\-correct in subtle ways. For example, the PDPA does not require an adequate level of data protection by the recipient *country*, but that the importing *organizations* provide such guarantees. It is likely that ChatGPT is confusing the Singapore PDPA with similar provisions from the EU GDPR, where \u201cadequacy\u201d is the primary mechanism to protect international transfers.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding compliance with Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)?\n\nA) The company cannot transfer personal data outside of Singapore under any circumstances.\n\nB) The company can transfer the data if India has been deemed to have an adequate level of data protection by Singapore authorities.\n\nC) The company can transfer the data if it enters into a legally binding agreement with the Indian service provider to ensure compliance with PDPA standards.\n\nD) The company only needs to obtain individual user consent to transfer the data to India.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Singapore's PDPA, organizations can transfer personal data outside of Singapore if they ensure that the recipient provides a comparable level of data protection. This can be achieved through legally binding agreements with the recipient (in this case, the Indian cloud service provider) to ensure compliance with PDPA standards. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the PDPA does allow international transfers under certain conditions. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the PDPA focuses on the importing organization's guarantees, not on a blanket assessment of the recipient country's data protection regime. \n\nOption D is insufficient on its own; while obtaining consent can be a method to facilitate transfers, it's not always the most appropriate or comprehensive approach, especially for ongoing business operations.\n\nThe correct approach (C) aligns with the PDPA's requirements for international transfers and provides a robust mechanism for ensuring data protection standards are maintained when data is transferred outside of Singapore."

Is it a normal addition to a Trust?\n\n![Trust Articles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oh3Id.jpg)\n\nThis is a second question about the same topic as another one of my questions but it is not a duplicate. I have edited the other questions to avoid any overlapping. I think the differences should be clear if you read them.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Section 6\\.19 says that the trustee is not required to provide an accounting of the trust to anyone, even if the law says otherwise.\n\nSection 6\\.20 says that **IF** the settlor (the person who established the trust) becomes incapacitated (unable to handle business, usually due to illness, injury, or age), then the trustee is required to provide an accounting to several people, specifically: 1\\) those people who will become beneficiaries of the trust when the settlor dies, 2\\) any person who may be acting as conservator of the estate, and 3\\) to any person who is acting as agent for the settlor under the settlor's power of attorney to manage the settlor's property. (A conservator is a person appointed, usually by a court, to manage an estate or property, so that it shall be in good order when it turned over to the proper owner. A conservator is often appointed when the owner is not able to manage his or her own property, or while a will is being settled.) \n\nSection 6\\.20 also says that If the settlor becomes incapacitated the Trustee will give a copy of th trust document to the potential beneficiaries (the same people indicated in item 1\\) above).\n\nSection 6\\.20 seems to conflict with 6\\.19 and I have no idea how this conflict would be resolved.

Therefore, when the settlor becomes incapacitated, Section 6.20 applies, requiring the trustee to provide both an accounting and a copy of the trust document to potential beneficiaries. The trustee must also provide an accounting to the conservator of the estate and the settlor's agent under power of attorney."

Most obviously, they may threaten to fire employees who refuse, whether immediately or at the end of their current term, as another answer observes. Indeed, if Big Company makes an NC a condition of employment then they are likely to insist on the same for employees they obtain from Original Employer.\n\nFiring employees for refusing to sign does, of course, put them in the job market as potential competitors, but the company may well find it acceptable to do that on their own terms. In particular, Big Company can ensure that those who won't sign go out the door with minimal knowledge of Big Company's clients, trade secrets, etc. other than those obtained from Original Employer.\n\nAnd that leads into other forms of inducement. Big Company can do some or all of the following things, depending on the particular employment situation:\n\n* offer bonus compensation for signing\n* promote those who sign and / or demote / reassign those who don't\n* change job duties for those who refuse to sign\n* do all manner of nastier things to be unfriendly to employees who refuse to sign\n\nSome of those fit directly into Big Company's perceived interest in avoiding employees using Big Company internal information to jump ship and compete with them, and others could fit into Big Company policy about which jobs require an NC. Some are just pressure tactics, but that does not necessarily make them unlawful (nor are all variations on the others necessarily lawful).",

BigCorp wants all existing SmallCo employees to sign non-compete agreements. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding BigCorp's ability to implement this policy?\n\nA) BigCorp can legally compel all SmallCo employees to sign non-compete agreements as a condition of continued employment.\n\nB) BigCorp cannot ask SmallCo employees to sign non-compete agreements under any circumstances, as it would violate Delaware labor laws.\n\nC) BigCorp can offer incentives for signing non-compete agreements, but cannot fire employees who refuse to sign.\n\nD) BigCorp can implement various strategies to encourage signing, including offering bonuses, changing job responsibilities, or terminating employees who refuse, but cannot directly compel employees to sign.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While BigCorp cannot directly compel employees to sign non-compete agreements, they have several legal options to encourage signing. These include offering bonuses, changing job responsibilities, or even terminating employees who refuse to sign. The key point is that while the company cannot force employees to sign, they can create conditions that make signing more attractive or refusal less desirable. Options A and B are incorrect because they present extreme positions that are not supported by the information given. Option C is partially correct but fails to acknowledge that the company can, in fact, terminate employees who refuse to sign, making it less comprehensive than option D."

The agreement *may* also stipulate that there will be no labor actions on issues which are not covered, as long as the agreement is in force, but that is not necessary.\n\n*Example: There is a collective bargaining agreement on wages, which is still running.

However, labor actions on issues not covered by the agreement are generally allowed, unless the agreement explicitly states otherwise. This nuanced approach balances the need for labor peace on settled issues while still allowing for potential action on new or uncovered matters. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it's too broad - Friedenspflicht doesn't automatically prohibit all labor actions. \nOption B is incorrect as it doesn't account for the possibility of agreements prohibiting actions on uncovered issues. \nOption D is incorrect and misrepresents the employer's role in Friedenspflicht.\n\nThe correct answer, C, accurately reflects the balanced nature of Friedenspflicht in German labor relations."

Even though the ID itself is just a number, it can be used to construct a profile URL and potentially reveal the user's identity through their Google or Facebook profile. This makes the user reasonably identifiable, qualifying the ID as personal data under most data protection regulations.\n\nThe fact that only ID numbers are stored, without additional information like names or email addresses, does not exempt the startup from being a data controller. As long as personal data is being processed, the entity is considered a data controller.\n\nIt's important to note that while salt-hashing the ID numbers would make it more difficult to identify individuals, the original question suggests that this alone may not be sufficient to declassify the data as personal information, especially if there's a way to potentially match hashed IDs to known user profiles.\n\nTherefore, the startup must comply with relevant data protection regulations as a data controller processing personal data, even if the data is limited to ID numbers from social login services."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Under U.S. law, almost all kinds of disputes between people who have contractual relationships with each other can be subject to binding arbitration with no appeal right or class action rights through a contractual term with only minimal regulation of the arbitration process.\n\nIn English law, are there significant classes of civil disputes that can not be subjected to arbitration? \n\nFor example, is binding pre\\-dispute arbitration prohibited (or required) for any significant subset of consumer disputes, landlord\\-tenant disputes, realtor disputes, employment disputes, banking disputes, or international disputes?\n\nOr, for example, are there contexts in which the duty to arbitrate is subject to strict scrutiny, either based upon either the arbitration process or the nature of the subject matter subject to arbitration?\n\nAlso, in civil disputes, when they are subject to arbitration clauses, is the arbitration process subject to significant legal regulation in English law? For example, is the business/profession of arbitrating civil disputes one that requires licensing and is subject to government regulation that affects the arbitration process in any material respect?\n\nTo be clear, when I say \"arbitration\", I mean a pre\\-dispute agreement to have a non\\-governmental private individual or firm resolve a civil dispute between parties bound by a common agreement of some kind, in lieu of resort to civil courts, where the agreement is binding without further action of the parties (with or without a right to a trial de novo or appeal of the decision either within the arbitration context or to a civil court). \n\nI do not mean mediation in which the parties are required to discuss settlement with the aid of a third party facilitator that only has any legal effect if both parties affirmative sign some sort of settlement agreement to particular terms after those terms are known.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not true to say that there is \"only minimal regulation\" of arbitration in the US: arbitrations are conducted under law, usually the [Federal Arbitration Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act) but sometimes equivalent state laws and must be conducted in accordance with the rules agreed to by the parties. Further they can be appealed, however, the grounds for appeal are restricted to those enumerated in the Act or agreed by the parties.\n\nIn general, this is the case for all jurisdictions including England, however, the specific Acts that makes arbitration legal are different in each jurisdiction.\n\nSection 69 of the UK Arbitration Act 1996 enumerates the rights of appeal and which may and may not be excluded. That said, appeals from arbitrations are rarely initiated and exen more rarely upheld. A recent decision, *NYK Bulkship (Atlantic) NV v Cargill International SA \\[2016] UKSC 20* has clarified this section:\n\n> The only two grounds to challenge an award which cannot be waived in an English\\-seated arbitration are those of substantive jurisdiction or serious irregularity. The right to appeal an award on a point of law is not a mandatory provision of the English Arbitration Act 1996\\.\n> \n> \n> Where this right to appeal on a point of law has not been excluded, an appeal can be brought under section 69 only with the agreement of the parties to the dispute or with the permission of the court.\n> \n> \n> Under section 69(3\\), the court can only grant permission if (a) the determination of the point of law will substantially affect the rights of one or more parties, (b) the question is one which the tribunal was asked to answer, (c) the arbitral award is obviously wrong or else the decision is open to serious doubt and concerns a question of general public importance, and (e) it is just and proper for the court to rule on this issue despite the parties agreeing to resolve the dispute by arbitration.\n> \n> \n> It is then at the court's discretion to confirm, vary or set aside the award or else to remit it to the tribunal in whole or in part for reconsideration in the light of their ruling. However, the statute provides that the court shall not exercise its power to set aside an award unless it is satisfied that it would be inappropriate to remit the award to the tribunal for reconsideration.\n> \n> \n> [http://hsfnotes.com/](http://hsfnotes.com/arbitration/2016/05/19/uk-supreme-court-rules-on-section-69-challenge-to-an-arbitral-do-the-courts-plan-to-take-a-more-active-role-in-arbitration/)\n\nAs far as I know arbitration clauses in England are not mandatory in any class of contract nor can a court order arbitration (but they can order mediation). They are restricted in employment contracts where the employee has a statutory right to appeal to an employment tribunal in that they cannot be the sole remedy and they are prohibited in insolvency proceedings and criminal matters.\n\nOther than impartiality, there are no requirements under the Arbitration Act relating to the qualifications and characteristics of arbitrators. It is not necessary for an arbitrator to be a national of, or licensed to practice in, England.\n\nWhile not strictly relevant to English law [recent decisions](http://uk.practicallaw.com/1-519-4506?source=relatedcontent#) in the USA and Canada on the unconscionably of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts (where one party can offer a \"take\\-it\\-or\\-leave\\-it\" contract to the other) have come to diametrically opposed conclusions. In the USA these are enforceable, in Canada they are not: probably a reflection of the different attitude of the jurisdictions on laissez\\-faire versus social welfare styles of capitalism although in both jurisdictions they were 5\\-4 decisions so more finely balanced than you might think.\n\nI would guess that English courts would probably find the Candadian rather than the US decision more persuasive if and when the question is asked. In other common law countries, Australia is almost certainly on Canada's side particularly since for small\\-business contracts the standard is (since 16 November 2016\\) whether a term is \"unfair\" rather than \"unconscionable\".",

Such a move isn't necessarily unprecedented, but it is extraordinary.\n\n[Legal Eagle had a piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P98bc_lYsvg) on this noting that while this move is extraordinary, it's becoming less extraordinary when it concerns lawyers for Trump. Per Legal Eagle, it seems that Corcoran did not wholly trust the information being given to him by his client and engaged in the notable move of recording his conversations. Thus, Corcoran can probably provide testimony which will indicate that he said things that weren't true, but did not knowingly lie because the basis for the information he conveyed was based on the information his client had provided to him. Presumably, because he lacked *mens rea*, he could not be culpable.\n\nHowever, this lack of *mens rea* may not be applicable to other attorneys whom have worked for Trump. Presuming a court permits piercing the attorney\\-client privilege for those attorneys, could those attorneys continue to impede the investigation by asserting their 5th amendment rights?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can an attorney plead the 5th if attorney\\-client privilege is pierced?\n\nYes. But if the prosecutor offers the attorney \"use immunity\" for the testimony (i.e. a binding promise that the attorney's own testimony won't be used against that attorney), then the 5th Amendment privilege can be overcome as well.\n\nIn other words, the prosecutor can unilaterally force an attorney to waive his or her fifth amendment rights by granting the attorney immunity from having that testimony used against the attorney, even if the attorney doesn't want to do that.\n\nThis is established, for example, as noted in the comments by bdb484, by the case of *Kastigar v. United States*, 406 U.S. 441, (1972\\) (\u201cThe United States can compel testimony from an unwilling witness who invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self\\-incrimination by conferring immunity\u201d).",

The court has ruled to pierce attorney-client privilege due to potential fraud. Attorney Smith is concerned about self-incrimination. Which of the following scenarios would most likely compel Attorney Smith to testify, despite Fifth Amendment concerns?\n\nA) The judge threatens to hold Attorney Smith in contempt of court if they refuse to testify.\nB) The prosecutor offers Attorney Smith a plea deal in exchange for testimony.\nC) The prosecutor grants Attorney Smith use immunity for their testimony.\nD) Attorney Smith's client waives attorney-client privilege and requests full disclosure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a prosecutor grants use immunity to an attorney, it means that the attorney's testimony cannot be used against them in any criminal proceedings. This effectively nullifies the Fifth Amendment concern about self-incrimination, as the testimony cannot be used to prosecute the attorney. As established in Kastigar v. United States, the government can compel testimony from an unwilling witness who invokes the Fifth Amendment by conferring immunity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a contempt threat alone does not address the Fifth Amendment concern.\nOption B is incorrect because a plea deal still leaves the attorney vulnerable to prosecution based on their testimony.\nOption D is incorrect because while it addresses attorney-client privilege, it does not resolve the Fifth Amendment issue."

United States*). In that case, SCOTUS ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the legal question before it (was the new trial format a proper trial by the senate), but did not have an opinion one way or another to suggest that SCOTUS could not review other cases that come before it. One of the reasons they also haven't is in order to have a legal case in the U.S., the plaintiff must suffer actual harm. More impeachments ended without a conviction than with either acquittal (8\\), resignation before trial conclusion (4\\), and expulsion from senate (1, and will never occur again as Congressional office holders are not impeachable following this particular case).\n\nSince no harm was caused and courts do not rule on hypotheticals, a case with actual harm (conviction) must occur in order for SCOTUS to even consider hearing the case. *Nixon* does not bar SCOTUS from hearing more appeals resulting from Impeachment, it only bars those relating to the manner in which the senate chooses to hold the trial.",

LPAs are filed against a judgment of a single judge of the High Court and are decided by a bench of two/more judges of the same High Court.\n\nMy question is:\n\n> Why is *Letters Patent Appeal* called so? Where does it get the name?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Letters patent are instruments issued by the monarch to publicly grant some specific rights to some person(s) with the backing of the royal power. It is also where the word *patent* (in its intellectual property sense) comes from, since the monopoly of invention was only granted by the authority of the monarch via a letter patent.\n\nAnother use of the letters patent is to constituting certain offices, particular those exercising the royal power, for example, [the Governor General of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_Patent,_1947).\n\nUnder the British system, the courts are thought to be [the monarch exercising their power over the bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Bench).\n\nMany High Courts of India were constituted by the British monarch during the colonial rul. The British Parliament allows the monarch to issue letters patent for such purposes in the [1861 High Courts Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_High_Courts_Act_1861). Their jurisdictions were specified by letters patent.\n\nOne of such jurisdiction is the power for a High Court to hear appeals from the decisions of one of its justices.\n\nFor example, in [the letters patent establishing the High Court in Calcutta](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979dd64a93263ca60b74d6):\n\n> 14. Appeal from the Court a of original jurisdiction to the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction.\\- And We do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal from the judgment, in all cases of original Civil jurisdiction, of one or more Judges of the said High Court, or of any Division Court, pursuant to Section 13 of the said recited Act: Provided always that no such appeal shall lie to the High Court as aforesaid from any such decision made by a majority of the full number of Judges of the said High Court, but that the right of appeal in such case shall be to Us, Our heirs or successors, in Our or their Privy Council, in manner hereinafter provided.\n\nThis clause grants appellate jurisdiction to the High Court over the High Court itself when the court makes a decision in its original jurisdiction (unless the decision was already made by the majority of the court's judges).\n\nOf course, India can establish its own courts now and the power comes from the Constitution (in particular arts. 226 and 227\\) instead of the monarch personally, although some letters patent remain legally in force. The Indian Parliament now regulates the High Courts according to the Constitution.\n\nBut the term letters patent appeal remained, because the appellate jurisdiction came from the letters patent.",

Letters patent were official documents issued by the British monarch to grant specific rights or establish institutions. In this case, the High Courts in India were established by letters patent issued under the Indian High Courts Act of 1861. These letters patent included clauses granting the High Courts jurisdiction to hear appeals against decisions made by their own single judges in cases of original civil jurisdiction. This specific power, derived from the letters patent, gave rise to the term \"Letters Patent Appeal.\" Although India's legal system has evolved since independence, with the Constitution now being the source of court powers, the historical term has persisted in legal usage to describe this particular type of appeal within High Courts."

They are also not a subject of criminal laws, so they technically can't break the law. The people can.\n\nIf the actions of such organizations will break some laws, the people staying behind that organization will be made responsible. Either it will be single individuals, or the whole organization might be declared criminal (such as mafia or a gang) and there everyone, including stakeholders or casual employees/contractors might be subjects to interrogation, arrest and sentence. \n\nAs for the problem you describe, when the organization made something illegal under one jurisdiction, and the stakeholders are sitting in other country, where such actions are not illegal, they might only partially be safe. They might be arrested not only in the country where the legal actions are taken, but also in third countries, that have extradition agreements with that country.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) operates across multiple jurisdictions and is found to be engaging in activities that are illegal in some countries but not others. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) Only the original programmer of the DAO's code can be held legally responsible for any illegal activities.\n\nB) The DAO itself, as a decentralized entity, can be directly prosecuted and punished under international law.\n\nC) Stakeholders and individuals involved with the DAO may face legal consequences, including potential arrest and extradition, depending on the specific laws and agreements between countries.\n\nD) Cryptocurrency miners supporting the DAO's blockchain are the primary targets for legal action and will bear full responsibility for any illegal activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer reflects the key points from the documentation that private organizations like DAOs are not subjects of international or criminal law themselves. Instead, individuals associated with the DAO - including stakeholders, employees, and contractors - may be held responsible for illegal actions. The answer also acknowledges the complexity of cross-border legal issues, noting that individuals might face consequences not only in the country where the illegal action occurred but also in other countries with extradition agreements. This aligns with the documentation's explanation of how legal responsibility is attributed in decentralized organizations and the potential international implications of their actions."

Is it legal to do this? For saving a copy of the copyrighted software and share in public (students).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question of saving a copy of software in public cloud is probably moot, however this is almost certainly legal provided it is not used to distribute the software. (I understand a [public cloud](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/public_cloud.html) to be cloud resources which are off\\-premise and owned by someone else, but under your control \\- which is distinct from making something available to anyone)\n\nThe relevant question is one of licensing \\- and provided you have the right to distribute the software to users you limit your distribution if required under your license this is legal. If the software you are using is licensed, \"[making available](https://www.copyright.gov/docs/making_available/)\" is most likely a breach of laws \\- which may vary from place to place in their specifics and enforcement \\- but are, nonetheless likely to be a breach. \n\nIn the case of Taiwan, I expect this is covered by the [Copyright Act](http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?PCODE=J0070017) (as per Laws \\& Regulations Database of the Republic of China) \\- specifically clause 10 \n\n> \"10\\.Public transmission\" means to make available or communicate to\n>  the public the content of a work through sounds or images by wire or\n>  wireless network, or through other means of communication, including\n>  enabling the public to receive the content of such work by any of the\n>  above means at a time or place individually chosen by them.\"\n\ncombined with Article 26\\-1 which states\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in this Act, authors of works have the\n>  exclusive right of public transmission of their works.

I don't mean off\\-brand clones of MagSafe itself, but rather another style of connector which uses the same principle.\n\nIf so, when does the patent expire?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The connector is patented, as you [see here](http://www.google.com/patents/US7311526). It contains 57 claims which define what is protected, and [35 USC 116](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/112) spells out the logic of claims (which, in a nutshell, says \"this can get really complicated\"). The set of claims defines what it patented, and infringement is defined in [35 USC 271](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271) as\n\n> whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any\n>  patented invention, within the United States or imports into the\n>  United States any patented invention during the term of the patent\n>  therefor, infringes the patent\n\nthat is, there isn't anything statutorily more specific about how similar similar is. Since the claims define what is protected, this generally is taken to refer to things that are the same w.r.t. to all of the claims. \"Generally\" means that there is a [doctrine of equivalents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_equivalents), exemplified by [Warner\\-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co. 520 U.S. 17](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/17/case.html), whereby a court may find infringement when there is an insubstantial difference between the allegedly infringing thing and the protected invention.\n\nThe Apple patent does not specify a specific number of millimeters between the contacts, so making a connector that is exactly the same as the Apple device (as marketed) but with different spacing on the connectors would be an infringement, because that spacing is not specified in a claim. A similar device that uses chewing gum rather than magnets to keep it together would not likely be found to be infringing since that is a substantial divergence from what Apple claims it has invented.",

This principle explains why the 2016 amendment allowing letter-only license plates would apply to Romania, even though Romania did not actively ratify this specific amendment. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the amendment process as described in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I filed a FOIA request with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) about 15 months ago (in April of 2020\\). The request was sent out to one of the agency's field offices, which automatically placed it in their \"complex track\". Placement in the track resulted in their notifying me that it could take up to nine months to complete the request.\n\nAfter ten months had passed and the status hadn't changed from \"Document Search\", I reached out to see if they had responsive records and/or an updated timeline. They didn't have either. I then reached out again last month (after 14 months had passed) with no response, and then a few days ago (after 15 months) where they said the same thing as before.\n\nFOIA requires agencies to stick to the basic timelines of 20 working days. But if a request is judged to be complex (more accurately: in certain \"unusual circumstances\" like needing to search field facilities), FOIA also permits agencies to negotiate an extended timeline or narrowed scope with the requester (described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6\\)(B)). The important part of this really lies in clause i of that subparagraph:\n\n> In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.\n\nHowever, that clause limits the extension to 10 working days. Anything beyond that is governed by clause ii:\n\n> With respect to a request for which a written notice under clause (i) extends the time limits prescribed under clause (i) of subparagraph (A), the agency shall notify the person making the request if the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified in that clause and shall provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.\n\nThe law clearly states that any alternative timeline must be arranged with the requester, which was done when they notified me of the request's placement in their complex track. But seeing as how BOP has failed to meet the originally imposed deadline, are they required to provide an updated date of determination upon request? I understand they very well could probably just push the deadline back again, but it would at least be nice to understand their estimated time of completion.\n\nThanks for any guidance you're able to provide!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

According to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(ii), when an agency cannot process a request within the extended time limit they initially provided, they are required to notify the person making the request and provide them with an opportunity to either limit the scope of the request so it can be processed within the time limit, or arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request. \n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate provision of all documents is not mandated, especially if the search is incomplete. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the agency cannot unilaterally extend the deadline without notifying the requester. \n\nOption D is incorrect as there's no provision requiring the closure of the request and resubmission in these circumstances."

Is it my responsibility even if I didn't own the house and there had been 6 other owners before me?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To get an answer tailored to your problem, you need to get a lawyer. The general answer is that the water bill goes with the property, not the person using the water. The unpaid bill can become a lien on the property, and the house can be taken and sold to satisfy the lien. \n\nThere are other factors / questions. Under Florida law ([180\\.135](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0100-0199/0180/Sections/0180.135.html)), if the debt arises from a renter who incurred the debt directly with the utility, a lien cannot be placed against the property. Any lien must be perfected (filed with the courts), and the point of a title search is to find such liens \u2013 assuming that a title search was done.

While water bills generally go with the property, there are exceptions and factors to consider:\n\n1. Under Florida law (180.135), if the debt was incurred by a renter who had a direct agreement with the utility, a lien cannot be placed against the property.\n2. Any lien must be properly filed and perfected with the courts to be valid.\n3. A title search should have revealed any existing liens, so the homeowner should investigate why this wasn't caught earlier.\n4. The 7-year limit on debt collection mentioned in the passage doesn't necessarily apply to property liens, making option A incorrect.\n5. Option B is too absolute, as there are exceptions to the property-tied rule.\n6. Option D is incorrect because the responsibility for the debt doesn't automatically transfer to previous owners; it can remain with the property.\n\nThis question tests understanding of property law, liens, and the complexities of utility debt responsibility in real estate transactions."

They called my name and took me back to the room and the assistant asked to take a front and side picture of my face. I noticed a screen on the wall showing before/after shots of patients facial problems so I told the assistant that I was there for my thumb not any facial issues and she said it was for their records. I said I didn't mind if she took a picture of my thumb but that I didn't see any reason to take pictures of my face. Her tone immediately changed and she quickly finished the interview and left the room. A few minutes later a women walked in and introduced herself as the office manager and explained to me that it was their policy to take pictures of patients for \"security reasons\" and that I would be refused service if I did not comply. I politely told her I understand she has to follow her policies and asked for a refund of my co\\-pay which she provided then I left the office. Can a doctor legally do this? Is this a violation of HIPAA? If so where would I file a complaint?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"Privacy Rule\" ([45 CFR Part 160](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title45/45cfr160_main_02.tpl) and Part 164, [Subparts A, E](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title45/45cfr164_main_02.tpl)) don't forbid this. Sect. 164\\.502 states the general rule:\n\n> (a) Standard. A covered entity or business associate may not use or\n>  disclose protected health information, except as permitted or required\n>  by this subpart or by subpart C of part 160 of this subchapter.\n\n\"Health information\" is defnes in part 160 as\n\n> any information, including genetic information, whether oral or\n>  recorded in any form or medium, that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan,\n>  public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university,\n>  or health care clearinghouse; and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health\n>  or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an\n>  individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision\n>  of health care to an individual.\n\nYour picture would not constitute health information (and anyhow, they are allowed to gather health information, just not freely disseminate it \u2013 the pictures on the wall were presumably with permission).\n\nThere is no general law (which would be state law) against taking a person's picture (though commercially exploiting someone's picture would require permission, via the concept of [personality rights](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11208/what-recourse-do-i-have-against-commercial-use-of-my-image/11212#11212)), and it is directly required in a number of instances (for identification purposes \u2013 school ID, driver's license, passport, voting in some states). It is an unusual requirement and since they scanned your driver's license it is especially inexplicable. Assuming that this is just a story they tell all patients because they want before and after pictures (which you would have to consent to, if you didn't already in one of those \"sign here\" flurries), saying that this is for \"security purposes\" would be untrue, but I don't think it's actually illegal. Taking but not using a photo would not cause you harm, so if you had let them take the picture, there would not be a basis for suing. If they use it for advertising without permission, that would be a problem.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to HIPAA's Privacy Rule, which of the following statements is correct regarding a dermatologist's office taking photographs of patients?\n\nA) It is always a violation of HIPAA for a doctor's office to take photographs of patients without their consent.\n\nB) A doctor's office can legally require patients to allow photographs for security purposes as a condition of treatment.\n\nC) Photographs of patients are automatically considered protected health information under HIPAA.\n\nD) A doctor's office can take photographs of patients, but using them for advertising without permission would be problematic.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Privacy Rule under HIPAA does not specifically forbid taking photographs of patients. The key points are:\n\n1. Photographs themselves are not automatically considered \"health information\" under HIPAA's definition.\n2. Healthcare providers are allowed to gather health information, but they have restrictions on how they can use or disclose it.\n3. There is no general law against taking a person's picture, though using it commercially without permission could be an issue.\n4. While requiring photographs for \"security purposes\" seems unusual, it's not necessarily illegal.\n5. The critical issue would be how the photographs are used. Using them for advertising without the patient's permission would be problematic and potentially violate personality rights.\n\nOption D is correct because it accurately reflects that while taking photos is allowed, using them improperly (like for advertising without consent) would be an issue. Options A and C are incorrect because they misstate the HIPAA rules. Option B is incorrect because while the office can have this policy, it's not necessarily legally enforceable in all circumstances."

If you can, I will be grateful for sure but my search led me to a more general question.\n\nMN has a comparatively easy to use online statute library. <https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/> I searched there for *trailer* and could not find any regulation about how far off the back of a trailer a load can hang (or how far a load can hang off the back of a trailer). I searched CA's statutes and found their rule:\n\n> Vehicle Code \\- VEH\n> \n> \n> DIVISION 15\\. CHAPTER 4\\. Length \\[35400 \\- 35414]\n> \n> \n> 35410\\.\n> *The load upon any motor vehicle alone or an independent load only upon a trailer or semitrailer shall not extend to the rear beyond the last point of support for a greater distance than that equal to two\\-thirds of the length of the wheelbase of the vehicle carrying such load, except that the wheelbase of a semitrailer shall be considered as the distance between the rearmost axle of the towing vehicle and the rearmost axle of the semitrailer.*\n\nSo I know that some states regulate this stuff.\n\nThe fact that I cannot find a statute in MN leads me to hesitantly conclude that the statute does not exist. However, if I get pulled over and cited, I will not be surprised that the rule exists and that I just missed it.\n\nSo, with something like this, how does one go about exhausting the search and (perhaps more interestingly) can we use as a defense the extent to which we searched and the extent to which the statute was nearly impossible to find?\n\nOh, and\u2014is there a rule in MN about load\\-overhang?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: tl;dr: In general, for trailers, the laws I could find seem primarily concerned with the total length and width, rather than overhang.\n\n---\n\nI believe you're looking for Minnesota Statutes sections [169\\.80 SIZE, WEIGHT, LOAD](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169.80) and [169\\.81 HEIGHT AND LENGTH LIMITATIONS](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2020/cite/169.81). There is also a section ([169\\.82](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169.82)) on trailer equipment, but that doesn't seem to have anything about overhang or length.\n\nThey specify various restrictions on load length and overhang.\n\nThis is seemingly the most relevant to towing:\n\n> The total outside width of a low bed trailer or equipment dolly, and the load, used exclusively for transporting farm machinery and construction equipment may not exceed nine feet in width except that a low bed trailer or equipment dolly with a total outside width, including the load, in excess of 102 inches may not be operated on any interstate highway without first having obtained a permit for the operation under section 169\\.86\\. The vehicle must display 12\\-inch square red flags as markers at the front and rear of the left side of the vehicle.\n\nFor overhang specifically: For trailers, the law seems mostly concerned with the total width and length, as described above. For loads carried directly by vehicles, there are various provisions, such as:\n\n> No passenger\\-type vehicle shall be operated on any highway with any load carried thereon extending beyond the line of the fenders on the left side of such vehicle nor extending more than six inches beyond the line of the fenders on the right side thereof\n\nand\n\n> The load upon any vehicle operated alone, or the load upon the front vehicle of a combination of vehicles, shall not extend more than three feet beyond the front wheels of such vehicle or the front bumper of such vehicle if it is equipped with such a bumper.",

She receives an E\\-mail from Bob, a New York State Citizen, in which he claims to have sexually incriminating material collected by tapping into Alice's webcam. Bob demands money via Bitcoin to not share the material with the public. Alice does not own a Webcam so knows that such material doesn't exist, but feels annoyed and informs the police, and does also not pay.\n\nNow, in real life, we know that it is nigh impossible to trace the e\\-mail back to Bob, but for the exercise, assume that *somehow* the police manage to identify Bob based on his Bitcoin wallet into which *some* person they can not identify has paid. Still, they bring it to the prosecution. Bob is found to never had the material they claimed to own for any of the people he sent such mail to.\n\nNew York State Prosecutor Charles wants to bring suit but then pauses: The behavior of Bob appears to be extortion, but does this fit the letter of the law? It is clearly not [NYPC \u00a7 135\\.60](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article135.php#p135.60), as no physical force is there, but maybe [NYPC \u00a7 155\\.05(2\\)(e)](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article155.php#p155.05) could work.\n\nSo Charles brings the suit under NYPC $ 155\\.05(2\\)(e)(v), because he believes that the unidentified person has been acting out of fear to be publically humiliated...\n\nNow, the question is: Is that actually the right section or might the whole case be in the wrong venue (e.g. belonging to federal court as wire fraud)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bob appears to have committed \"attempted larceny\" by extortion, contrary to [\u00a7 155\\.05(2\\)(e)(v)](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/155.05):\n\n> (e) **By extortion.**\n> \n> \n> A person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so delivered, the actor or another will:\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (v) Expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or\n> false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule;\n\nSee [\u00a7 110\\.00](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/110.00):\n\n> **Attempt to commit a crime.**\n> \n> \n> A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime.\n\nAnd see [\u00a7 110\\.10](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/110.10) which covers the \"impossibility\" that Bob actually had compromising images from Alice's non\\-existent webcam:\n\n> **Attempt to commit a crime; no defense.**\n> \n> \n> If the conduct in which a person engages otherwise constitutes an attempt to commit a crime pursuant to section 110\\.00, it is no defense to a prosecution for such attempt that the crime charged to have been attempted was, under the attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such crime could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as such person believed them to be.\n\n(NB Bob's sentence, if found guilty, would depend the value of his attempted extortion)",

Bob can be charged with attempted larceny by extortion under New York Penal Code \u00a7 155.05(2)(e)(v). This is because:\n\n1. The law covers attempts to obtain property by instilling fear of exposing secrets or publicizing facts that could subject a person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\n2. New York Penal Code \u00a7 110.00 defines attempt as engaging in conduct intended to commit a crime, even if unsuccessful.\n3. \u00a7 110.10 specifically states that factual impossibility (Bob not actually having the incriminating material) is not a defense against attempted crimes.\n4. The crime would have been possible if the circumstances were as Bob claimed them to be.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while wire fraud could potentially apply, the question focuses on New York state law, and attempted larceny by extortion is a valid charge under state jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the impossibility of committing the actual crime does not negate the attempt, as per \u00a7 110.10.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because \u00a7 135.60 deals with coercion involving physical force or threats, which doesn't apply in this case.

I learnt of it the hard way, by being denied boarding on a Pegasus flight from Istanbul to Bergamo (despite calling the border police in Bergamo, who sent a clearance message to Pegasus).\n\nI then e\\-mailed my IATA contact and asked him to ask their Italian government sources to re\\-confirm this restriction. It was found not to exist whereby Timatic was corrected.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You've asked a two part question.\n\n> \\[Is this a violation of] the international policy that a country should never refuse entry to verified citizens of their own?\n\nIn considering that question, the US example may be illuminative. The US requires US citizens to have a \"passport book\" when flying into the US, even though the US issues \"passport cards\" that serve as proof of nationality. If you can get to the border and prove your US nationality (by passport card or otherwise), they'll let you in, but airlines won't board you unless you have a passport book. If you don't have a passport book, you're supposed to get to the nearest consulate and apply for a passport before flying to the US.\n\nBut note that the US obligation to admit its own citizens is principally a feature of US law. CBP does not waive [8 USC 1185](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1185) because of some international body; there is no body that enforces international \"policies\" of this nature. Rather, they do so because they know that the federal courts would require them to admit US citizens based on the right of free movement implicit in US law.\n\nIf someone were unable to get into their country of citizenship and unable to gain legal residence elsewhere then unless they could remain on the run for the rest of their life they would eventually end up as the subject of negotiation between whatever country is trying to deport them and their country of citizenship. In other words, in the worst case, such people become a bilateral diplomatic matter between two countries. Therefore, any challenge to the restriction would have to go through the Italian or EU legal system.\n\n> Is this a violation of the EU freedom of movement directive, whereby a verified EU/EFTA national cannot normally be refused entry to any EU/EFTA state?\n\nIt certainly seems to be, but without a decision from an EU court, we can't be certain. From Article 5 of the freedom of movement directive ([2004/38/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616)):\n\n> Article 5\n> \n> \n> Right of entry\n> \n> \n> 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to the provisions on travel documents applicable to national border controls, Member States shall grant Union citizens leave to enter their territory with a valid identity card or passport and shall grant family members who are not nationals of a Member State leave to enter their territory with a valid passport.\n> \n> \n> No entry visa or equivalent formality may be imposed on Union citizens.\n\nThis doesn't say anything about allowing EU citizens to *board aircraft* from non\\-EU destinations without their EU passports. So if Italy makes a rule that EU citizens need a passport to board a flight to Italy from outside the EU and Schengen area, that doesn't seem to violate Article 5 except by implication. It would be for a court to decide whether that implication is in fact present.\n\nBecause Article 5 doesn't say anything about where the passenger has flown from, we can also consider the case of a dual citizen of an EU member state and a \"third country,\" who might fly to Italy using the third\\-country passport, and then present a national ID card at the immigration counter. If such a traveler were denied entry, that would appear to violate Article 5\\. If that traveler's other nationality were one that required a visa in the non\\-EU passport, the traveler might have a stronger case that Italy's rule infringes on the right of free movement.\n\nEU or EFTA citizens could also challenge the restriction more generally as an infringement on the right of free movement that is established in the [Treaty on European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12012M/TXT) (TEU), even if the directive itself does not prohibit the restriction. For example, one might argue that free movement is restricted because there are countries *to* which EU citizens can travel with only an ID card, but *from* which they cannot return to Italy with only that card.\n\nIn addition, non\\-Italian EU or EFTA citizens could challenge the more restrictive regime applied to them on the argument that it violates the principle of non\\-discrimination articulated in Article 9 of the TEU:\n\n> Article 9\n> \n> \n> In all its activities, the Union shall observe the principle of the equality of its citizens, who shall receive equal attention from its institutions, bodies, offices and agencies....\n\nFurthermore, non\\-Italians *residing in Italy* could challenge the more restrictive regime on the basis of Article 24 of the directive:\n\n> Article 24\n> \n> \n> Equal treatment\n> \n> \n> 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0Subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided for in the Treaty and secondary law, all Union citizens residing on the basis of this Directive in the territory of the host Member State shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of that Member State within the scope of the Treaty.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An Italian citizen attempts to enter Italy from Egypt using only their national ID card. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The Italian citizen should be allowed entry without issue, as Italy cannot refuse entry to its own citizens.\nB) The Italian citizen should be denied entry, as Egypt is not on the list of countries from which Italian citizens can enter using only an ID card.\nC) The Italian citizen should be allowed entry, as Egypt is on the list of countries from which Italian citizens can enter using only an ID card.\nD) The situation is unclear and would likely require a court decision to determine if this restriction violates EU freedom of movement directives.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, Italian citizens can only use their IDs to enter Italy if they have flown from an EU/EFTA state, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Tunisia or Turkey. Egypt is on this list, so an Italian citizen flying from Egypt should be allowed to enter Italy using only their national ID card. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the restriction does exist for Italian citizens coming from certain countries. Option B is incorrect because Egypt is actually on the list of allowed countries. Option C is the correct interpretation of the given information. Option D, while potentially true for other scenarios, is not the most accurate answer in this specific case where the rules are clearly stated."

Am I right to think of the structure of information (at least in the patent realm) as:\n\n1. USC title 35 \\= high level source, compilation of laws\n2. MPEP \\= detailed guidance on interpretation of the USC title 35\n3. Guidance docs and cases \\= further colour on the interpretation of law along with Interim updates to the MPEP, until the MPEP is updated.\n\nDo all titles of the USC have an associated manual along with supporting guidance documents?\nHow often does the manual get updated?\n\nDelving a little deeper: I understand that the manual of patent examining procedure serves to provide guidance for use by USPTO professionals in applying the laws set forth in USC 35\\.\n\nI don't see mention of the judicial exceptions (abstract ideas/laws of nature/natural phenomena) in the USC. Is the MPEP along with guidance documents such as [these](https://www.uspto.gov/patent/laws-and-regulations/examination-policy/subject-matter-eligibility)/relevant cases the only place to find information on them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Other Authorities**\n\nYou are missing at least several important sources of authority, which include:\n\n(1\\) The United States Constitution;\n\n(2\\) the set of regulations issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at [Title 37, Chapter I](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/chapter-I); \n\n(3\\) applicable international treaties;\n\n(4\\) case law with the most important being the U.S. Supreme Court, followed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, followed by U.S. District Court cases on point; and \n\n(5\\) case law from the administrative bodies of the PTO.\n\nAll of the above and the sources you mention are \"primary sources\". \n\nThese are interpreted collectively in \"Treatises\" on patent law which are often cited on issues where primary authority is either too thin, or so numerous that it is not easily summarized merely by resort to primary authority. A number of them are listed [here](http://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/treatise-finders/intellectualproperty).\n\nChisum on Patents is the leading treatise in the field and should usually be your first destination. It will mention most of the relevant primary source authority in the subject area you are researching.\n\n**Priority of Authorities**\n\nThe CFR is superior to the MPEP but inferior to Title 35\\. \n\nTreaties are co\\-equal with Title 35 with conflicts resolved by the date of enactment. \n\nCase law of the U.S. Supreme Court trumps everything (even, in practice, the language of the United States Constitution).\n\nCase law from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Federal Circuit trumps everything except the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the very long string of recent reversals of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by the U.S. Supreme Court (almost one or two a year for the last decade or so), however, every Federal Circuit case should be analyzed to determine if it has been implicitly overturned or limited by the applicable U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence.\n\nThe United States Constitution trumps everything except U.S. Supreme Court cases and cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (these cases impliedly provide definitive interpretations of the United States Constitution). \n\nCase law from a U.S. District Court is not binding on anyone but the parties to the case, but is highly persuasive and in practice is about on a par with the MPEP, but subordinate to the CFR and administrative case law of PTO bodies.\n\nOne complicated aspect of case law is that it is only binding when it resolves a question of law necessary to resolve to decide the case before it. Sometimes opinions go off on tangents which discuss other questions of law not before the court and that is called \"dicta\" which is persuasive on that point of law, but not binding and not as authoritative. It is not always obvious what constitutes the binding portion of a court decision and what constitutes dicta.\n\nAnother complexity in case law involves concurring or dissenting opinions in cases. Dissenting opinions, obviously, are not binding on anyone but sometimes clarify the scope of the majority opinion. If there is a plurality opinion and a concurring opinion in a case, they have equal weight and neither opinion's rule is definitive except to the extent that they agree. Generally speaking a majority opinion will be binding relative to a concurring opinion in the same case, but that status isn't really definitive and a concurring opinion should be considered even when it accompanies a majority opinion even though the concurring opinion shouldn't be considered binding in that situation.\n\nOf course, all case law (and for that matter all other authority) can be made obsolete by subsequent amendments to Title 35 or by the adoption of new treaties.\n\nA treatise isn't binding on anyone, but a well reasoned passage from a leading treatise like Chisum will, in practice, be given weight a little below a U.S. Court for the Federal Circuit case, but often greater than any lesser source of authority on a topic. A well reasoned passage in a lesser treatise is typically given a weight comparable to a U.S. District Court case that is on point.\n\n**Loose Ends**\n\nOne of the important sources for prior art is the compendium of all patents ever issued by the United States (the vast majority of which have expired and entered the public domain). You can get them all for a very reasonable cost in electronic form. The compendium of patents which have not expired is obviously relevant when attempting to determine if a potential patent or technique or process of a client infringes on any existing patent.\n\nThere are also some patent issues (e.g. jurisdiction and venue in patent disputes) which depend upon other Titles of the United States Code and have the same priority as Title 35 of the United States Code.\n\nThere are circumstances in which the procedural rules of various courts which issue relevant case law are relevant. Each type of court has its own rules of procedure, and each particular court has its own local rules. (This is not hypothetical, I've had a case involving patent law in which three\\-quarters of the motion practice in the heavily litigated case depended upon the local rules of practice in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.)\n\nPrecedents of U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, and precedents from U.S. Court of Appeal for Circuits other than the Federal Circuit, are sometimes relevant as well (e.g. interpreting procedural court rules, rules of evidence, or very general principles of law that aren't restricted to patent law such as the *ex post facto* clause of the U.S. Constitution). But, for the most part, patent case law arises in U.S. District Courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court and the administrative tribunals of the PTO.\n\nIssues related to the relationship between an attorney and a client in patent law cases (e.g. attorney malpractice law in patent cases) is a question of state law rather than federal law.",

Therefore it is almost impossible to prove that this has happened. Several cases in the wider \u201cpolicing\u201d regime have suggested that even if statistically certain groups are disproportionately targeted then that is not evidence of such targeting in a particular case.\n\nFurther it is not clear if you would even have standing to sue \\- to prevent this kind of discrimination you have to show that you *personally* at risk of harm in the future.\n\nClearly this state of affairs is problematical \\- there is little doubt that airport screening, not just in the USA but worldwide is tainted by this sort of bias. The data shows it as well as plenty of anecdotal evidence \\- I\u2019m 1st generation Australian with UK and Australian parents, my son\u2019s girlfriend is 2nd generation but her grandparents were Thai: she gets stopped way more than I do.\n\nThis is bad not just because it\u2019s antithetical to human rights but also because it is demonstrably less effective than purely random screening \\- where there is bias, that bias can be gamed. [This](https://thepointsguy.com/2015/06/does-tsa-screening-really-work/) article from a TSA employee states \"Behavior Detection Officers (the guys who walk around and watch to see if you look creepy) are useless, and there are widespread rumors within TSA that the BDO program won\u2019t be around for much longer.\" \"The guys\" are people and, like all of us, are subject to overt and subconscious bias in deciding what \"look\\[s] creepy\".\n\nNotwithstanding, security is never \u201cobliged\u201d to \u201cskip\u201d a search even if the reason for that search is arguably illegitimate. You made the travel arrangements and you take the risk that you will not have enough time between flights for this or any other reason.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A traveler with a Muslim name frequently experiences advanced searches at airports, causing them to miss connecting flights. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation in the United States?\n\nA) This practice violates the 4th Amendment, as it constitutes an unreasonable search based solely on the traveler's name.\n\nB) The TSA is legally obligated to skip advanced searches if they would cause a traveler to miss a connecting flight.\n\nC) While potentially discriminatory, this practice is difficult to legally challenge due to issues of consent and the difficulty in proving bias as the sole factor.\n\nD) The traveler can easily sue the TSA for violating their 14th Amendment rights, as statistical evidence of disproportionate targeting is sufficient proof of discrimination.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This answer is correct because:\n1. The 4th Amendment is not violated, as travelers consent to searches when entering airport security.\n2. TSA is not obligated to skip searches, even if they cause missed flights.\n3. While potentially discriminatory, it's extremely difficult to prove that ethnicity or name was the sole factor in selection for advanced screening.\n4. TSA agents are not required to explain their reasons for selections.\n5. Statistical evidence of disproportionate targeting has been deemed insufficient to prove discrimination in individual cases.\n6. Demonstrating standing to sue requires proving personal risk of future harm, which is challenging in this context."

I\u2019ve seen this discussed in House of Lords decisions, possibly also court of appeal ones, and it further came up last night in a discussion with an English person on the history of personal monikers in England and the proposition that all English surnames come from one of four origins (patronymic, locative, profession, personal characteristic).\n\nIn any event, what is the basis and/or rationale for that doctrine, and what are the particular terms of its functioning?\n\nHas it changed and evolved over the centuries? What did it mean in the past? Was there an expectation that one maintained a consistent identity across all of the spheres and contexts in their life over any one period? Or could one assume one identity in their work, another at university, and then marry under yet another name? And maintain all of these identities simultaneously?\n\nOr is it more to say that any time one wishes to change their moniker they are allowed to so long as they assume that new identity in all aspects of their life?\n\nTo what extent and how has that doctrine changed over the years, and did the domesday book play a pivotal role in the situation changing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The common law is permissive\n----------------------------\n\nThat is to say that, in a common law jurisdiction, the law is about what you **must not** do rather than about what you **must** do. Now, particular statutes may be phrased as requiring certain actions but, if you read them the \u201ccommon law way\u201d to coin a phrase, they are really imposing sanctions for doing the prohibited thing that falls outside those parameters.\n\nSince there is no legal prohibition on using multiple names (simultaneously or sequentially) you are free to do so.\n\nNow, there are common law prohibitions of, for example, fraud or tax evasion. So, if you use different names *for the purpose* of doing those prohibited things, then that is illegal but it is the specific criminality that is sanctioned, not the use of the alias in perpetrating it.\n\nThe UK has a law that makes it a crime to not register the birth of a child. It also imposes some (and by most country\u2019s standards, very few) restrictions on the name a child can be registered under. But there is no legal obligation on the child or their parents to use the registered name in any particular circumstances. There may be difficulties (amounting to impossibility in some cases) in obtaining a passport, opening a bank account, or claiming social security under a non\\-registered name but that is due to the necessity to *identify* the individual for which the name serves as a proxy.\n\nHowever, outside the requirements of specific statutes or administrative procedures, the common law position is that your name is what people call you and you identify as your name. The second part is important \\- I have been called dickhead on many occasions but I do not consider it to be my name.\n\nThe UK has a patronymic tradition for surnames so, usually, on marriage, the female adopts the surname of the male and that, through the marriage certificate, becomes her registered name. However, it is extremely common for women to continue to use their original (and now not registered) name in their professional life and her new name in her private life. This can be problematic. My wife, has on server all occasions been refused permission to board a plane because the ticket (booked by others) was in her maiden name \\- a name for which she has no official identification. However, that\u2019s a procedural problem \\- she didn\u2019t do anything illegal.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In English common law, which of the following statements best describes the legal doctrine regarding the use of multiple names?\n\nA) It is illegal to use different names in different aspects of one's life simultaneously.\nB) One must legally change their name through official channels before using a new name in any context.\nC) People are free to use any name they choose, as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes.\nD) The use of multiple names is only permitted if all names are registered with the government.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to the common law tradition in England, people are generally free to use any name they choose, as long as it's not for fraudulent or illegal purposes. This is based on the permissive nature of common law, which focuses on what is prohibited rather than what is required.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not prohibit the use of different names in different contexts of one's life.\n\nOption B is incorrect as there is no legal requirement to officially change one's name before using a new one. The common law allows for flexibility in name usage.\n\nOption C correctly captures the essence of the common law approach, emphasizing freedom of choice in name usage while noting the limitation on fraudulent purposes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no requirement to register all names with the government. While birth registration is required, subsequent name usage is not strictly regulated.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the permissive nature of common law regarding name usage, the absence of strict legal requirements for name changes, and the key limitation on using names for fraudulent purposes."

However, the same is true of various humans. The real legal question is whether a wolf (or other animal) has standing to sue (with the aid of a crafty attorney). The question is not entirely decided in the US, but the odds for animals having standing in court are poor.\n\nIn the case of [Naruto v.

The camera owner published the photos and claimed copyright: PETA and others then filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the photographer, acting on behalf of the macaque (assigned the name Naruto). The court dismissed the case, but the specific reason was that PETA failed to assert \"next friend\" status, especially that \"the next friend has some significant relationship with, and is truly dedicated to the best interests of, the petitioner\".\n\nIn an earlier decision, [Cetacean Community v.

But there is also Article III (constitutional) standing. The court notes that\n\n> Article III does not compel the conclusion that a statutorily\n> authorized suit in the name of an animal is not a \"case or\n> controversy.\" As commentators have observed, nothing in the text of\n> Article III explicitly limits the ability to bring a claim in federal\n> court to humans.\n\n...\n\n> It is obvious that an animal cannot function as a plaintiff in the\n> same manner as a juridically competent human being.

While some courts have suggested it might be possible, it's far from a settled issue.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Naruto v. Slater was dismissed on procedural grounds related to PETA's status as a \"next friend,\" not because of a definitive ruling on animal standing.\n\nOption C is correct.

Non\\-appearance of a party or their representing lawyer is a bad idea as it might incur contempt of court.\n\nSuch a court date can be used to (once more) inform the court and other parties of the stay. Paperwork that might have been delayed in postal service is then given over under the eyes of the judge, pretty much ensuring that the other parties did get them and nobody may cry foul play. Possibly the meeting can be used by the attorney to reschedule other court dates or depositions if the stay has a specific time length.\n\nAlso note, that not all stays are for the whole case but might only rule to stay parts of it: a divorce case that includes a case for visitation of a child might stay the visitation part till a related case about where the child will live in the future is solved, but continue on the parts that try to sort out the divorce itself.

Even when a stay order is issued by a higher court, it's crucial for parties and their lawyers to continue appearing for scheduled hearings in the lower court. This is for several reasons:\n\n1. To officially inform the lower court about the stay order and ensure all parties are aware.\n2. To handle any administrative matters or paperwork related to the stay.\n3.
