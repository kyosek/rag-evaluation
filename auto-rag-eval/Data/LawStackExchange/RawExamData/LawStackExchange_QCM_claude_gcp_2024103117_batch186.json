In fact, it is even more liberal than the US, including representation in civil cases for the most part as well (there are a few exceptions, like libel, and from what I've read, even that is changing). \n\nRather than the main source of free representation being called public defenders, they are referred to as Legal Aid, which is a government funded agency much like public defenders are in the United States.\n\nArticle 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that legal aid will be made available to those who lack sufficient resources, in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.\n\nIn the event legal aid is too busy to accept a new client, the court will appoint a solicitor from a list of private firms/practitioners that will act in the same capacity.\n\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees the right to a fair trial in both civil and criminal proceedings. This has been interpreted as providing for a general requirement of some measure of \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the state and the individual or between the parties in the case, and the overall structure of the article, as well as the case law of the Court, stresses the vital connection between the right to legal assistance and the general interest in guaranteeing the right to a fair trial. \n\nWhen faced with a criminal charge, the right to legal assistance is explicitly set out in Article 6 (3\\) (c). An entitlement to free legal aid in civil cases is available in cases where the absence of legal support would make any equality of arms impossible and would effectively deprive an applicant of access to the proceedings as such, for example, when a case can be filed to a court only if assisted by a lawyer in circumstances when an applicant cannot clearly afford one. \n\nMy guess is, if your friend was denied counsel under legal aid, she has too much income or to many assets to qualify, or she is involved in a case that does not qualify. That said, the right to counsel in in the UK is a right for the indigent in most types of cases (even civil) and is becoming more and more fundamental as imposed by findings of the European Court of Human Rights Jurisprudence. \n\nHere is a link where you can at least begin to get some information.\n\n[https://www.gov.uk/legal\\-aid/overview](https://www.gov.uk/legal-aid/overview)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about legal representation in the UK is NOT correct?\n\nA) Legal Aid in the UK provides free lawyers for both criminal and most civil cases.\nB) The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to a fair trial only in criminal proceedings.\nC) If Legal Aid is too busy to accept a new client, the court will appoint a solicitor from a list of private firms.\nD) Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides for legal aid to those who lack sufficient resources.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is incorrect.

My mom is nearing 60 years of age.\n\n**The issue**\n\nMy sister and I are like night and day. I completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree debt free, have $100,000\\+ in savings and got hired out of college as a software developer at a healthy $90,000 starting salary. My sister on the other hand has a long history of psychiatric problems, drug use and promiscuity. She has dropped out of college and has **net earnings of \\< $5,000 annually**. She never has more than $20 in her bank account and spends all her money on reiki healing, crystals and all that other pseudoscientific healing garbage. My sister also lives off my mom and has never held a serious job. **Psychiatrists have suggested diagnoses of both schizophrenia and/or borderline personality disorder**.\n\nI have severe concerns about inheriting a home jointly with someone who is disordered should anything happen to my mom. Myself and my sister get along (usually) however the big issue is that she has nowhere to go should my mom pass away and will refuse to sell the home whereas I want to sell the home as fast as possible such that I do not own a joint venture with her. **She does not understand that owning a home doesn't mean one \"owns\" the home \\- there is mortgage to pay, property taxes, utilities, etc. In her opinion, this is a conspiracy by Big Brother government to overthrow the public.** Inevitably, the home will be lost due non\\-payment, neglect, among other possibilities.\n\n**The question**\n\nA question from my mom: Is it possible to re\\-draft a will such that a third party could sell the home on our behalf?

Having researched these yourself, you will be in a far more equipped position when talking to a lawyer to get things underway.\n\n**Direction 1: Trusts**\n\nYour issue may not be solvable by a will because what a will does is essentially **distribute** assets. It simply specifies who gets what of what the deceased owned \u2014 as opposed to ordering people to do certain things. The house could certainly be granted to a third party, but there will be no way to oblige that party to sell it and transfer back to you; they could keep it for themselves and you and your sister would get nothing.\n\nA [trust](https://www.investopedia.com/university/estate-planning-guide/estate-planning5.asp) (instead of a will) can probably be a solution.\n\n**Direction 2: Guardianship of your sister**\n\nMentally ill persons can own property but their ability to decide what to do with it can be taken away by [guardianship](https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/guardianship-and-mental-illness/).

If the authorities that enforce a statute affirm that they are not enforcing it, this is often enough to defeat a case on standing grounds.\n\nFor example, rather than establishing a landmark precedent decriminalizing polygamy (or declining to do so), the 10th Circuit held in *[Brown v. Buhman](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/14-4117/14-4117-2016-04-11.html)*, Case No. 14\\-4117 (10th Cir. April 11, 2016\\), that the case must be dismissed without prejudice as moot, because the Utah District Attorney's office who was sued in the case adopted a policy in May of 2012 that it would only prosecute polygamy cases when they were incident to frauds committed on a prospective spouse or third parties, effectively freeing the Sister Wives family from risk of prosecution.\n\nThe end result creates no precedent on the underlying issue of the decriminalization of polygamy (which also would have invalidated a virtually identical Colorado statute), and shifted the official prosecution policy of just one DA's office in Utah that can be changed prospectively at any time. The key language of the ruling was as follows:\n\n> The Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cUCAO\u201d) subsequently closed its\n> file on the Browns and adopted a policy (\u201cthe UCAO Policy\u201d) under\n> which the Utah County Attorney will bring bigamy prosecutions only\n> against those who (1\\) induce a partner to marry through\n> misrepresentation or (2\\) are suspected of committing a collateral\n> crime such as fraud or abuse. The Browns fall into neither category.\n> Nonetheless, the district court denied the Utah County Attorney\u2019s\n> motion to dismiss the case as moot and instead granted summary\n> judgment to the Browns.\n\nSimilarly, while the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals finally reached the issue in 2019 (upholding its constitutionality), many earlier constitutional challenges to the exclusion from income for federal income tax purposes for a minister's housing allowance under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 on First Amendment establishment clause grounds, were dismissed for lack of standing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of constitutional law challenges, which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in a case being dismissed for lack of standing?\n\nA) A plaintiff challenging a law that is actively being enforced against them\nB) A government agency adopting a policy of non-enforcement for a potentially unconstitutional law\nC) A plaintiff who has suffered direct economic harm from a law\nD) A case where multiple plaintiffs with varied circumstances challenge a law\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect.

Direct economic harm usually provides strong grounds for standing in a legal challenge.\nD) Incorrect. Having multiple plaintiffs with varied circumstances often strengthens a case's standing, as it demonstrates the law's wide-ranging effects.\n\nThe correct answer illustrates how an unconstitutional law can remain in effect if no case with proper standing can be brought to challenge it, which was the central point of the original question."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89351/what-are-the-consequences-if-any-of-admitting-to-a-crime-one-did-not-commit", "docs_id": 89351, "title": "What are the consequences (if any) of admitting to a crime one did not commit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say that Vicky the Victim is murdered by Mark the murderer. However, Mark's best friend Fred doesn't want Mark to go to jail.

But if, somehow, it comes out that Fred was innocent of the crime, and he was actually trying to take the fall for Mark, then what consequences could Fred face?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A confession is (usually) taken after the court finishes its pre\\-trialing stage. There is a weightage and importance of such confession determined before the calculation of the gravity score of such crime.\n\nIf the attorney somehow (fakely) proves Fred as the killer, Mark is declared innocent, and later on its discovered that Fred is innocent; the court can take some action against Fred.\n\nIt would be first checked whether was Fred in a logical state of mind or not. If being manipulated by Mark, it would not be their fault of Fred. The court will also most likely see the age of the confessor to determine the importance of this. Here is a source from the National Registry of Exonerations which states the age of crime, and the percentage of groups with false crime declarations:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1rrf.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1rrf.jpg)\n\nOne reason is that minors can be easily psychologically manipulated, and so by chance Fred if under 18 would not be considered to give any worth of confession unless proven to go against him.\n\nIn some cases, the individual who made the false confession may be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice, particularly if their false confession led to an innocent person being convicted or if their false testimony impeded an ongoing investigation when the individual is not a minor. This is covered by perjury, a crime of expressing fake statements. In United States Code, Chapter 79 of Section 1632, it states:\n\n> (1\\) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\n\n> in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\n> is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.\n\nThe following law only applies to a sensible adult, who has intentionally, without a psychological circumstance, made a false statement to defend someone. It is hard later, for the prosecutor to prove the claimant innocent if the confession has solid ground and worth.\n\n---\n\nNote that though false confession can come under perjury crime, an exemption exists for minors or those psychologically unwell or influenced. It reminds us of *Miranda v Arizona*, where Miranda, an inmate in prison cased over by Phoenix Police (Credits:[@TannerSwett](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/18320/tanner-swett)) who would torture an innocent inmate to confess a crime. In collective terms, it was called Miranda Warnings, where the inmate was warned, using torture to confess fakely.\n\nIt would be clear from torture. In the 1936 case *Brown v. Mississippi*, which was the first time the Supreme Court excluded a confession from a state court prosecution, this was the issue. For days, three suspects had been tortured. The deputy in charge testified when asked how hard one of the defendants had been whipped: Not too much for a Black person; not nearly as much as I would have done if I had been in charge.\n\nAn image of courtesy, The Crisis Magazine 1935:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVT2q.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVT2q.jpg)\n\nThe Supreme Court passed American reforms where Miranda was passed, and torturing was banned with evidence for both interrogation and confession. At the time Miranda was written, more \"modern\" methods of questioning were being used: rather than beating, isolation, deception, and exhaustion. It seems unlikely that an innocent suspect would confess to a serious crime if they were not subjected to torture or other forms of violence or death threats. Confessions are extremely potent forms of proof of guilt for precisely this reason.\n\nTo sum up, we conclude:\n\n1. If Fred was a stable adult, he is punished under the perjury crime\n2.

Otherwise, you have no basic for taking them to court. On the other and, you could be trying to say something entirely different, namely that someone has taken the name of your goods but not the goods themselves, and sold something else under your name (or a very close approximation therein). That could be trademark infringement, and you could go to court over that.\n\nThe nature of your product name would matter significant. If the product were named \"Artisanal Jewelry\", there is little hope for success for success in a lawsuit (given that this is not a registered name). Such a name is a descriptive mark, and you would have to prove that the public associates \"Artisanal Jewelry\" specifically with your product. If the product is named Xoachhcaox Jewelry, that is an arbitrary and unique name, and it would not be too difficult to establish that they have infringed your trademark right. Let's say that the competitor names their product Xoachcaox Jewelry \u2013 the likelihood that a person would be confused as to which is which is very high.

However, I am interested in how to write an NDA from scratch DIY without a lawyer, and am having a hard time finding any examples online that seem respectable.\n\nIf one would like to share information with another party (either an employee of another company or just a friend or acquaintance), I am confused as to what exactly would count as a valid NDA.\n\nFrom what I've seen, many of the example NDAs say something along the lines of \"...confidential information will be shared orally, and followed up in 30 days in written form so as to be valid.\" I was initially under the impression that just having the NDA say everything was purely communicated orally \\-\\- with nothing in writing \\-\\- would be sufficient. But maybe perhaps writing down what is confidential that was talked about somehow makes it better.\n\nAlso, I don't see how you can write it down efficiently enough, so as to avoid essentially creating a detailed patent document lol. If you describe orally something for an hour, that could be the outline of a patent in principle, so it would seem that you would then need to \"follow up with them in 30 days or less with a written form of the confidential information\". This to me seems (a) hard and time consuming, and (b) a security leak. At the same time it would help clarify exactly what was talked about, that's for sure.\n\nSo my question is, what the key attributes are of an effective (software related) one\\-sided NDA.\n\nIt seems to me that you could simply have a generic NDA for all of potential software ideas, saying basically \"Anything I share with you related to any legally allowable business activity or idea is confidential\" and that's it, not needing to list anything in particular. Once you start saying you need to list particular things, I don't see how you can avoid going down the rabbit hole and writing a detailed patent\\-like document.\n\nAlso I'm wondering what sorts of edge cases you must cover. Or, in general, if a legal document must cover every possible edge case, or can somehow just cover the main ones and leave the rest as assumed somehow. For example, some NDAs say something to the effect of \"You are free to reveal the confidential information to authorities if it comes down to it\" or \"You may disclose information to whomever if you first get written permission from me.\" I don't see why it's necessary to say this stuff. There's so much you could potentially say, I don't see why you can just leave this out. If it turns out that the situation comes up where they would like to disclose something in the future to someone, then they could ask you and you could come up with an amendment to the contract, or another contract specific to that. It seems better that way, rather than trying to cover every edge case, but I'm not sure what is the best approach.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not that easy. There is no such thing as an all\\-encompassing perfect contract, nor are there magical words. In fact, many contracts contain uses language such as the one you found (example: the \"freedom\" to reveal confidential information to authorities \"if it comes down to it\") or are in violation of legislation.\n\nThe protocol you saw as to oral disclosure and its 30\\-day follow up really helps no purpose.

There are also data residency concerns that the website must be hosted on the University's servers instead of services like GitHub Pages or Netlify because of that.\n\nI view these concerns with a great deal of incredulity. **Is a site that collects no visitor data yet displays publicly available information affected by the GDPR?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, whether that information is public or not. The student website is definitely processing personal data of faculty. Any website is also necessarily processing personal data of visitors due to technical reasons, even though hosting has been outsourced to a third party. There's always a server, you just might not be managing it yourself.\n\nThus, GDPR applies.\n\nJust because it processes personal data doesn't mean that the student website would be illegal. It just means the students are responsible for GDPR compliance of that website. Since the website is controlled by students and not by the university, the university DPO has no say here and the university can't demand the website to be hosted in a particular manner. Nevertheless, the DPO's suggestions might be quite sensible.\n\nTypical GDPR compliance steps include:\n\n* having a clear purpose for which the personal data is being processed\n* having a legal basis for that processing (here, probably a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d which will require a balancing test), see Art 6\n* providing transparent information to the data subjects\n\t+ providing a privacy notice to website visitors, see Art 13\n\t+ notifying faculty per the requirements in Art 14 GDPR\n* preparing to fulfill data subject rights such as access, rectification, and erasure\n\t+ when using a legitimate interest, there's also a right to \u201cobject\u201d (opt\\-out)\n* implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security and compliance of your processing activities, see Art 24\\+32\n* making sure that third parties to which you outsource processing activities are contractually bound as \u201cdata processors\u201d to only use the data as instructed by you, see Art 28\n* if you transfer data to non\\-European countries, having appropriate safeguards in place\n\nDoes this sound complicated? It can be complicated. The point is that the internet is no longer the lawless Wild West. Just because you *can* easily publish a site with personal data, doesn't mean that you *should*. The GDPR is about requiring data controllers to find an appropriate balance with the rights and interests of the affected persons. Of course there are countries with less regulation, but there are also countries with fewer taxes and that isn't necessarily good for society.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid these responsibilities will be to stop publishing the site as students \u2013 and instead taking up the university DPO's offer to have the university run the site. Which is less fun, of course, but the adult thing to do. If this motivates you further: note that the data controller (the people responsible for the site) must publish their contact information in the privacy notice, typically name \\+ email \\+ street address.\n\nThe GDPR contains no exceptions that would help here.\n\n* There is an exception for purely personal or household activities. But if the website would be available to the general public, it would be difficult to argue that this is purely personal. There's also case law such as the *Lindqvist* case requiring a narrow interpretation of that exception.\n* In Art 9, the GDPR does mention that some restrictions are lifted if the data subject made the information public themselves.

In saying \"*reduce* the Software to a human\\-perceivable form\", the choice of the word \"reduce\" is no doubt significant. A reasonable man would conclude that an effort to simplify the raw binary code into something more graspable (such as opcodes) is a reduction to perceivable form. However, a screen dump via cat or a hex print doesn't affect the informational content of the file, it just changes the mode of representation: it makes it perceivable, but does not reduce the software in any way (does not reduce the entropy of the bit pattern).

This is unlikely to violate the clause.\n\nB) Creating a hexadecimal dump, similar to using 'cat', doesn't reduce the software's informational content or entropy.

The answer suggests this might not be explicitly prohibited.\n\nD) Disassembling the executable into assembly code is the correct answer because it clearly reduces the software to a more easily understood form. This process simplifies the raw binary code into human-readable instructions, which aligns with the interpretation of \"reduce\" in the context of making the software more graspable or understandable to humans.\n\nThe key factor is the interpretation of \"reduce\" as simplifying or decreasing the entropy of the bit pattern, rather than just making it visible.

For example, Virginia calls this [\"refusal to aid \\[an] officer in execution of his office\"](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-463/) and it is worded so widely, that the officer asking you to shut up and you don't, then you are guilty.

On the other, they did enter the property illegally.\n\n**Negligence Per Se And Attractive Nuisance**\n\nThe doctrine you are considering first is called \"negligence per se\" and states that failure to follow a penal statute or other law or regulation is negligent as a matter of law if the harm caused by failing to take the action it mandates is the kind of harm that the statute was intended to prevent.\n\nIt isn't perfectly clear, but the answer to that is probably \"no, this is not a negligence per se\" case.\n\nLaws requiring pools to be fenced are largely directed at a particular type of tortious conduct called an \"attractive nuisance\" that could cause, for example, children who can't swim to be attracted to a pool that is dangerous to them without supervision. These laws are not intended to protect adult robbers (if the person engaged in robbery were an armed seven years old, that might be another story). California, however, has discarded the attractive nuisance doctrine that used to be part of its law, in 1970, in the case of *Beard v. Atchison*.\n\n**Common Law Premises Liability In California**\n\nThe common law duty that a property owner owes to trespassers is to keep it free of deadly traps. You have liability if you turn your lawn into a literal mine field full of explosive land mines. But, you did not at common law owe a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable accidental injury to trespassers such as robbers. So, there would be no common law duty here.\n\nBut, California has abandoned the strict common law distinction in premises liability between invitees, licensees, and trespassers in lieu of a general duty to use reasonable care that is fairly tailored to the precise circumstances of the accident. [California Civil Jury Instruction No. 1001](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1000/1001/) (2000\\) citing *Ann M. v.Pacific Plaza Shopping Center*, 6 Cal.4th 666, 674\\-675, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207 (1993\\).\n\nCalifornia, rather than focusing on the nature of the duty that the landlord owes to a trespasser, focuses more on this factor as part of the question of issues like whether the harm was foreseeable.\n\n**A Statute That Is On Point And Controlling Here**\n\nDespite this evolution in California's common law of premises liability, however, California does have a statute that singles out felons who are injured on someone else's property in the course of a felony, specifically, [California Civil Code \u00a7 847](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-847.html), which states (emphasis added):\n\n> (a)\u2002**An owner**, including, but not limited to, a public entity, as\n> defined in Section 811\\.2 of the Government Code , of any estate or any\n> other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossessory,\n> **shall not be liable to any person for any injury or death that occurs upon that property during the course of or after the commission\n> of any of the felonies set forth in subdivision (b) by the injured or\n> deceased person.**\n> \n> \n> (b)\u2002The felonies to which the provisions of this section apply are the\n> following: \u2009(1\\) Murder or voluntary manslaughter; \u2009(2\\) mayhem; \u2009(3\\)\n> rape; \u2009(4\\) sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of\n> great bodily harm; \u2009(5\\) oral copulation by force, violence, duress,\n> menace, or threat of great bodily harm; \u2009(6\\) lewd acts on a child\n> under the age of 14 years; \u2009(7\\) any felony punishable by death or\n> imprisonment in the state prison for life; \u2009(8\\) any other felony in\n> which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person, other\n> than an accomplice, or any felony in which the defendant uses a\n> firearm; \u2009(9\\) attempted murder; \u2009(10\\) assault with intent to commit\n> rape or robbery; \u2009(11\\) assault with a deadly weapon or instrument on a\n> peace officer; \u2009(12\\) assault by a life prisoner on a noninmate; \u2009(13\\)\n> assault with a deadly weapon by an inmate; \u2009(14\\) arson; \u2009(15\\)\n> exploding a destructive device or any explosive with intent to injure;\n> \u2009(16\\) exploding a destructive device or any explosive causing great\n> bodily injury; \u2009(17\\) exploding a destructive device or any explosive\n> with intent to murder; \u2009(18\\) burglary; \u2009**(19\\) robbery**; \u2009(20\\)\n> kidnapping; \u2009(21\\) taking of a hostage by an inmate of a state prison;\n> \u2009(22\\) any felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or\n> deadly weapon; \u2009(23\\) selling, furnishing, administering, or providing\n> heroin, cocaine, or phencyclidine (PCP) to a minor; \u2009(24\\) grand theft\n> as defined in Sections 487 and 487a of the Penal Code ; \u2009and (25\\) any\n> attempt to commit a crime listed in this subdivision other than an\n> assault.\n> \n> \n> (c)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section arises at\n> the moment the injured or deceased person commences the felony or\n> attempted felony and extends to the moment the injured or deceased\n> person is no longer upon the property.\n> \n> \n> (d)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section applies only\n> when the injured or deceased person's conduct in furtherance of the\n> commission of a felony specified in subdivision (b) proximately or\n> legally causes the injury or death.\n> \n> \n> (e)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section arises only\n> upon the charge of a felony listed in subdivision (b) and the\n> subsequent conviction of that felony or a lesser included felony or\n> misdemeanor arising from a charge of a felony listed in subdivision\n> (b). \u2002During the pendency of any such criminal action, a civil action\n> alleging this liability shall be abated and the statute of limitations\n> on the civil cause of action shall be tolled.\n> \n> \n> (f)\u2002This section does not limit the liability of an owner or an\n> owner's agent which otherwise exists for willful, wanton, or criminal\n> conduct, or for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against\n> a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.\n> \n> \n> (g)\u2002The limitation on liability provided by this section shall be in\n> addition to any other available defense.\n\nThis statute is controlling and would probably immunize the property owner from liability in the fact pattern of the question.

If so, this is almost certainly your responsibility.\n\nIf instead, it\u2019s a leak from a pipe or fixture, then the owner of that is responsible.

As a tenant in a condo building, the individual is typically not responsible for building maintenance or repairs unless specified in the lease or if they've been negligent. In this case, there's no indication of negligence, and residential leases rarely make tenants responsible for structural issues. The leak appears to be a building maintenance problem, which is usually the landlord's responsibility. By referring the matter to the landlord and directing the neighbor to communicate with them, the tenant is taking the most appropriate action. This approach ensures that the responsible party (the landlord) handles the issue and any associated costs, including potential negotiations about the neighbor's self-inflicted ceiling damage."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31536/can-a-religious-employer-prohibit-public-advocacy", "docs_id": 31536, "title": "Can a religious employer prohibit public advocacy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work for the Roman Catholic church in the USA.

Everett WA has [local ordinances](https://www.codepublishing.com/WA/Everett/html/Everett10/Everett1024.html#10.24.010) against \"lewd conduct\" (there are versions of this at the state level and in most municipalities). Having sex and masturbation are included in the class of \"lewd acts\", and are also included in \"sexual conduct\". An activity is \"obscene\" if three things are true. First, \n\n> the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would\n>  find, when considered as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n\nand\n\n> when considered as a whole, and in the context in which it is used,\n>  lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nI think having sex or masturbating could pass these two tests. The third condition is that the act\n\n> explicitly depicts or describes patently offensive representations or\n>  descriptions of... \\[sex, masturbation, or excretion]\n\nThe prohibition is more narrow:\n\n> A person is guilty of lewd conduct if he or she intentionally performs\n>  any lewd act in a public place or under circumstances where such act\n>  is likely to be observed by any member of the public.\n\nIf lewd conduct were completely illegal, you could not excrete or have sex withing the city limits. Now we have to turn to the definition of \"public place\":\n\n> an area generally visible to public view, and includes streets,\n>  sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots,\n>  automobiles (whether moving or not), buildings open to the general\n>  public, including those which serve food or drink or provide\n>  entertainment and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings\n>  and the grounds enclosing them, and businesses contained in structures\n>  which can serve customers who remain in their vehicles, by means of a\n>  drive\\-up window\n\nFocusing not on the probable intent but on the words, it is primarily defined as \"an area generally visible to public view\". Your house *qua* building is probably generally visible to public view, as is a public toilet or hotel. The inside of your bedroom is probably not generally visible to public view, nor is the inside of a toilet stall. While the building is probably a public place, a closed stall within the building does not meet the definition (nor does a hotel room). It *might* however qualify under the clause \"or under circumstances where such act is likely to be observed by any member of the public\". The statute does not give a definition of \"observe\", but under ordinary language interpretation, observation may be seeing or hearing. Silent sex, masturbation or defecation might not qualify as being public. \n\nObviously, excretion in a stall of a public bathroom cannot be a lewd act, presumably because the average person does not generally consider ordinary excretion as appealing to the prurient interest: but there could be contexts where it does.\n\nAnother avenue for prosecution is the [Indecent Exposure](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.88.010) state law which is when one\n\n> intentionally makes any open and obscene exposure of his or her person\n>  or the person of another knowing that such conduct is likely to cause\n>  reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nIt is totally non\\-obvious that sex or masturbation in a toilet stall is \"open\". There is a slippery slope regarding quiet sex or masturbation w.r.t. knowing that the conduct is likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nBecause the contexts where sex and masturbation are not clearly spelled out by statutory law, the matter would depend on how courts had interpreted previous cases. There have been arrests in Washington of people having bathroom sex, but I don't know if anyone has ever or recently\\-enough been convicted for having quiet sex out of view in a toilet stall, or similar place. There is a potentially applicable case, [Seattle v. Johnson](https://casetext.com/case/seattle-v-johnson), 58 Wn. App. 64, which seems to involve public sex, and the conviction was overturned because the complaint was defective, in not including the element \"that the defendant must know 'that such conduct is likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm'\". It is not clear from the appeal what the act actually was \u2013 it probably was for public nudity. There is also an decision by the state appeal court division 3 (not publicly available) in Spokane v. Ismail which, in connection with a charge of public urination declares that \"A toilet stall is not a public place. The center of Riverfront Park during the lunch hour is a public place\", in connection with an ordinance just like the Everett one against public lewd acts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Washington state, which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to be considered illegal under lewd conduct or indecent exposure laws?\n\nA) A couple having loud sex in an unlocked public bathroom stall\nB) An individual masturbating silently in a locked public bathroom stall\nC) A person urinating in the middle of a public park during lunchtime\nD) Two people engaged in sexual activity in a parked car on a busy street\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This scenario could be considered illegal as it's likely to be observed (heard) by members of the public and could cause reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nB) This is the least likely to be illegal because it occurs in a locked stall (not generally visible to public view), is done silently (not likely to be observed), and is in a place where some private acts are expected.

Investigation to that point had revealed that the decedent had jumped from the top of a ten\\-story building with the intent to commit suicide. (He left a note indicating his despondency.) As he passed the 9th floor on the way down, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, killing him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the 8th floor level to protect some window washers, and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this.\n> \n> \n> Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even if the mechanism might not be what they intended, is defined as having committed suicide. That he was shot on the way to certain death nine storeys below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to homicide, but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands.\n> \n> \n> Further investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9th floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. He was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight. Therefore, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife, and the pellets went through the window, striking the decedent.\n> \n> \n> When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded.

That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.\n> \n> \n> But further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal accident. That investigation showed that the mother (the old lady) had cut off her son's financial support, and her son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.\n> \n> \n> Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, Ronald Opus himself, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered. This led him to jump off the ten\\-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a 9th story window.\n> \n> \n> The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.\n\nI feel like this sequence of interpretations both makes sense and doesn't make sense. For example, I'm surprised that in the 4th paragraph, they're talking about murder instead of manslaughter, which seems more appropriate for an accidental killing.\n\nNow, I know that law requires a jurisdiction. Since the original creator of the story worked at the universities of Cincinnati and Southern California, I'm wondering whether the above story, and especially the legal claims and observations the forensic examiner make, hold up under Ohio or California law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No it's not.\n\nThis is important because we have an inaccuracy in this paragraph:\n\n> When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. **He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.**\n\nThere's a riddle that many people who are teaching gun safety courses like to ask their class to drive the point home early: \"How can you tell if a gun is unloaded? Answer: The Gun is always loaded!\" The point here is that one should never, ever treat a gun as if it is unloaded. Always assume that it is loaded and ready to be fired, and will destroy the thing it is pointed at. Because of this, in the United States, the act of pointing a gun at someone in a threatening manner (and without affirmative defense of self\\-defense) constitutes an assault **even if the person pointing the gun knows it's not loaded, inoperable, or not even a real gun.** So the husband, by dint of the fact that he pointed a gun that the wife reasonably believed was a work, albeit unloaded, gun at her, had assaulted his spouse (assault need not include physical harm aka Battery but only the threat of physical harm, by most legal definitions.).\n\nIn addition, in U.S. common law, there is a provision called \"Felony Murder\" in all jurisdictions. This legal concept states that if, while in the comission of a felony crime, someone dies, you are guilty of 1st Degree Murder (if the crime is a misdemenor, you are guilty of \"Misdemenor Manslaughter/3rd degree murder). This is not something you want to face because you need not prove that you killed the person but that you committed a crime and someone in proximity to this act died (The classic example is a bank robber yells \"this is a stick up! Nobod move unless I tell you. Teller, give me all the money in the vault!\" and after saying this, a little old lady who was there to deposit her social security check has a fatal heart attack and dies. Even though the robber didn't even point the gun at her, he is now guilty of Felony Murder because she died while he robbed the bank. Doesn't matter if her heart attack was induced by the excitement of the situation or she didn't get proper medical attention because EMS will not enter a hostile situation until the police clear it or that her heart attack had nothing to do with this.). Thus, because the Husband was committing a felonious crime (assault) upon his wife, the fact that the man jumping had the misfortune of being at the wrong place at the wrong time does not matter. The Husband murdered the man with intent because he intended to assault his wife by threatening her with his gun and thus is liable for the legal consequences related to that crime. Intent to committ murder does not factor here.\n\nWhat's more, at trial this is easy to prove as the investigating officers would be able to testify that the husband and wife both told them at the scene that they believed the gun was unloaded (Stupid but not a crime) when he pointed the gun at her (stupid and a crime).\nThis is not a violation of hearsay as statements against the opposite party's interests are admissable under U.S. rules of evidence. The Husband would not be required to testify as he has a fifth amendment right against self\\-incrimination and the prosecution could not call the wife under spousal\\-immunity privilege (unless she waived it), but this is something their attorney would need them to try and refute.\n\nFurthermore, the cornor would likely not rule this a suicide unless he/she learned of the details of the man's death prior to or during the course of the autopsy. There would be trace evidence (glass from the window) or lack of trace evidence (lack of Gun Shot Residue) to lead the cornor to conclude the fatal injury was a gun shot, not a suicide by jump. I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure the two injuries look nothing alike.\n\nAdditionally, there are cases that would come into play even if somehow the fall (and not the sudden stop) killed our jumper. As a general rule, it's murder if you inflict a fatal injury to what you reasonabley believe to be a dead person that is infact a living person (or if you inflict a seemingly fatal injury to what you reasonably believe to be a living person that is in fact a dead person), so the fact that the jumper was going to die no matter what doesn't mitigate that the death by fall was not what killed him.\n\nFinally, as crazy as it may seem, humans have survived falls from greater heights. There are multiple recorded instances of people who tried to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge (the second most popular suicide spot in the world) and seemingly miraculously lived to tell of the experience. The deck of the Golden Gate bridge is 245 feet from the water's surface, which makes this a fall from 23 stories up, more than double the building height in this scenario. As a general rule, it's a good bet someone jumping from 10 stories (108 feet) will die, it's not a garentee as we have multiple survivors who jumped from 245 feet and lived.\n\nIn conclusion, Coronors do not work that way, nor does the law. The only thing saving the man from conviction is a sympathetic jury that finds that it's not illegal to accidentally kill a man who is in the process of committing suicide. Given the facts of this case, I find it hard to get twelve people to sympathize with the man, but hey, stranger things have happened.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal principles discussed in the analysis of the Ronald Opus story, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the husband's potential criminal liability?\n\nA) The husband cannot be charged with murder because he believed the gun was unloaded and had no intent to kill anyone.\n\nB) The husband can only be charged with manslaughter because the death was accidental and not premeditated.\n\nC) The husband can be charged with first-degree murder under the felony murder rule, regardless of his belief about the gun being unloaded.\n\nD) The husband can only be charged with assault for threatening his wife, but not for the death of Ronald Opus.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the analysis, the felony murder rule applies in this situation. Even though the husband believed the gun was unloaded and did not intend to kill anyone, he was committing a felony (assault) by pointing the gun at his wife in a threatening manner. Under the felony murder rule, if someone dies during the commission of a felony, the perpetrator can be charged with first-degree murder, regardless of their intent to kill. The fact that the death was accidental or that the victim was attempting suicide does not negate the application of this rule.

However, if institutional racism is know to exist in a particular setting, or can be proved to exist, that might be evidence which will help to prove that a particular action was racial discrimination.\n\nNote that it is not illegal in the US to discriminate on the basis of race where no anti\\-discrimination law applies, nor to discriminate against people on a basis that is not a protected class (for example against left\\-handed people). Such actions may incur public disfavor, but not legal redress.\n\nSo (in the US at least) there really is no \"legal understanding\" of *institutional racism* or indeed of *racism* in any form. There is only the legal concept of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.

According to the information provided, in the United States, there is no specific legal understanding or definition of institutional racism. Anti-discrimination laws prohibit discrimination based on race (and other protected characteristics) regardless of whether the discrimination stems from individual or institutional racism. The legal focus is on the discriminatory action itself, not on categorizing the type of racism.

It's an efficiency apartment in the basement of my girlfriend co\\-workers house. Prior to us living there the space was used as an office and work space for a dog grooming business (there is a very small bedroom, bathroom, shower and another room kept constantly locked because they're growing pot in it, supposedly legally.) We are not allowed to have anything in the main entry way because they still come down frequently to tend their marijuana plants and occasionally wash dogs. The lease is for a set duration of time (through the end of July).\n\nThey did not provide us with a copy of the lease agreement, although we asked, and my understanding is that any part of a lease that violates tenant law is unenforceable.\n\nFrom memory, I recall the lease stating that they may enter the unit whenever they wish with or without notice, that although they are permitting us to have our 2 cats, in situations where they need to use the unit for dog washing, the cats are to be confined to the small bedroom. Also that they may, at any point, with our without cause, terminate the lease, at which point we must vacate within 5 days.\n\nThe \"landlord\" isn't exactly the nicest of people, and the floor/ceiling is extremely thin, so every small noise from the main house is heard in our living area, yet we're expected to stay extremely quiet. We constantly hear him shouting and swearing at his young (10 or 11 year old) son and his two large dogs sound like elephants walking around above us.\n\nTo put the icing on the cake, today I came home and was immediately greeted with anger because I left the bedroom door open for the cats and they needed to wash a dog, something they told me they were going to do yesterday. While I was trying to apologize for the misunderstanding, the landlord lost his temper, swearing and shouting at me to \"shut my f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* mouth\", then proceeded to threaten to \"knock my b\\*\\*\\*\\* a\\*\\* out\" and ended by telling me that I needed to \"get the f\\*\\*\\* out, but my girlfriend could stay\". Through all of this, I was denied entry to my living area because the landlord's girlfriend was washing a large and unfriendly dog.\n\nI'm very sorry for the long winded post. I will update once I get a copy of the lease that we didn't have a choice but to sign, for fear of not having a place to live. What I really want to know is how much of this is cause for me to go for a legal approach? As far as the growing marijuana, this is Washington and he claims that he has his medical growing license, but also consistently demonstrates fear of drawing attention to the house, the reason being that he's growing pot.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The landlord may be confused about what is legal. Growing pot without a license (they do not have one: it cannot be grown at home, and certainly not if there is a minor present) is not legal, not even in Seattle (medical marijuana now requires a general marijuana license, and home\\-grown is not legal \u2013 some Dept. of Health pages don't reflect the new law).\n\nUnder [RCW 59\\.18\\.065](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.065), the landlord must provide a copy of the executed agreement to each tenant, and a replacement copy on request.

On September 2nd we visited a property in the area we will be moving to and we really liked it. After getting the info for the available units from the woman in the office we then went online to apply.\n\nWe applied for a specific unit, lets just say unit \\#1A for example. We completed the entire application and paid the application fees and the 'Holding/Starting Security Deposit'(this is the exact wording from the page where we agreed to pay. \n\nWe found out 2 days late that we had been approved and I was sent what I would call the welcome packet.

On this list is says 'Application Fee Per Applicant: $60x2 PAID' and 'Administration Fee: $150 PAID'. I noticed here that it now says 'Admin Fee' and not Deposit, but didn't much of it. \n\nThe next day I received an email saying the lease was ready for us to sign. So I logged in to take a look. When I opened it I noticed that the unit number had changed to unit \\#B2\\. I was very confused by this so I called the office, and this is what I was told.\n\nThe unit we had applied for and been approved for was actually a renovated unit and we did not apply for a renovated unit. I told the lady that this did not seem right of them to just change the unit on us like this. She told me that we could have the original unit if we agreed to pay the higher price, which is out of our budget. She said that it was IT's fault that it had been listed wrong and that it was now fied.\n\nAfter I hung up with her I went to their website to check and sure enough the unit \\#A1 was still listed for the same price we had applied for and been approved for but now with a different availability date. \n\nI have done some looking and it seems to me that since we paid what I was told when paying the fee was the the deposit that they can not switch the unit on us. \nI have been trying to get ahold of the office now for 2 days with no answer. Plus watching their website and the unit \\#A1 is still listed for the same price now with another different availability date. They know we are moving from out of state and I do not remember the unit \\#B2 being listed as available when we did our application. \n\nSo I guess my questions are: \n1\\. What should I do? \n\n2. Can they do this, switch the unit like that?\n3. Should I try to push for the original unit \\#A1? I'm worried if I do this they will treat us horribly during our lease.\n4. Should I try to get my money back?\n5. If I decided to go with the new unit they assigned should I be worried about them trying to pull off shady stuff?\n\nI really don't know what to do but they don't seem to be trustworthy. But I need somewhere to live in two weeks.\n\n**UPDATE**: I spoke to the woman in the office finally yesterday(9/12\\) she told me that her manager would call me later but I was not contacted. \n\nInstead she called me back later and said they will just give me the original unit and renovate the other instead. \n\nHowever when I checked last night and again just now my lease papers still say the second unit and the original unit is still listed as available for the same price I applied for it at. \n\nAlso I do have proof that according to their payment system I agreed to pay the Holding/Starting Security Deposit not the Admin Fee.

To arrive at any other outcome, they both must agree to a new contract. One could argue that no new contract was agreed to for two separate reasons:\n\nFirstly, the request to \"approve by signing next to the copyright statement\" is not very specific, understandable contract language that unambiguously is intended to transfer the copyright to the collager. Whether the specific language the collager used to make the new proposal is indeed a contract is debatable. A contract requires \"mutual assent\", which is tested legally by how a \"reasonable person\" would interpret the contract \\- it's far from guaranteed that most reasonable people would interpret the correspondence as a mutual decision intended to transfer copyright.\n\nSecondly, a contract requires *consideration* \\- one cannot enter into a contract where one side gets unilateral benefit and the other side gets nothing whatsoever. Even if the language used would constitute terms specific enough for a contract, there is certainly no consideration involved \\- the collager is proposing that they get the copyright to the collective work, while the artist gets nothing. Because there is no consideration for the artist, it is not a valid contract.\n\nFor these two reasons (especially the second one), the artist has a strong case that they have not entered into any other contract or contract amendment other than what they originally agreed to, which states that the artist owns the copyrights to both the original and collective works.

Even if we assume that COLLAGER's request was specific enough to be considered a valid offer (which is debatable), the lack of consideration is a fundamental issue. For a contract modification to be valid, there must be some form of consideration - something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, COLLAGER is asking for copyright ownership without offering anything in return to ARTIST.

The correct action is to accept the check for the written amount ($250.00) and then address the shortfall separately, either by requesting additional payment or issuing a new bill for the difference. This maintains the integrity of the original document while following proper legal and financial procedures."}}
