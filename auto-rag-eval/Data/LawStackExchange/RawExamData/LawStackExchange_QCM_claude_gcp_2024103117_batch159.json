It's not you that is bound by the EULA, it's the customer. Case 3: you work for the company that develops the software and holds the copyright, either fixing bugs or testing the security of the system by trying to crack it.

Supp. 86, the court found that a grooming policy had a disparate impact on members of a religion (Sikhism), and was thus contrary to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, although a requirement to shave does not obviously discriminate on the basis of religion. This points to an important element of a successful disparate impact claim, that there has to be a policy with a causal effect. In the above scenario, there is no proposed policy that has this effect. Note that the burden of proof is on the person suing for relief \u2013 they must have a theory of something the company does that causes this hiring pattern, a practice that is discriminatory.\n\nThe identified policy (whatever it might be) could be justified by a business necessity defense ([Griggs v. Duke Power Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/424/), 401 U.S. 424\\), by showing that the practice has a demonstrable relationship to the requirements of the job. That, b.t.w., would not excuse a racially or religiously discriminatory hiring policy for a factory manufacturing menorahs or kinaras.\n\nIf a company recruiting locally in Boise ID had a 75% black work force, it would be reasonable to suspect that something was up. But legally, without showing that this results from a unjustified policy of the company, mere statistically anomalous distribution is does not sustain a claim of discrimination.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A paper supply company in a diverse metropolitan area has 100 employees, of which 75 are Jewish. The local Jewish population is approximately 15%. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential discrimination claims against the company?\n\nA) The company is automatically liable for discrimination due to the disproportionate representation of Jewish employees.\n\nB) The company cannot be held liable for discrimination as long as they did not intentionally favor Jewish applicants in their hiring process.\n\nC) The company may be vulnerable to a disparate impact claim, but the burden of proof would be on the plaintiff to show a specific policy causing this hiring pattern.\n\nD) The statistical disparity alone is sufficient evidence for a successful discrimination lawsuit against the company.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While the disproportionate representation of Jewish employees could raise suspicions of discrimination, it does not automatically make the company liable (ruling out option A). The absence of intentional discrimination does not protect the company from all liability, as disparate impact claims don't require proof of intent (ruling out option B). The statistical disparity alone, without evidence of a specific policy causing it, is not sufficient for a successful lawsuit (ruling out option D). \n\nOption C correctly states that the company may be vulnerable to a disparate impact claim, but emphasizes that the burden of proof would be on the plaintiff to demonstrate a specific policy or practice of the company that causes this hiring pattern. This aligns with the information provided about disparate impact claims and the need for a causal link between a company's policies and the resulting demographic disparity."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93659/how-do-laws-against-computer-intrusion-handle-the-modern-situation-of-devices-ro", "docs_id": 93659, "title": "How do laws against computer intrusion handle the modern situation of devices routinely being under the de facto control of non-owners?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Current versions of Microsoft Windows will automatically update themselves.\n\nThat's usually great, but they also are designed to update themselves even if the owner of the device wants them to not do that.

The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that these clauses are presumptively unenforceable due to their potential to unreasonably restrict an individual's ability to earn a living. The fact that the employee was on paternity leave is not the primary factor in this case. The geographical and temporal scope of the clause, as well as its broad nature (\"any business similar\"), would likely make it unenforceable under Ontario law.

In American common law, for a defamation claim to succeed, especially in cases of slander (oral defamation), the plaintiff must typically show either that the statement falls into a special category (slander per se) or that it caused special harm (economic injury). In this scenario, the statement to C, who knows B well and doesn't believe A, is less likely to result in provable harm.

This constitutes special harm, making B more likely to succeed in a defamation claim for the statement made to D. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because C's longer relationship with B actually makes the statement less harmful, not more. \nAnswer B is incorrect because the outcomes and potential for harm differ between the two statements. \nAnswer D is incorrect because while oral statements (slander) have a higher bar for actionability than written statements (libel), they can still be the basis for a defamation claim if special harm is shown."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83048/one-person-patenting-a-biology-researchers-published-idea", "docs_id": 83048, "title": "One person patenting a biology researcher&#39;s published idea", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a biology researcher publishes a paper indicating that a certain molecule can be used to treat a certain condition, can another person then patent that molecule or would the right to patent that molecule be exclusively the original researcher's?

Once Dr. Smith published the paper describing molecule X and its use for treating condition Y, this information became prior art. Prior art is any evidence that an invention is already known to the public before a patent application is filed. In patent law, an invention must be novel (new) to be patentable. By publishing the information, Dr. Smith made it public knowledge, which prevents anyone, including Dr. Smith and the pharmaceutical company, from patenting the molecule and its use as described in the publication. This is because the publication has destroyed the novelty requirement for patentability.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the \"first to file\" principle doesn't override the requirement for novelty. The publication created prior art that prevents patenting.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while some jurisdictions do offer a grace period for inventors to file patents after their own disclosures, this doesn't apply to third parties like the pharmaceutical company. Additionally, the question doesn't specify a jurisdiction with such a grace period.\n\nAnswer D is partially true but not the most accurate answer.

The first is the copyright on the recording itself. The second is is the copyright on the musical composition that is being recorded. If that composition is an arrangement or modification of an original, there will be a separate copyright on the original, as well. \n\nThe copyright on the performance will be initially held by the musicians, but may have been signed over or sold to a recording company or someone else. If the performance was recorded before 1972, there will be no copyright under US Federal law, but there may be limited protection under state law.\n\nThe copyright on the composition, and on the arrangement if any, has terms basically the same as on a printed work. Works published before 1923 will be in the public domain. Later works may have a term of 95 years, or 70 years after the death of the author. See [the cornell chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) for details. Such copyrights are initially owned by the composer or composers, and possibly the writer of the lyrics, or in some cases the employer of the composer(s)/lyricist(s). They may well have been sold or transferred and be owned by some company.\n\nThe exact rules will differ under the laws of other countries, but the general structure is much the same, i understand.\n\nTo use a recording you must obtain permission (a license) for the recording itself, for the composition (unless it is out of copyright) and for any arrangement (unless the arrangement is out of copyright). [Performing rights societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights_organisation)  are how professional performers and venues usually secure such rights. They charge fees which depend on the use someone wants to make. They offer licenses to a variety of music for a single payment.\n\nA recording released under a creative commons license may or may not include a license for the underlying composition. Often it does not. Also, someone who uploads a recording to an online site such as YouTube stating that it has a creative commons license, may be lying, have no rights to the recording at all, and expose any reusers to the chance of lawsuit. If you want to use and reproduce such recordings, you must verify that you have proper licenses from all copyright holders.\n\nThe site [Jamendo](https://licensing.jamendo.com/en/static/termsofsales) says that it offers \"royalty free\" music for various purposes. It says that the recordings it offers have all needed rights included. It charges various fees depending on the kind of license purchased, with discounts for bulk purchases. It offers a guarantee against claims of infringement by 3rd parties, but the terms seem to make this guarantee quite limited. It appears that for use in an online/mobile app, one must purchase their 'large\" license or higher. Its terms do not seem to be compatible with creative commons licenses.

If the plaintiff never files a lawsuit, the defendant is under no obligation to continue interacting with the plaintiff, and can simply wash their hands of the matter.

What good does that do you?\n\nIf you want to use the money to buy stuff for yourself, the shell company has to pay it back to you as a dividend or salary or something, and that payment will be taxable income to you personally.\n\nThis might even come out worse for you: if you had held the bitcoins for more than a year, and sold them yourself, you could benefit from the lower long\\-term capital gains tax rate. But if you collect the funds as salary or dividend, you pay the higher ordinary income tax rate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John buys $10,000 worth of Bitcoin and holds it for 2 years. The value increases to $50,000. John creates a shell company in a foreign country, transfers his Bitcoin to it, and has the company sell the Bitcoin. The company then pays John $40,000 as a salary. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the tax implications for John?\n\nA) John will pay no taxes because the sale was conducted by a foreign company\nB) John will pay long-term capital gains tax on $40,000\nC) John will pay ordinary income tax on $40,000\nD) John will pay long-term capital gains tax on $40,000 and ordinary income tax on $40,000\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario illustrates why using a shell company to avoid taxes is not effective and can potentially result in higher taxes. When John receives the $40,000 as salary from the shell company, it's treated as ordinary income, regardless of how the company obtained the money. He loses the benefit of the lower long-term capital gains rate he would have enjoyed if he had sold the Bitcoin directly. Option A is incorrect because the US taxes its citizens on worldwide income. Option B is wrong because the payment is salary, not capital gains. Option D is incorrect because the $40,000 is only taxed once as income, not twice. Option C is correct because John will pay ordinary income tax rates on the $40,000 salary he receives from the shell company."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21315/does-congress-have-the-authority-to-grant-citizenship-to-an-individual", "docs_id": 21315, "title": "Does Congress have the authority to grant citizenship to an individual?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The US House Committee on Appropriations just passed a resolution to grant citizenship to Charlie Gard, a British infant.

It is more of a political statement, as a preamble to all laws in today's sovereign federal state, describing the foundation of the United States of America and its constitutional order.\n\nThe only constitutional law in force today in the U.S. is the *Constitution for the United States of America*, beginning with\n\n> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nand the subsequent amendments.\n\nThe ratification of the Constitution replaced any previous constitutional orders in effect between the States. A new government was [created by the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-7/ratification-clause) and replaced the old one under the Articles of the Confederation:\n\n> Both Governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The New Government did not commence until the old Government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution being ratified by the ninth State; for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new Government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a Government until it dissolved on the 1st of November, by the successive disappearance of its Members. It existed potentially until the 2d of March, the day proceeding that on which the Members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\n> \n> \n> *[Owings v. Speed](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18/420)*\n\nThe States abandoned their old agreement (the Articles of Confederation) and subjected themselves to the new Constitution.\n\nOf course, the other documents remain historically very significant and may shine lights on the interpretation of the present Constitution, for example, in *[Texas v.

The main example is the\u00a0[redaction of Grand Jury Testimony](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-attorney-general-grand-jury-information/)\u00a0that cannot be unredacted under any circumstances (as I understand the article on the case cited). I did not see an exception for Grand Jury Testimony, or other forms of redaction, in the subpoena\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nGiven the situation above, can Barr be able to legally fully comply with the House Judiciary committee's subpoena?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best course of action for Barr would be to file an objection to the subpoena in the proper court (probably the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia) under or by analogy to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(d)](https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-vi-trials/rule-45-subpoena/) (which governs disputes over subpoenas in civil cases in the federal courts), if he thinks that there are matters he cannot lawfully divulge or thinks it is improper to divulge even if they are not privileged, and to let a judge decide.\n\nGenerally speaking, in a civil action, you can only object to a subpoena by following this process and Congress has increasingly used the civil lawsuit discovery process as a benchmark. Failure to file an objection with the proper court, or at least in a response to Congress by the date required in the subpoena to produce the materials, will generally constitute a waiver of the objections that might otherwise have been asserted to the subpoena. \n\nSimply not responding without explanation by the due date would be a pretty clear case of Contempt of Congress which is the basis for both a civil action and criminal contempt charges. \n\nFor example, in the *Lynch* case, cited below, the Court stated with respect to information that was withheld without any claim of privilege:\n\n> Failure to provide any grounds for withholding particular records does\n>  not comply with the order or enable the Court to resolve defendant\u2019s\n>  privilege claims as to those documents. Accordingly, defendant must\n>  produce the material withheld without any proffered justification.\n\nThis said, in any dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch there is always some uncertainty, and the courts strongly favor negotiation and conferral between the parties before bringing these matters to a head.\n\nA general discussion of Congressional subpoenas can be found [here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/congressional-subpoena-power-and-executive-privilege-coming-showdown-between-branches), recognizing, however, that while there are a variety of grounds for redaction asserted in the Mueller report case, \"Executive Privilege\" is not among them and so the special considerations that apply to an assertion of executive privilege do not apply. The authority of the judicial branch to resolve these issues has been upheld, for example, in the cases of *[United States v. Nixon](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep418/usrep418683/usrep418683.pdf)* (U.S. 1974\\) and *[Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Lynch](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012cv1332-117)* (D. D.C 2016\\) (both of which involved the more difficult scenario of an assertion of executive privilege in addition to the more ordinary assertions of privileges like the grand jury privilege).\n\nNot infrequently, the judge will review the unredacted material *in camera* (i.e. privately in chambers without showing it to the requesting party) to determine if the claim of privilege or other basis for redaction is really valid (e.g. maybe something that was redacted under the label grand jury testimony is not, in fact, grand jury testimony). But, there is case law to support the notion that Congress would have to demonstrate some specific reason why it doubts the accuracy of the assertions of the executive branch regarding redactions in this particular case to make it necessary for there to be an *in camera* review. In the *Lynch* case (which is a non\\-precedential opinion itself) the Court said:\n\n> As for whether the redactions are what they purport to be, the Court\n>  notes that counsel for even the most disputatious parties are often\n>  called upon to trust each other, and that the judiciary relies\n>  regularly on declarations by the executive branch that matters\n>  redacted from FOIA productions are what they are described to be in\n>  the Vaughn index. *See Loving v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def.*, 550 F.3d 32, 41\n>  (D.C. Cir. 2008\\) (holding that district court had not abused its\n>  discretion by relying on agency\u2019s Vaughn index and declaration in\n>  determining whether a disputed document contained segregable\n>  portions); *Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau*, 60 F.\n>  Supp. 3d 1, 13 (D.D.C. 2014\\) (\u201cThe reviewing court may rely on the\n>  description of the withheld records set forth in the Vaughn index and\n>  the agency\u2019s declaration that it released all segregable\n>  information.\u201d). **The Court has been provided with no reason to believe\n>  that its assistance is needed to verify for counsel for one branch of\n>  government assertions made in pleadings by an officer of the court\n>  representing another, equal branch of government.** If in the end, a\n>  neutral is required to read each individual redaction and confirm that\n>  what the Department claims is simply a name or a telephone number is\n>  in fact a name or a telephone number, the parties can arrange for that\n>  on their own.\n\nThese discretionary issues are likely to be influenced by the partisan leanings of the particular judges involved.\n\nAnother question is to whom a subpoena could be directed. While attorney\\-general Barr is one possible person to whom it could be directed, Mueller himself is another possible person to whom a subpoena could be directed and that might lead to a more tractable counter\\-party in the lawsuit and might simplify some of the conflicts of interest present in a subpoena of the attorney\\-general himself that in criminal contempt cases is enforceable by his subordinates, i.e. U.S. attorneys, who are required by law to bring such charges.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of a congressional subpoena for the full unredacted Mueller Report, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Attorney General Barr's legal options?\n\nA) Barr can simply ignore the subpoena without any legal consequences if he believes the requested information cannot be lawfully disclosed.\n\nB) Barr must fully comply with the subpoena regardless of any potential legal restrictions on disclosing certain types of information.\n\nC) Barr should file an objection to the subpoena in the appropriate court, citing specific legal grounds for withholding certain information, and let a judge decide.\n\nD) Barr can unilaterally decide which parts of the report to release without any need for judicial review or explanation to Congress.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate legal course of action for Attorney General Barr would be to file an objection to the subpoena in the proper court, likely the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This approach allows Barr to cite specific legal grounds for withholding certain information (such as grand jury testimony) and lets a judge make the final decision. This process follows established legal procedures for handling subpoena disputes and avoids potential contempt of Congress charges. Simply ignoring the subpoena (A) could lead to legal consequences.

A good analogy is a computer algorithm. One can draw a flow chart or could theoretically otherwise carry out the operations of the algorithm in their head, for example calculating the area of a right\\-angle triangle, but not even Pythagoras could assert the mathematical method was an invention as the concept excludes intangible things, it is a discovery no doubt if novel and non\\-obvious. A machine somehow analogously calculating the result would be an invention. Similarly, a business method can be imagine as an algorithm and it runs in people. If it\u2019s merely people necessary there is no patent eligible subject matter in the method. In a time where there were no vending machines, the method to provide a can of coke upon the registering of sufficient payment could be the subject of a patent as a system and separately as a method carried out on the machine. One can reasonably refer to such a method as a business method as the process results in direct revenue.\n\nIt is doubtful that the referenced examples would not be rejected as lacking patent eligible subject matter, that is, it be more than an abstract idea, and even if some extremely narrow claim may be granted, it would not have commercial value as it could be easily worked around.\n\n**2nd question**\n\nWhether or not they would operate until anyone tells them to stop would require speculation, but whether or not they then could be compelled to stop is a question on\\-topic here, and the answer is they may very well be compelled to stop if discovered or the IP holder decides to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A fan club dedicated to a popular TV show organizes themed events and sells merchandise featuring hand-drawn images of characters and quotes from the show, without using official logos.

Even without using official logos, the use of characters, quotes, and images clearly derived from the show could constitute copyright infringement or creation of unauthorized derivative works. If certain elements are well-recognized, there could also be trademark implications. While the club might operate until told to stop, they are not legally protected and could be compelled to cease operations if discovered by the IP holder.

She has also been collecting rent from two renters who live in the downstairs complex.

Should I however, provide an example text which the court can then insert into their injunction? Where can I find example text I can use? Can I just go to the court and ask to see all their injunctions and read through them?\n\nIn my case the ideal text will be something like \"The court orders the XYZ Corporation of 123 Main Street to make available to Joseph Plaintiff any all their financial records from 2015 through 2017 and to return a sworn statement to the court that this has been done by June 1, 2017\\.\" Is there standard text for such injunctions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There really is no standard form for orders imposing injunctions. They are, in general, arguably the most customized documents in the entire legal system, because they are a court order to do or not do something. They would generally, however, say to whom they are directed and might provide for how they should be served.\n\nAlso, it is hard to find examples in public records because injunctions are documents entered by trial courts whose orders are public records but are not indexed or easily accessible. Decisions of appellate courts reviewing injunctions are much more widely available, but they rarely quote the entire language of the injunction in full.\n\nYour best bets to find models in accessible sources with full text are the PACER system which has the full text of every federal trial court pleading and order at a minimal cost, and the SEC's EDGAR system in which publicly held companies must disclose documents such as court orders entered against them in litigation that are pertinent to the fair market value of the company.\n\nEither way, you really need to know in advance of searching the particular case with the particular parties in which some injunction you would like to use as a model was issued (e.g. from newspaper or trade press accounts), and then either search in PACER or EDGAR using that information.\n\nLaw libraries also often have treatises with forms in them, as practice guides, and sometimes there will be examples there.\n\nIn general, a court order will have a court caption, recite the information it considered (pleadings, hearings, etc.) to reach its decision, sometimes will restate the arguments of each party and the findings of fact and conclusions of law it reached in light of those arguments with the factual and legal basis for that decision, and then will set forth in as precise language as possible the terms of the order it chooses to impose. If there is a bond requirement, it will set a bond, direct its form (e.g. cash, personal recognizance, property) and explain the reasons for the bond required. Often it will set forth a deadline and expressly state who is bound by the order. It will close by saying something like \"Done the \\_\\_\\_ day of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, 2017\" and have a signature line for the judge with the judge's name and title appearing below that line).

The expert advises that this is why websites use passwords in addition to emails and why spam filters exist. \n\nThe response emphasizes that more concerning would be a leak of both email and password, and recommends using different passwords and two-factor authentication on important sites as good security practices. This aligns with the advice in option C.\n\nOptions A and D are overly aggressive responses given the context provided. The documentation doesn't suggest that this situation warrants immediate police or GDPR action based solely on an email appearing in a list.\n\nOption B is not recommended because, as the documentation points out, the \"website owner\" easily found by the user may well be another victim rather than the actual culprit, making this approach potentially ineffective or misguided."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46520/employer-withholds-last-paycheck-in-virginia", "docs_id": 46520, "title": "Employer withholds last paycheck in Virginia", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I signed my exit interview form that stated I gave back my property that I had from the company during my employ and that I was receiving my last paycheck.

For instance for older adults being offered a severance agreement they would have had to have given me 7, or 21 days or something to the resend it if I wanted to.

Nevertheless, many cities and town have ordinances that require hotels to record extensive information on all their guests and to allow police to search those records whenever the police want without a warrant or even notice of any kind.\n\nSo, the question is how can a hotel challenge such ordinances and have them voided by the courts without breaking them and criminalizing themselves?\n\nUpdate: I found an article on this subject dating back to 1967 (Declaratory Relief in the Criminal Law, Harvard Law Review, Vol. 80, No. 7 (May, 1967\\), pp. 1490\\-1513 (24 pages)).

They don't have to risk arrest by actually violating the ordinance first. In granting the injunction, the court would likely rule that this particular ordinance is unconstitutional, which seems to be the \"voiding\" that you're looking for.\n* If the city shows no signs of wanting to enforce the ordinance (e.g. they are well aware that it is unconstitutional and not legally enforceable), then a request for an injunction would likely be dismissed as not [ripe](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ripe). Courts do not want to waste their time on cases where there is no real dispute between the parties, or on issuing orders for an entity not to do something that they weren't going to do anyway. It's understandable that the business might wish for an explicit ruling anwyay, in case they fear that the city will change its mind tomorrow and start cracking down, but unfortunately for them, courts do not agree that this is worth doing.\n\nNote in either case the ordinance will remain on the books until such time as the town council (or other relevant legislative body) should vote to repeal it.

According to U.S. jurisprudence, the court is likely to find the law unenforceable under the Vagueness Doctrine, which is derived from the Due Process clauses of the 5th and 14th Amendments. This doctrine renders vague laws at any level of government unenforceable. \n\nOption A is incorrect because courts do not allow drafters to testify about their intentions or interpretations of a law after it has been passed. The law must stand on its own text.\n\nOption B, while partially correct in that the court will not consider the drafter's offer to testify, is not the most likely outcome. The court will indeed interpret the law based on its text, but if it's found to be vague, it will likely be deemed unenforceable rather than simply interpreted.\n\nOption D is incorrect because courts do not typically postpone cases to allow for legislative amendments.

If the house was bequeathed specifically to the beneficiaries then the executor must arrange for the legal transfer.

Perhaps the house is a small part of a large factory complex?\n\nThe property could be inside a trust with the brother and sister as beneficiaries but the sister as trustee. Trusts can be discretionary (i.e. the trustee decides who gets what) or unit trusts (like having shares in a company \\- you get it in proportion to your holding).
