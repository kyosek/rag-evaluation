Some customers say to me if you didn't do it now, we're going to sue the company. My reply is like I should follow the instructions of the company and you should wait for few days. So I just follow the instructions regardless of what the customers will do as a consequence.\n\nToday, a customer told me that he will sue me personally as a part of the company. He was also recording my voice to have an evidence. I had to flow the restrictions and the instructions of the company as usual.

There is no longer any access possible to the data by the developer. Is the app creator liable for Google's use of the data?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A data controller is whoever determines the means and purposes of processing. It is possible that multiple controllers jointly determine the means and purposes. However, someone can only be controller over processing activities where they actually have the ability to influence these decisions (see e.g. the Fashion ID case).\n\nThe provider of an app does not have any control over what Google does on its servers with the collected data, unless Google were a data processor for that particular processing activity. Thus, the app provider is not a data controller for Google's subsequent processing, and is not responsible for Google's GDPR compliance.\n\nHOWEVER, the app provider is a data controller regarding what happens within the app (including any SDKs, libraries, or frameworks). The app provider is data controller for processing activities such as \u201ccollecting data\u201d and \u201csending data to Google\u201d. These processing activities must comply with the GDPR (if GDPR applies), for example they need a legal basis. Under some circumstances there might be a legitimate interest for sending data to another data controller. But in the context of behavioural advertising, such a legitimate interest would be very weak and would not pass the required balancing test. Instead, the app provider would likely have to collect consent.\n\nThis is very similar to the question of whether a website can embed content from Google services such as YouTube videos, which would necessarily share data with Google. I have written related answers [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/55926/20476) and [there](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56006/20476).\n\nYou are correct that many apps do not collect valid consent before showing ads.

They are responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance for these activities, such as having a legal basis (likely requiring user consent for behavioral advertising). However, the developer is not responsible for or able to control Google's subsequent processing of the data once it leaves the app. The developer cannot be held liable for Google's use of the data, as they have no control over Google's servers or processing decisions.

Article says that:\n\n> Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has released her\n>  tax return for 2018, reporting that she and her husband paid more than\n>  $200,000 in taxes on a joint income of about $900,000 last year.\n\nThat comes down to about 22% tax rate. When I take into account marginal tax rate total tax comes up to about $275k \\= $164k\\+0\\.37\\*$300k which is effectively 30%, following [this table](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/11/15/irs-announces-2019-tax-rates-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/#3b321e6d2081):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/soM5t.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/soM5t.png)\n\nIs that calculation correct? Does it mean Senator's family got deductions worth $75k in taxes?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not all income is taxed at the rates you cite. Special rates apply to long term capital gain and qualified dividends (maximum rate 20%). There are $1,349 of qualified dividends in this case and $3000 of capital losses that can be taken in the current year (this is the cap for capital losses against ordinary income).\n\nThe benefit the Warren receives from these special tax rates is negligible.\n\nThere are also above the line deductions ($59,348\\) and itemized deductions (they claimed $60,128 of them that reduce their taxable income), credits (which reduce taxes dollar for dollar of which they claimed $13,936\\) and the carry forward of losses that couldn't be claimed in full in a prior year for some reason (which is functionally similar to a deduction) of which the Warrens have $102,276 but could only use $3,000 in the current year.\n\nWhile they doesn't appear to be included in the $905,742 of gross income figure cited, certain kinds of income are also exempt from inclusion on a tax return such as qualified municipal bond interest, certain income in the form of wages and salaries earned abroad, certain disability payments, personal injury settlements (exclusive of interest components) and alimony received under a post\\-2017 divorce decree, to name a few. None of these items are relevant for Warren.\n\nAccording to @JackFleeting in his answer:\n\n> they had gross income of $905,742, AGI of $846,394, taxable income of\n>  $786,266 and tax liability of $230,965\n\nPer the chart, the tax due on ordinary income of $786,266 is $229,058 by my calculation. This is reduced by a $13,936 residential energy credit (because she installed solar panels on her home), and $8,696 of additional federal tax as self\\-employment taxation, and $6,137 of self\\-employment and Obamacare taxes netted against overwitholding of Medicare taxes.\n\nThe itemized deductions were $60,128 which consists of state and local income tax payments (limited to $10,000 of $78,086 incurred in 2018\\) and charitable deductions of $50,128 (about 5\\.5% of her income).\n\nWarren herself, like most middle and upper middle class people in the Northeast, fares very badly with respect to deductions in 2018 compared to all prior years when they were not subject to a $10,000 cap. \n\nFor reference purposes, the disallowed itemized deductions increased her tax bill by $25,192 (itemized deductions don't impact the amount of FICA, self\\-employment tax and Obamacare tax due). On the other hand, she benefits from the lower tax brackets in 2018 compared to those [in 2017](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/). Overall the 2017 tax law reduced Warren's taxes by about $2,713 (a little more than 1\\.1% of her total tax bill and about 0\\.3% of her family's gross income).\n\nThere are \"above the line\" adjustments to income in the amount of $59,348, there is a self\\-employment adjustment to correct for the self\\-employed paying both employee and employer FICA ($4,348\\) and adjustment for a retirement plan contribution in the maximum allowed amount of $55,000\\. Notably, she took no business expenses as deductions against her writing income. Her husband had a whopping $18 of self\\-employment income and took $803 of professional organization dues as a business expense.\n\nHer self\\-employment income does not qualify for the pass though entity tax break created by the 2017 tax law.\n\nAbove the line deductions simply convert your self\\-employment income to the numbers they were be if you were an employee of someone else with the same benefits.\n\nThe marginal tax rate that Warren pays on each additional dollar of self\\-employment income (e.g. writing) is about 40\\.94% from all applicable taxes combined.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Senator Elizabeth Warren and her husband reported a joint income of about $900,000 in 2018.

The answer is B because the documentation specifically mentions that Warren, \"like most middle and upper middle class people in the Northeast, fares very badly with respect to deductions in 2018 compared to all prior years when they were not subject to a $10,000 cap.\" This cap on state and local tax deductions increased her tax bill by $25,192, which is the most significant factor affecting her tax liability compared to previous years.

It is not at all easy to just casually declare some address as your own, or a PO Box. It must be a dwelling the government considers official in all ways, not just meeting various habitability codes, but also I think an address that in general has a kind of residential \u201czoning\u201d, like some addresses are simply not even considered residential, regardless of what\u2019s actually there.\n\nThe part that makes this seem like a regrettable bureaucracy is that in all of these three countries, the converse is true for maintaining residence status: matters of citizenship, criminal activity, deportation and so on aside, there is (I think) basically no formal concept of needing to maintain your residence status. Basically, the second the government has accepted your residence application at some address, you could immediately move out and become homeless for the next ten years, but you will have officially gotten your foot in the door, and will be entitled to all of the rights of someone residing in that country. But before that initial registration happens, the opposite, where you are barred from a number of civil services and provisions because you\u2019re basically just a foreigner, visitor or illegal alien there.\n\nIt seems that this type of law is far more geared towards a certain practical effect then it is meant to have a particular intrinsic meaning, an actual necessary condition for some reason. They just need to make it slightly hard for anyone in the world to move there unrestricted and self\\-declare as residents.\n\nBut given how trivial one\u2019s evasion of that condition can be \\- I have registered at a hostel I spent a month at and have not been there in several months; I can easily register with a friend on a whim, who simply says \u201cmi casa es tu casa\u201d even though I maybe have never even set foot inside of their home \\- it opens the genuinely important question to me of whether people should ultimately have the legal right to declare themselves a resident of a certain country, under certain conditions, without needing to have a specific home, address or apartment that you live at.\n\nI think it\u2019s very important because it is a fundamental and natural human right to not have to pay money to spend time inside of a building every night. You absolutely have the right to be \u201chomeless\u201d, to sleep on the ground, in a van, to camp, to be a drifter, to move around from place to place.\n\nSo, is there any legal avenue for a person to declare residence in Denmark, openly communicating that they do not have any home or personal address? For example, could there be any claim to fulfilling the essential role of a resident but who simply asserts their right to be a part of Denmark without having to have a home? Is there any even tiny legal opening for such an idea? And if not, isn\u2019t that a pretty major violation of human rights, that it\u2019s effectively illegal to not pay money to live inside of an apartment, that it mandatorily costs money just to have a place to sleep at night, that you have to pay money just for being alive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nIt is not a fundamental human right to be able to become a resident of Denmark.\n\nEvery country has the right to decide who is and who is not a resident and what criteria need to be satisfied. Having a residence is usually a pretty fundamental criterion for being a resident.\n\nAt the same time, most countries have laws that state what areas and types of structures can be used as residences. There may be zoning requirements and building codes. You may argue that you should be able to decide what you will accept as your living quarters but that presumes, wrongly, that your decision doesn\u2019t affect other people. As a simple counter example, emergency services might need to enter your \u201cdwelling\u201d and it must be, among other things, structurally sound enough for them to do so safely.\n\nSo given that becoming a resident of Denmark is not a fundamental human right stated anywhere, Denmark can decide who is and is not.\n\nOf course, you can lie and say you have a residence when you don\u2019t but lying to the government in order to obtain something you are not actually entitled to is likely to solve all your Danish residence problems; they\u2019ll deport you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to Danish law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the requirements for obtaining residency in Denmark?\n\nA) Having a specific home address is optional, as long as you can prove you're physically present in Denmark.\n\nB) You can declare yourself a resident without a fixed address if you assert your right to be part of Denmark.\n\nC) Having a residence is a fundamental criterion for being considered a resident, as determined by Danish law.\n\nD) Homelessness is protected as a human right, allowing individuals to claim residency without a fixed address.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

From reading questions on this site, I understand that a written contract (e.g. a lease) is only a written record of the actual contract, that is to say the understood \"abstract\" contract takes precedence. So someone can't argue something silly like \"the contract said I must pay them $100 but never specified the currency\". But in complex situations, different parties may have different interpretations of the contract, even after signing it in writing. Just because something is in writing doesn't mean it's clear.\n\nMy question is, isn't it wrong to think that in court the judge and jury are trying to establish the actual understood contract? It is very well possible that the parties were not on the same page when the contract was formed. If this were the case, then what is the job of the judge/jury?\n\nFor example if Bob and Joe are going to court because Bob believes Joe owes him $100 in accordance with a contract they both signed, but Joe believes he doesn't, if the contract really is ambiguous and both Joe and Bob really do believe they are in the right, what is the job of the Judge and Jury? You can't really say it's to find out who was right because there was a misunderstanding when the contract was formed \\- but I don't think that invalidates the contract because businesses do this all the time to rip people off for money :P\n\nIs it possible the a judge/jury actually decides who wins the case based on the judge's/jury's own interpretation of the contract and not the plantiff's or defendant's? \n\nUPDATE: sorry for the confusing question, I think what I was trying to get at is what happens when a party finds an \"alternative\" interpretation to a clause before agreeing to it, so they can find a loophole if/when a dispute arises. I think large corporations do this a lot.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The court's job is to resolve the **dispute**.\n\nThe parties are in court specifically because there **isn't** agreement on what the terms of the contract were or even if there is a contract at all.\n\nIf one of the parties contends that there is no contract then the court will have to determine if there is or isn't. Even if both parties agree there is a contract the court will need to satisfy itself that there is. This is a jurisdictional matter; in the absence of a contract the court **can't** make a ruling.\n\nHaving decided there is a contract, there is **something** about the contract they don't agree on \\- if they agree then why are they in court? Each party will state their position on the dispute and provide evidence that supports that position. The court will decide based on the evidence and on the balance of probabilities which version is more correct.\n\nIt is a given that the parties are in dispute about the exact terms of the contract, whether this was because of an initial misunderstanding, someone didn't read it or someone saw an opportunity to screw someone else doesn't matter.

North Carolina follows a \"pure contributory negligence\" system, which means that if a driver is found to be even slightly at fault for an incident, they can be held fully responsible. In this case, even though the car was parked, the insurance company could argue that the driver should have anticipated the soft ground or taken precautions. The fact that the incident occurred in Tennessee doesn't necessarily change how the North Carolina-based insurance applies its policies. Additionally, insurance companies can add points without a payout, as points are used to assess risk and determine future rates, not necessarily tied to current claims.

The legality of using content from other news sources depends on various factors and is not always clear-cut.

The amount of content used, the purpose of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, and the effect on the potential market for the original work are all considered when determining if something qualifies as fair use.

On what level(s) will jurisdiction over the case lie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on some quick searching, this would likely be a wrongful death action. I have to pick a state, so I'll pick Nevada.\n\nThe first question is what damages could be. I don't know offhand what is typical in wrongful death suits, but this appears to be beyond mere negligence: there was a hit and run involved. I have no trouble believing the claim would reach at least six figures. This is important, because federal diversity jurisdiction only includes lawsuits with over $75,000 at stake. Now, Santa Claus's citizenship matters; if he were stateless it'd be an issue, but he is a [citizen of Canada](http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2008/12/23/7839591.html).\n\nThat means that federal court has diversity jurisdiction: because the lawsuit is between a citizen of one state on one side and a foreign citizen on the other (no state has citizens on both sides of the lawsuit), and meets Congress's extra requirements (enough money at stake), it can be in federal court. The way diversity jurisdiction works is that the plaintiff can file in federal court, but if they choose to file in Nevada court then the defendant can *remove* the case to federal court. Either party can get it into federal court.\n\nConventional wisdom is that federal court is more defendant\\-friendly than state court on state law claims. It is likely that if Grandpa files the case in any court in Nevada, the case will end up in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.\n\nBut suppose it is in state court? Most states don't have separate \"county court\" and \"state court\" systems; county courts are a thing, but they're a specialized thing and the serious stuff is not in those. A six\\-figure wrongful death claim won't go in Nevada's equivalent of small claims court. It'd go in Nevada district court, if it's in state courts.\n\nBut what about other courts? Grandma was walking home, so it can be assumed she was a Nevada resident. Assuming Grandpa lived with her (which is rather likely), so is he.

My reading of the offending text is that it states the desirability of an action which some people probably think would result in the overthrow of the US government by force, but does not directly commit the offending act.\n\nIn [Yates v.

RCW 9A.16\\.020 says when use of force is lawful, and there are different \"public officer\" vs. \"person\" related provisions.

The officer must have \"probable cause to believe that the suspect, if not apprehended, poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officer or a threat of serious physical harm to others\". If that is so, \"deadly force may also be used if necessary to prevent escape from the officer\".

However, subsections (1\\) limit the application of the law, stating \"Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe\", which means that the restrictions only apply to those who are not a member of an SC or ST. The listed acts are not prohibited in the case of a Sentinelese person is forced by another Sentinelese person to eat an obnoxious substance, regardless of whether the two people are related. Moreover, because the law is stated as exempting *any* member of a SC/ST, a Toda may force a Sentinelese person to eat an obnoxious substance without violating the law. However, a Tamil person may not do so.\n\nAssuming in a given case that the family member is not a member of an SC/ST, then we have to turn to the nature of the prohibited acts. \"Disrespecting\" a person is pretty open\\-ended: certainly forcing a person to eat an obnoxious substance is one way of disrespecting them. Normal usage of \"disrespect\" would limit that term to actions like insulting. The Act probits force\\-feeding, excreting, stripping, dispossessing from land, enslaving, interfering with voting, vexatious litigation, false reports etc. Item (x) identifies \"intentionally insult\\[ing] or intimidat\\[ing]\nwith intent to humiliate a member of\na Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe\nin any place within public view\", which might qualify (the law does not say that the \"public view\" must be composed of non\\-SC/ST persons, so local humiliation would count). This is the closest that one can come to a prohibition against \"disrespecting\".\n\nThe [2014 Amendment](https://tribal.nic.in/DivisionsFiles/mj/10-preventionofAtrocities.pdf)\n\n> (u) by words either written or spoken or by signs or by visible\n> representation or otherwise promotes or attempts to promote feelings\n> of enmity, hatred or ill\\-will against members of the Scheduled Castes\n> or the Scheduled Tribes;\n> \n> \n> (v) by words either written or spoken or by any other means disrespects\n> any late person held in high esteem by members of the Scheduled Castes\n> or the Scheduled Tribes;\n\nAs you can see, (v) has limited applicability.

Law is a human institution, and is not always logical or consistent.\n\nHowever, in this particular case, prohibitions on sex with a person under a given age (not always the age of majority, often known as the \"age of consent\") have a long history as a part of the law, which can be discussed here.\n\nThe question seems to be missing a key detail. Where marriage is legal below the age of consent, sex within a legal marriage is normally an exception to statutory rape laws, that is laws against sex with a person under the age of consent.\n\nFor example, the Arizona Criminal Code [\u00a7 13\\-1405](https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/2013/title-13/section-13-1405/) provides in pertinent part that:\n\n> A.

For the purposes of this section, a minor is a person under the age of 18 years and an adult is a person who is at least 18 years of age. \\[*emphasis added*]\n\nColorado Code \\[\u00a7 18\\-3\\-402] provides in pertinent part that:\n\n> (1\\) Any actor who knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual penetration on a victim commits sexual assault if:\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (d) At the time of the commission of the act, the victim is less than fifteen years of age and the actor is at least four years older than the victim **and is not the spouse of the victim**; or \\[*emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> (e) At the time of the commission of the act, the victim is at least fifteen years of age but less than seventeen years of age and the actor is at least ten years older than the victim **and is not the spouse of the victim**; \\[*emphasis added*]\n\nThe Wikipedia article [\"Statutory rape\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape) lists several reasons that have been given for such laws. It states:\n\n> The original purpose of statutory rape laws was to protect young, unwed females from males who might impregnate them and not take responsibility by providing support for the child. In the past, the solution to such problems was often a shotgun wedding, a forced marriage called for by the parents of the girl in question. This rationale aims to preserve the marriageability of the girl and to prevent unwanted teenage pregnancy. \\[*citations omitted*]\n\nObviously, this rationale does not apply if the parties are married, and the man is legally obliged to support his wife and child, as was the usual practice before modern times.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also states:\n\n> Statutory rape laws are based on the premise that an individual is legally incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse until that person reaches a certain age. The law mandates that even if he or she willingly engages in sexual intercourse, the sex is not consensual.\n\nWhen an underage marriage requires parental consent, as it does in some US states, this rationale is less applicable.\n\n> Another rationale comes from the fact that minors are generally economically, socially, and legally unequal to adults. By making it illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor, statutory rape laws aim to give the minor some protection against adults in a position of power over the youth.\n\nAgain parental consent provides some protection against this concern, and as the classic adult predator would not be willing to marry the victim, an exception for marriage does not enable such predators a free pass.\n\nIn general social policy and public opinion have treated sex within marriage differently, and more favorably, than sex outside of marriage. Rules in the common\\-law system reflect this. The legal requirements of a marriage have been thought to offer protection (both for the underage person and for society) against the problems that underage sex would otherwise cause, and so consensual sex with a person under the age of consent within a lawful marriage is generally legal. It might be debated whether this is good reasoning, and one might argue that laws on this point should be changed. There have been changes, piecemeal, state by state, not all in the same direction. One common, although not invariable, change is so\\-called \"Romeo and Juliet\" laws, which remove or reduce criminal penalties when the \"adult\" is not that much older than the \"child\" (often within 3 years of age, although laws vary by state within the US) and the sex was consensual. These are described at greater length in the Wikipedia article. Note that the AZ and CO laws quoted above have such provisions, and that CA reduces penalties in such cases in a section not quoted.\n\nDetails of the various statutory rape laws within the US as of 2003 can be found at [\"Statutory Rape Laws By State\"](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-r-0376.htm).

Is this legal? Would such a person need to be given warning or severance? I guess an employer who signs a union agreement could agree not to employee any person listed on a black list.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A union cannot fire an employee (except a person who is an employee of the union), but an employer can. Section 246\\.1(1\\) of the [Canada Labour Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-2/) prohibits a federally regulated employer from taking an adverse action against an employee, if they exercising specific rights granted under Part III.

There are also labo(u)r laws for [provinces and territories](https://www.adp.ca/en/resources/compliance-and-legislation/employment-standards-in-canada/provinces-and-territories.aspx), but it is unlikely that retaliation is a protected right in any part of Canada.

According to the information provided, Canadian federal labor laws do not protect an employee's right to retaliate against another employee for union activities. The Canada Labour Code prohibits employers from taking adverse actions against employees for exercising specific rights related to wages, scheduling, and leaves, but retaliating against coworkers is not one of these protected rights. Therefore, an employer can legally take adverse action, including termination, against an employee who has retaliated against another for contacting a union.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to free association protects joining a union, not retaliating against others. Option B is incorrect as there's no legal requirement for warning or severance in this situation.

Verbal disclosure of ballot choices is generally allowed and is the basis for practices like exit polling. However, laws regarding ballot photographs (or \"ballot selfies\") vary significantly by state. As of 2016, 18 states banned sharing photographs of ballots, while 6 additional states banned photography in polling places. These laws have been challenged in some cases on First Amendment grounds, with at least one federal court invalidating such a law. This creates a patchwork of regulations that differ by state and are subject to ongoing legal scrutiny.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no universal ban on disclosing ballot choices, especially verbal disclosures. Option B is incorrect because while verbal disclosure is generally allowed, ballot photography is not universally legal and is subject to varying state laws. Option D is overly broad and incorrect, as there is no federal law explicitly protecting all forms of ballot disclosure, and state restrictions do exist in many cases."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49373/will-my-landlord-fix-a-leaky-faucet", "docs_id": 49373, "title": "Will my landlord fix a leaky faucet?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just got a lease to sign, but I am confused by some of the language.\n\nMy question in short is: what does \"**public mains up to the point of entry**\" mean?\n\n**More information:**\n\nIt reads:\n\n...\n\nLandlord shall make all repairs which, in Landlord's discretion, are necessary to maintain\nthe following, subject to normal wear and tear:\n\n**A.** The exterior and structural walls, excluding glass, structural floors, excluding\nfloor coverings, the foundations, roofs, gutters, and exterior downspouts of the\nLeased Premises;\n\n**B.** All appurtenances to the Leased Premises, including stairways, sidewalks,\ndriveways, tenant shall be responsible for normal maintenance.

Displaying user videos is not exactly the same thing as a particular popular song, but they just might be close enough for some consumer confusion tom occur. Whether reasonable people are in fact confused into thinking that the app is in some way sponsored by the makers of the song is a question of fact. A trademark suit would probably need to present some sort of evidence that confusion had occurred or was likely.\n\nIt also may make a difference whether \"Tik Tok\" has been **registered** as a trademark. In the US, registration gets greater protection than mere use. (In some countries there is no protection without registration.) \n\nIt is also possible that the app has already licensed the rights to the term from the trademark owner for the song. This would avoid a potential suit.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the term \"Tik Tok\" is not original with the song. It dates back, in that spelling, to at least the [\"Oz\" books by L. Frank Baum and others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oz_books) *Tik\\-Tok of Oz* dates from 1914, and the character of the Tik\\-Tok from the book *Ozma of Oz* (1907\\). Terms that are not original coinages are less strongly protected in trademark law, and the app could claim to be alluding to the Oz character, not the more recent song.\n\nA comment by ub3rst4r says that: \n\n> the term \"Tik Tok\" is registered as a trademark in the USA by \"Bytedance Ltd\" (which is the company that operates the app).\n\nIf that is correct, the US Patent and Trademark office (PTO) came to at least a preliminary conclusion that this trademark did not infringe anyone else's trademark.

Uruguayan legal citizenship has special characteristics. A person who acquires it retains their nationality of origin, which is determined by Uruguayan law to be that of their country of birth and therefore, is immutable. Legal citizens acquire political rights but do not acquire Uruguayan nationality as natural citizens do. According to Uruguayan law, those born in Uruguay or whose parents or grandparents are Uruguayan natural citizens are considered to be Uruguayan nationals.\n\nThe Uruguayan State defined nationality in this way based on an interpretation of the Constitution made by the jurist Justino Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga in the mid\\-twentieth century. Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga's interpretation, found in one of Uruguay's fundamental academic interpretative texts, states: *\"In the first place, nationality is presented to us as a natural bond, derived from birth, from blood\"*. Likewise, this jurist believed that *\"nationality corresponds to a certain sociological or psychological reality\"*. Speaking on behalf of the drafters of the Constitution of 1830, this jurist concluded: *\"The quality of nationality thus depends on one fact: birth in the territory of the State\". Finally, \"nationality is irrevocable\"*.\n\nAccording to Uruguayan law, the concepts of nationality and citizenship are distinguishable, the first being of a real or sociological nature and the second of a legal nature.\n\nHe argued that nationality and citizenship are two completely different individual conditions. According to Ar\u00e9chaga's view nationality is a permanent state of the individual, which does not suffer any alteration whatever the point of the earth they inhabit, and citizenship is, on the contrary, variable and alters with the different domiciles that men acquire in the different societies into which mankind is divided.\n\nThe source of citizenship, he added, is in the actual domicile and not in nationality.\n\nTherefore, he says: *\"each state feels who its nationals are, and declares it by its law; on the other hand, each state decides who its citizens are, and it disposes of them by its law, for nationality corresponds to a certain sociological or psychological reality.\"* (JUSTINO JIM\u00c9NEZ DE ARECHAGA, La Constituci\u00f3n Nacional. Volume II pg. 186\\)\n\nAs a result of Uruguay's unusual distinction between citizenship and nationality (it's the only country in the world that recognizes the right to citizenship without being a national), legal citizens have encountered problems with their Uruguayan passports at airports around the world since 2015\\. This is due to recommendations in the seventh edition of Doc. 9303 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which requires that travel documents issued by participating states include the \"Nationality\" field. The lack of a naturalization path means that the Nationality field in legal citizens' passports indicates their country of birth, which Uruguay assumes to be their nationality of origin. Many countries do not accept passports issued by a country that declares the holder to be a national of another country. As a consequence, it has severely curtailed legal citizens' exercise of the right to free movement, as their travel abroad is often difficult or downright impossible.\n\nDue to its current and narrow definition of nationality, Uruguay could be violating the sovereignty of other countries by assigning foreign nationalities in its official documents, thus overriding their powers. Some Uruguayan legal citizens may even, as a result of the application of a national law of a third nation and this Uruguayan interpretation, become de facto stateless.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This seems similar to a lot of other countries. For example, in U.S. Law, only natural born U.S. Citizens can be President or Vice President, whereas immigrant Citizens can hold any other elected or appointed office in the U.S. Government.\n\nIn New Zealand, New Zealand Citizens living aboard cannot vote in New Zealand election, because living aboard means they have no stake in elections.\n\nAs to your passport concerns, it's generally accepted that a nation that a validly issued passport by a nation is a validly issued passport for the point of crossing the boarder. In nations that allow dual citizenship, people who have dual citizenships may own passports from both nations and nations may issue passports to non\\-citizens for numerous reasons (One famous example was [Canadian Caper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Caper), in which Canada issued valid Canadian passports to six American diplomats who managed to flee the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis and were being hidden within the residents of the Canadian Ambassador to Iran. While the CIA managed to bring the passports to the escapees, it was only the six ambassadors who received valid Canadian Passports, while the CIA agent on the mission had to forge a Canadian Passport.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Uruguay's unique legal framework, which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between citizenship and nationality for immigrants?\n\nA) Immigrants who become legal citizens of Uruguay automatically acquire Uruguayan nationality.\n\nB) Legal citizens of Uruguay retain their original nationality but gain full political rights, including the right to be President.\n\nC) Uruguay's distinction between citizenship and nationality is common among other countries, similar to the U.S. presidency requirements.\n\nD) Legal citizens of Uruguay face international travel difficulties due to the country's unusual passport policies.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, Uruguay makes a unique distinction between citizenship and nationality.

When Company X transfers the shares to Company Y for less than market value, it is still considered a disposal for tax purposes. The capital gains tax (CGT) liability for Company X will be calculated based on the market value of \u00a3500,000, not the nominal fee of \u00a31,000 paid by Company Y.

If you have a Korean lational parent, you are automatically Korean. Before March 31 of the year you turn 18, you must renounce your Korean citizenship, lest you be then subject to the military service law. If you were a Korean citizen and then gained another citizenship, you automatically lose your Korean citizenship, and if you did not complete your military obligation and did not obtain an overseas travel permit, you may be punished if you ever return to Korea. The travel permit lets you postpone military service until age 37, so if you are living overseas, by January 15 of the year you turn 25 you must apply for a travel permit.\n\nThe laws are set up so that you must enlist by age 28, but must have obtained a travel permit by age 25\\. That means if you are abiding by the law, there is no risk of sudden conscription if you're there for a short period (e.g. as a tourist). The risk seems to come from not obtaining a travel permit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 24-year-old Korean-American male, born to a Korean national father and an American mother, is planning to visit South Korea for the first time.

What is the most likely outcome of his visit?\n\nA) He will be allowed to enter and leave the country without any issues, as he is an American citizen.\nB) He will be immediately drafted into the Korean military upon arrival.\nC) He will be denied entry at the border due to his dual citizenship status.\nD) He will be allowed to enter but may face legal consequences and potential conscription if he stays beyond a short tourist visit.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the US Embassy FAQ, individuals born to a Korean national parent automatically acquire Korean citizenship. If they don't renounce this citizenship before March 31 of the year they turn 18, they become subject to military service law. The individual in question is 24 years old and has never addressed his citizenship status or obtained a travel permit, which should have been done by January 15 of the year he turned 25. While he may be allowed to enter South Korea, he is at risk of facing legal consequences and potential conscription, especially if his stay extends beyond a brief tourist visit. The correct answer is not A, as his American citizenship doesn't exempt him from Korean laws regarding dual citizens. It's not B, because immediate drafting upon arrival is not the standard procedure.

I suppose this is something similar to the use of cigarettes, how does this work in these cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a saying that you can't sue city hall: that is applicable here. Governments enjoy sovereign immunity, and cannot be sued for their errors of judgment unless they specifically allow it. Safety regulations are an example of a situation where the government hold all of the power and shoulders none of the responsibility. If a government forbids sale or use of a substance on some grounds (could be safety, could be economic impact, could be something about preventing the moral decay of society), and the grounds later turns to be false, you cannot sue the government because of lost business opportunities.\n\nGenerally speaking, that which is not prohibited is allowed, so there would have to be an affirmative duty for the government to prevent all forms of harm. If there were such a legal duty, there is a miniscule legal foundation for suing the government for shirking its duty. That is not a completely hypothetical possibility, in that the state of Washington imposes a constitutional duty on the legislature to provide public education, and the Supreme Court has done things to enforce this duty (the contempt of court fines are up in the realm of $80 million).\n\nSince there is no jurisdiction that imposes a duty on the government to absolutely prevent all harm, you won't be able to sue the government if they fail to outlaw a thing that is eventually proven to harm someone.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A government agency approves a food preservative for widespread use, but years later, scientific studies conclusively prove it to be carcinogenic.

The concept of sovereign immunity protects governments from being sued for errors in judgment or policy decisions, including those related to safety regulations. As stated in the documentation, \"Governments enjoy sovereign immunity, and cannot be sued for their errors of judgment unless they specifically allow it.\" The government is not automatically liable for approving substances that later turn out to be harmful. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the government's decision-making process in approving substances is generally protected by sovereign immunity, even if later proven to be flawed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because strict liability typically applies to manufacturers and sellers of products, not to government regulatory decisions. Moreover, sovereign immunity would still protect the government in this case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while courts can sometimes enforce specific constitutional duties (as in the Washington education example), there is typically no general duty for the government to prevent all forms of harm, and courts cannot arbitrarily impose fines on the government for policy decisions."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70208/i-used-a-3d-asset-in-my-game-that-was-distributed-under-cc-license-later-i-foun", "docs_id": 70208, "title": "I used a 3D asset in my game that was distributed under CC license.

The details of the law, including the rules on damages and other remidies, will vary from country to country.\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") those rules are contained in [Chapter 5 of title 17 USC](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html) particularly sections 502\\-505\\. Section 504 provides for possible money damages. Section 502 provides for a possible injunction (court order to stop infringing). Section 503 provides for for infringing works to be seized. Section 505 provides for possible awards of costs and legal fees to a successful plaintiff (copyright holder).\n\nSection 502 allows injunctions to \"prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright\" on \"reasonable\" terms. But when the infringement has already been stopped, no such injunction is needed and a court is not likely to impose one.\n\nSection 503 allows the court to order the impoundment of infringing copies and \"plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced\". This is largely obsolete for digital content.\n\nSection 504 is the key. It offers the plaintiff a choice between actual damages plus profits and statutory damages. The rule for the first is:\n\n> The copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.\n\nThis means money made by use of the unauthorized content, plus any loss of sales or other losses suffered by the owner. Money mad by the infringing work but not made by use of the infringing content is not included, if this can be proven. Income obtained after the infringing content was removed would probably not be included in the infringer's profits.\n\nStatutory damages can be any amount between $750 and $30,000 that the count thinks is just, but id the infringement is proved to be \"innocent\" the lower limit is $200\\. The exact provision reads:\n\n> In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200\\.\n\nAn award of costs and fees under section 505 is entirely up to the discretion of the court.\n\nIf the maximum possible award of infringer's profits is $10,000, and a defense of innocent infringement is plausible, a plaintiff might well find such a suit unprofitable, given the legal expenses involved in preparing an carrying through such a suit. But that is entirely up to the copyright owner. An owner may choose to file even an unprofitable suit in an effort to deter others.\n\nA person who has discovered that s/he has innocently infringed a copyright and made some money in the process would be wise to document the prompt removal of the infringing content form any publication, and efforts to notify the copyright owner. Ther is no way to be sure what actions the owner will take, if any, within those that the law allows.\n\nOften a owner in such a case will not bring suit if the infringement was apparently innocent, resulting profits were small, the infringement has been halted, and future infringement by that infringer seems unlikely.

However, if the infringer can prove the infringement was innocent, the court may reduce the damages to a sum not less than $200. The developer's quick action to remove the content and attempt to contact the copyright holder could support a claim of innocent infringement, but it doesn't guarantee protection from lawsuit or damages.

How does subjective application differ from objective application of an OS?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The next part of the sentence (after the bolded text) explains how an objective standard may be applied subjectively: \n\n> there are no clear criteria from the cases indicating how errors of judgment are to be identified.\n\nEssentially, my view of whether an error is the kind of error a competent professional might make may differ from your view of whether that same error is the kind a competent professional might make. Because there are no criteria established, the application is subjective. \n\nConversely, if there were criteria that you and I were both bound to apply in making this determination, then you and I would be using an objective standard to determine if that error was the type a competent professional might make.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Canadian tort law, the distinction between incompetence and \"errors in judgment\" for professionals is described as \"an objective standard which is subjectively applied.\" Which of the following best explains this concept?\n\nA) The standard is objective because it's based on written laws, but subjective because judges interpret these laws differently.\n\nB) The standard is objective because it refers to what a competent professional might do, but subjective because there are no clear criteria for identifying errors of judgment.\n\nC) The standard is objective because it's applied equally to all professionals, but subjective because it depends on the professional's personal circumstances.\n\nD) The standard is objective because it's determined by expert witnesses, but subjective because the jury ultimately decides based on their personal opinions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct because it accurately captures the essence of the \"objective standard which is subjectively applied\" concept in this context. The standard is objective in that it refers to what a competent professional might do, which is an external benchmark. However, it's subjectively applied because, as the passage states, \"there are no clear criteria from the cases indicating how errors of judgment are to be identified.\" This lack of established criteria means that different individuals may have different interpretations of what constitutes an error a competent professional might make, leading to subjective application.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the subjectivity doesn't arise from different interpretations of written laws, but from the lack of clear criteria for identifying errors of judgment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the subjectivity doesn't stem from considering the professional's personal circumstances, but from the lack of clear criteria for identifying errors of judgment.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the standard isn't determined by expert witnesses, nor is the subjectivity related to jury decisions. The subjectivity comes from the lack of clear criteria for identifying errors of judgment."}}
