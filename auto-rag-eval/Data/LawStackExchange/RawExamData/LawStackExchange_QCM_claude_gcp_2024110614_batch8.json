The details of the license depend on your use, the licensing agency, and the item being licensed. Online music licensing is a business, and there are a number of options to choose from. One concern would be assuring that the service didn't just become a way to get free music. Whether or not you could find an agency willing to create such a license is, well, not a legal question.\n\nApart from the problem of making the works available online, there is also the matter of copyright and your lesson plans. It is not clear what the content of such lesson plans is, but if you would be inserting substantial excerpts from the lyrics into your text, you need permission (a license) to do that. You can certainly talk about Taylor Swift's \"mean\" in your book and can quote brief passages (under the \"fair use\" doctrine), but you can't just copy the lyrics without permission.

The *actus reus* of an attempt requires the accused to have taken steps that were more than \"mere preparation\" (*R. v.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to s. 24(1) of the Criminal Code, an attempt to commit an offense is criminalized \"whether or not it was possible under the circumstances to commit the offence.\"\n2. The documentation explicitly states that \"factual impossibility is not a defence to an attempt charge.\"\n3. The friends had the intent (mens rea) to commit theft and took actions beyond mere preparation (actus reus), which are the two key elements required for an attempt charge.\n4. The fact that the diamond was fake represents a case of factual impossibility, which does not negate the criminal attempt.\n\nOption A is incorrect because factual impossibility does not prevent conviction for an attempt. Option B is wrong because factual impossibility cannot be used as a defense in this scenario. Option D is incorrect because their actions likely surpass mere preparation and constitute an attempt, regardless of whether they actually took the diamond.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (attempt, mens rea, actus reus, factual impossibility), applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about how these legal principles interact in practice."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90334/landlord-picks-lock-enter-premises-without-a-judgment-for-possession", "docs_id": 90334, "title": "Landlord Picks Lock &amp; Enter Premises Without a Judgment for Possession?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a landlord enters residential premises without receiving a judgment for possession and without the presence of a Special Civil Part Officer what recourse does the tenant have USA?\n\nCan they be charged with trespassing?\n\nIllegal lockout?

The correct answer, D, is the strongest argument because kicking a restrained individual in the head is highly unlikely to be considered reasonable force under any circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pepper spray can be considered reasonable force in some situations.

The other countries of the E.U. (as of 1984\\) had rules similar to those of Britain's loser pays rule, although there was significant variation in detail from country to country that made this less of an omnibus statement than it might seem. See Werner Pfenningstorf, \"[The European Experience With Fee Shifting](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3749&context=lcp)\", 47(1\\) Law and Contemporary Problems 37 (1984\\).\n\nMost countries with civil law systems (i.e. those systems based upon the civil code tradition of Continental Europe rather than the common law tradition of England or something else entirely) outside of Europe in Africa and Asia are derived from the French Civil Code (most of West, Northwest and Central Africa, for example), or the German Civil Code (Korea and Japan, for example), and probably have followed in the footsteps on their parent legal traditions on this issue. This is also true of most formerly Communist Eastern European countries.\n\nMost countries in Spanish speaking Latin America, however, have legal systems derived from the Spanish legal tradition (and national constitutions modeled on that of the U.S.), so other countries besides the U.S. and Spain without automatic fee shifting to a prevailing party are probably located in Latin America. Some of these Latin American countries, however. probably adopted fee shifting rules of their own, and many of these countries declared independence from Spain before Spain adopted its civil code, so the extent to which those countries follow the Spanish model may not be as complete as in countries that gained independence later on.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, however, in most civil law countries, the fees that an attorney can charge are usually significantly more highly regulated than in the United States, so the possibility of extremely high litigation fees is lower. Furthermore, civil litigation, in general, involves lower attorney fees on average in civil law countries (and in Islamic law and Chinese style Communist countries) than in the United States, in litigated cases, because the process is less attorney resource intensive due to civil procedure differences.\n\nSo far as I know, fee shifting is also not used in Islamic law countries, where the basic assumption is that the parties are often pro se (i.e. without lawyers) and the institution of a professional legal class post\\-dates the establishment of the relevant legal rules.\n\nI do not know what the situation is in the People's Republic of China or similar legal systems.\n\n**The American Rule**\n\nIt also bears noting that there are many exceptions to the \"American rule\" in U.S. law.\n\nWhile the American rule does not shift attorney fees, fees for out of pocket litigation expenses such as filing fees, copying charges, and expert witness fees are shifted as a matter of course to the prevailing party.\n\nMost professionally drafted written agreements have fee shifting provisions.\n\nMany specific statutes (e.g. civil rights actions and many labor law and consumer rights enforcement cases) also have fee shifting provisions (sometimes one sided, sometimes two sides).\n\nFees can also be awarded in certain kinds of breach of fiduciary duty litigation contexts and in cases involving a dispute over a \"common fund\".\n\nIn divorce cases, litigation costs of both sides are often (really usually) allocated by the court in proportion to ability to pay, as \"winning\" and \"losing\" are ill defined.\n\nThe biggest areas where fees shifting would be unusual in the U.S. would be in common law tort lawsuits, such as negligence cases (e.g. automobile accidents and slip and fall cases), strict liability products liability cases, defamation cases, intentional harm cases, and fraud actions. The American rule also applies in cases of oral contracts or contracts drafted by inexpert non\\-lawyers. Even in those cases various kinds of litigation misconduct can result in fee shifting.\n\nIn U.S. tort cases, defendants usually have their attorney fees paid for by their insurance company, and plaintiffs often have an attorney paid on a contingent fee basis. Furthermore, awards by juries for non\\-economic damages and/or punitive damages often makes it possible for a prevailing plaintiff to receive full or nearly full economic loss compensation in such lawsuits, with the non\\-economic and/or punitive damages awards effectively providing resources to pay the attorney for the plaintiff on top of economic loss compensation for the plaintiff.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A legal scholar is comparing fee-shifting practices across different jurisdictions.

If the premise is restricted, access can be restricted pretty arbitrarily, apart from infringing on a person's property interest in the facility. A laboratory, for example, may restrict access to a specific list of people, or to a describable class of people. \"A department\" is a pretty big thing and generally does not describe a concrete location, but perhaps you mean \"may not enter the department office\" or \"may not enter any of the following offices\".

It avoids making assumptions about the nature of the space (public vs. restricted) or the specific authority issuing the ban, both of which are variable factors according to the documentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because filing a lawsuit is premature without first exhausting internal procedures, and the documentation doesn't definitively state that all university spaces are public.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it falsely assumes all university buildings are public places, which the documentation contradicts by discussing restricted areas.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the documentation mentions that higher authorities typically have more clout, it doesn't definitively state that only the dean can issue such bans.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the student to integrate multiple legal concepts and apply them to a complex, real-world situation, rather than simply recalling facts."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45542/using-screen-recording-of-clients-products-in-promotion", "docs_id": 45542, "title": "Using screen recording of client&#39;s products in promotion", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work at a company that creates software that developers use in their frontend.

Terms of Service", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Wag!](https://wagwalking.com/) is an app for dog sitting services.\nAccording to their [terms](https://wagwalking.com/terms), once you get acquainted with a pet care provider through Wag! platform, you cannot obtain for life pet care services from the dog sitter, off their platform. If you do, Wag! can charge your card a $1,000 referral fee and the same applies to the dog sitter.\n\nEDIT\n\nNote that the mentioned contract provision has no expiration. You are subject to $1,000 payment whenever during your lifetime you should happen to ask for a pet care service to someone met through Wag!. Is this legal?\n\nThe provision is akin to a non\\-compete clause where the dog sitter agrees not to start a separate business in competition against their employer. In that case $1,000 qualifies as a compensation for breaching the agreement. However dog sitters (like Uber drivers) are not Wag! employees, and by the way these clauses are not permissible in all jurisdictions.\nThis is might be the reason they use the term 'referral fee', anyway, the fee is many times more the value of the referred pet\\-care services: imagine to pay $10,000 for a second hand car and $50,000 for someone helping finding the seller. It is reasonable to assume nobody would willingly accept to pay such a huge fee and the only reason to enter the contract is the misrepresentation of the associated costs.\n\nAll that given:\n\n1. How such a clause is to be construed (in a court)?\n2. If they charge customers credit cards with a $1,000 referral fee, what type of legal protection will they have?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: About the part where they say that will charge your payment method, when you terminate your relationship with the company, you should send registered mail withdrawing authorization to charge your credit card thereafter, and you should notify the credit card company that further charges are not authorized. This won't change your legal liability, it just changes whether they have to first prove that you are legally liable before collecting the money.\n\nIt is problematic that only the company has the right to terminate the contract, but you can treat that as a harmless omission of wording on their part. Surely they did not intend that you are perpetually bound to the terms of the contract and the obligations in section 11\\. Of course, you have to stop using their services in order to terminate the contract. Given the nature of their service, you can send a notice (registered mail again) to them informing them that you are terminating the contract and will not be using their services.\n\nIf then some time in the future you do hire a pet walker that you met through the service, they might come after you for the $1,000 (although, at their sole discretion, they can increase that amount to $20,000 or anything else, see section 2\\). If you have prevented them from charging your credit card, they would have to get a judgement against you, meaning they would have to go for arbitration. Or, if they did charge your credit card, then you would have to initiate the proceedings to get your money back. That is, unless you opted out of arbitration within 30 days of starting the relationship. Let's assume you did opt out.\n\nThe question would then be whether a perennial \"no\\-compete\" clause would be enforceable against you. Employees are often bound to no\\-compete agreements prohibiting them from doing the same work in the same area for a certain period of time. A lifelong no\\-compete agreement would be unenforceable, at least in court, but a 6\\-month no\\-compete clause could easily be. In [Medix Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Dumrauf](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2017cv06648/344091/36/0.pdf?ts=1524130353), the court recites standard legal requirements of enforceable no\\-compete agreements, especially that they be \"reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer\". In such a case, the court would consider \"the hardship caused to the employee, the effect upon the general public, and the scope of the restrictions\", and the company would have to show that the \"full extent of the restraint is necessary for protecting its interests\". It is in principle possible that the court would find such a clause unenforceable (owing to it imposing a life\\-long obligation on you). This could be a new area of law: customer non\\-compete clauses. \nOne other point about that clause is that it is just a penalty clause, which is unenforceable (calling it a \"referral fee\" doesn't change the fact that it is a penalty clause). It can't reasonably be interpreted as a liquidated damages clause (which is enforceable). $100 might be.\n\nYou might rely on the mercy of the court, hoping that they would find such a perma\\-ban clause to be \"unconscionable\" and unenforceable; in principle, the arbitrator could find the same thing. An alternative would be to accept the conditions in the contract, and never hire that dog\\-walker on your own.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A dog owner regularly uses Wag! to find pet sitters. After developing a good relationship with one particular sitter, they decide to hire them directly for future services to save money. Six months later, Wag! discovers this arrangement and charges the owner's credit card $1,000 as per their terms. The owner disputes this charge. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and potential outcome?\n\nA) The charge is likely enforceable as it's a legitimate liquidated damages clause protecting Wag!'s business interests\nB) The owner can easily win the dispute by proving the arrangement occurred after terminating their Wag! account\nC) The charge is likely unenforceable due to being an unreasonable penalty clause with no time limitation\nD) Wag! can enforce the charge if they can prove the owner didn't opt-out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of contract law and the specific terms of Wag!'s agreement. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The $1,000 fee is likely to be considered a penalty clause rather than a legitimate liquidated damages clause. Courts generally disfavor penalty clauses that are punitive rather than a reasonable estimate of actual damages.\n\n2. The lifelong nature of the prohibition is likely to be seen as unreasonable. As mentioned in the documentation, even employee non-compete clauses typically have time limitations, and a lifelong restriction would likely be considered unenforceable.\n\n3. The fee is disproportionate to the value of the services, which further supports it being an unreasonable penalty.\n\n4. While A might seem plausible, it mischaracterizes the fee as liquidated damages when it's more likely to be seen as a penalty.\n\n5. B is incorrect because merely terminating the Wag! account doesn't negate the terms of service that were agreed to.\n\n6. D is a distractor that combines true elements (the arbitration opt-out) with an incorrect conclusion.

Can Congress essentially pardon a violation of law through legislation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can Congress essentially pardon a violation of law through\n>  legislation?\n\nYes.\n\nCongress has the power to retroactivity reduce the sentence for a crime for which someone has been sentenced. This was done most recently in the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/drug-law-reform/fair-sentencing-act) that reduced excessive penalties for crack cocaine relative to powder cocaine.\n\nIn the same way, when the death penalty is legislatively repealed in a state, the death sentences of the handful of people on death row at the time is often commuted legislatively.\n\nWhile Congress cannot impose criminal penalties on someone legislatively, which is a [Bill of Attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) and constitutionally prohibited, it can single out people for special treatment in a [private bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_bill), which is a constitutional exercise of legislative power at the federal level (not every state allows private bills to be enacted due to Progressive era reforms to state constitutions).\n\nFor example, private bills often eliminate the collateral effects of a criminal conviction upon a person, there is even [a standard procedure for doing so](https://www.shusterman.com/privatebillruleshouseofrepresentatives/), which is functionally equivalent to a Presidential pardon of the crime for that purposes (the vast majority of Presidential pardons are issued after the person convicted has served the sentence for the crime).\n\nA private bill cannot impair contract or property rights, which would be a prohibited *[ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law)* law. \n\nBut no one other than the federal government has a legally protected interest in keeping someone incarcerated or otherwise punishing them for a crime. Crimes are prosecuted in the name of the People and victims of crimes do not have legal rights in those proceedings except as created by statute. So, this would not be an *ex post facto* bill or a *taking* governed by the Fifth Amendment for takings of property interests. And, Congress may, by legislation, determine what the federal government will do in essentially all cases where it is not expressly prohibited from doing so (some argue that there is a minimum of federal authority vested exclusively in the President in the area of foreign affairs and military affairs, but that exclusivity of power does not extend to domestic criminal justice).\n\nBasically, anything that Congress could do for everyone via a public bill, it can do for someone in particular via a private bill, unless a specific constitutional prohibition applies, and there is no such prohibition when it comes to relieving someone from a sentence or the collateral effects of a criminal conviction prospectively via a private bill. This isn't exactly equivalent to a Presidential pardon or commutation, but it is very close to one in practical effect.\n\nFor a fuller, but somewhat outdated treatment of the issue, you can read this [1939 article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3734&context=californialawreview) in the California Law Review which acknowledged that legislative pardons were possible under existing law. \n\nThis said, government prosecutors routinely fervently oppose any retroactive criminal legislation that reduces punishment, particularly via private laws (although some countries, such as France, have constitutional requirements to retroactively reduce the sentences of anyone currently serving time for a crime whose punishment is legislatively reduced prospectively).\n\nPrivate bills that constitute legislative pardons are very rare. A [2011 law review article](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=clsops_papers) recounts how the tool of the legislative pardon (in parallel with the executive pardon which is also used much less frequency) has fallen into disuse. \n\nPart of the decline is due to the adoption of the right to appeal from a trial court criminal convictions which did not exist in the federal system until the 1890s. Until then, the only judicial relief available from a federal criminal conviction was via a writ of habeas corpus, and that was available only on very limited grounds such as a lack of jurisdiction to conduct the trial, or the non\\-existence of the crime of conviction. Conviction by a jury in a court with jurisdiction of a constitutionally permissible crime was an absolute defense to the extent of the sentence imposed to a habeas corpus petition at that time.\n\n(As a footnote, the term \"private bill\" can be confusing. In many governments with a parliamentary system, a \"private bill\" means one sponsored by an individual legislator rather than the prime minister and his or her cabinet. But, in U.S. terminology, a \"private bill\" refers to a bill with an effect limited to one person or a small number of persons who are either identified by name or by a very narrowly defined situation.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A controversial public figure has been convicted of a federal crime, but the President refuses to pardon them despite significant public pressure.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the potential outcomes and implications of this scenario?\n\nA) Congress cannot pass such a bill as it would violate the separation of powers doctrine by infringing on the President's exclusive right to pardon.\n\nB) Congress can pass the bill, but it would be limited to removing collateral effects of the conviction without affecting the original sentence.\n\nC) Congress can pass the bill to fully pardon the individual, but it would require a constitutional amendment to be legally valid.\n\nD) Congress can pass the bill to effectively pardon the individual, including eliminating both the sentence and collateral effects, despite potential opposition from prosecutors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that Congress has the power to retroactively reduce sentences and even effectively pardon individuals through legislation, specifically through private bills.\n\n2. This power extends beyond just removing collateral effects (which option B suggests) and can include eliminating the sentence itself, making it functionally equivalent to a Presidential pardon in many ways.\n\n3.

The second is whether all civil wrongs constitute crimes and hence can be regarded as illegal acts.\n\nA *crime* is generally defined as *an act or omission that is prohibited by law*. Thus, from what I understand, states will have various statutes that are passed by their respective legislatures defining what acts/omissions constitute crimes in their jurisdiction as well as what their potential punishments will be. For example, California may have a law written in a statute somewhere saying that an individual may not assault someone and that the penalty is no more than 2 years imprisonment etc.\n\nNow suppose someone in California bumps into someone else walking on the pavement (accidently) causing the other to fall and injure themselves. In this case, because the action of bumping into someone had no malice aforethought (it was accidental), we could say that the individual has not in fact committed a crime but instead has possibly committed a *civil wrong* (a *tort*). If this is the case, are there statutes in each respective state defining exactly what acts and omissions constitute civil wrongs? If there are statutes defining these civil wrongs, surely this would mean that all actions/omissions defined by statute to be civil wrongs are also in fact *prohibited by law* ? (since there exists a statute stating that the act/omission carries with it a potential penalty etc). If this is true, all civil wrongs must necessarily be *crimes* as well as civil wrongs since they are prohibited by law because a statute declaring a potential penalty for an act/omission is functionally a prohibition by law.\n\nAm I correct in my thinking here? Is it the case that all civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they constitute actions/omissions that are prohibited by law (since there exists statutes defining them and their potential penalties)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The detailed answer depends on the jurisdiction that you are asking about (e.g. Saudi Arabia, France, US or specifically California): my answer is about the US. You should note that the term \"crime\" originally comes from Ancient Greek [\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=kri/ma), which means \"decision; judgment\": the word form is pretty stable, compared to the concepts that it is associated with. When the legal system changes, the referent of \"crime\" changes. Some facts about how the words are used are because of historically earlier concepts. At an earlier stage of English law, there was no distinction between crimes and civil wrongs, there were simply wrongs (\"tort\", in French).\n\nIn contemporary American practice, \"crime\" is a sub\\-type of offense against the government, the other being an \"infraction\" (such as a parking ticket). \"Civil wrong\" encompasses breaches of contract, breaches of trust, and \"torts\" such as trespassing and assault, and have in common that they are wrongs against an individual. If you commit a crime, it is you against the government, and one set of principles is adhered to in deciding *guilt*. If you commit a civil wrong, it is you against the individual (though it may be that the government acts as the mouthpiece when e.g. the \"citizens of California\" have been each wronged), and different principles are adhered to in deciding *liability*.\n\nThe distinction can be murky given overlap in certain cases, for example assault is both a crime, as dictated by statutory law and punishable by prison time, and also a tort (sub\\-type of civil wrong) as recognized at common law (traditionally recognized since the 13th century in England), and passed on to modern America. You can sue a person for the tort of assault, but the government prosecutes you for committing the statutory offense of assault. In the case of a lawsuit over assault, you seek compensation for the harm done do you, you do not seek punishment for an offense against society. That is the function of criminal law, to define the acts which may be punished.\n\nMost states in the US have done away with \"common law crimes\", but as far as I know the remnants of common law crime in the US are limited to \"definitions\" \u2013 punishments are set out in statutory law. An example of common law definitional inheritance is \"assault\" under [Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.36&full=true), where assault includes poisoning, transmitting HIV, and assaulting in various ways (relying on the common law definition of \"assault\"). This common law definition is then transmitted to the juror via a [set of instructions](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Iefa7d8b5e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?contextData=%28sc.Default%29&transitionType=Default), which summarize the case law that defines \"assault\".\n\nAs you can see, there is a bright line between crimes and civil wrongs, so it is plainly not the case that all civil wrongs are crimes. A number of civil wrongs are statutorily defined (e.g. copyright infringement), and there is in the US a tendency to statutorily encode the essentials of civil wrongs as well as crimes.\n\nYou are probably right that crime is \"generally\" defined as an act or omission prohibited by law, where \"generally\" means \"by most people\", but that is because most people don't have a clear understanding of \"law\", \"statute\" and \"common law\". Here in Law SE, we tend to use \"legal\" in a very broad sense, meaning \"would probably be allowed and not incur any sanction by the courts\". Copyright infringement is not (necessarily) a crime, but it is prohibited by law, thus \"prohibited by law\" is not a good definition of crime.\n\nBecause of the distinction between \"crime\" and \"infraction\", both of which are cases of the individual vs. the government, \"crime\" has to be defined in terms of a specific aspect of the statutory law, the punishment. You can be imprisoned for committing a crime, but not for an infraction, such as a parking ticket. In Washington, [\"infraction\" is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=7.84.020) with reference to Title 76, 77, 79, or 79A RCW or RCW 7\\.84\\.030(2\\)(b) that \"is declared not to be a criminal offense and is subject to the provisions of this chapter\", such as [fishing with barbed hooks](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.15.160). Even though the government is the prosecutor in such a case, [the offense is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.84&full=true) is said to be \"civil in nature\".\n\nIn other words, the distinction is anything but clear.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about civil wrongs and crimes, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software developer accidentally releases a faulty update that causes users' private data to be publicly visible for 24 hours.

The user's deliberate action to remove the popup and continue using the site could be interpreted as implied consent.\n3. Legal principles such as \"unclean hands\" and estoppel might apply, as the user's actions led the site owner to believe they had accepted the terms.\n4. The top answer suggests that courts would likely treat such actions as legally equivalent to clicking \"I agree.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because mere non-clicking doesn't exempt the user, especially when they've taken deliberate action to bypass the terms. Option C is unlikely as website owners aren't typically held responsible for users circumventing their systems.

Automatically purchasing games from Steam upon customer order and immediately transferring the license closely resembles the situation described in the original question, where the seller doesn't actually own the game but buys it from Steam to resell at a profit. This practice is likely to violate Steam's EULA, as it involves an unauthorized automated purchasing system and immediate transfer of licenses, which may exceed the scope of the license granted by Steam.\n\nOption A is less problematic because purchasing from authorized distributors typically comes with resale rights, though it still requires careful review of the distributor's terms.\n\nOption B is generally considered legal, as it involves users reselling their own legitimately acquired licenses, which is often protected under the first-sale doctrine (though digital goods can be more complex).\n\nOption D, while potentially problematic from a business ethics standpoint, doesn't inherently violate legal principles if the keys were legitimately acquired with resale rights.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to real-world scenarios in the digital marketplace, requiring integration of multiple ideas from the documentation and critical thinking about the implications of different business models in relation to EULAs and license transferability."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38070/what-are-the-types-of-personal-data", "docs_id": 38070, "title": "What are the types of personal data?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the GDPR, the concept of **data categories** is used and examples of such categories are given.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The origin of the mold (licensed or unlicensed) doesn't affect the bakery owner's right to use the character's likeness commercially.\n2.

The correct answer, D, is the most appropriate action because:\n\n1. According to ORS 113.165, the personal representative (executor) is required to file an inventory of the decedent's property with the court within 30 days of appointment. The question states this wasn't done, which is a violation of legal requirements.\n\n2. While option A mentions the 4-month timeframe from the \"Information to devisees\" notice (ORS 113.075 and 113.145), removing the executor isn't necessarily the first or most appropriate step, especially without evidence of intentional wrongdoing.\n\n3. Option B is incorrect because the 30-day timeframe applies to the executor's duty to file the initial inventory, not the beneficiary's right to request it.\n\n4. Option C relates to contesting the will itself, which isn't the issue here; the problem is with the executor's actions, not the will's validity.\n\n5.

The correct answer, C, is the most legally sound and ethically appropriate approach for several reasons:\n\n1.

The regulations state that \"A covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose protected health information except as permitted or required by this subpart or by subpart C of part 160 of this subchapter.\"\n\nThe documentation specifically mentions that there is no general rule allowing disclosure to interested individuals, even spouses, without the consent of the individual to whom the information pertains.

The correct answer, C, aligns with both legal obligations and best practices outlined in the Postal Services Act 2000 and Royal Mail's advice.\n\nOption A, while well-intentioned, still constitutes delaying the mail, which is not allowed under Section 84 of the Postal Services Act 2000. It doesn't solve the problem of getting the mail to the intended recipient or notifying senders of incorrect addresses.\n\nOption B is explicitly illegal according to Section 84(1)(a) of the Act, which prohibits intentionally opening a postal packet in the course of its transmission.\n\nOption D, while tempting for convenience, violates the legal obligation not to delay or destroy mail. As per the Act, the mail is still considered to be \"in course of transmission\" until it reaches the addressee, not just the address.\n\nOption C correctly follows Royal Mail's advice, which satisfies the legal requirement not to delay mail while also taking proactive steps to resolve the situation.

The police, or the store manager, can legally request you to come in for a conversation: what matters most is whether you were forced to come in against your will. By your report, you were not, so your rights were not violated. The police are irrelevant to the remainder of the question.\n\nWhat remains is whether your rights were violated because the manager told you to go away and never come back under pain of prosecution. The store is private property, meaning that the owner has wide latitude to grant or deny permission to enter. If they hate pink hair and your hair is pink, they can legally \"ban\" you.

The correct answer is B because the core issue revolves around the store manager's right to refuse service and ban individuals from the premises, which stems from private property rights.\n\nWhile option A (Fourth Amendment) might seem relevant due to police involvement, the documentation indicates that the customer voluntarily entered the store when asked, so there was no unreasonable search or seizure. \n\nOption C (false imprisonment) could be considered if the customer was forcibly detained, but the facts don't support this conclusion. \n\nOption D (First Amendment) is not directly applicable to this situation, as it doesn't involve government restriction on association.\n\nThe key principle, as explained in the documentation, is that store owners have \"wide latitude to grant or deny permission to enter\" their private property.

One of my points is that, supposing what they're already doing is technically legal, it is not \"faithfully executing\" the law.\n\nIn the abstract, is there any history that might suggest there are two differing standards of legality...one which is \"faithful\" and one which merely passes a base level test of legality?\n\nObviously I am referring to clauses in different constitutions which require the executive to (in so many words) \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The distinction you have drawn resembles the traditional distinction between (common) **[law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Connotation_3._Law_as_opposed_to_equity) and [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law))**. In the seventeenth century, English courts of law exercised an ancient jurisdiction that was inflexible and formalistic, while courts of equity exercised a more wide\\-ranging [ecclesiastical jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_jurisdiction) according to the Lord Chancellor's conscience. Law and equity were 'fused' to some extent by the [*Judicature Acts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicature_Acts) from 1873 onwards, but the distinction still has practical significance.\n\nIn many cases, equity provides a remedy where the strict application of the common law could result in **unconscionable** outcomes. For example, it is equity which requires a [trustee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee) to manage trust property in the interest of beneficiaries, even though the trustee is the legal owner of the property. Equity may also require people to return money they have received by accident or where it would be unconscionable for them to retain it, even though there is no relationship between the parties under the common law of tort or contract.\n\nThe concept of unconscionability is closely linked to the idea of exercising powers 'faithfully.' Equity is the source of [**fiduciary** duties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary), which are essentially legally\\-enforceable duties to be **faithful** to a principal.

Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A government official is accused of implementing a policy that, while technically legal, does not align with the spirit of the law. Which legal concept best explains the basis for this accusation and provides a framework for evaluating the official's actions?\n\nA) Common law precedent\nB) Equity and fiduciary duty\nC) Statutory interpretation\nD) Constitutional supremacy\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The concept of equity and fiduciary duty best addresses the situation described in the question. The documentation discusses the distinction between strict legality and \"faithful execution\" of the law, which closely aligns with the principles of equity and fiduciary duty.\n\nEquity, as explained in the documentation, provides remedies where strict application of common law could result in unconscionable outcomes. This relates directly to the scenario where an action might be technically legal but not in the spirit of the law.\n\nFurthermore, the documentation explicitly links the concept of \"faithfully\" executing laws to fiduciary duties, which are rooted in equity. Fiduciary duties require individuals in positions of trust (like government officials) to act in the best interests of their principals (in this case, the public and the law itself).\n\nThe other options, while relevant to legal practice, don't specifically address the nuance between technical legality and faithful execution:\n\nA) Common law precedent is more about following past judicial decisions, not about evaluating the spirit of the law.\nC) Statutory interpretation, while important, doesn't capture the ethical dimension implied by \"faithful execution.\"\nD) Constitutional supremacy deals with the hierarchy of laws, not the manner of their execution.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (equity, fiduciary duty, faithful execution) and applies them to a real-world scenario of policy implementation, testing critical thinking about legal principles beyond mere technical compliance."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92700/is-it-legal-to-create-a-website-that-freely-provides-the-contents-of-books-which", "docs_id": 92700, "title": "Is it legal to create a website that freely provides the contents of books which are another company&#39;s IP?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is rather specific.

The success of the Yacht Rock web series has materially benefited the real\\-life musicians whose stories it purports to tell. Its success renewed popular interest in their catalogues sufficient for them to tour again. Some of these artists have acknowledged this publicly, [even seeking to promote their tours as \"yacht rock.\"](https://music.mxdwn.com/2018/07/14/reviews/concert-review-monsters-of-yacht-rock-christopher-cross-kenny-loggins-and-michael-mcdonald-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl/) Satellite radio entity [SIRIUS/XM created a \"yacht rock\" genre channel](https://www.siriusxm.com/yachtrockradio), while Rock Band [video game developers Harmonix recently released a \"yacht rock\" song pack](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/yacht-rock-pack-01-sets-sail), capitalizing on this renewed interest.\n3. [In 2008, a cover act from Atlanta formed, calling itself \"Yacht Rock Revue,\"](http://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/confessions-cover-band-yacht-rock-revue/) and playing a number of songs both consistent and inconsistent with the genre, as defined by the comedy group that coined the term \"yacht rock.\" However, what Yacht Rock Revue did that the comedy series writers did not is trademark the term \"yacht rock.\" (A USPTO search reveals that Yacht Rock Revue claims ownership of U.S. Registration Number 3834195, and in June 2018 filed an additional TEAS Plus application for its merchandise.) The band has since used its trademark to cease\\-and\\-desist \"yacht rock\" marketing used by other musicians, including the recording artists whose work they perform.\n4. In 2016, the creators of the Yacht Rock comedy series began a podcast called \"Beyond Yacht Rock,\" which creates and defines artificial/arbitrary genres of music. In the process, they honed their definition of \"yacht rock\" as a musical style, [created a \"Yachtski Scale\" to score the \"yachtiness\" of a given song](http://www.yachtrock.com/yacht-or-nyacht-jay-gradient/) along a series of (principally arbitrary) metrics, and wrote vigorous critical defenses of these definitions in a \"Captain's Blog.\" They even interviewed Yacht Rock Revue on the show, and discussed the merits of the band's \"yacht rock\" material vis\\-a\\-vis their definitions.\n5.

Did the original series writers have a trademark in the phrase either at common law, or by registering it?\n2. If they did have a trademark, what was the scope of goods or services covered by the trademark? Generally, a trademark can only be acquired for goods or services actually used by the person claiming it. There is no such thing as a trademark that applies universally.\n3. If they did have a trademark was it diluted to the point of becoming a generic term a la the term \"Xerox\" that lost its secondary meaning association with the goods or services of the original user of the trademark.\n4. Does the use by the radio program deceive the ordinary listener in a manner that causes the ordinarily listen to believe that the radio program is affiliated with the comedy show creators and benefits from the \"secondary meaning\" association with their show that they imparted to the term. A trademark isn't a prohibition on using the phrase, it is a prohibition on using the mark to deceptively market goods as associated with something that they are not associated with.\n5. Who owns any rights to the trademark, if there is one, and was it licensed? Often intellectual property in entertainment media is managed by multi\\-copyright owner association on behalf of IP owners who are often media companies. Typically radio stations including Sirius XM has a licensing agreement with all major management companies controlling the rights to the content that they play. It could be that a trademark is controlled by such an organization and within the scope of the station's license.\n6. Also, in addition to trademark claims, there could be claims that the station is creative derivative works of its work that is protected by copyright, subject to fair use, [sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire) (i.e. has yacht rock become a genre rather than a particular comedy group's baby), and licensing considerations.\n\nThe answers to these questions must be resolved to know that answer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular YouTube comedy series coined the term \"yacht rock\" in 2005 to describe a specific music genre.

The most significant challenge for the comedy series creators would be proving that their use of the term \"yacht rock\" in a parody series constitutes a valid trademark (Option A).\n\nThis is the most challenging aspect because:\n\n1. The creators didn't initially use the term as a trademark for goods or services, but rather as part of a comedic narrative. Trademark rights typically arise from commercial use, not creative expression.\n\n2. They didn't take steps to protect the term by registering it as a trademark, allowing others (like the cover band) to do so first.\n\n3. The term has been widely adopted by the music industry and media, potentially diluting any claim to exclusive rights.\n\n4. Parody and comedy are not typically considered as establishing trademark rights in the same way as commercial use.\n\nOption B is less likely because there's no evidence of fraud in the cover band's registration. They openly acknowledged the term's origin.\n\nOption C, while a possible argument, is not the most significant challenge. It could potentially invalidate the existing trademark but wouldn't necessarily give rights back to the creators.\n\nOption D is not a strong legal argument, as evolving definitions don't typically supersede registered trademarks.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about trademark law, the intersection of creative works and commercial rights, and the complexities of intellectual property in popular culture."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74009/us-equivalent-of-no-case-to-answer-before-trial", "docs_id": 74009, "title": "US equivalent of &quot;no case to answer&quot; before trial", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: At least in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, criminal defence can make a [\"no case to answer\"](https://www.defence-barrister.co.uk/submission-of-no-case-to-answer/) application *before* trial (they can also make one at the close of the prosecution's case during trial, but let's not be distracted by that).\n\nWhen they make such an application before trial, they basically assert that the prosecution's evidence is *not capable* of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Please make it clear under what scope the laws actually reside.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Brief detentions and reasonable suspicion\n\nYou can be briefly detained by police if they have reasonable suspicion that you committed a crime. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968\\)\n\nWhat reasonable suspicion \"means\" can only be fully understood by reference to subsequent case law (which I will expand this answer to do), but as a basis, the court said in Terry that:\n\n> the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion\n\nThis standard has been reiterated as recently as in Heien v. North Carolina 574 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\), where they say \"All parties agree that to justify this type of seizure \\[a traffic stop, in the case of Heien], officers need only reasonable suspicion \u2014 that is, a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of breaking the law\" (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe reasonable suspicion standard was also used recently in Navarette v. California 572 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\). They reiterated that reasonable suspicion is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability, quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330 (1990\\). A mere \"hunch\" does not create reasonable suspicion, but the level of suspicion required by the reasonable suspicion standard is \"obviously less than is necessary for probable cause\".\n\n### Arrests and probable cause\n\nTo be arrested, police require probable cause. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160 (1949\\)\n\nIn more detail, probable cause exists (from Brinegar v. U.S.):\n\n> where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed\n\nAlso:\n\n> The rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these often opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly hamper law enforcement. To allow less would be to leave law\\-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers' whim or caprice.\n\nAs in the case of reasonable suspicion, the probable cause analysis is case\\-by\\-case and fact\\-intensive, so to understand the contours of probable cause will require reference to much subsequent case law.\n\nIn Beck v.

Which of the following scenarios would most likely justify the officer's actions under current legal standards?\n\nA) The officer has a hunch that one of the teenagers might have been involved in a disturbance, but cannot articulate specific facts.\n\nB) A witness told the officer that \"some kids were causing trouble\" without providing any detailed description or specific actions.\n\nC) The officer observed one teenager matching the description of a suspect who was reported to have assaulted someone at the pool party minutes earlier.\n\nD) The officer wants to question all teenagers in the area as a precautionary measure, without any specific suspicion of wrongdoing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard as established in Terry v. Ohio and reaffirmed in subsequent cases. Option C is the correct answer because it provides the officer with \"specific and articulable facts\" that, combined with rational inferences, would reasonably warrant a brief detention.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a mere \"hunch\" does not meet the threshold for reasonable suspicion, as explicitly stated in Navarette v. California. \n\nOption B, while providing slightly more information than a hunch, still lacks the specificity required to establish reasonable suspicion. The information is too vague and doesn't connect any particular individual to a specific criminal activity.\n\nOption D represents an overreach of police authority. Detaining individuals without any specific suspicion of wrongdoing violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizures.\n\nOption C, however, meets the criteria for reasonable suspicion:\n1. It provides a specific description of a suspect.\n2. It links the suspect to a specific criminal act (assault).\n3. It places the suspect at the scene of the reported crime.\n4. The timing (minutes earlier) makes it reasonable for the officer to believe the suspect might still be in the area.\n\nThis scenario would likely justify a brief investigative detention under the Terry standard, allowing the officer to briefly stop the teenager matching the description to investigate further. However, it's important to note that this would not justify an arrest, which would require the higher standard of probable cause as established in Brinegar v.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. A motion for judgment on the pleadings is indeed a dispositive motion, similar to a motion to dismiss but typically filed after the pleadings are closed.\n\n2. When considering such a motion, the court treats it similarly to a motion to dismiss.

However, territories are federal entities and so in theory, any federal matter could be devolved to the territorial legislatures. This is hinted at with the s. 8 in your question. However, with the exception of some Aboriginal matters, the territorial acts are clear that the territorial legislatures do **not** have any competencies beyond that of the provinces (*Yukon Act* s. 20(1\\), *Northwest Territories Act* s. 25(1\\), *Nunavut Act* s. 23(2\\))\n\nThis makes our job easier: since the territorial legislatures can't legislate on criminal matters, any inconsistency with the *Criminal Code* would have to lie directly in those three territorial acts. While I could have missed something, I was unable to find any inconsistency in either the Yukon or Northwest Territory acts. So why does s. 8 of the *Criminal Code* exist? It seems to be a matter of how the legislation was historically structured: The *Criminal Code* would set the country\\-wide default, and any derogations could be placed in the territorial acts. See for example *[The King v. Standard Soap Company](https://www.canlii.org/en/nt/ntsc/doc/1907/1907canlii134/1907canlii134.html)*, 1907 CanLII 134 (NWT SC):\n\n> When the Criminal Code, 1892, was enacted, it was, by sec. 983, made applicable to the North\\-West Territories, except in so far as it was inconsistent with the provisions of the North\\-West Territories Act and the amendments thereto. As far as this case is concerned, the only Changes made in the Code by that Act are that instead of an indictment being presented by a grand jury to the Court where a person is charged with a criminal offence, the proceedings are commenced by a charge in writing setting forth the offence in the same manner as in an indictment.\n\nGrand juries no longer exist in Canada, so this inconsistency doesn't either (I speculate the original reason would have been the difficulty and expense of convening grand juries in such a sparsely populated territory).\n\nAs for Nunavut, well it seems Parliament threw the historical structure out the [Peace Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Tower) window. If you search for \"Yukon\" or \"Northwest\" in the *Criminal Code*, you'll find about 20 results each where they are mostly being treated the same as the provinces.

Furthermore, once people realize that their documents from these online services do not serve their purposes or have screwed them over, they must go to a lawyer anyway to fix the mess.\n\nWhat are some concrete examples of ways using documents from online services would not provide the proper protection? What is the approximate cost to have a lawyer fix said mistakes and in what situations would I come to realize the need to consult a lawyer in person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A single person LLC document is one where it probably makes less of a difference to have it drafted by a lawyer than many other documents because it has very few tax implications and governance is elementary. The main issues would be choosing a proper LLC name and correctly choosing whether it should be member managed or manager managed (almost always, manager managed is preferred).\n\nBut, the main reason to consult a lawyer is to determine if a single person LLC as opposed, for example, to an S corporation, is really the most appropriate entity form for your business.\n\nAmong the concerns would be how this form would interact with California's community property laws, determining whether the LLC is disregarded for [state franchise taxes as well as federal income taxes](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/businesses/Structures/Limited-Liability-Company.shtml), determining what impact the LLC makes on Medicaid planning and estate planning, determining whether the ability to reduce FICA taxation in an S\\-corporation makes it worth choosing that form rather than an LLC, determining whether there are liability insurance requirements that are triggered, and determining how this form impacts health insurance structures v. other alternatives.\n\nAn attorney could also advise you on the \"care and feeding\" of the LLC so that you are clear on how to observe the proper formalities. For example, many people forget to, or don't know how to, title property in the LLC name, don't know when to obtain a separate EIN for the LLC, don't know how to sign documents in the name of the LLC, don't know how to draft an LLC authorization, don't know that the LLC must be an insured on insurance policies, etc.\n\nAlso, an attorney normally wouldn't charge very much for a very simple entity like a single member LLC Operating Agreement.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that getting a lawyer to fix a problem after the fact caused by DIY work by a client is about ten times as great as the cost of hiring a lawyer to do it correctly in the first place.\n\nFor example, a single person LLC might cost $500\\-$750 to draft in the first place including a consultation about whether it was really appropriate and a care and feeding discussion.

Facebook showed that the document had been accessed by the account user and the court accepted that as the person who owned the account and the person summonsed were the same that service had occurred.\n\nIn general, it doesn't matter how a document was served so long as there is evidence that it was *received*: email and other forms of electronic messaging may or may not provide such evidence. For example, if an email is part of a conversation then each response provides evidence that the previous email was received \\- the only room for doubt is in the last email in the chain.\n\nAn exception to this is the [postal rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_rule) where something that is mailed is deemed to be received when it is dropped in the mailbox or, for some legislation, \"in the ordinary time for delivery\", usually 1 or 2 days.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A law firm is considering modernizing its communication methods with clients and other attorneys. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the current legal status of electronic communications in the US legal system?\n\nA) Email can be used for all official court communications, including serving summons and subpoenas, as long as read receipts are enabled.\nB) Electronic signatures on emails are universally accepted as legally binding in all jurisdictions for attorney-client communications.\nC) The acceptability of email for legal communications depends on the ability to prove receipt, with exceptions like the postal rule not typically applying to electronic methods.\nD) Fax remains the only legally recognized method for sending documents between attorneys, as email cannot be certified for delivery.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer reflects the nuanced state of electronic communications in the US legal system. While email and other electronic methods are increasingly used, their legal status is not uniform and depends on several factors:\n\n1. The key issue is proving receipt, not just sending. As stated in the documentation, \"it doesn't matter how a document was served so long as there is evidence that it was received.\"\n\n2. Email can provide evidence of receipt, especially in ongoing conversations where responses indicate previous messages were received.\n\n3. Unlike physical mail, which benefits from the \"postal rule\" (deemed received when mailed), email and other electronic communications don't typically have this presumption.\n\n4. The documentation doesn't suggest that email is universally accepted for all court communications or that electronic signatures are universally binding, making options A and B too broad.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect as the documentation implies that fax is not the only method and suggests email can be used in certain circumstances.\n\n6. The correct answer acknowledges the variability in acceptance of electronic communications and focuses on the core issue of proving receipt, which aligns with the information provided in the documentation.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the given information, integration of multiple concepts (legal communication methods, proof of receipt, variations in acceptance), and application to a real-world scenario of a law firm updating its practices."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23275/must-the-state-compensate-individuals-from-whom-property-is-seized-as-evidence", "docs_id": 23275, "title": "Must the State compensate individuals from whom property is seized as evidence?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Pursuant to [the Fourth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment), law enforcement officers routinely obtain warrants under a \"probable cause\" standard to seize items that may contain evidence of a crime.\n\nThis is a taking of private property for public use (i.e., the public interest in prosecuting crimes) and therefore, pursuant to [the Fifth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment), \"just compensation\" should be paid to the owner.\n\nI have come across examples in which police seize items from third parties (e.g., computer or video systems that may have captured evidence of a serious crime by unrelated suspects). As best I can tell, *in practice* so long as police assert that the seized item is potentially useful in their investigation of a crime (which, if serious but unsolved, may never be formally abandoned), they can avoid returning seized property \u2013 even if the ownership is uncontested and the items are not contraband. I.e., even when the owner is *effectively permanently deprived* of their property, I have not found any practical legal mechanism for them to seek compensation. (The only redress I have found is a right to petition for return of property, which is apparently denied so long as police assert the property has value in a criminal investigation or prosecution.)\n\nAre there any particular laws, rules, or procedures that provide for payment of compensation in these cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a good question, which I am going to answer from a practical perspective, rather than a theoretical one, which would probably justify a law review article (applications of the takings clause to criminal justice fact patterns is actually one of my pet areas of legal scholarship, but a lot of it calls for dramatic changes in established practice and precedents reached from other perspectives, making it impractical to pursue in real life). \n\nI recently had a case along these lines in my office where my client's property was seized as evidence in a criminal case against a third\\-party.\n\nThe crime involved a gun shop where all of the guns that were in the possession of the shop owner for repairs at the time of the bust (i.e. as bailments), including ours worth several thousand dollars in addition to having some sentimental value, were seized as evidence of charges against a shop owner who was fencing stolen goods, making sales to felons off the books, falsifying excise tax returns, etc. \n\nHe seemed legitimate and had been in business for many years in what was not a fly by night operation. He had all of the proper licenses. Who knew we were dealing with a crook?\n\nIn that case, we intervened on behalf of our client in the primary case to seek the physical return of the property (basically a replevin claim), as have others affected by the bust. It took a few months and some legal fees, but we prevailed without too much effort, as have the other intervenors.\n\nGenerally speaking, to make a 5th Amendment claim, you would have to show a total taking and move into some legal gray areas in this context, while it is usually hard for authorities to show a continuing need for possession of third\\-party property in the face of a demand for its return, especially when photography and other scientific tools can document the evidence in great detail these days. In that case, showing that our client's particular gun was not involved in any illegitimate transaction also simultaneously made it less important as evidence, although that would not necessarily be true in general in these kinds of situations.\n\nThere is a pending case in Colorado posing similar issues, where a suburban police department essentially destroyed a guy's home in order to catch a felon with no relation to the homeowner whatsoever, who had fled into it and taken refuge there.

Which of the following legal strategies is most likely to succeed in addressing the business owner's concerns while balancing law enforcement needs?\n\nA) File a Fifth Amendment claim for just compensation, arguing that the seizure constitutes a total taking of private property for public use\nB) Petition the court for return of property, offering to provide a forensic copy of the hard drive to law enforcement\nC) Sue the police department for damages under Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure protections\nD) Demand immediate return of the property, citing the expiration of a reasonable time frame for evidence examination\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer, B, is the most pragmatic and legally sound approach based on the information provided.\n\nA) While the Fifth Amendment argument is theoretically interesting, the documentation suggests that such claims are rarely successful in practice for temporary seizures. It would likely be considered too broad an application of the Takings Clause in this context.\n\nB) This option aligns with the practical approach described in the top answer. Petitioning for return of property is identified as a valid legal mechanism. Offering a forensic copy addresses law enforcement's need to preserve potential evidence while mitigating the business owner's hardship. This solution balances the interests of both parties and is likely to be viewed favorably by a court.\n\nC) A Fourth Amendment claim is less likely to succeed because the initial seizure was presumably conducted with a valid warrant based on probable cause. The issue here is the duration of the seizure, not its initial legitimacy.\n\nD) While the owner can demand return of the property, the documentation indicates that such requests are often denied if police assert ongoing investigative value.

First, you are expected to report the injury to the employer within 30 days, and if you do not, your claim may be denied. You have actually done that (they have actual knowledge of the injury so a future petition is not barred by [the 30 day rule](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.185.html)). Then within 7 days they are to report the injury to their insurance company. They acknowledge that employers may refuse to report injuries, and clarify that the employee has a right to report the injury to the insurance company (they offer assistance in doing that). Your medical expenses would be covered. There is also a provision that you can get compensation for lost time.\n\nIt is [against the law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.205.html) for them to fire you for filing a claim or attempting to file a claim (\"No employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee by reason of such employee\u2019s valid claim for compensation or attempt to claim compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law\").\n\nRegardless of the effect on the location's record of reported accidents or the amount of paperwork involved, it is not obviously in the interest of an employee to forgo their rights to compensation. The employee's attorney can advise the employee whether the company's alternative offer is advantageous. If one does not take action (notifying the insurance company for example), eventually they will have waived your rights for compensation.\n\nSupposing that the employee files a report with the insurance company, and the company then fires her in retaliation. This would not involve any unemployment compensation. There is no provision under the law for the state to litigate on her behalf, although the attorney general might file a class action suit if the company is engaged in widespread illegal terminations. So it would fall on the employee to litigate the matter: retaliation for filing a workman's comp claim is one of the recognized grounds for a wrongful termination suit.

Option B is the best course of action because:\n\n1. Florida law requires employers to report injuries to their insurance company within 7 days.\n2. The documentation states that if employers refuse to report injuries, employees have the right to report directly to the insurance company.\n3. This action ensures the employee's rights are protected without immediately escalating to legal action.\n4. It complies with the 30-day reporting requirement mentioned in the documentation.\n5. It allows the employee to potentially receive coverage for medical expenses and lost time compensation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal promises are not legally binding, and the employee would be forfeiting their rights.

It doesn't happen because it's been outlawed.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have the time to traverse Indonesian legislation to determine which laws may or may not apply to banks but not insurance. However, I will say this: generally, the financial services industry, and in particular, deposit\\-taking institutions, are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than many others.

So it's likely that there are laws and regulations that prevent banks, for instance from doing it.\n\nAs for other places... I don't intend to traverse the trillions of contracts made each day.\n\n> Why only in insurance we have this problem?\n\nYou haven't proven this.

If you mean that you don't give your statement at least a cursory overview when you receive it, or monitor your account online regularly to make sure that everything looks okay... well, that's not really a legal issue, but maybe it's something worth considering.\n\n> We don't make sure that there is no 100% acquisition fee on all money we deposit?\n\nI guess not. Maybe you pay bank fees on deposit products, or interest on credit products, or other fees, instead.

Anyone who is not ks\u0323atriya, brahmin, vais\u0301ya or s\u0301udra is avarna (\"outcaste; dalit; untouchable\"). [Article 17](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1987997/) simply asserts that \"Untouchability\" is forbidden, leaving it to ordinary interpretation to figure out what that really means.\n\n[The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989](https://www.cvmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PoA-Act-English.pdf). \"Scheduled Caste\" is invoked in [Art. 341](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/68762/) of the constitution, which simply says\n\n> (1\\) The President may with respect to any State or Union territory,\n> and where it is a State after consultation with the Governor thereof,\n> by public notification, specify the castes, races or tribes or parts\n> of or groups within castes, races or tribes which shall for the\n> purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in\n> relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of\n> Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause ( 1 )\n> any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or\n> tribe, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said\n> clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification\n\nLeaving aside the further definition of those in a Scheduled Caste, the act lists numerous specific actions which are prohibited, the Offenses of Atrocities in Ch II, for example\n\n> (a) puts any inedible or obnoxious substance into the mouth of a\n> member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe or forces such member\n> to drink or eat such inedible or obnoxious substance\n\nYou can summarize this as \"you cannot commit crimes against a member of a Scheduled Caste\".\n\nThe membership question is reduced to lists, for example\n[The Constitution, (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950](https://socialjustice.gov.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/CONSTITUTION%20(SC)%20ORDER%201950%20dated%2010081950.pdf).

During the trial, the defense argues that the official's actions were based on personal dislike, not untouchability. How would the court likely approach this case under the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955?\n\nA) The court must accept the defense's argument if any evidence of personal dislike is presented.\nB) The court will presume untouchability unless the defense conclusively proves otherwise.\nC) The court will dismiss the case if the official can prove any motive other than untouchability.\nD) The court will only consider untouchability if the specific act is listed in the Constitution.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the legal presumption in cases involving Scheduled Castes and the concept of untouchability. The Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 states that when an offense under the Act is committed against a member of a Scheduled Caste, \"the Court shall presume, unless the contrary is proved, that such act was committed on the ground of untouchability.\" This creates a rebuttable presumption in favor of the victim.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mere presentation of evidence of personal dislike is not sufficient to overturn the presumption. The law requires that the contrary (i.e., that the act was not based on untouchability) be proved, not merely suggested.\n\nOption B is correct. The court starts with the presumption of untouchability and requires the defense to prove otherwise. This shifts the burden of proof to the accused in such cases.\n\nOption C is too extreme. The law doesn't require dismissal if any other motive is proven; it requires that the presumption of untouchability be disproven.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the specific acts constituting untouchability are not listed in the Constitution.

The exact details vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n1. The statute of limitations for bringing suit based upon the alleged statement has passed. Many jurisdictions have especially short statutes of limitations for defamation claims. For example, in Colorado, the statute of limitations for a defamation claim is just one year, while other civil claims have two to six year statutes of limitations.\n2. The quoted statement isn't actually what was said.\n3. The statement is not defamatory in nature (i.e. it doesn't tend to harm the Plaintiff's reputation).\n4. The Plaintiff's reputation is so bad that no further statement could harm it.\n5. The court lacks jurisdiction over the claim or the case is filed in the wrong venue.\n6. The statement was substantially true. Note that this is not a defense to all types of claims called defamation in all jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions prohibit certain kinds of inflammatory negative statements (e.g. about religious figures, monarchs, dead people, family members, or disabled people) without regard to their truth, in causes of action that are seen as a subset of defamation actions. For example, Germany's criminal defamation statute prohibits some kinds of speech that would be considered insulting or \"fighting words\", effectively imposing a standing of civility in every day contexts, that applies without regard to truth. U.S. law carefully distinguishes between remedies for fraudulent lies about someone, statements that are objectionable because they implicate privacy concerns, statements that are objectionable because a person has a contractual or particularized legal duty not to say negative things about a particular individual, and statements that are disrespectful and disorderly, but not all jurisdictions draw these careful and fine lines.\n7. In context, the statement could not reasonably have been understood to be true as opposed to puffing, hyperbole, or an opinion.\n8. Failure to prove damages in jurisdictions where this is required on claims where it is required (proof of damages is not required for libel or slander per se in some jurisdictions). Some jurisdictions allow only economic damages, others allow emotional harm damages, others allow punitive damages, some allow statutory damages, and some allow some but not all of these kinds of damages.\n9. The statement is privileged or subject to a qualified privilege (e.g. statements made to law enforcement investigators, by attorneys in litigation, in court documents, by legislators in legislative debate, etc.)\n10. The statement was false but believed in good faith and with a reasonable basis to be true at the time, and at the time of the litigation, the person making the statement acknowledges its inaccuracies or a sense in which a statement meant as true could be misunderstood.\n11. Some jurisdictions make retraction of full defense or a partial defense. Some jurisdictions even make a request for a retraction a condition precedent to bringing a defamation lawsuit in some circumstances.\n12. The person bringing the lawsuit doesn't meet their burden of proof at trial. Usually, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, but truth is sometimes considered an affirmative defense which some jurisdictions place on the defendant to prove. The burden of proof could be quite relevant to the answer.

The correct answer is C because the impact on the plaintiff's reputation is fundamental to a defamation case. \n\nOption A is relevant but not the most crucial factor. While statutes of limitations are important (point 1 in the documentation), they are a procedural issue rather than the core of a defamation claim.\n\nOption B might seem plausible, but lack of specific details doesn't necessarily negate a defamation claim if the statement is still harmful and false. The documentation doesn't suggest that providing specifics is required to win a case.\n\nOption C is correct because it relates to the essential nature of defamation: harm to reputation.

United States: Under US law, this scenario likely falls under \"work made for hire\" doctrine. Even without an explicit agreement, if the work was specially commissioned and falls into one of the categories listed in 17 USC 101 (which could include software as a \"compilation\" or \"collective work\"), the company could be considered the author and copyright owner.\n\n2. Germany: German law strongly favors individual creators. The \"principle of non-transferability\" means that the programmers would retain authorship and significant rights. The company could only obtain a license, not full ownership or authorship status.\n\n3. United Kingdom: UK law doesn't have a broad \"work for hire\" doctrine like the US. While it recognizes corporate authorship in some cases (e.g., for publishers), software development by freelancers wouldn't typically fall under these exceptions.\n\n4. \"All of the above equally\" is incorrect because the laws differ significantly.\n\nThe US provides the strongest case for corporate authorship in this scenario, making A the correct answer.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The impersonation of an ASC agent doesn't fall under identity theft (Section 402.2) as it doesn't involve using another person's specific identity information.\n\n2.

If a platform violates these guidelines, then they are open to litigation, which they have previously been protected from. Here is a link to a draft of the order: [https://kateklonick.com/wp\\-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT\\-EO\\-Preventing\\-Online\\-Censorship.pdf](https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf)\n\nSome questions I have...\n\n* Is my summary an accurate description?\n* A common part of the debate has been \"free speech\", which isn't relevant to a private company. However, are there other times the FCC has set guidelines that effectively influence free speech?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Addressing only the document that you link to without assumption of accuracy or finality, it says that \"It is the policy of the United States to foster clear, nondiscriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the Internet. Prominent among those rules is the immunity from liability\", referring to [47 USC 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230), and specifically \"the scope of that immunity should be clarified\". It is clear that the law say nothing about what counts as \"good faith\", nor does it say anything about what constitutes \"otherwise objectionable\". The document correctly say that the law \"does not extend to deceptive or pretextual actions restricting online content\", at leas as long as we understand \"extend to\" as meaning \"explicitly mention\". Similarly, the law does not explicitly say anything about whether a provider violating its own TOS nullifies the \"good faith restriction\" clause.\n\nThe order then directs the Dept. of Commerce to petition the **FCC** for regulations clarifying the interpretation of this law (I assume you meant FCC and not FTC). It specifically proposes explicitly interpreting \"taken in good faith\" to exclude actions that are deceptive, pretextual or inconsistent with a provider's TOS, or \"the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or having been undertaking \\[sic] without a meaningful opportunity to be heard\".\n\nEverybody is presently open to litigation for defamation (for example), because you can allege that pretextual or \"unreasonable\" restrictions on speech *are* in bad faith, then the courts have to evaluate that question. What the regulations would do is provide a default answer (\"yes, it is\"), which the courts would follow unless the regulation is overturned in court or is rescinded. \n\nThere are vast numbers of restrictions on free speech by the FCC: the whole purpose of the FCC is to restrict the freedom to speak as one may please. The initial premise was that the government didn't want broadcaster A to functionally obliterate broadcaster B due to the strength of his signal on a particular frequency, so you are not free to speak in certain ways. There are numerous other restrictions on what you may say within the sphere regulated by the FCC, e.g. you can't broadcast live sex acts on network TV during Saturday morning cartoon time. The [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) and the [equal time rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule) are / were other examples of restrictions on free speech (via compelled speech). \"Free speech\" is an open\\-enough concept that it is reasonable to consider anything with a governmentally\\-mandated \"non\\-level playing field\" to be a restriction on free speech (for example, statutory immunizations of a certain class of individuals against legal consequences of their acts). The problem with saying what acts of the FCC \"restrict free speech\" is that there isn't a clear definition of \"free speech\" that is consistent with laws against threatening, fraud, perjury and defamation.\n\nAs for the accuracy of your summary, there are also provisions regarding [deceptive practices](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45). There is more to it than you summarized (obviously: that's what a summary is), but apart from misspelling FCC I'd say that the summary is brief and not as informative (or verbose) as the original, but it is not deceptive. If you want a well\\-intentioned criticism, I think it is important to be specific about the fact that there is been some statutory immunization against liability which is the core of the order, but you didn't clarify that point. Governments litigate against companies (mostly) all the time, but governments do not litigate against companies or individuals for defamation or violating a TOS, and nothing in the order suggests that the government could start to sue social media companies for defamation or breach of contract, that is, the scope of the potential litigation is limited in an important way.

It is the mother's house and the adult child has been trying to help the mother. Then one day the two get into a heated verbal argument and the mother tells the adult child to move out?\n\nDoes the adult child have to move out that night? If the adult child does move out, can be charged with elder abuse for leaving the mother alone when the adult child believes it is not safe for the mother to live alone. Part of the problem with the mother living alone is that she would need to get to the food store and her driving skills have detoriated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, a landlord cannot just expel a tenant, this involved getting a court order where the judge tells the tenant to leave. Second, she might think that \"You're not a tenant, you're just living here\" but that is pretty much what it means to be a tenant \u2013 she agreed to let the relative live there. There does not have to be a detailed lease written up, though the term of such unwritten agreements is usually month\\-to\\-month (this is all about the laws of the particular state, but no state authorizes instant expulsion).\n\nYou would need to look at the laws of your state for the \"abuse\" question. Using Washington as [an example](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=74.34), and trying to make the best case possible that bailing out is against the law, the potential legal concern is \"abandonment\", which is defined as an\n\n> action or inaction by a person or entity with a duty of care for a\n> vulnerable adult that leaves the vulnerable person without the means\n> or ability to obtain necessary food, clothing, shelter, or health\n> care.\n\nthe failure of a vulnerable adult, not living in a facility, to provide for himself or herself the goods and services necessary for the vulnerable adult's physical or mental health, and the absence of which impairs or threatens the vulnerable adult's well\\-being. This definition may include a vulnerable adult who is receiving services through home health, hospice, or a home care agency, or an individual provider when the neglect is not a result of inaction by that agency or individual provider.\n\nRCW 74\\.34\\.200 creates a legal cause of action for abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult.

The courts do not declare that a duty of care exists because of a genetic relationship. A duty of care might be found from a contractual relation (one not involving a state social services agency), for example \"You can live here if you take care of me\".

After a heated argument, the mother demands the child move out immediately. The child is concerned about leaving the mother alone due to her deteriorating driving skills and inability to safely get groceries. Which of the following best describes the legal and ethical implications of this situation?\n\nA) The child must leave immediately to avoid trespassing charges, but cannot be held liable for elder abuse.\nB) The child has tenant rights and cannot be evicted without proper legal process, but may be at risk of elder abuse charges if they leave abruptly.\nC) The child has no legal right to stay and must leave, but should arrange for a home care agency to avoid abandonment charges.\nD) The child can stay indefinitely due to their caregiver status, regardless of the mother's wishes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal and ethical concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer, B, integrates several key points:\n\n1. Tenant rights: The documentation clearly states that even without a formal lease, the child is considered a tenant and cannot be instantly evicted. A court order would be required for eviction, typically involving a month-to-month agreement.\n\n2. Potential for elder abuse charges: While the documentation doesn't explicitly state the child would be charged with elder abuse, it does discuss the concept of \"abandonment\" under elder abuse laws. The child's concern about the mother's safety if left alone indicates a potential duty of care, which could lead to legal implications if abruptly abandoned.\n\n3. Complexity of the situation: The answer acknowledges both the legal right to stay and the potential risk of leaving, reflecting the nuanced nature of the scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores tenant rights and oversimplifies the potential for elder abuse charges. Option C incorrectly assumes the child has no right to stay and oversimplifies the solution. Option D overstates the child's rights to stay indefinitely.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, and consider multiple facets of elder care and tenancy law simultaneously."}, "83": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85198/can-an-employer-make-employment-decisions-based-on-who-you-live-with", "docs_id": 85198, "title": "Can an employer make employment decisions based on who you live with?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by [a question on Workplace Stack Exchange](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/187789/137034) in which an employee of a German research institute was told by their boss's secretary:\n\n> Hey, we pay you one of the top salaries in our research group, but you live in a shared apartment in a remote district. It's obvious that if you spend 3\\-4 hours a day commuting and share a flat with a bunch of people, your performance at work is bound to be suboptimal, even though we have no specific complaints about your performance. Your work is critically important to our group, so we want to get the most from you and expect you to rent a comfortable apartment solely for yourself and close to work. That's why we pay you that much and your salary is supposed to cover this.\n\nThere are some other details in the secretary's message regarding dress code and eating together with colleagues, but for this question I want to focus only on the matter of how far away the employee lives and whether they live with other people or alone.\n\nGiven that there are admittedly no issues with the employee's performance, would it be legal for the employer to decline to renew the employee's fixed term contract solely because their commute is long and they live in a shared flat? Suppose for the sake of this question that the employer would definitely renew the contract if the employee acceded to the demand that they move closer and live alone, and the employer's demand is not related to the nature of the work (e.g. the employee is not required to get to the office quickly in case of emergency, and they do not take home sensitive information which would need to be kept from others in their household). If it would change the answer, assume that these demands would not be written into a renewal contract, rather they only form the basis of whether the employer chooses to offer a renewal.\n\nThe original question regards a German employer, and probably in the public sector, but information about other jurisdictions may be interesting too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Restatement of facts\n\n* Employee Kaya3 has been working for 22 months with employer E under a 2\u2011year fixed term employment contract.\n* E has informally hinted they would like to extend/renew the contract with Kaya3\\.\n* Yet there is no employment contract about the subsequent period yet.\n* E cites Kaya3\u2019s distant place of residence and living conditions (a shared apartment) as the reasons for not concluding an employment contract.\nE fears Kaya3\u2019s performance would suffer under these circumstances.\n* Kaya3 comes from a developing country and likes to save as much earnings as possible, i.\u202fe. prefers cheaper accommodation.\n* There is no public or internal job posting concerning the subsequent period.\n\n### ~~Opinion~~ Thoughts\n\n1. **Contractual obligations**  \n\nThere *is no contract* obligating the parties to conclude an employment contract.\nThere is also no legal obligation to conclude a contract.\nThis is an expression of freedom of contract.\nThere *are* restrictions:\nFor instance, the [Universal Equal Treatment Act](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_agg/index.html) (AGG) forbids discrimination based on grounds of sex, ethnicity, age, among others.\nYet violation of none the restrictions bear the consequence that a contract is concluded, as emphasized for instance in \u00a7\u00a015\u00a0\u2165\u00a0AGG.\n2. **Quasi\\-contractual obligations**  \n\nInstead German labor law is completely focused on damages.\n\n\t1. *culpa in contrahendo*  \n\n\tBy starting business relations you are already entering a semi\\-contractual relationship, \u00a7\u00a0311\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tHere E and Kaya3 started talking about a future employment (\\=\u00a0*start* of business relationship possibly culminating in conclusion of a contract).\n\tThis \u201ccontract\u201d imposes the duty to take account of each other\u2019s interest, \u00a7\u00a0241\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tThat means e.\u202fg. gaslighting someone, say, *pretending* you *would* like to conclude a contract even though there has never been such intent, is forbidden, because it is not in good faith, \u00a7\u00a0242\u00a0BGB.\n\tBreaching this duty could lead to a claim in damages, \u00a7\u00a0280\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0BGB.\n\tHowever, in the present case there is not enough evidence that E was trying to \u201churt\u201d Kaya3\\.\n\tQuite the contrary, it is in the *fixed\\-term* contract\u2019s nature to fulfill a *temporary* need.\n\tFurthermore, since Kaya3 still has 2 months to work, there is still time to conclude a follow\\-up contract.\n\tA damage\u00a0\u2013 here lack of income\u00a0\u2013 has not even occurred yet.\n\t2. unequal treatment *c.\u202fi.\u202fc.*  \n\n\tE\u2019s decisions to not (yet) hire Kaya3 could be *veiled* racial discrimination or xenophobia, illegal considerations as per \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07\u00a0\u2160,\u00a06\u202f\u2160\u202f2,\u00a01\u202fAlt.\u202f1\u202f\\+\u202f2\u00a0AGG.\n\tE says he was afraid of Kaya3\u2019s work performance suffering when in fact he does not want to hire foreigners (here characterized by the circumstance that Kaya3 in fact prefers his current living situation which is quite normal in his country of origin).\n\tOn the one hand E having already hired Kaya3 once indicates he does not discriminate based on such criteria.\n\tOn the other hand it is possible that there was a change in HR\u2019s personnel so a different recruiter (for which E is responsible) is in charge now.\n\tOn the one hand Kaya3\u2019s performance on the job never gave rise to consider firing him.\n\tOn the other hand the fixed\\-term contract fulfilled a temporary need, thus a subsequent open\\-ended contract could have legitimately higher standards.\n\n\tAnswering this will require complete details, but this kind of question is in fact very frequent in practice:\n\tIs it still a *legitimate reason* or already *indirect discrimination*?\n3. **Tort obligations**  \n\nThe regulations of the Universal Equal Treatment Act (AGG) could be considered guard statutes for \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0823\u00a0\u2160,\u00a0\u2161\u00a01\u00a0BGB, yet the AGG is *lex specialis* to the general provisions of the BGB.\nIn general, damages are those legal rights the damaged party would have without the damaging event, \u00a7\u00a0249\u00a0\u2160\u00a0BGB.\nThus you could say, \u201crefusing to contract\u201d was the damaging event; if we omit the \u201cdamaging event\u201d there would have been an employment contract.\nHowever, as \u00a7 15 \u2165 AGG emphasizes, conclusion of a contract cannot be damages.\nThis is again a consequence of the freedom of contract which is an expression of the universal personal rights enshrined in the Basic Law, Art.\u00a02\u00a0\u2160 in conjunction with\u00a0Art.\u00a01\u00a0\u2160\u00a0GG (partially applicable to a company, Art.\u00a019\u00a0\u2162\u00a0GG, even though a company doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpersonality\u201d).\n4. **Conclusion**  \n\nKaya3 is not entitled to get an employment contract, nor does he have a claim for damages.\n\n### Answer\n\nJust to answer your question:\nYes, generally speaking an employer is allowed to discriminate based on where and how someone lives.\nAn employment contract, \u00a7\u00a0611\u00a0BGB, has to be fulfilled in person.\nYou cannot, say, send *your brother* to do the work which *you* are supposed to do (the employer will rightfully reject such performance).\nThus the employer can have arbitrary standards when filling a vacancy, even criteria that do not seem related to the job.\nThere are just the criteria like religion, beliefs, sex, ethnicity, and so on, which may not be taken into consideration.\nSo, even though an employer\u2019s question like \u201cHave you visited a mosque before?\u201d is neutral in nature, it creates exposure to litigation (potential indirect discrimination again).\n\nIt is also perfectly legal not to hire somebody, simply because they have already worked for the same employer (or predecessor) under a fixed\\-term contract and thus *the next* employment contract (if any) *must* be an open\\-ended contract (unless there is a good reason) \\[simplified summary of the TzBfG].\nThis practice has been repeatedly criticized by (left\\-leaning) labor unions and other parties.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Social insurance:\nAlways inform the employment agency (3 months ahead) about looming unemployment even if the current employer says \u201cwe\u2019ll extend your contract\u201d.\nOtherwise you run the risk of a period of disqualification (*Sperrzeit*, \u00a7\u00a0159\u00a0\u2160\u00a02\u00a0No.\u00a09\u00a0SGB\u00a0\u2162), because the employer might change his mind until you have concluded a contract.\n* Switching employers:\nNever terminate an open\\-end employment contract until you *have signed* the contract with the new employer.\nOtherwise, the new employer might retract his (informal) offer and then you\u2019re out of work completely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An employee of a German research institute is told by their boss's secretary that their long commute and shared living arrangement are potentially affecting their work performance, despite no specific complaints.

This is not a protected characteristic under the Universal Equal Treatment Act (AGG). The documentation explicitly states, \"Yes, generally speaking an employer is allowed to discriminate based on where and how someone lives.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because living situation is not a protected characteristic under German labor law. The AGG only prohibits discrimination based on specific grounds like sex, ethnicity, and age, among others.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while culpa in contrahendo does create some obligations in pre-contractual negotiations, the documentation states that \"there is not enough evidence that E was trying to 'hurt' Kaya3\" and that damage (lack of income) has not even occurred yet. Additionally, it's in the nature of fixed-term contracts to fulfill temporary needs.\n\nOption D is incorrect on two counts. First, the suggestion alone doesn't necessarily constitute indirect discrimination, especially given the employer's stated concerns about work performance. Second, even if discrimination were proven, the documentation explicitly states that \"conclusion of a contract cannot be damages\" (\u00a7 15 VI AGG), meaning the employee wouldn't automatically be entitled to contract renewal.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding of German labor law, the Universal Equal Treatment Act, and the nature of fixed-term contracts.

The company pays the consultant via PayPal using a credit card, allowing the consultant to keep a small fee for their services. After several months, the company initiates a chargeback for all transactions, leaving the consultant with a large negative PayPal balance. Which of the following legal perspectives best describes the consultant's situation?\n\nA) The consultant is likely guilty of credit card fraud due to the large number of transactions and keeping a fee.\nB) The consultant may be held liable for civil damages but is unlikely to face criminal charges for fraud.\nC) The company's actions constitute fraud, and the consultant should file a police report for theft.\nD) The consultant has no legal recourse due to the lack of a written contract and immediate withdrawal of funds from PayPal.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal considerations. The consultant is unlikely to be guilty of credit card fraud (option A) because they did not directly use or access the company's credit card without permission. The company willingly provided the funds via PayPal.\n\nOption C, while partially correct in identifying the company's potentially fraudulent actions, overstates the consultant's position. Filing a police report may be premature without further evidence of intent to defraud.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the lack of a written contract doesn't negate all legal protections, and withdrawing funds from PayPal is not inherently problematic.\n\nOption B is the most accurate. The consultant's actions, based on the information provided, don't appear to meet the threshold for criminal fraud charges. However, they may face civil liability for the negative PayPal balance. The situation is primarily a civil matter between the consultant, the company, and potentially PayPal.\n\nThis answer acknowledges the complexity of the situation, the unlikely criminal aspect for the consultant, but also the potential civil ramifications.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Indonesian contract law, like many jurisdictions, recognizes the principle of freedom of contract, but also considers fairness and good faith.\n\n2. The court would likely not strictly enforce the contract (option A) due to the obfuscated terms, which goes against principles of transparency and good faith in contracting.\n\n3.

The most I can own is up to the high tide mark. However, if the sea level rises then the amount of land I own would also decrease, in which case do I get compensation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") and [scotland](/questions/tagged/scotland \"show questions tagged 'scotland'\"), no.\n\nAt common law, with a hefty influence from Roman writers such as [Gaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_(jurist)) who tackled the topic, gradual changes in a natural boundary are distinguished from others. This is usually encountered in the case of a river, whose course may change slightly from year to year. New deposits are laid down and other parts are eroded, generally imperceptibly. These processes are called *alluvion* and *diluvion*, and distinguished from *avulsion* where a chunk of identifiable land is washed downriver. Deliberately\\-induced changes are also different.\n\nFor those slow and natural changes, the position is that where ownership of the land is defined with reference to the natural boundary, the extent of ownership also changes when the boundary moves. This is a sensible rule in the absence of modern surveying methods, and generally matches what people expect \\- I own the land on the south bank, you own it on the north, and it doesn't make sense for me to gain a sliver of land on the other side if the river should happen to meander a bit. It is possible to override that assumption by agreement between the landowners (or else litigate it) but that is the starting point.\n\nThe sea works in the same way, except that the \"landowner\" on the other side is the Crown. (Quotation marks because it is not the same kind of ownership that ordinary people exercise.) The intermediate area, the foreshore, has its own rules, so in fact there are multiple boundaries to think about \\- the mean high water mark, the mean low water mark \\- but it's the same idea. The foreshore might be owned by the Crown, as the sea is, but maybe by somebody else. Perhaps what was my land is now underwater at high tide, but exposed at low tide; and some other bit of land used to be foreshore and now is totally submerged.\n\nEveryday tidal changes do not affect ownership, nor do unusually large tides either way. But if I own land next to the sea, I may gain some land, or lose it, by natural action. Gradually rising sea levels move the tide lines and the property rights follow. Some riverbeds are also owned by the Crown, so the same principle is at work there too for the motion of Crown boundaries.\n\nThe rationale for *why* the Crown owns these places is not clear: there are several possible explanations to do with it being for the common good, or alternatively just an old feudal rule. That might affect adjudication of rights in some cases, such as for access to the \"new foreshore\" for particular activities: see [*R (Newhaven Port and Properties Ltd) v East Sussex CC* \\[2015] UKSC 7](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html) for an investigation of the public right to swim on an English beach. Even in the case of Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, ownership does not extend to the sea beyond the low\\-tide mark, since the Crown has sovereign rights (*Shetland Salmon Farmers Association v Crown Estate Commissioners* 1991 SLT 166\\).\n\nIn land registration, a boundary marked on a cadastral map is not taken as authoritative when the underlying geographical feature moves. That's in the [Land Registration Act 2002, section 61(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/61) for England and Wales, and the [Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2002, sections 66](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/66) and [73(2\\)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/73) in Scotland. Courts have inferred that a boundary coinciding with such a feature is \"meant\" to be this way, even if it wasn't defined like that in words \\- see for example [*Southern Centre of Theosophy Incorporated v The State of South Australia (Australia)* \\[1981] UKPC 41](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_41.html) in the Privy Council.

Due to gradual sea level rise over 20 years, a significant portion of the original property is now permanently submerged. The owner wants to reclaim this land by building a sea wall. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and the owner's rights?\n\nA) The owner retains ownership of the submerged land and can build a sea wall to reclaim it without permission\nB) The submerged land now belongs to the Crown, but the owner can petition for compensation for the lost property\nC) The owner's property line has shifted with the rising sea level, and they have no right to the submerged area or to build a sea wall\nD) The owner must seek permission from the Crown to build a sea wall, but retains ownership of the submerged land\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C, based on several key points:\n\n1. The documentation states that for gradual changes in natural boundaries (including rising sea levels), \"the extent of ownership also changes when the boundary moves.\"\n2. It's specified that this applies to sea boundaries, where \"the Crown\" is effectively the landowner on the other side.\n3. The question mentions this occurred over 20 years, indicating a gradual change, not a sudden avulsion.\n4. The document notes that \"Gradually rising sea levels move the tide lines and the property rights follow.\"\n5. There's no mention of compensation for such natural changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the owner no longer owns the submerged land and doesn't have the right to build on it. Option B is wrong because there's no provision for compensation for gradual natural changes. Option D is incorrect because the owner no longer retains ownership of the submerged land.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple concepts and application to a specific scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy.

The correct answer is A because it captures a key advantage of pursuing action under the main contract rather than the duty of care deed.\n\nThe documentation states that \"the rights contained in the contract were more extensive than those to be found in the duty of care deed: the contract contained a number of strict obligations.\" This indicates that the main contract provided for strict liability, which is generally more favorable to the plaintiff than the standard of reasonable care and skill found in the duty of care deed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation actually highlights that Panatown's lack of direct financial loss was a potential weakness in their case, stating \"the most obvious difficulty with the first route lay in demonstrating that Panatown had suffered a loss.\"\n\nOption C, while true, is not the best answer. The lack of an arbitration clause in the duty of care deed is mentioned as a disadvantage of that route, but it's not the primary reason for choosing the main contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, despite UIPL being the property owner, the group still chose to have Panatown bring the proceedings.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply critical thinking to a complex legal scenario, and understand the strategic considerations in choosing between different legal options.

Option B is the strongest support for the company's claim because it directly addresses the core issue of proving user agreement to the TOS.\n\nThe expert programmer's testimony that it's impossible to access the premium feature without accepting the TOS provides the most compelling evidence.

[This item](https://www.aclu.org/other/joint-statement-current-law-religion-public-schools) by the ACLU summarizes what that law is. Regarding your concern, public schools are not required to be \"religion\\-free zones\". Individuals have the right to hold and express their religious beliefs, or their lack of such beliefs, as long as it is contextually appropriate.

Students are allowed to try to persuade others to believe whatever they want, and students are allowed to be snarky about people who don't share their beliefs. Schools can teach about religion as part of the curriculum, though they cannot teach religion.
