They summon the Commons to attend the speech and lead them to the Lords. As part of the ritual, the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons are slammed in the approaching Black Rod's face. This is to symbolise the Commons' independence of the Sovereign. Black Rod then strikes the door three times with the staff, and is then admitted and issues the summons of the monarch to attend.\n\nSocieties are not run by laws \\- they are run by convention and custom.\n\n> Take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy. and yet... and yet you act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some... some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.\n> \n> \n> Terry Pratchett, Hogfather\n\nThe purpose of Royal Assent is to preserve the convention and custom that the United Kingdom is ruled by a King to avoid dealing with the reality that it's ruled by the people just like you and me which is and should be a truly terrifying thought. This is not a dig at politicians, judges, and civil servants: it applies equally to your doctor, the engineer who designed your house and the plumber who fitted your toilet.\n\nWhat would happen if it was refused?\n------------------------------------\n\nWell, a [constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis) would happen.

However, it's a *crisis* primarily because no one knows how it will be resolved in advance.\n\nThis particular crisis is unlikely to arise:\n\n* the last time it happened was in 1708 by Queen Anne who was acting on the advice of her ministers (who were answerable to Parliament for their actions).\n* the last time it happened against the wishes of the government was in 1696 by William III.\n* the last time a monarch considered it was in 1914 by George V who decided it should not be done without \"convincing evidence that it would avert a national disaster, or at least have a tranquillising effect on the distracting conditions of the time\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of maintaining the tradition of Royal Assent in modern parliamentary systems?\n\nA) To give the monarch actual veto power over legislation\nB) To preserve the convention and custom of monarchical rule\nC) To allow the parliament to challenge the monarch's authority\nD) To slow down the legislative process\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. The primary purpose of maintaining Royal Assent in modern parliamentary systems is to preserve the convention and custom that the country is ruled by a monarch, even though the reality is that it's governed by elected representatives. This ritual helps maintain societal traditions and customs, which are crucial in how societies function beyond just laws.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because in practice, modern monarchs do not use Royal Assent to veto legislation, with the last refusal in the UK occurring in 1708.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the purpose is not to challenge the monarch's authority, but rather to symbolically reinforce it.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Royal Assent may add a step to the legislative process, its primary purpose is not to slow down legislation but to maintain tradition.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the symbolic importance of constitutional monarchies and the role of tradition in governance."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18377/can-i-face-swap-for-a-video-i-shot-where-an-individual-doesnt-consent-to-using", "docs_id": 18377, "title": "Can I face swap for a video I shot where an individual doesn&#39;t consent to using their likeness?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say I'm shooting some video of an interview, and one of the people in frame claim that they do not consent to the use of their likeness in any film or derivative (or some similar phrasing).

Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age). Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor. Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.\n\nThat page cites:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\\- Sexual Exploitation of Children (Production of child pornography)\n* 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251A\\- Selling and Buying of Children\n* 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\\- Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors (Possession, distribution and receipt of child pornography)\n* 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A\\- certain activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography\n* 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\\- Definitions\n* 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260\\- Production of sexually explicit depictions of a minor for importation into the United States\n\nThe [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography_laws_in_the_United_States#Simulated_pornography) mentions that:\n\n> Simulated child pornography was made illegal with the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA). The CPPA was short\\-lived. In 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States in [*Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition) held that the relevant portions of the CPPA were unconstitutional because they prevented lawful speech. Referring to Ferber, the court stated that \"the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not 'intrinsically related' to the sexual abuse of children\".\n\nThe opinion in *Ashcroft* included the statement that:\n\n> Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value. This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See *Book Named \"John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v. Attorney General of Mass*., 383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966\\)\n\nUnder [*Ginsberg v. New York*, 390 U. S. 629 (1968\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/390/629/), it may be a crime for an adult to provide \"inappropriate\" sexual content to a child, even if the content is not legally obscene, but this does not apply when both parties to a communication are minors.\n\nText, written words, may be unlawful to distribute if and only if it passes the [Miller\\* test](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/413/15/), making it legally obscene. The wording of the test is:\n\n> The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, *Roth*, supra, at 354 U. S. 489, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

In the alternative, F argues that if found liable, he is only liable for part of the losses claimed by A and B, due to contributory negligence by V.\n\nIs there clear precedent in case law that backs either of their positions?\n\nOr, put another way, is there case law precedent for a deceiver being liable for loss due to a *subsequent problem*, on the legal ground that \"but for the deceit the claimant would never have put themselves in a position where they would have been exposed to the risk of that *subsequent problem*, in the first place\"?\n\n*NOTE: Assume for this question that UK law applies, and all criteria for the claims are met: the fact of any deceit or negligence is blatant and uncontested, the fact of reliance or mitigation is uncontested, and so on. So the question is only about how the subsequent matter affects F's liability.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The underlying assumption in this question seems to be that because A received defective professional advice from V, F may be free of blame. I believe that assumption is wrong.\n\nThe gist of the question is this:\n\n> Suppose a fraudster's deception causes a person to take a course of action they wouldn't have otherwise taken. As part of that, they suffer losses due to a second person's tort. Is that loss recoverable from the fraudster as well?\n\nIn the scenario given, there are clearly two parties that are to blame for the loss:\n\n1. The fraudster, who perpetrated the fraud.\n2. The professional attorney, who gave defective advice.\n\nThe fact that there also exists a second party that may have *contributed* to the loss does not in any way *absolve* the first party from blame or from being liable for his actions.\n\nIn a tort case, it is always the person that caused the loss in the *first place* (the tortfeasor) the victim (A) should seek relief from first. So F is in *no way* \u201csafe from litigaton\u201d.\n\nIn the event that the tortfeasor is not being able make full restitution (e.g. he is already bankrupt), A may sue V for professional negligence to recover his loss. However, to prevail, A vould must be able to prove that V has made critical errors that no \u201creasonable attorney\u201d would have made. That is sometimes pretty hard to prove (it obviously depends on how clever F's deception was, and whether the number of hours A allowed V to use for due diligence should have been sufficient to uncover the deception).\n\nAs for legal precedent, I am not aware of a *single* case where a fraudster has *not* been held liable because the victim of the fraud has sought professional advice (but it is of course not easy to locate precedent for something has *not* occured).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case of fraud where the victim (A) relied on negligent professional advice from a valuer (V) before purchasing an asset from a fraudster (F), which of the following statements is most accurate regarding F's liability?\n\nA) F is not liable for any damages because V's negligence was the ultimate cause of A's loss.\n\nB) F is only liable for a portion of the damages, with V being responsible for the rest due to contributory negligence.\n\nC) F is fully liable for all of A's losses, including any expenses incurred in potentially suing V, because but for F's fraud, A would not have been in a position to rely on V's advice.\n\nD) F is only liable for the difference between the asset's actual value and the fraudulently represented value, with V being solely responsible for any additional losses.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In cases of fraud, the fraudster (F) is typically held liable for all losses resulting from their fraudulent actions, even if those losses were exacerbated by a third party's negligence (in this case, V's). The principle is that but for F's initial fraud, A would not have been in a position to suffer any losses, including those related to V's negligent advice. This aligns with the legal concept that a fraudster is liable for all losses due to their fraud, whether or not those losses were reasonably foreseeable. Options A and B incorrectly limit F's liability, while option D improperly divides liability between F and V in a way that doesn't reflect the primacy of F's fraudulent actions in causing A's losses."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90923/if-we-use-a-generative-ai-to-generate-original-images-can-we-use-these-images-i", "docs_id": 90923, "title": "If we use a generative AI to generate original images, can we use these images in a product that we sell?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Generative AI can create images.

I recently found out, since it is not my native language, that it wasn't just a warning \\- it was actually a ticket.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exact situation depends on where you are. If you are in Washington state, what you get (but did not realize) is a [notice to appear in court](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.64.015). By not paying the fine or showing up to court, you could be subject to [RCW 46\\.64\\.025](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=46.64.025), so that the department of licensing is notified. You have [15 days to respond](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.63.070) to the notice. We assume that you are a resident, because [if you are a non\\-resident](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.64.035) (and not resident of another state with a reciprocal agreement), they would have required you to pay a bond at the time of the ticket (though that isn't possible with automated infraction\\-detection).\n\nWhen the Dept. of Licensing gets the notice of the unpaid ticket, they may suspend or revoke your license. At this point, you will have received notice that your license was suspended (unless you changed your address and mail isn't forwarded, in which case you have a different problem, that you're supposed to apprise DOL of your current address, and didn't do so). At that point (after they send the letter), you have 15 days to respond. One response is to pay the ticket plus the added fines, or, you can request an administrative review (to appeal the suspension).\n\nThe point of going to court to plead your case would presumably be to modify the judgment against you, for instance to reduce or eliminate the added fine. You would then need to give a good reason for not being punished: RCW 46\\.64\\.025 already has you covered, because the suspension process starts with *willfully* failing to appear. You would then need to show that your failure to appear was not willful.\n\nIt does not legally matter whether you are a foreigner or have problems understanding the language. Speeding tickets usually say pretty clearly that you must pay the ticket within a specified time frame, or appear in court, but people don't always read tickets. It is entirely plausible that one's grasp of the language is low enough that there really was a misunderstanding. If you can provide credible evidence that your failure was not willful, by law you would only be liable for the ticket.\n\nIn other states and countries, the situation could be somewhat or quite different (e.g. Norwegian traffic laws are stricter). In New Mexico, it is more serious to fail to appear. NM Statute [66\\-8\\-126](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-8/part-2/section-66-8-126/) states that \"It is a misdemeanor for any person to violate his written promise to appear in court, given to an officer upon issuance of a uniform traffic citation, regardless of the disposition of the charge for which the citation was issued\". Your license can/will be suspended (it is not clear whether suspension is automatic), but additionally since failure to appear is a misdemeanor, you can be arrested. Unlike Washington law, there is no willfullness requirement for such a penalty. Given the criminal nature of failure to appear, a traffic attorney would need to suggest an appropriate belated response.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A foreign driver in Washington state receives a speeding ticket but misunderstands it as a warning due to language barriers.

What is the most accurate sequence of events that could follow?\n\nA) The driver is immediately arrested for a misdemeanor and their license is automatically suspended.\n\nB) The Department of Licensing is notified, the driver's license may be suspended, and they have 15 days to respond after receiving a suspension notice.\n\nC) The driver is required to pay a bond, and if they don't, they are barred from entering the United States in the future.\n\nD) The ticket is automatically dismissed due to the language barrier, and the driver faces no consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Washington state law, when a driver fails to respond to a ticket within 15 days, the Department of Licensing is notified. They may then suspend the driver's license. After sending a suspension notice, the driver has another 15 days to respond, either by paying the ticket plus added fines or requesting an administrative review.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it describes a more severe process more akin to New Mexico law. In Washington, failure to appear is not automatically a misdemeanor, and arrest is not the immediate consequence.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because bonds are typically required for non-residents at the time of the ticket, not after failing to respond. Additionally, there's no mention of being barred from entering the U.S. in the given information.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because language barriers do not automatically dismiss tickets in Washington state.

If you feel that information displayed on LocateFamily.com is private in nature and you would like said information removed from view, please complete and submit the form on our removal page...\"\n\nthat means they process Data anyhow and then if people request to opt\\-out they will then consider erasure; GDPR requires a Lawful Base for processing Personal Data and they do it without having a documented one.\n\nIf you used to live in the EU and you now live in the U.S., GDPR only applies to them if they are an EU established company, if they are not established in the EU and you are not an EU resident, then GDPR does not apply.\n\nNote that it is not a matter of \"citizenship\" yet one of \"residency\", unless you reside in the EU and you are temporarily in the U.S.\n\nThe other thing that is \"troubling me\" is when you mention:\n\n\"... certain details that were used on a European domain register in 2014\\...\"\n\nthis points in a direction (for now just speculation) that this company may have (somehow) incorporated 3rd party DataBase content (containing Personal Data) without (potentially) thousands of people, not having been informed.\n\nWhat can you do (under GDPR that is):\n\n1st \\- If the company is established in the EU, submit a Data Subject Access Request; if not get someone you know who resides in the EU to do it (as themselves).\n2nd if the answer does not arrive within 1 month or it is not according to GDPR requirements, present a complaint towards the Supervisory Authority (of the European country the person resides in) and further submit a formal complaint towards the Company.\n\nThese matters will only start to move once people start presenting formal complaints.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An EU citizen who now resides in the United States discovers their personal information on locatefamily.com, which they believe originated from a European domain register in 2014.

The\n> Government may continue to review and use the materials seized for\n> purposes of intelligence classification and national security\n> assessments.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence is allowed to continue the classification review and intelligence assessment, which does not involve the FBI.\n\nTherefore, the FBI and the Department of Justice cannot review, read, or look at said documents, whether as original documents, paper copies, or scanned images. The order does not address mental states, it only addresses actions, so there is no requirement to \"pretend\" anything. For the moment, the government cannot make use of the documents. It could be pointless to violate the court's order, except another judge could make a contrary ruling, so if it turns out that Cannon's order was a major legal error, there might not be any negative consequences to disobedience.\n\nIf the DoJ obeys the order, there is nothing that prevents \"Trump's team\" from making accusations. The fine line that they would have to navigate is \"defamation\" \u2013 if somebody makes a completely false claim that a specific person violated the law by some action, and the claimant had willful disregard for the falsity of the claim, that could be defamatory.

However, that is because they clearly have the subclauses of 12\\.4 in the wrong order. If this is fixed then the limitations are 12 months for a 15km radius, 6 months for a 50km radius and 3 months for the same state.\n\nThird, 12\\.6 and 12\\.7 are pretty standard types of clauses (although I've not seen something like 12\\.7 before). The reason they are here is because restraint of trade clauses are void if they exceed what is reasonable to protect the legitimate interests of the business.

The clause is designed with a \"cascading\" structure, allowing for partial enforceability if some provisions are deemed too restrictive. This is evidenced by the multiple time periods (12, 6, and 3 months) and geographic areas (state-wide, 50km, and 15km) listed, as well as clauses 12.6 and 12.7 which allow for severability of unenforceable provisions. This structure allows the court to enforce the most restrictive provisions that are still considered reasonable, even if some are deemed too broad. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the clause is broad, its cascading structure is specifically designed to maintain partial enforceability. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the clause is not necessarily enforceable as written, and the geographic restrictions are meant to be read in conjunction with the time periods, not independently.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while remote work might impact the reasonableness of geographic restrictions, the clause is not automatically limited to only the smallest radius.

If I foolishly decide to start marketing dairy products in the US using a bucket with wings as a logo and call my company \"[Tine](https://www.tine.no/)\", some other company might want to sue me for violation of their trademark. The text of the Trademark Law Treaty is [here](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/text.jsp?file_id=294357), and you can see that this is basically about registration, and not remedies. By going through one of these registration\\-disseminations protocols, they may have registered their trademark in the US, so they could sue me here for infringement.\n\nThere isn't anything legally special about ads or being online.

When the company goes away, the contract disappears. However, there may be situations in which this intuition misleads, and the confidentiality agreement lives on.

While it's true that contracts generally terminate when a company dissolves, confidentiality agreements can be more complex.

In establishing the infringer\u2019s profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer\u2019s gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.\n\nStatutory damages may also be awarded under this section, but that will hardly apply if provable damages are anything close to $1 billion. Costs and legal fees can be awarded as additional damages.\n\nUnder other sections of chapter 5 of 17 USC, injunctions against further infringement may be issued, and infringing copies may be seized from importers or other infringers, and destroyed or handed over to the copyright owner. So may type, dies, or other mechanisms for reproducing infringing copies.\n\nAny business or person knowingly participating in making, distributing, or importing infringing copies is an infringer, and may be included in the suit and so in any assessment of damages.

However, those who merely receive or purchase infringing copies are not liable, as long as they do not make additional copies or further distribute the software. The law specifically targets those who violate the exclusive rights of the copyright owner, which includes reproduction and distribution, but not mere possession or use of infringing copies.

You could threaten to sue the company for negligent misrepresentation, or the driver of Car C for defamation, in order to try to get this statement removed, but those would be hard cases to win since you are at least arguably at fault and fault is to some extent a matter of opinion.

Is it even theoretically possible?\n\nMy initial thought was to find all of the relevant information (all the many volumes and documents), but even this seems difficult. How does anyone (citizens, lawyers, judges, other government officials, etc.) even verify that the actions they've taken are legal when the potential applicable laws are so vastly separated from each other being in entirely different series of documents written in format of chronological amendments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main impediment is identifying exactly what \"a law\" is. When people talk (casually) about \"the law\", that can refer to statutes enacted by Congress, regulations set forth by administrative agencies to articulate specifics of those statutes, and Supreme Court rulings as to what \"the law\" is or says. The canonical example of \"a law\" is a statute passed by Congress. Under that understanding, you could point to the US Code and ask the question \"how many\", though you may have to also subtract things ruled unconstitutional by SCOTUS (they aren't removed from The Code, unless actually repealed by Congress).\n\nIn the US code, there isn't an enumerable element \"a law\". [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17) pertains to copyright; [Title 18](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18) pertains to crime. There isn't just one law about crime and one law about copyright. There are 12 chapters in Title 17; Chapter 1 has a couple dozen sections. Sections can get fairly minutely subdivided: there is no clear point at which you can say \"this is one law, this is another\". However, it is legally irrelevant how many there are \u2013 unless Congress passes a law that counts likes (\"must repeal two laws for every new one passed\").\n\nThe immediate product of congressional enactments is the US Code; the immediate product of administrative rule\\-making is the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=browse). Supreme Court decisions are also published in [United States Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports), though I don't if there is an exhaustive online compendium of all rulings.\n\nAlso note that things passed by Congress are \"Laws\" (some public, some private). Things in the US Code originate in such acts of Congree, but not every act of Congress affects the US Code, for example [PL 118\\-81](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1617/text). When new subject matter is first introduced it is usually entirely contained in the corresponding law passed, but subsequently it can be amended, and an amendment to copyright law could be snuck into a bill generally about terrorism. I think that the stuff in the US Code corresponds to what most people think \"a law\" is, but it's better to look at the US Code as a single thing \u2013 \"the law\" \u2013 rather than try to count individual laws.\n\nIf you are armed with access to all of these resources, you would also need to know where to find relevant law. Once you find all of the applicable text, you simply apply general legal principles to reach a conclusion, then hire a lawyer to determine where you went wrong, then hire another lawyer to determine where *he* went wrong. At least in difficult cases. Fortunately, although enacted bills often glue stuff together in crazy ways, when it is assembled into the US Code, it is organized more sensibly.

The issue of laws being hidden in unrelated bills (D) is a complication, but it's not the fundamental problem in quantifying laws.\n\nThe core issue, as highlighted in the correct answer (B), is the lack of a clear, consistent definition of what constitutes a single, countable \"law\" within the complex structure of US federal legislation."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60421/will-naver-own-all-user-content-on-wattpad-when-the-sale-goes-through", "docs_id": 60421, "title": "Will Naver own all user content on Wattpad when the sale goes through?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On January 19, the [Naver buy of Wattpad](https://technocodex.com/south-korean-internet-firm-naver-to-acquire-toronto-based-wattpad-for-600-million-usd/) was reported.

Reading the [Naver terms of service](https://policy.naver.com/policy/service_en.html), it seems that when the sale goes through, Naver will now own all user content. Once you delete your content, Wattpad no longer retains it. it is gone permanently, or so I think.\n\nSome of my friends have already done it, and fear that I will have to delete all of my content so Naver cannot own it. How will it affect the copyright of user\\-made content? We already suspect that Naver is probably probing the site, and maybe even cataloging it for \"data collection.\nAlso, when exactly is the \"second quarter of Wattpad\u2019s fiscal year.\"?\n\nIt doesn't help that the [Wattpad Help Ceneter](https://www.zendesk.com/help-center-closed/) has been suddenly and explicitly shut down.\n\nThe relevant section of Naver services, I think, says all this.\n\n---\n\n> We will value all contents provided by you.\n> Naver hopes your posts shared with other users through Naver Services will enrich the lives of all of us.

Legally this means you give us a nonexclusive license to publish your content on the Wattpad Services, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it).\n\nThe wording is different and shorter than the Naver terms quoted in the question, but in both cases the poster grants the service a non\\-exclusive license to the content.\n\nNaver specifies that this includes the rights to \"store, copy, reproduce, modify, publicly transmit, display, distribute, and create derivative works (only limited to translation)\" while Wattpad gives the more general \"anything reasonably related to publishing\" and specifically includes \"storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing\". The other rights listed by Naver seem probably included in \"reasonably related to publishing\" with the possible exception of a right to \"create derivative works (only limited to translation)\". It dopes not seem that the rights claimed by Naver will be very much more extensive than those already granted to Wattpad.\n\nNothing in the Naver terms quoted says that Naver will \"own\" the content uploaded by users.\n\nIn addition although Naver will purchase Wattpad, one news story says \"Lau confirmed Wattpad will continue to operate independently\" which may well mean that its TOS will be unchanged \\-\\- it is not unusual for different services of the same owner to have different TOS documents and terms.\n\nMoreover, if the Naver terms did grant Naver significantly greater rights in the content uploaded by users, it is not clear that they could unilaterally obtain greater rights in content previously uploaded without some form of consent by the uploader\\-owners.\n\nIn short, I think the concerns expressed in the question are overstated.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about Naver's acquisition of Wattpad, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright and ownership of user-generated content on Wattpad after the acquisition?\n\nA) Naver will automatically own all user-generated content on Wattpad once the acquisition is complete.\n\nB) Users must immediately delete their content from Wattpad to prevent Naver from gaining ownership rights.\n\nC) The rights granted to Naver are likely to be similar to those already granted to Wattpad, with users retaining copyright of their work.\n\nD) Wattpad's terms of service will definitely change to match Naver's, granting Naver extensive new rights over user content.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the information provided suggests that the rights granted to Naver are likely to be similar to those already granted to Wattpad. Both companies' terms of service indicate a non-exclusive license to publish and distribute content, rather than ownership. The Naver terms, while more detailed, do not appear to claim significantly more extensive rights than Wattpad's current terms. Additionally, it's mentioned that Wattpad may continue to operate independently, which could mean its terms of service remain unchanged. There's no indication that Naver will automatically own all content or that users must delete their work to protect their rights.

This picking and choosing is, I don't think can be denied at this point, based at least somewhat on the political opinions of these clients.\n\nIn response to this, a common defense is \"They're private companies, so they can pick and choose who they want to serve.\" But this argument holds no water for most other businesses; for example if I run a coffee shop, I can't pick and choose who to serve based on what political paraphernalia they're wearing (or at least, I'm pretty sure I can't).

Specifically it is an order to a particular person to appear and testify at a particular time and place. In many but not all cases, the order also requires that person to bring specified records or documents along. That is known as a *subpoena duces tecum*. In some cases this is used to, order the production of documents without any accompanying testimony.\n\nThe word \"subpoena\" comes from Latin words meaning \"under penalty\" because the order requires the person to comply under penalty of being held in contempt of court and fined or imprisoned.\n\nTher are many other court orders, such as an *injunction* which is generally an order **not** to do something. Different jurisdictions may use different terms for orders with similar effects.

Let's imagine I am in a public place, such as a mall, or some other large gathering of people, when I hear gunshots ring out.

As I approach the location of the gunshots, I see a man armed with an assault rifle, gunning people down. To be clear, I witness this man killing others.

To be clear, I am NOT talking about any case in which the person who accidentally shot the bystander is a law enforcement officer, as I know they are covered by different laws. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Could I be held criminally and/or civilly responsible?\n\nProbably not criminally in Colorado. You would lack the requisite intent (criminal negligence which verges on recklessness) for even the lowest level homicide offense (negligent homicide), and unlike when a criminal trying to murder someone accidentally kills someone else, the doctrine of transferred intent doesn't create criminal liability because your primary target was one you were authorized by the defense of other statute to use deadly force against.\n\nFor civil liability in Colorado, the standard would be \"negligence\", which means, did you take the care of a reasonable person under the circumstances (engaged in the lawful business of defending others with a deadly weapon) to not hit bystanders. This would probably go to a jury and the claim would be covered by your homeowner's or renter's insurance in all likelihood. You would be a very sympathetic defendant in front of a jury.\n\nA case like that would be fact intensive and could go either way. It is a case in which the quality of lawyering would probably matter a lot. A ricochet off a hard surface to hit a bystander who was not in your line of fire would probably not be sufficiently foreseeable to impose liability (or would limit your liability to a very low percentage of the total). So would a victim you didn't see because the victim was in rapid motion or hidden behind an opaque but not bullet proof object. Other scenarios could conceivably be more culpable, for example, if the active shooter was holding the bystander in a hostage situation.\n\nAlso, the jury would allocate 100% of the liability between you and the criminal as a \"non\\-party at fault\" and that would probably significantly reduce your liability even if the jury found that you had some civil negligence. Maybe the active shooter would be found 90% at fault, and you 10% at fault, for example, if the jury thought that a reasonable person would have taken more care not to hit bystanders. But, since the victim would probably be 0% at fault, the odds of a full exoneration are lower than in cases where the victim is at fault, since it the victim is majority at fault there is no liability.\n\nThe civil liability analysis would different if a law enforcement officer had deputized before you took action (which could be done orally).

However, they could potentially face civil liability based on a negligence standard, which would be determined by whether they took reasonable care under the circumstances. The jury would likely allocate fault between the civilian and the active shooter, potentially reducing the civilian's liability.

Therefore the shop could sue you for any damage this causes (maybe you took something the shop did not want to sell, or the person at the information desk was not an employee and ran away with the money).\n\nHowever, whether this constitutes a crime such as theft will depend on jurisdictions.\n\nGermany\n-------\n\nIn Germany, for example, it would probably not, because by definition a theft requires \"intention to take posession in violation of the law\" ([StGB \u00a7242](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html)). You could argue that you did not intend to violate the law, because you paid the required amount, and only gave the money to the wrong person by mistake. Of course, I cannot guarantee that will convince the judge...\n\nEngland and Wales\n-----------------\n\nSimilarly, the law in England and Wales defines \"theft\" in [section 1 of the Theft Act 1968](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/1):\n\n> A person is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property\n>  belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the\n>  other of it; \\[...]\n\nFurthermore, section 2 says:\n\n> A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be\n>  regarded as dishonest\u2014\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (b) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other\u2019s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or \\[...]\n\nSo, similar to the situation in Germany, you could argue in court that you intended to buy the item legally, and believed that the shop would be okay with that.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the scenario where a customer leaves money with a random employee at a supermarket and takes goods without going through the regular checkout process, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications in different jurisdictions?\n\nA) This action would uniformly be considered theft across all jurisdictions, as the proper checkout process was not followed.\n\nB) In Germany, this action would likely not be considered theft due to the lack of intention to violate the law, while in England and Wales, it would always be considered theft.\n\nC) Both in Germany and England/Wales, this action could potentially avoid being classified as theft if the person can demonstrate a genuine belief that their actions were acceptable to the store.\n\nD) The legal implications would be identical in Germany and England/Wales, with both jurisdictions automatically considering this action as theft.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because both in Germany and England/Wales, the legal definitions of theft include elements related to the person's intent and belief. In Germany, theft requires \"intention to take possession in violation of the law,\" which could potentially be argued against if the person genuinely believed they were making a valid payment. Similarly, in England and Wales, the Theft Act 1968 includes provisions that an appropriation is not dishonest if the person believes they would have consent under the circumstances. Therefore, in both jurisdictions, if the person can demonstrate a genuine belief that their actions were acceptable to the store, they might potentially avoid theft charges.

Get one of Nolo Press's [books](https://store.nolo.com/products/business-suite/business-formation/starting-a-business) on starting a business, and go to town. \n\nAny citizen can incorporate a business in any US state. You will need a [**registered agent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_agent) in the state you registered in. This must be a real office staffed 9\\-5 M\\-F. Usually you contract this out for $300\\-ish a year, but you can be your own registered agent if you have a street address you are at 90% of the time. The criterion is that if a process server tries 3 times to deliver you a legal notice, he must succeed.\n\nYou will find that government license fees and the cost of registered agents will be higher in California than in other states. As you research setting up a corporation or LLC, you will learn other advantages of choosing another state. \n\nHowever, if you do business in California (pay employees; interact with customers), you will need a state license to **do business in California.** If you formed your business in California, that \"comes with it\". Otherwise your out\\-of\\-state business must register *as a foreign business* with the Secretary of State. This costs about the same as registering a domestic (CA) business. \n\nYou will also need a California Registered Agent.

According to the documentation, any US citizen can incorporate a business in any state, regardless of residency. However, to operate in California, the business will need a registered agent in the state and must obtain a license to do business in California. This applies whether the business is incorporated in California or another state. Option A is incorrect because residency is not required for incorporation.

My understanding is that a quorum merely prevents business from taking place without meeting the required number of members present. It is not an grant of authority for things to take place when you do happen to meet the minimum threshold. \n\nFor example, the quorum may be set at a majority of members. But without a rule stipulating that a majority vote wins, a quorum is not sufficient to tell you whether or not a majority can carry a motion. To go further, the quorum certainly does not override any requirement that a supermajority carry any motion.\n\nIn sum, my understanding is that a quorum shouldn't be read to explain what number is necessary to carry a motion. My understanding is that a quorum merely denotes the number required for any business to take place at all.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Quorum defines the minimum number of members present in order to conduct business. Once quorum is met, members may make motions and the assembly may conduct business.\n\nNow your question concerns the minimum required for passing a motion, and you are correct some motions require more than majority, such as 2/3 vote.\n\nThe problem in your analysis is that rules of procedure assume that the majority or supermajority is met from the members present and voting, not from the total number of members.\n\nLet me show you some examples so you can fully understand.\n\nLet's say there's an assembly with 21 members, with the standard quorum requirements of majority of the members.\n\nThe minimum number of people required for quorum show up, which is 11 (more than half is majority).\nIn order to pass a motion, you only need majority of the members present and voting. That typically means 6 people. However, let's say 2 members abstain from the vote or are present at the meeting but don't record their vote. Then a vote can pass 5\\-4\\. Quorum is met and a majority of the members present and voting, voted for the the motion.\n\nSimilarly 2/3 votes are counted from members present and voting.\n\nThere is an exception to this. If the organizations bylaws say that it takes a majority of the members to pass a certain motion, then the motion must pass by the majority of the total number of members in the organization, which is 11 in this case.

Does it matter if the person reporting this, is a union member or not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A person can report a breach of contract, if there actually is one: the risk is that they are mistaken and they make a false claim, in which case they may be sued for defamation. This would almost certainly fall under the rubric of defamation against public figure, where one must show \"actual malice\" (such as knowing that the claim is false, or having reckless disregard for the truth of the statement).\n\nAnother consideration is that a publisher might believe themselves to be open to lawsuit for tortious interference, as in the infamous 1995 case of CBS 60 Minutes backing down on an interview, where they felt that maybe they induced the interviewee to breach a non\\-disclosure clause in a contract (it is generally held that CBS's concerns were ill\\-founded).\n\nThe only imaginable path for retribution against the employee would be a non\\-disparagement or non\\-disclosure clause in the employment contract. \"Disparagement\" is sufficiently under\\-defined that telling the truth about a company's actions would not be \"disparagement\". Non\\-disclosure clauses are founded on the idea that some employees are entrusted with secret information, and there would be no duty of no\\-disclosure with respect to a rank\\-and\\-file employee reporting a legal wrong\\-doing by a company.\n\nOn the contrary, an employee is generally protected against retaliation for such revelations, owing top various whistleblower protections.

Whistleblower protections generally shield employees from retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoing. However, if the employee's report turns out to be false and was made with \"actual malice\" (knowing it was false or with reckless disregard for its truth), they could potentially face a defamation lawsuit.

Many early episodes have plot points centering around Constitutional issues and Presidential powers that Americans will remember from their school days (e.g. the ability of the President to federalize units of the National Guard). Based on those early episodes, it's clear the show is *attempting* to be accurate in its depiction of existing US law, and not just making stuff up wildly or in an alternate reality with different laws.\n\nIn S1E11 of the show, police officers have surrounded a building where they believe a terrorist is hiding. They are on US soil, and believe that the occupant of the building is the person who attempted to assassinate the president several hours earlier. It is unclear if they know the nationality/citizenship status of the terrorist.\n\nThe (Acting) President of the United States has an open line of communication to the on\\-scene police commander from a bunker in the White House. Other characters explain that standard procedure is for police to attempt to take the alleged terrorist into custody so that criminal charges may be brought, and for police to not fire their weapons unless attacked. The President gives a preemptive order for police to kill the suspect even if a non\\-lethal option is available. His advisors object, but he overrules them, explicitly commanding them to \"shoot to kill.\"\n\nThe show set things up to feel sort of like a Commander\\-in\\-Chief giving orders to a military unit in a war zone overseas, but ultimately, the scenario was a domestic police operation. So, is this something a President can actually do, from a legal standpoint? Or did the show decide to ignore reality in the service of the plot this time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The show ignored the existing legal framework.\n\nAlmost all U.S. police officers are employed by state and local governments and do not report directly to the President, even in an emergency. \n\nA small number of law enforcement officers are federal employees with a direct line of command to the President (e.g. the Secret Service and the security guards in the General Services Administration and TSA officers), but a law enforcement officer, unlike a member of the military or a CIA officer, does not simply follow the orders of the civilians to whom his superiors are responsible without the intervention of their law enforcement superiors based solely upon that civilian's whims and directions the way that a soldier would.\n\nThe Secret Service has some limited authority to direct and even deputize local law enforcement officers in pursuit of their missions, but that would probably not extend to the kind of national security kill order contemplated in this episode.\n\nThis said, lots of law enforcement officers are ex\\-military, most law enforcement agencies has a quasi\\-military organizational structure, and in the extreme circumstances of *Designated Survivor*, it wouldn't be shocking for law enforcement officers to follow their natural military chain of command intuitions rather than the law that actually applies in these situations. Law enforcement officers are personality types that are very deferential to authority which is a natural counterpart to support for their hierarchical view of the world that endows them with their own authority. There is no one in the loop to play devil's advocate for the suspected terrorist.\n\nBut, strictly speaking, the proper protocol within the U.S. would be to have a CIA agent make the strike (because the military is prevented by the posse comitatus act from doing so, unless these events counted as an \"insurrection\" which they very well might in which case the military could be involved), rather than a law enforcement officer.\n\nIncidentally, the U.S. Supreme Court has basically held that the citizenship of the suspected terrorist is irrelevant, even though policy makers in all of the Presidential administrations since 9\\-11 have not been very comfortable with that state of the law and have sought to distinguish U.S. citizens from non\\-U.S. citizens in their own policies.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the TV show Designated Survivor, the President orders police to \"shoot to kill\" a terrorist suspect on US soil.

According to the information provided, the President does not have the legal authority to directly command local police forces, as most US police officers are employed by state and local governments. However, given the extreme circumstances depicted in the show and the tendency of law enforcement to defer to authority, they might comply with such an order despite its lack of legal basis.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the President does not have direct authority over local police forces.\n\nAnswer B is partially true but incomplete. While the President has more direct authority over federal agencies, issuing a \"shoot to kill\" order to law enforcement (even federal) without due process is still problematic legally.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement is generally prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act, unless the situation is classified as an \"insurrection.\"\n\nThe most legally appropriate action, according to the provided information, would be to have a CIA agent carry out such an operation, rather than law enforcement or military personnel."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16543/would-it-be-legal-for-bookmakers-to-take-bets-on-someone-being-assassinated", "docs_id": 16543, "title": "Would it be legal for bookmakers to take bets on someone being assassinated?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background: My colleague just told me that he reckons Donald Trump's presidency is most likely to end in assassination.

The statutory language is not clear, and legality is determined via case law. The way to determine if it is currently illegal is to inspect the record of similar cases, especially [US v. Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.), pertaining to the relationship between the OS and their browser. It is possible that a court would find NVIDIA to be in an analogous dominant position. The Microsoft battle was not subjected to an ultimate court finding after an [initial finding against the company](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/84/9/2497700/), and was settled without establishing a distinguishing precedent, after the company prevailed on the [highest appeal](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/253/34/576095/). That appeal did not bring forward any legal principles that would tend to render NVIDIA's policy illegal, but one can always pour over this case to see if there is anything applicable, if one decides to pursue NVIDIA on similar grounds.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: NVIDIA's policy of restricting the use of their Capture API to certain hardware products while offering their own ShadowPlay software raises antitrust concerns. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation based on the information provided?\n\nA) NVIDIA's policy is clearly illegal under current antitrust laws and would likely be struck down in court.\n\nB) The legality of NVIDIA's policy is uncertain and would depend on a court's interpretation of existing antitrust case law, particularly in comparison to the Microsoft antitrust case.\n\nC) NVIDIA's policy is completely legal because they have the right to set any conditions on the use of their copyrighted software.\n\nD) The policy is legal only if NVIDIA can prove that restricting the API use is necessary for technical reasons related to the hardware.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the documentation indicates that the legality of NVIDIA's policy is not clear-cut under current antitrust law. The text states that \"legality is determined via case law\" and suggests that a court would need to examine similar cases, particularly the Microsoft antitrust case, to determine if NVIDIA's practices are illegal. The outcome would depend on whether a court finds NVIDIA to be in a dominant position similar to Microsoft's in the OS market. The lack of a definitive precedent from the Microsoft case leaves the legality of NVIDIA's policy uncertain and subject to judicial interpretation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation does not state that the policy is clearly illegal. Option C is too absolute, as copyright protection doesn't guarantee immunity from antitrust concerns. Option D introduces a condition not mentioned in the provided information."}}
