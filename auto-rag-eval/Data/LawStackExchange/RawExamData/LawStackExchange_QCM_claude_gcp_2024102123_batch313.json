(My \"source\" for this is \"Perry Mason.\")\n\nWhat exactly is a \"preliminary hearing\"? Is it a \"halfway house\" between say, a grand jury indictment and a trial? Or given the sequence of arrest and \"preliminary hearing,\" is it the grand jury indictment process itself? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A \"preliminary hearing\", of the kind depicted in the Perry Mason novels, is a procedure in California and some other states. It is an alternative to a Grand jury proceeding. It is used to determine whether there is probable cause to put the defendant on trial.\n\nSuch hearing are mostly rather routine, and rarely reach the level of drama shown in \"Perry Mason\". But the prosecutor does present witnesses, which the defendant's lawyer can cross\\-examine. The defendant may, but rarely does, also present witnesses. \n\nNote that Mason stories sometimes involved a full trial, not just a preliminary hearing.\n\nGardner, who wrote Perry Mason, was a practicing attorney in CA, and most of the law as he shows it was accurate when he wrote, but he often showed legally possible but highly unlikely events to improve the drama of his stories.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the California legal system, what is the primary purpose of a preliminary hearing?\n\nA) To determine the defendant's guilt or innocence\nB) To negotiate a plea bargain between the prosecution and defense\nC) To determine if there is probable cause to put the defendant on trial\nD) To select a jury for the upcoming trial\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a preliminary hearing in California is used to determine whether there is probable cause to put the defendant on trial. It serves as an alternative to a grand jury proceeding.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the purpose of a preliminary hearing is not to determine guilt or innocence - that's the role of a full trial.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while plea bargaining can occur at various stages of the legal process, it is not the primary purpose of a preliminary hearing.\n\nOption D is incorrect because jury selection occurs later in the process, typically just before a full trial begins.\n\nThe preliminary hearing allows the prosecutor to present witnesses, whom the defendant's lawyer can cross-examine. It's a step between an arrest and a full trial, acting as a screening process to ensure there's enough evidence to proceed to trial."

In [2014 Microsoft bought Nokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mobile). Part of Nokia's value was that it held [a whole bunch of fundamental patents for cellular communications](https://www.nokia.com/licensing/patents/). Microsoft was suing Samsung on the basis of those patents. Samsung in turn claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia, and their attempt to charge for the Nokia patents violated the terms of a 2011 agreement between Samsung and Microsoft.\n\nSamsung and Microsoft settled the dispute in 2015\\. The terms of the settlement were confidential.\n\nMicrosoft and Google did wage a separate patent battle in the courts of the US and Germany.

These cases are assembled by legal publication companies in what used to be long sequential series of hard bound books called \"reports\" although this is not predominantly done electronically.\n\nBut every court case produces a court file which is maintained by a court clerk. Historically this has usually been done at the trial court clerk level in each county, with appellate court filing that are not published maintained by court clerks for each appellate court.\n\nThe federal courts have modernized this into a single online record keeping system for non\\-sealed court documents available to the general public over the Internet for a modest charge known as PACER (there is a parallel system linked to it in which lawyers and parties and judges can file documents after getting an account in that system).\n\nSome states have partially or fully consolidated state court files into on online system and there is considerable variation in the degree to which non\\-lawyer can access these files over the Internet (anyone can go to a court clerk's office and get copies of the non\\-sealed court files maintained by that clerk in paper form at a modest charge). But most state court records aren't searchable by members of the general public and aren't available to members of the general public over the Internet.\n\nIf there is an equivalent database to the one you mention that collects state\\- and local\\-government initiated lawsuits against corporations on a comprehensive basis, I've never seen it or heard about it.\n\nIf I wanted to, I could do a search of the court records of all of the post\\-digitized court cases brought by a particular governmental entity in Colorado's court records (except in municipal courts and the Denver County Court which are not part of the state record keeping system). I could likewise do a search of all post\\-digitized court cases brought against a particular corporation in Colorado's courts (with the same exceptions).\n\nBut I could not do a search of all records of all cases brought by any governmental entity (there are about 30,000 of them in the U.S.) against any corporation (there are several million corporations in the U.S.), and there really isn't an efficient way to compile such a list. It would take pure brute force pouring through case captions, without cooperation in a research agreement with the state court e\\-filing system administrator and a human subject committee review approval (which could probably both be obtained with enough work).\n\nThere are private companies, primarily credit reporting agencies for business debtors, such as Dun and Bradstreet, and Standard \\& Poors, that systemically pay for and process bulk downloads of all case fillings in almost every court at great expense to prepare a system of credit reports, and their data is available for a substantial fee, generally on a per party search basis, or on a subscription basis, which also isn't cheap. I had a subscription to D\\&B for a year or two since I had a case where this was necessary to finance the expense, and it wasn't crushingly expensive, but it wasn't cheap either.\n\nAnother private database is Lexis Nexus. It is best known for its legal search database, mostly of published and unpublished appellate court decisions that competes primarily with Westlaw, the other major online commercial database of published and unpublished court decisions. But Lexis Nexus also maintains a database of newspaper and magazine and scholarly research articles, and an appropriate search of that database would reveal lawsuits by governments against corporations that were reported upon, not only in the national news, but by local media sources and in industry journals. It isn't the most expensive of private sources, but it isn't the cheapest either, unless you have an academic subscription.\n\nThere is also a service called the jury verdict reporter the maintains as comprehensive a list of civil jury verdicts as it can, but that wouldn't be a great fit to the search criteria and would also be quite expensive to utilize outside paper copies in a law library.\n\nIt might be somewhat manageable for someone with a lawyer's access to the e\\-filing system to set out to list all lawsuits filed against 100 to 500 large publicly held corporations in a single state, and then to manually purge those lists by the governmental or non\\-governmental character of the plaintiffs, during the e\\-filing era, although it would still be an epic and expensive task. But there isn't any free source that has done it. Any publicly available databases are extremely fragmentary.\n\nAnother way to dramatically focus the search would be to limit the scope of government plaintiffs searched. There are roughly 30,000 state and local governments in the United States. But State governments would bring the lion's share of interesting lawsuits against publicly held corporations and there are only 50 of those (plus D.C. and territorial governments) to search. If you limited it to state criminal prosecutions against corporations (which are extremely rare), that would narrow your search even further, although it would still be cumbersome to winnow down.\n\nAfter state government plaintiffs you'd want to focus on the county and municipal governments in the place where each corporation has its headquarters, on county and municipal governments in state capitols, and on county and municipal governments in places where each corporation has its largest operations other than its headquarters (especially central cities in major metropolitan areas).\n\nFor cases filed prior to the e\\-filing system, you would have even more work, realistically, having to go from court house to court house in every single county to review paper based indexes of court files (although at least you could sort cases based upon case names alone without reviewing the content of the files).\n\nFinally, there is a non\\-court record source that is available for publicly held corporations, of which there are several thousand. This is EDGAR which is the databased of federal corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contains annual and quarterly reports from publicly held companies and also supplemental disclosures from those companies in some circumstances. Publicly held companies are required to mention in their SEC reports available on the Internet via EDGAR all material lawsuits against the company. So, if you wanted to develop a database of material lawsuits in all jurisdictions filed by governments against say, all corporations in the S\\&P 500, EDGAR reports would be a fairly efficient way to go about it, even though these reports also contain lots of non\\-lawsuit related information.\n\nBut closely held companies don't have to file reports with the SEC so an EDGAR search would not reveal lawsuits filed by governments against privately held corporations.\n\nIf you were primarily interested in criminal cases against corporations, select reports of the U.S. Sentencing Commission and a handful of U.S. states also have similar commissions that might sometimes discuss sentences for corporations as criminal defendants, although these would be quite rare.\n\nThere are also likely to be databases specific to suits commonly brought by governments against corporations, such as anti\\-trust cases, labor law cases, and environmental cases.",

Obviously there is no way to be sure what the law will be at that date, so I am asking what the law for a similar situation would be in the year 2022, in New York State, although I would also be interested in the law in other jurisdictions. \\[This question includes spoilers for the earlier books in the series.]\n\nIN this novel the main character, Captain Ishmael Wang, has a chance to purchase a used spaceship designed for both freight and passengers at the bargain price of 35 million credits (about 1/3 of the market price). Not having that much money of his own, Ishmael hires a financial advisor, William Simpson. Simpson sets up a company with nine shares of stock, each with a face value of ten million credits. He arranges for four venture capital investors to buy one share each at face value, which would give Ishmael the purchase price plus additional start up funds. In return the stock will pay 5% dividends annually, starting after five years. But at the last moment, one investor backs out of the deal. Simpson arranges a 90\\-day loan of 8 million, at 6%, backed by one share of the company.\n\nAs the end of the 90\\-day period approaches, the company ios doing well, but has not earned the required eight million credits. Here is the relevant conversation between Ishmael Wang and William Simpson (from chapter 65 of *Oner's Share*)\n\n> \u201cSo, how can I help you today, Captain?\u201d Mr. Simpson asked with a small smile and a sidelong glance.\n> \n> \n> \u201cI\u2019ve come about the note, sir. It\u2019s due in a couple of days and the ship hasn\u2019t earned enough in so short a time. I wondered if you\u2019d found a buyer for the stock so that we might avoid default.\u201d\n> \n> \n> He reached over and patted my forearm with one bony hand. \u201cHere\u2019s what will happen on the twenty\\-sixth, my boy.\u201d He laced his fingers together across his chest and continued. \u201cAssuming you haven\u2019t the liquid assets needed to repay the loan, you will default. Larks, Simpson, and Greene will take ownership of the single share of stock that you\u2019ve assigned as collateral. Once that happens we\u2019ll sell it to an investor, removing ourselves from ownership, and leaving you to deal with your board of directors.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \u201cYou already have an investor, sir?\u201d\n> \u201cWe do, my boy. We do.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \u201cThen why not sell them a share of unencumbered stock, and let me pay off the loan without incurring the default?\u201d\n> \n> \n> He turned his head toward me. \u201cIf we did that, we\u2019d forego the opportunity to earn a profit of two million credits.\u201d He shook his head, and turned back to gaze out through the armorglass. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a great deal of time and money in getting you started up, Captain. You\u2019ll walk away with an unencumbered company, and the opportunity to succeed or fail on your own without long\\-term liabilities. Please don\u2019t deny us a modest profit on the transaction.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that the Simpson character, a paid financial advisor who knows that Wang is relying on his advice, is in the position of a fiduciary (or would be under current law) and would be ethically and legally required to but his client's interest first, and not take the two million additional profit, on top of his fees and the 6% interest on the loan. Is that correct?\n\n\\[I will add that I recommend this series, which consists of the novels *Quarter Share*, *Half Share*, *Full Share*, *Double Share*, *Captain's Share*, and *Owner's Share*. Buty I would not advise starting with the sixth of these.]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Is this person a [fiduciary](https://www.13wentworth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fiduciary-Duties-010518.pdf)?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou describe Simpson as a financial advisor, however, I believe that is a mischaracterisation. His role appears rather to be that of a business advisor: a financial advisor offers investment advice whereas a business advisor offers business and corporate capital advice. In most jurisdictions, financial advisors are heavily regulated, business advisors aren\u2019t.\n\nTo be a fiduciary, the person must come from a recognised class where the relationship is fiduciary by its nature, or the relationship must be one of special trust and confidence.\n\n> Such relationships will possess the \u201ccritical feature\u201d spoken of by Mason J in *Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation* (1984\\) 156 CLR 41 at 96\\-97, namely:\n> \n> \n> \u201c... that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.\u201d\n\nIs Simpson in a class recognised to have a fiduciary duty?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nProbably, but not to Wang.\n\nOne class the law recognises as owing a fiduciary duty is that of Promoter of a company: *Tracy v Mandalay Pty Ltd* (1953\\) 88 CLR 215, Dixon CJ, Williams and Taylor JJ at 241\u2013242\\.\n\nHowever, that duty is owed to the *company*, not to any particular shareholder. Indeed, a duty to the company is incompatible with a duty to potential investors in that company, If the loan default is by the company, this would appear to breach that duty.\n\nHowever, Wang is not owed such a duty if the loan is in his name.\n\nWe can\u2019t really tell if the loan is owed by the company or by Wang: either is possible on the information given.\n\nDoes Simpson\u2019s relationship to Wang possess the \u201ccritical feature\u201d?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the facts given (here and probably in the book), it\u2019s impossible to say.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this relationship is a contractural one and fiduciary duties are rarely found in such relationships. As with most things involving contract law, the terms of the contract are critical.\n\n> The imposition of fiduciary duties in contractual relationships can be problematic. In *Hospital Products*, Mason J spoke in terms that came to be endorsed by the High Court in *John Alexander\u2019s Clubs v White City Tennis Club* (2010\\) 241 CLR 1 at 36; \\[2010] HCA 19\\. Sir Anthony Mason examined cases where contract provides the foundation for a fiduciary relationship:\n> \n> \n> \u201cIn these situations it is the contractual foundation which is all important because it is the contract that regulates the basic rights and liabilities of the parties. The fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them. The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction.\u201d\n\nIf the terms of the contract create a fiduciary relationship, either explicitly or implicitly, then there will be one. However, almost all contracts don\u2019t do this: the rights and responsibilities in most contracts are incompatible with a fiduciary relationship.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nIf the contract explicitly allows Simpson to behave in this manner then that\u2019s the end of it. It says he can so he can.\n\nIf the contract gives Simpson discretion to act in this manner, or if it is silent, then it gets a bit jurisdiction specific. In the US, there is an obligation to act in good faith to achieve the purposes of a contract. Other common law jurisdictions do not impose this positive duty: they impose a negative duty to not act in bad faith.\n\nWhile Simpson\u2019s actions are certainly not those of a good faith actor, they are not obviously bad faith. Good faith requires powers to be exercised reasonably and not arbitrarily. Bad faith requires an intention to mislead or deceive by performing the contract dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a gap in between and Simpson might be in that gap.",

In contractual relationships, fiduciary duties are rarely imposed unless explicitly stated. Without knowing the exact terms of their agreement, Simpson's actions, while potentially unethical, may be legally permissible if not explicitly prohibited by the contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Simpson appears to be acting more as a business advisor than a financial advisor, and financial advisors are not automatically considered fiduciaries in all jurisdictions.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that Simpson may owe a fiduciary duty to the company as its promoter, but this doesn't extend to Wang personally as a shareholder.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Simpson's actions may not demonstrate good faith, they don't necessarily rise to the level of bad faith, which requires an intention to mislead or deceive.\n\nThe key point is that without knowing the specific terms of their contract, we cannot definitively state that Simpson's actions are illegal or in breach of his obligations to Wang."

In that case, the client is free to choose the statement in the contract or the one subsequently furnished to him via the adoption agreement. This outcome is akin to \\-\\-or consistent with\\-\\- the doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem).\n\nSee also the [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](https://www.nylitigationfirm.com/files/restat.pdf) at \u00a7 215:\n\n> where there is a binding agreement, either completely or partially\n>  integrated, evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements or\n>  negotiations is not admissible in evidence to contradict a term of the\n>  writing.\n\nThus, bringing up the existence of the \\[previously] signed contract would not help the company's attempt to invalidate the conflicting statement in the \\[subsequent] adoption agreement. Instead, it is likelier for the conflicting clause of the agreement to be cognizable as waiver of what was stated in the contract.\n\nPerhaps the draftsman of the adoption agreement could prevail on grounds that the error in the adoption agreement would lead to an absurd outcome, but that requires a more detailed knowledge of the circumstances. If the adoption agreement is detrimental to the company/draftsman, the best approach is to amend it as soon as possible.\n\nA situation where the adoption agreement is detrimental *to the non\\-draftsman* of the contract sounds in company's unilateral alteration of the contract. As such, it would be unenforceable because it cannot be said that the client agreed (or would be reasonable for him to agree) upon the new, detrimental clause which is inconsistent with what he signed.",

Later, the company sends an adoption agreement to the client, which is supposed to mirror the original contract. However, the adoption agreement contains a clause that conflicts with the original contract. The client is not the drafter of either document.

According to the documentation, when the client is not the drafter of the contract, they are free to choose between the statement in the original contract or the one provided in the subsequent adoption agreement. This approach is consistent with the doctrine of contra proferentem, which generally interprets ambiguities against the drafter of a contract.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the original contract does not always take precedence, especially when a subsequent document provides a different option that may benefit the non-drafting party.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the adoption agreement does not automatically supersede the original contract. The client has the choice between the two conflicting clauses.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the conflicting clause in the adoption agreement is not automatically void. It can be enforceable if the client chooses to apply it over the original contract's clause.\n\nThis question tests understanding of contract interpretation principles, particularly in cases where subsequent documents introduce conflicting terms."

What is the law concerning how one should behave if a wild animal is in the road you are driving on?\n\nWhen I was learning to drive (many years ago, in an area that frequently has wild animals in the road) I learnt that if a human is in the road you do whatever you can to avoid them, and if that causes a crash then so be it, people in cars are better protected than pedestrians. If a (non\\-human) animal is in the road you continue on until you have ascertained that it is safe to take avoiding action, as a crash is likely to hurt humans and they are infinity more important than wild animals. This is the behaviour I have adopted, and would like to know if it is legal.\n\nThis occured in the UK, and that is where I am most interested in answers about. Other jurisdictions could be interesting.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to the article, the driver ran over the ducklings intentionally, when other drivers had already stopped. From the article: \"Police urged animal lovers not to take \"matters in your own hands\" following the incident.\". So the main consequences might not be legal consequences but non\\-legal consequences.\n\n*Before* you run into animals on the road, you make sure that you stay within the speed limit, that you have unobstructed view, and that you keep your eyes on the road. If there's a dog in the road, there could have been a young child as well. So having a situation where you can't stop safely is very bad.\n\nThere are lots of people with expensive animals. A dog could easily be \u00a32,000 and there are Frenchies that cost \u00a330,000\\. Something to consider, so make sure your third party liability insurance is fine.

According to UK law and best practices, what should the driver do in this situation?\n\nA) Continue driving at the same speed, as wild animals are less important than human safety.\n\nB) Immediately swerve to avoid the ducklings, even if it risks causing an accident.\n\nC) Slow down and stop if it's safe to do so, allowing the ducklings to cross.\n\nD) Accelerate to clear the area quickly and minimize traffic disruption.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to slow down and stop if it's safe to do so, allowing the ducklings to cross. This aligns with several key points from the provided information:\n\n1. The article mentions that other drivers had already stopped, indicating that stopping was a safe and expected action.\n\n2. Intentionally running over animals can lead to legal and non-legal consequences, as implied by the police urging people not to take matters into their own hands.\n\n3. Drivers are expected to stay within speed limits and maintain an unobstructed view, which would allow them to stop safely for obstacles, including animals.\n\n4. While human safety is paramount, unnecessarily harming animals can have legal, financial, and social repercussions.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because it disregards animal welfare and potential legal consequences. Option B is wrong as it may cause accidents, contradicting the advice to ensure human safety first. Option D is incorrect as it puts animals at unnecessary risk and doesn't align with the expectation to drive safely and considerately."

Crypto hodled for more than a year in Germany is tax free (neither Capital Gains or Income Tax).\n\nI am a musician and only earn approx 6000Euro per year. This means I pay Zero income tax.\nI got lucky with crypto, but freaked out and sold as the recent crash started to unfold.\nMy gains if taxed *'as'* my income may bring me to a much higher income tax rate (possibly higher than the Capital Gains tax rate).\nEg. if your gains were say 70KEuro, would that put you in the highest income bracket and you would have to pay over 42% income tax?\n\nIf the gains are taxed at my current income tax level, I will then pay a neglible amount.\n\nCould anyone please tell me which scenario is the likely outcome?\n\nI thought that selling would just incur Capital Gains tax on the sale of approx. 25%, but now it seems it may be linked to the incremental income tax scale which could bring the rate much higher.\n\nNote: Interestingly staking coins in Germany means they must be held for a 10year period before they become tax free assets (avoiding Capital Gains). On the other hand, depositing coins in a crypto bank and earning interest does not jeopordise your 1 year holding period.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Crypto sales are a *privates Ver\u00e4u\u00dferungsgesch\u00e4ft* (private sale) that is covered by \u00a723 EstG. This is *sonstiges Einkommen* (other income). So the usual income tax is due on the gains, and not the flat capital gains tax.\n\nThe tax is always assessed on your entire taxable income. Thinking in \u201ctax brackets\u201d is misleading because these brackets only determine your marginal tax rate, not your entire tax rate. The first 9408 EUR are always tax\\-free (numbers for 2020 fiscal year). At 76k EUR total taxable income, your actual tax rate would be a bit over 30%, e.g. see [this tax calculator](https://www.bmf-steuerrechner.de/ekst/eingabeformekst.xhtml). The calculator shows both the marginal tax rate and average tax rate, and lists the \u00a732a EstG formula for tax brackets.\n\nIn practice, your actual income taxes will be lower since deductions might be available, such as payments for health insurance \u2013 but of course you won't end up with more net income.",

This means it's subject to regular income tax, not the flat capital gains tax rate. The total taxable income (\u20ac6,000 + \u20ac70,000 = \u20ac76,000) would be assessed on a progressive scale, resulting in an average tax rate of about 30%, not the highest marginal rate of 42%.

It does not mean that employees excluded by these rules would be unable to whistleblow at all. Rather, the government channels through which they are able to seek protection are likely through a different office. In so far as I can tell, USOSC might restrict the FBI from protection services because they protect employees who go to the Media. FBI agents often handle classified material which would not be allowed to be disclosed to the media and many intel agency employees are required to submit any documents they intend to publish based off knowledge aquired from their employment for a pre\\-publishing review to make sure no classified material is leaked, and would thus limit the way the employee could whistleblow.\n\nJust because this particular office does not provide protection services to the listed employees, it does not mean there is an agency or department that does provide them (Usually the Office of General Inspector for the particular agency in question. While they are attached to the agency they cover, they are not within the chain of command of the agency itself and are independent to them.).\n\nFor that reason, just because the rules that apply to most do not cover FBI Whistle Blowers, it does not mean an FBI employee cannot become a whistle blower. They just cannot use the services of USOSC in their whistleblowing efforts.",

They typically have alternative channels for whistleblowing, often through their agency's Office of Inspector General.

The negative result to the consumer is that this chip caused reliability issues with the system resulting in blank screens. If the chip is disabled manually or by the use of a 3rd party device (blinking light win) then it is much more reliable.\n\nThe top loader model of the NES later released removed this chip making it more reliable in that respect. My question is, would disabling or using the BLW violate the DMCA or any other US law?\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_(Nintendo)>\n\n<https://www.arcadeworks.net/blw>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [The function of the 10NES / CIC Chip](https://youtu.be/sJFCwDJq1gU?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CIC chip was used first at the SNES, and was the base for most authentication. It ran proprietary software that would be seeded with random numbers, and it aborts the game in case that some calculations did come to a bad result.\n\nBypassing it was done with one of three methods:\n\n* modifying the console and disabling the chip, which is legal.\n* use a specialized chip that...\n\t+ answers to the CIC with the authentic answers.\n\t+ just freezes the CIC chip by giving it a Zap.\n\n### Faking Authentification\n\nThere's basically two ways to fake authentication: either you use a copy of the actual chip's proprietary code, or mimicking the proper output. And here the legal trouble starts:\n\nWholesale copying the code or even the significant portions is copyright infringement and illegal.\n\nTricking the US copyright office to get a hold of the trade secret copyrighted code, like Atari did? **Highly** illegal. Copying portions of that illegally obtained code? [Copyright infringement and illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Games_Corp._v._Nintendo_of_America_Inc.), and the court even denied Atari many defenses because they had fooled the copyright office to get the code. [You can read the verdict here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15866317401594691669), but I want to quote this paragraph (emphasis mine):\n\n> In this case, the source code obtained from the Copyright Office facilitated Atari's intermediate copying of the 10NES program. To invoke the fair use exception, **an individual must possess an authorized copy** of a literary work. See Harper \\& Row, 471 U.S. at 562\\-63, 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (Knowing exploitation of purloined manuscript not compatible with \"good faith\" and \"fair dealings\" underpinnings of fair use doctrine.). **Because Atari was not in authorized possession of the Copyright Office copy of 10NES, any copying or derivative copying of 10NES source code from the Copyright Office does not qualify as a fair use.**\n\nBut reconstructing a workaround chip? That actually is legal, as the very case determined in the very next paragraph:\n\n> Reverse engineering, untainted by the purloined copy of the 10NES program and necessary to understand 10NES, is a fair use. \\[Explanation of the process used before Atari resorted to tricking the Copyright office] This \"reverse engineering\" process, **to the extent untainted by the 10NES copy purloined from the Copyright Office**, qualified as a fair use.\n\nAnd deconstructing the chip to show the results? That's actually legal. Even the court in the Atari\\-case said so, and had Atari succeeded in their tries, they would have not had to result to illegal methods to get a hold of the code.\n\n### Zapping the chip\n\nWhile Atari's \"Rabbit\" chip was ill\\-gotten gains, other companies made different legal workarounds: Interrupt the function of the chip by *shocking* the CIC? That's legal.\n\n[GameBoy Authentification](https://youtu.be/I1cUIGHZLGA?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [GameBoy](https://youtu.be/I1cUIGHZLGA?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ) used a variant system. It did not rely on code secrecy but worked with the Trademark \\- offering a different venue to strike at infringers. The GB BootROM relied on loading and then checking if the game was offering the Nintendo logo. If the logo wasn't readable, it would not boot. To make a game run, the most simple way would be to include the Nintendo Logo. There is a more complex solution that first displays the maker's logo and then offers the Nintendo Logo for verification in the second step.\n\n### The simple solution: just display Nintendo\\-TM\n\nIf the game simply offered the official, registered Nindendo logo, it would offer to be endorsed or made by Nintendo. This would be a violation of the Nintendo trademarks, and illegal.\n\n### Tricking the chip\n\nBy displaying the own logo on the step 1 but offering the Nintendo\\-TM Logo in the 2nd step, the solution is very akin to the [Lexmark Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexmark_International,_Inc._v._Static_Control_Components,_Inc.). As the courts in the 2004 case held, it is allowable to bypass an authentication chip. You are also allowed to reverse engineer code to trick it. But you are **not** allowed to just copy the Nintendo code \"10NES\" on the CIC chip.",

Did a fleeing Manuela Rodriguez have the right not to be shot and killed by a Millikan High School safety?\n\nBonus round: any clarification as to whether\nCalifornia Highschool safety officers have the authority to enforce law outside of the confines of a school is also of interest.\n\nCommentary:\n===========\n\nIANAL: any edits to the question is appreciated: including tags. In a day and age where law enforcement is a political football, this question is intended to be posed agnostically: I would like to understand the contours of the law. That being, I would think it prudent for the young, to review this CNN article for understanding the risk associated with fleeing law enforcement over a fist\\-fight.\n\nAs a frequent metropolitan pedestrian, **my biases** lead me to believe that shooting at fleeing suspects (that have not posed a threat) is unnecessarily dangerous to the community and prompts me to pose the question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The federal precedential case on using deadly force against a fleeing suspect is [*Tennessee v. Garner*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/):\n\n> The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable. It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape. Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\n\n> Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.\n\nThis case does not generally prohibit using deadly force to arrest someone who is fleeing in a vehicle, as vehicles are deadly weapons. A person fleeing police in a car poses a threat to pursuing officers and the general public so it is up to local policy and the officers on scene to weigh the risk of public harm against the interest of taking suspects alive and the risk of attempting to use deadly force against them. However, most if not all police departments do not allow the use of deadly force merely because someone is fleeing in a vehicle and also prohibit using firearms against a vehicle in this way, and at least according to the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-30/no-justification-for-shooting-by-long-beach-school-safety-officer-experts-say) this is true of the Long Beach Police Department as well:\n\n> According to a use\\-of\\-force policy from Long Beach Unified\u2019s school safety office, officers are not permitted to fire at a moving vehicle. Firearms may be discharged only when reasonably necessary and justified under the circumstances, such as self\\-defense and the protection of others, the policy states. The policy also bars shooting at fleeing suspects.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner, under which of the following circumstances is it constitutionally reasonable for an officer to use deadly force against a fleeing suspect?\n\nA) Any time a suspect is fleeing from the scene of a felony\nB) Only when the suspect is fleeing in a vehicle\nC) When the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others\nD) Never, as all suspects have the right to flee without risk of deadly force\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supreme Court ruling in Tennessee v. Garner established that using deadly force against all fleeing felony suspects is unconstitutional. However, it allows for the use of deadly force when the officer has probable cause to believe the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others. Option A is too broad, as not all felony suspects pose an immediate threat. Option B is incorrect because fleeing in a vehicle alone does not automatically justify deadly force, though vehicles can be considered deadly weapons. Option D is incorrect because the ruling does allow for deadly force in specific threatening circumstances. Option C correctly reflects the key principle from the Garner decision."

Therefore, the legality and enforceability of such clauses depend on the specific state's laws where the applicant will be working.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because these clauses are not universally enforceable across all U.S. states, and their enforceability can vary based on local laws.\n\nAnswer B is overly permissive and doesn't account for potential legal implications, even if the contract hasn't been signed yet.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because in some cases, these clauses might be considered enforceable even without explicit written agreement, depending on the state's laws and the circumstances of the job offer."

He walked up onto the driveway (trespassing) and broke into the car and stole it (theft). What John didn't know was that James had just died, and had willed all of his property to John. Therefore, John actually was walking in his own driveway (which is legal, of course) and broke into and \"stole\" his own car (also legal, albeit unusual). Did John commit a crime? He had intent and thought he had committed a criminal act (he thought he was trespassing and stealing), but the actions were actually legal. Does the criminal intent make them illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Theft in Oregon (and elsewhere, substantially the same) is [defined statutorily](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_164.015):\n\n> A person commits theft when, with intent to deprive another of\n> property or to appropriate property to the person or to a third\n> person, the person: (1\\) Takes, appropriates, obtains or withholds such\n> property from an owner thereof...\n\nThe car is James' property and it is not John's, even though James is dead. There is a legal process by which at some point in the future the car could become John's, but criminal acts are defined in terms of what is the case at the time of the act, not what might happen in the future. James' intent as expressed in the will notwithstanding, it is not guaranteed that John will become the car owner.

Even though James has died and willed his property to John, at the time of the act, John was not yet the legal owner of the property. The transfer of ownership through a will is not immediate and requires a legal process. Therefore, when John entered the property and took the car, he was trespassing on another's property and stealing another's vehicle. His intent to deprive the owner (who he believed to be James) of the property meets the definition of theft, regardless of the future possibility of inheritance. Criminal acts are defined by the circumstances at the time they are committed, not by potential future outcomes. The fact that John might eventually become the owner does not negate the criminality of his actions at the time they were committed."

Who is responsible for paying income tax on the IRA distribution?\n\nA) John's estate must pay income tax on the full $500,000 on its 2023 tax return\nB) John's estate must pay income tax on the full $500,000 on its 2024 tax return\nC) Each of John's children must report and pay income tax on their $166,667 share on their individual 2024 tax returns\nD) No income tax is owed because IRAs are tax-free upon death\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The IRA distribution is considered \"income in respect of a decedent\" and is taxable to whoever first receives the distribution. In this case, the estate received the IRA but immediately distributed it to the beneficiaries. Therefore, John's children, as the ultimate recipients of the IRA funds, are responsible for reporting and paying income tax on their respective shares in the year they receive the distribution (2024).

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm quite confident that all users on Law StackExchange are well acquainted with the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which confers the privilege against self\\-incrimination upon witnesses as well as defendants. I'm also equally assured of users' familiarity with the Amendment that follows, and they are thus aware of the rights it affords to the defendant, which includes one to confront adverse witnesses and obtain favourable ones via a compulsory process.\n\nIn my opinion, the rights that I have stated in the previous paragraph are in conflict with each other in certain scenarios. For example, what happens if the state's witness invokes their Fifth Amendment right on cross\\-examination or a defence witness, whom the state refuses to give immunity, does the same on direct examination?\n\nI am aware that a witness may not want to expose themselves to prosecution, but would they deprive a defendant's right to a full defence in doing so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is indeed a conflict, often described as a balancing act. Similarly, the principle of free speech protected by the First Amendment requires that the public tolerate lies in political rhetoric, and hateful public speech and insults, but can be balanced against an individual's interest in reputation in a libel case. See *Near vs Minnesota* and *NY Times vs Sullivan* for leading cases on this issue. There is also tension between the right of a newspaper to report on a current criminal case again under the First Amendment, and the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury, which might be influenced by newspaper publicity.\n\nIn these and similar situations, there is no way to fully serve both protected interests, and courts must strike a balance and prefer one right over another, or find some compromise.\n\nIn the 5th vs 6th situation, courts have mostly favored the 5th. That is, the court will not require a witness to give up the right not to self\\-incriminate, and usually will not grant a defendant an acquittal because desired testimony is unavailable.\n\nIt might be that a defendant expected to rely on the testimony of a witness who has since died, or has fled the country and cannot be brought before the court. The sixth does not and cannot assure perfect justice, and the courts do not attempt to make it do so.\n\nIn the situation described, the defendant may compel the witness to appear and be asked the relevant questions. The jury will hear the answer, and may assume what it would have been without the invocation of the Fifth. The defendant's lawyer can try to find a question that the witness will answer, and can argue that the refusal to answer is consistent with a not\\-guilty verdict. That is all that the courts provide.\n\nWhen the **prosecution** calls a witness, knowing or having good reason to know that the witness will invoke the 5th on more or less every relevant question, the US Supreme Court in *Namet v. United States* 373 U.S. 179 (1963\\) has held that this may be error requiring overturning the conviction. This was confirmed and expanded in *Douglas v. Alabama* 380 U.S. 415 (1965\\). But neither of these are relevant when the **defense** calls the witness.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal trial, the defendant calls a witness who invokes their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during direct examination. The witness's testimony is crucial to the defendant's case. Which of the following best describes the likely outcome of this situation?\n\nA) The court will compel the witness to testify, overriding their Fifth Amendment rights to protect the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.\n\nB) The defendant will be granted an automatic acquittal due to the unavailability of crucial testimony.\n\nC) The witness will be allowed to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights, and the defendant's lawyer can argue that this invocation is consistent with a not-guilty verdict.\n\nD) The court will grant the witness immunity from prosecution to ensure the defendant's right to a full defense is protected.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In situations where there is a conflict between a witness's Fifth Amendment rights and a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, courts have generally favored the Fifth Amendment. The witness is allowed to invoke their right against self-incrimination, even if it potentially harms the defendant's case. The defendant can compel the witness to appear and be asked questions, but cannot force them to answer. The defendant's lawyer can then argue that the refusal to answer is consistent with a not-guilty verdict.\n\nOption A is incorrect because courts typically do not compel witnesses to give up their Fifth Amendment rights, even to protect a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.\n\nOption B is incorrect because courts do not usually grant automatic acquittals due to unavailable testimony, whether it's because a witness invokes the Fifth Amendment or for other reasons like death or fleeing the country.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while granting immunity is a possibility, it's not a guaranteed or likely outcome, especially when the defense calls the witness. Courts generally do not intervene to this extent to ensure a defendant's right to a full defense."

The size of the fee is \n>  rather minimal, but it was based on the recognition that costs are not \n>  intended to be a full indemnity but rather a partial indemnity, as we \n>  have seen from the earlier discussion of the components of costs.\n\nI read: [Disbursements (that is, the law firm's out of pocket expenses) will be accounted for, and added to the bill.](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/day-to-day/how-legal-fees-work/article626802/) [This](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kt0Cw.jpg) from p. 260 states more about 'costs' vs 'fees'.\n\nYet I still don't understand the bolded sentence's apparent distinction of 'disbursement' vs 'fees.' \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Disbursements** are 'the funds paid out by the lawyer for expenses incurred in the lawsuit, such as the costs of typed transcripts and the fees charged by expert witnesses': Irwin Law, *Canadian Online Legal Dictionary*, [definition of 'disbursements.'](https://www.irwinlaw.com/cold/disbursements) For an international perspective, see the [Wikipedia article on disbursements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disbursement).\n\nThe term **fee** does not necessarily have any special legal meaning. Disbursements can include 'fees' which are paid by a lawyer on a client's behalf \u2013 the dictionary definition includes the example of expert witness fees, but a more common example is a filing fee charged by a court to commence a lawsuit. However, when used in contrast to 'disbursements,' 'fees' often refer to lawyers' professional fees. These tend to be charged by the hour and form the majority of litigation costs. Wikipedia calls them [attorney's fees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%27s_fee).\n\n**Costs** are the combination of fees and disbursements which the losing party can be ordered to pay to the winning party. The source you have quoted from explains a common feature of the law of costs in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada: disbursements are often recoverable in full, while professional fees can only be recovered in part. This ensures that the loser is not responsible for the winner's decision to hire unusually expensive lawyers, although in many jurisdictions even an average lawyer will charge fees well in excess of the recoverable amount. Wikipedia refers to these as [court costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_costs).",

Fees, when contrasted with disbursements, typically refer to the professional charges of lawyers for their time and expertise, usually billed at an hourly rate. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while disbursements are often fully recoverable, fees are sometimes partially recoverable, not never recoverable. \n\nOption B mischaracterizes both terms - court filing charges can be a type of disbursement, and fees are not limited to these.\n\nOption D incorrectly limits both terms. Expert witness charges are typically considered disbursements, not fees, and disbursements cover a much wider range of expenses than just document preparation."

I guess so... right? But it also feels like the line between public and private is quite blurred...\n\nAnd am I allowed to promote/market the platform? Would that be investment advice? What about marketing specific investments on my platform?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Operationally, in the United States, a **public stock exchange** is a stock exchange which only conducts transactions involving securities in publicly held companies for members of the general public through brokers authorized to participate in the exchange, while a **private stock exchange** is a network that facilitates private placements of securities (i.e. transfers of securities that fall within a securities law exemption) in companies that are not publicly held, between accredited investors (basically affluent people, certain sophisticated people and institutional investors).\n\nA company is publicly held if it has more than a certain amount of shareholders with a certain amount of market capitalization, if it is listed on a public stock exchange, or if its securities are marketed to the general public. In practice, there is very little middle ground. \n\nMost companies either have just a handful of owners and investment debt holders (i.e. are closely held), or have a great many (typically thousands), while few are near the threshold between being closely held and public held. Typically, a company with enough securities holders to be publicly held has a net asset value that requires the company to comply with the obligations of a publicly held company.\n\nA company that has securities that is publicly held is subject to much more strict disclosure requirements and liability for non\\-disclosure of material facts than a company that is not publicly held. Publicly held companies are also not allowed to be taxed as pass through entities. This is quite expensive (hundreds of thousands of dollars to single digit millions of dollars per year in a typical case, mostly for lawyers, accountants, printers and investment bankers).\n\nThere are many kinds of securities, but the most common are common stock, preferred stock, and bonds.\n\nAlmost all of the technical terms used in this answer have highly specific legal and regulatory definitions.",

The released video omits the shooting itself.\n> \n> \n> The full unedited body camera footage of the shooting was unsealed by the Court immediately after the end of the trial.\n\nIt seems out of place that there would be video evidence of the crime in questioning happening, but the actual shooting was omitted while other parts of the video were released. Isn't the actual moment of the shooting the most important part of the video?\n\nWas this to prevent bias? Why was the video evidence of the not used in the case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The non\\-release of video evidence prior to the trial's completion would be to prevent potential jurors from being tainted, because jurors are required to obtain their knowledge of the facts of the case solely from what is presented to them at trial. Someone who saw the full video prior to the trial would be ineligible to serve as a juror in the case in much the same way that witnesses of a crime can not serve on the jury in a trial arising from that crime.\n\nThe fact that he was acquitted meant that the case could never be retried. If he was not acquitted, the video probably would have stayed under seal until all possible appeals were exhausted to prevent jurors on any possible retrial from being tainted. The Wikipedia link in the OP notes that: \n\n> In March 2018, it became known that the United States Department of\n>  Justice has reopened the case and is looking into a possible civil\n>  rights violation by Brailsford.\n\nFinding jurors in that case may be somewhat more difficult as a result, although the more remote time period and the larger jury pool area of a federal court, may make it possible to find jurors unfamiliar with this video. If not, the defendant may move to change the venue of the case to a court less familiar with the case.\n\nYou are incorrect in your belief that the video evidence was not used in the case. \n\nThe fact that the video was \"under seal\" doesn't imply that it wasn't used at trial. This just means that it can't be released to anyone other than the prosecution team and the defense team other than at trial and that it can't be released by anyone present at the trial until the case is no longer under seal.\n\nIn fact, the full video was the highlight of the trial. According to [NBC news coverage](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/daniel-shaver-shooting-ex-arizona-police-officer-not-guilty-murder-n827641) of the trial:\n\n> Last year's fatal shooting of a Texas man by Arizona police was caught\n>  on body\\-camera video and showed him sobbing with his hands up, begging\n>  for his life in his final moments.\n> \n> \n> Jurors who watched the full video showing Daniel Shaver's death agreed\n>  Thursday to acquit former Mesa officer Philip Mitchell Brailsford of\n>  murder, ending an emotional six\\-week trial.",

The full body camera footage was initially sealed to prevent potential jurors from being biased before the trial. This is a common practice in high-profile cases to ensure that jurors obtain their knowledge of the facts solely from what is presented during the trial. Releasing such crucial evidence before the trial could taint the jury pool, making it difficult to find impartial jurors.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sealing evidence does not prevent the defendant from accessing it for their defense; both the prosecution and defense teams have access to sealed evidence.\n\nAnswer B, while plausible, is not the primary reason in this case. The privacy of individuals is a consideration, but the main concern was maintaining the integrity of the jury selection process.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the footage was highly relevant to the case.

The former can be done by anyone; the others require a licence.\n\nYou can tailor factual information to someone about whom you have specific information (such as someone who asked a question on [Money SE](https://money.stackexchange.com)) without crossing into advice. The examples in the ASIC document are illustrative:\n\n> **Scenario**\n> \n> \n> An organisation without an AFS licence includes on its website a list of financial products of a particular class available from third\\-party product providers, together with some objectively ascertainable factual information about specific product characteristics, with the aim of providing useful information for consumers to assist them to make a decision about the class of financial product.\n> \n> \n> **Commentary**\n> \n> \n> Because the information is factual and does not involve a qualitative judgement about, or an evaluation or assessment of, the features of the products, it is not financial product advice.\n\n> **Scenario**\n> \n> \n> A client contacts an insurer\u2019s call centre and requests a quote for comprehensive car insurance. Noting the client\u2019s car is old and of low value, the call centre operator mentions the possibility of third party property damage cover and explains the difference between it and comprehensive cover. At the client\u2019s request, the call centre operator provides a quote for the annual premiums for each product.\n> \n> \n> **Commentary**\n> \n> \n> This is factual information. Although the call centre operator has been provided with some personal information about the client, and has used this information to provide relevant information to the client about an alternative product, the operator has not given an opinion or made a recommendation that is intended to, or that could be reasonably regarded as being intended to, influence a decision about a financial product.\n\n> **Scenario**\n> \n> \n> A superannuation fund would like to provide a brochure containing general advice about retirement planning issues to some of its members via a mailout.

Using the personal information about fund members in this way does not mean that the fund is providing personal advice. Instead, the fund is using personal information to provide general advice to a particular audience.\n\nThe disclaimer will not turn what is clearly advice into information but it makes clear that what is being presented is and is intended to be factual information. And, since the \u201cadvice\u201d is considered as a whole in a prosecution the disclaimer can make a big difference.",

Rather, common law systems rely heavily on judicial precedent (previous court decisions) to interpret and apply the law, while civil law systems primarily refer to codified statutes. In both systems, courts interpret the law rather than rewrite it, and public opinion does not directly determine court decisions. The common law approach allows for more flexibility in interpreting statutes based on evolving societal norms and previous cases, which is particularly relevant in cases involving emerging issues like transgender rights in the workplace."

After few months, co\\-founder A would not want to continue, but based on the original founders' agreement, has equity allocated (and vested) to him.\n\nNow, the co\\-founders agree amongst themselves and are willing to buy the third co\\-founder out. Note, until this point, everything is just on agreements that they drafted themselves, agreed upon, and signed. I.e. there is no company registered, or notarized documents.\n\nCan the two co\\-founders pay co\\-founder A and buy back the equity? Can they do so without involving any Notary public i.e. by simply drafting up another agreement and signing it together?\n\nIdeally, co\\-founders (A, B, and C) would want to avoid any extra work as much as possible. Co\\-founders B and C will be continuing their work on the same startup project, and wouldn't want to deal with any future consquences.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The three partners presumably created some variation of an \u00a7 705 BGB partnership (*Gesellschaft b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts*). Their rights and obligations are established via their mutual contract, which does not even have to be written as long as no real estate is involved. However, this contract is bounded by the BGB.\n\nThe partner A who wants to leave can terminate the partnership contract at any time. Depending on the terms of the contract, this will dissolve the partnership (default consequence), or the partnership will continue with the other members B and C. In either case, A will receive their share of the assets of the partnership. The BGB provides a default procedure:\n\n* objects that were handed over to the partnership are returned, without compensation for use or accidental loss\n* outstanding debts of the partnership are discharged, or sufficient assets are set aside for later discharge\n* from the remaining assets, A's capital contributions are returned. This includes both monetary and non\\-monetary contributions, but not services performed by A.\n* if there is a surplus/profit, it is divided among the members. However, the correct division can be difficult to determine since it shall depend on the member's share/contribution to the profit, not necessarily on their capital contributions to the partnership.\n* similarly, if there is a deficit, everyone has to make further contributions to the degree that they are responsible for those losses\n\nSo this means that yes, for all practical purposes the partners B and C can \u201cbuy out\u201d A, if A voluntarily terminates the contract. B and C would have to pay to A either according to the terms set out in the contract, or by default:\n\n* A's capital contributions to the partnership\n* plus/minus the profit/losses for which A is responsible\n\nSince you mention that the founder's agreement describes an allocation of \u201cequity\u201d, this may help with the division of profits.\n\nBut starting with a non\\-notarized partnership and presumably shoddy bookkeeping, trying to reconstruct all contributions and everyone's share of the profit/losses is going to be an utter mess \u2013 the typical divorce is probably easier to sort out. If there are non\\-negligible sums involved, everyone (and especially A) should get a lawyer to represent them in the ensuing negotiations. Nothing prevents the partners from reaching an unanimous agreement, but everyone would still be interested in getting this agreement negotiated by legal professionals to make sure that no future demands remain. Legal professionals are costly, but if this startup idea works out these DIY contracts will end up being far more costly.\n\nFurther potential factors that might complicate things:\n\n* depending on the goals or the structure of the partnership, different rules might apply. In particular, this might be the case if the goal of the partnership was trade.\n* Some of the non\\-monetary assets that would return to A might be essential for the continuation of the partnership by B and C. This would give A substantial leverage during negotiations, unless there are already contractual provisions for continued use. For example, the comments point out issues around intellectual property.\n* A is not required to exit the partnership. B and C can exclude A from the partnership only with cause, and only if the partnership will continue to exist when one member leaves. Of course, B and C have the same termination rights as A, so they could terminate the partnership and start a new partnership. However, termination of a partnership may be impossible if the partnership was established with a fixed/minimum duration.",

According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the process of A's exit?\n\nA) A can be forced to leave the partnership by B and C at any time, as long as they compensate A for their equity.\n\nB) If A voluntarily terminates the contract, B and C must pay A according to the terms in the contract or, by default, A's capital contributions plus/minus profits/losses for which A is responsible.\n\nC) A's exit automatically dissolves the partnership, requiring B and C to form a new legal entity to continue their business.\n\nD) The buyout process for A's share must be overseen by a notary public to be legally valid.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, if partner A voluntarily terminates the contract, partners B and C can \"buy out\" A. They would need to pay A either according to the terms set out in their original contract, or by default, A's capital contributions to the partnership plus/minus the profit/losses for which A is responsible. This aligns with option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because B and C cannot force A to leave without cause. Option C is incorrect because the partnership doesn't necessarily dissolve if one partner leaves; it can continue with the remaining partners if the contract allows. Option D is incorrect because the documentation states that notarization is not required for this type of agreement, though professional legal advice is recommended for complex situations."

But I gather that the last bullet encompasses the sense of your question *whether the calculation of overtime depends on the sequence of schedules*. The answer is no.\n\nThe language in (iii) has no indication that the 11\\-hour schedule needs to precede the 9\\-hour schedule even if it is written in that order. Notice how (iii) is in terms of \"*any **other** day*\" instead of \"*a **later** date*\". The term \"*other*\" is more flexible or wider encompassing \\-\\-in terms of chronology\\-\\- than a term such as \"*later*\".\n\nThus, as an example, suppose an employee worked three days giving a total of 27 hours in a week. Clearly he did not exceed 38 hours (also assume for simplicity that (ii) and the clause on \"roster cycle\" are inapplicable). If the employee's schedules were 10, 10, and 7 hours, he gets no overtime because he never exceeded 11 hours.\n\nBy contrast, if the employee's schedules were 12, 2, and 13 hours, respectively, then gets (13\\-11\\) \\+ (12\\-9\\) \\= (13\\-9\\) \\+ (12\\-11\\) \\= 5 hours at overtime rate. The language in (iii) allows for subtracting 11 and 9 hours from either of the 13\\- and 12\\-hour schedules interchangeably (also notice that the 2\\-hour schedule plays no role in the calculation).",

We identify the day with more than 11 hours worked (in this case, Tuesday with 13 hours).\n2. For that day, we calculate overtime as hours worked beyond 11 (13 - 11 = 2 hours).\n3. For all other days, we calculate overtime as hours worked beyond 9.\n\nSo the calculation would be:\nMonday: 12 - 9 = 3 hours\nTuesday: 13 - 11 = 2 hours (this is the \"11-hour day\")\nWednesday: 10 - 9 = 1 hour\nThursday: 10 - 9 = 1 hour\nFriday, Saturday, Sunday: No overtime (didn't exceed 9 hours)\n\nTotal overtime: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 hours\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the explanation provided in the documentation, which states that the sequence of schedules doesn't matter, and that the 11-hour and 9-hour thresholds can be applied interchangeably to the longest shifts."

Are there prior lawsuits related to this? I'm mostly interested in the particular case where the copy is not reproduced, but kept private.\n\n---\n\nI've recently learned that this is indeed the case. This came as a huge surprise to me since:\n\n1. \\[First of all] most browsers retain a copy of the HTML (for the period of the visit or much longer, if caching is enabled)\n2. Proxy servers often keep cached copies of these files\n3. Web archives (like Google's) not only copy all assets of a site it find to keep historical versions of these pages but also make available to the general public these historical copies.\n4. Programs that scrape external sites often have in their repositories copies of (likely copyrighted) HTML for testing purposes\n\nNumber (4\\) is the one that directly affects the company I work for, since we do web analysis and therefore write programs that visit other sites. For example, we make extensive use of [vcrpy](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) library to record external accesses and test our code against these \"frozen\" HTMLs.\n\nAlso, specifically in our case, we don't really copy the entirety of any site, since we are only concerned with a subset of its pages, but from what I've been informed, that doesn't seem to qualify as \"fair use\", such as quoting a passage of a book (where, in a sense, the book would be analogous to the entire site with all its public assets). We don't even copy assets like CSS files or images, so we can't reproduce the actual content in full.\n\nAfter I was told that such copies are likely unlawful, we are not only being limited to explore more robust testing methodologies (which would likely make use of a large amount of HTML copied from the web in a local storage) but the current use of vcrpy library has become something that demanded analysis (as it's not clear if our use of it is unlawful).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *You are clearly seeking legal advice. Answers on this site come from anonymous people on the internet and are not legal advice. You should not act based on information from this site.*\n\nI am unaware of any lawsuit where one would be sued for merely storing and reading HTML for personal use. \n\n**Downloading a webpage is probably not a copyright violation.** Most things you create, including HTML source code, are protected by copyright and copyright includes the exclusive right to choose who can read what you created. I couldn't find any actual reference to this but I would hazard a guess that displaying an HTML webpage online is implicitly allowing others to read that code. I believe this guess is correct because all modern web browsers have the capability to view source that nobody considers illegal and browsers also include the capability to save webpages to disk. These browsers are made by companies with large legal departments, I doubt Internet Explorer would include this function if using it was a copyright violation.\n\n*Here begins speculation:*\n\nHowever, your expanded question says that not only you wish to read the HTML code but you also wish to process it, extract information from it and use what you learn this way. This could, I think, be prevented by the copyright holder. Still, what you are describing is commonly done in the world. Services such as Google, Bing or the Wayback Machine go far beyond what you are doing. In theory, I can see this as being a copyright violation but again, the fact that these big companies \\- without any kind of contract with the website owners \\- keep doing it is *big* evidence in favor of legality of storing webpages.\n\n**You should be careful about how you use the stored data, though.** For example, computer programs often have a stipulation in EULA that prevents you from reverse engineering the code. I could see that the use of some websites could be protected in such manner.\n\nFurther (not authoritative) internet pages on this topic:\n\n* <https://stackoverflow.com/q/22819287/1580088>\n* [https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid\\=20120621055815AAvJPvN](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120621055815AAvJPvN)",

While copyright laws protect HTML code, the act of displaying a webpage online could be seen as implicit permission to read and temporarily store that code. Major tech companies engage in similar practices (e.g., caching, web archiving) without facing legal challenges. However, the use of stored data could potentially be restricted by terms of service or other agreements. The lack of lawsuits against individuals for personal storage and the prevalence of \"view source\" functions in browsers further support this interpretation.

This means the federal law would take precedence over both state laws where they contradict.\n\n2. New laws trump old laws.

I went there tonight expecting to pay for most of my meal with the gift card, but was told that they aren't currently accepting gift cards.\n\nI know and have read about a variety of laws relating to expiration of gift cards, but haven't found anything about who is or isn't required to honor them. \nDo you know of any laws that would apply in this situation? I'm in Lincoln, NE.\n\nThe manager said that if I had gone to the downtown location that I could have used the gift card.

The statement\n>  may appear on the front or back of the gift certificate or gift card\n>  in a location where it is visible to a purchaser prior to the\n>  purchase.\n\nSo the expiration date must be printed on the gift card. If there is no expiration date, you can reasonably argue with the restaurant that the card hasn't expired, but that is not stipulated in the law; it's simply something to argue with the restaurant.\n\nFor \\#2, this depends on the terms and conditions of the gift card. Is this location limitation printed on the card? Is it posted in the restaurant? If there are no written or visible limits on the location of usage, you can reasonably argue that the card should be used in any location because that limitation was not expressed in the beginning.\n\nIf there is no expiration date and no terms regarding the use at different locations, it sounds like the ramifications of giving gift cards wasn't clearly thought out by the restaurant.\n\nYou can argue with them; give them a bad review on Yelp; or take them to small claims court.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Lincoln, NE, Sarah received a gift card for a local restaurant a year ago. The restaurant recently opened a new location closer to her house. When Sarah tried to use the gift card at the new location, she was told they weren't accepting gift cards there. According to Nebraska law and general gift card practices, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The gift card is automatically invalid after one year, regardless of whether an expiration date is printed on it.\nB) The restaurant is legally obligated to accept the gift card at all locations, regardless of any terms and conditions.\nC) If there's no expiration date printed on the gift card, Sarah can argue that it's still valid, but the restaurant isn't legally required to accept it at the new location unless specified.\nD) Nebraska law requires all gift cards to be accepted at any location of the same business, regardless of what's printed on the card.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Nebraska Legislature Revised Statute 69-1305.03, gift cards must have expiration dates clearly printed on them if they are subject to expiration. If there's no expiration date on the card, Sarah can reasonably argue that it hasn't expired. However, the law doesn't stipulate that a card without a printed expiration date never expires.\n\nRegarding usage at different locations, this depends on the terms and conditions of the gift card. If there are no written or visible limits on the location of usage, Sarah can argue that the card should be usable at any location, but this isn't explicitly required by law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't automatically invalidate gift cards after one year. Option B is incorrect because the restaurant's obligation depends on the terms of the gift card. Option D is incorrect because Nebraska law doesn't explicitly require acceptance at all locations of the same business."

He left saying: \u201cI have no idea what happened\u201d. Next day, another guy \\- \u201csomeone\u201d just to quote what the landlord said \\- came over, left with the same result. Nothing happened for 8 days, and then, at 3rd of September another investigator came, who also left with: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nHe's just asking for the property management company, and... they repaired the lift in 2 months, so not much hopes.\n\nAs I\u2019ve read, in the UK law, the landlord must carry out repairs in a reasonable period of time. Not too sure if carry out means completing the works, or just starting the process, but if he chooses the cheapest slowest workers, it may end up even one year, and I\u2019ll have to live in a hotel for that long just because the landlord says: \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any delay on my side\u201d.\n\nSo when can I sue the landlord for disrepair \\- not fixing the problems in time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Pretty much any time a contractual, statutory or case law precedent uses the word \"reasonable\" what it means is that the decision regarding what is and is not reasonable is vested in the trier of fact (i.e. the judge in a U.K. landlord\\-tenant case) to decide on a case by case basis in light of all of the facts and circumstances presented at trial, rather something to be decided as a matter of law by an appellate court absent of extreme abuse of discretion by the judge in determining what is reasonable.\n\nPut yourself in the judge's shoes and consider the range of opinion that people who are judges in a case like this might have, and you have your answer.\n\nA reasonable amount of time balances out factors like the availability of repair contractors at a reasonable price, the magnitude of the repair, and the extent to which the repair impairs the habitability of the premises, and assumes a time frame that would apply if the landlord is diligent and trying to solve the problem in good faith. A reasonable time to fix a broken heating element is different in July than in January.\n\nIf three different inspectors failed to determine the cause of the problem, that is going to work in favor of the landlord for a longer period of time. So will the significant extent of the damage (apparently). On the other hand, the fact that the repair rendered the premises completely uninhabitable argues for a shorter time period.\n\nStarting late to address an urgent problem could be breach, although it doesn't sound like this has happened here if some action has been taken that would seem to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results have been inconclusive about what to do. Unnecessary foot dragging could also be a fact in reasonableness, because ultimately the duty is to get the job done.\n\nThere may also be a parallel duty of the landlord to provide a habitable premises and to compensate you for time when this is not provided, in addition to the duty to repair within a reasonable time. Asking to be paid for alternative accommodations while diagnosis and repairs are underway would be a logical demand to make before suing for a fairly small dollar amount in an ongoing lease.\n\nYou would probably focus on failure to repair in a reasonable time more if you seek to terminate the lease entirely and rent elsewhere instead in the face of repair delays, hoping to avoid the duty to pay rent for the remainder of the lease term due to the landlord's breach of the duty to repair under the lease.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in the UK is facing a serious water leak in their rented property, causing them to move out due to safety concerns. The landlord has made attempts to diagnose the issue but has not yet fixed it after 8 days. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's legal options?\n\nA) The tenant can immediately sue the landlord for breach of contract, as 8 days is always considered an unreasonable time for repairs.\n\nB) The tenant has no legal recourse until at least 30 days have passed without the issue being resolved.\n\nC) The tenant should consider requesting compensation for alternative accommodation before pursuing legal action, as the concept of \"reasonable time\" for repairs is subjective and determined case-by-case.\n\nD) The tenant can only take legal action if they can prove the landlord has not made any attempts to address the issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that \"reasonable time\" for repairs is subjective and determined on a case-by-case basis by a judge. The answer suggests a practical approach of requesting compensation for alternative accommodation before pursuing legal action, which aligns with the advice given in the documentation. It also acknowledges the subjectivity of what constitutes a \"reasonable time,\" taking into account factors such as the severity of the issue, the landlord's efforts, and the impact on habitability. Options A and B provide arbitrary timeframes that are not supported by the given information, while option D incorrectly suggests that legal action is only possible if the landlord has made no attempts to address the issue, which contradicts the nuanced approach described in the documentation."

According to the documentation, minors can enter into contracts, but these contracts are generally voidable by the minor. This means the minor can enforce the contract against the other party, but the other party cannot enforce it against the minor if the minor chooses to void it. In this case, the NDA would be valid, but the 16-year-old inventor would have the option to void it if they choose. This actually works in the minor's favor, as they can maintain the protections of the NDA while having the option to cancel it if needed. Options A and B are incorrect because minors can enter contracts, and parental co-signing doesn't change the voidable nature of the contract. Option D is incorrect because such a clause wouldn't affect the fundamental legal principle regarding minors and contracts."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of John's actions?\n\nA) John has violated Sarah's privacy rights and can be successfully sued for damages.\nB) John's actions are illegal because he did not obtain Sarah's consent before uploading the video.\nC) John's actions are likely legal, as Sarah had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public park.\nD) John can only be sued if he monetized the video on YouTube.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because in public spaces, individuals generally do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Sarah was in a public park, and her actions were visible to anyone present. John had the right to record what was happening in public and owns the recording. He can generally use it as he sees fit, including uploading it to YouTube.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Sarah's privacy rights were not violated in a public space.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because consent is not required for recording or sharing videos of public behavior.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because monetization is not a factor in determining the legality of sharing such a video.\n\nIt's important to note that while John's actions are likely legal, there could be other considerations such as platform policies or potential defamation claims if the video were misrepresented. However, based on the information provided, John's actions appear to be within his rights."

Which of the following approaches would best satisfy FTC guidelines regarding endorsements and advertising disclosures?\n\nA) The blogger should only describe the features of Company X's smartphone without expressing personal opinions about its quality or performance.\n\nB) The blogger can write a positive review praising the smartphone's features, as long as they genuinely believe what they're writing.\n\nC) The blogger should clearly disclose their financial relationship with Company X at the beginning of the review and provide an honest, unbiased assessment of the smartphone.\n\nD) The blogger can write the review without disclosing the payment from Company X, as long as they include both positive and negative aspects of the smartphone.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to FTC guidelines, the key elements here are disclosure and honesty. Option C best satisfies these requirements by:\n\n1. Clearly disclosing the financial relationship between the blogger and Company X, which is crucial for readers to evaluate the credibility of the review.\n2. Providing an honest and unbiased assessment, which aligns with the FTC's requirement that endorsements must reflect the honest opinion of the endorser.\n\nOption A is overly restrictive and doesn't address the disclosure requirement.

Purposes (1\\) and (2\\) are known as *injunctive relief* and *declaratory relief*, respectively.\n\nInjunctive relief is arguably more drastic and is intended for situations where *irreparable loss* is imminent or very likely. A respondent's conduct can be of such nature that no award in court could suffice to compensate for the loss caused by that respondent (i.e., the person responsible for the loss); or, if the award compensates at all, the losses would have been exacerbated by the time the correct ruling is made. Personal Protection Orders (example: [this one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R6ttMLiOesuzUME3F6A_rl_UVJETB75p)) are one example of *injunctive relief*.\n\nBy contrast, *declaratory relief* does not strictly require the cessation of an act. Instead, it only determines *beforehand* or ex\\-ante the party who would be liable/entitled and the extent of that party's liability/entitlement.\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary defines \"Responsible\" as the entity \"*\\[a]ble to pay a sum for which he is **or may become** liable*\" (emphasis added). Thus, the concept of *responsibility* is wider encompassing than the term \"*liability*\".",

In common law systems, allowing individuals to seek the cessation of an illegal act even if they haven't suffered damages serves the important purpose of preventing potential damages from materializing. This is known as injunctive relief and is particularly useful in situations where irreparable loss is imminent or very likely.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the primary purpose is not punishment, but prevention.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the intent is not to create more work for the legal system, but to provide a mechanism for preventing harm.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the legal system is not designed to encourage vigilantism, but rather to provide legitimate means of addressing potential harms through proper legal channels.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the distinction between responsibility and liability in common law, and the importance of preventive legal measures like injunctive relief."

Back to current, he is asking me to take the game down. I don't want to as it would require redeveloping the entire thing, losing it's fan base in the process. My argument is that he agreed for me to develop the game around him and has no right to demand it be taken down, especially after being fine with it for years.\n\nWhere do I stand legally? Do I have to take it down?\n\nEdit: This issue has been resolved. He complained through our school who threatened me with suspension if I failed to remove it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such protection is widespread in the US, falling under the rubric \"right of publicity\", but as [this article](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1368&context=elr) says, such protection is very limited in the UK. This assumes that you have permission of the copyright holder to distribute the picture (e.g. if you took the picture). One basis for preventing you from using the image would be if you were \"passing off\" the use of the image as an endorsement. Supposing that you took a picture of Graham Norton, you could not then sell a line of Graham Norton goods that implied an endorsement of your goods. However, this cause of action is about how you may have damaged a celebrity plaintiff's revenue stream, and can be easily overcome by saying \"using the picture does not imply endorsement\". Another theoretical line of attack for a plaintiff would be defamation, e.g. if the product implies that the subject is a murderer.\n\nThere might be applicable EU laws based on the Human Rights Bill, but from what I can tell that limitation is on how a government can exploit you.

Two years later, the friend demands the game be taken down. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation in the UK?\n\nA) The friend has an absolute right to revoke consent and demand the game's removal under UK right of publicity laws.\n\nB) The game developer must remove the game to avoid potential defamation claims, regardless of the initial consent.\n\nC) The game can likely continue as long as it doesn't imply endorsement or damage the friend's revenue stream, given the limited nature of image rights protection in the UK.\n\nD) EU laws based on the Human Rights Bill provide strong protection for the friend, requiring the game's immediate removal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the UK, protection for an individual's image or likeness (often called \"right of publicity\" in other jurisdictions) is quite limited. The game developer likely has a strong position to continue using the image, especially given the initial consent. The main legal concerns would be if the game implied endorsement (which could be addressed with a disclaimer) or if it somehow damaged the friend's revenue stream. Defamation would only be an issue if the game portrayed the friend in a false and damaging light. EU human rights laws primarily restrict government actions, not private disputes like this. Therefore, as long as the game doesn't imply endorsement or cause economic harm, the developer probably has the right to continue using the image in the UK legal context."

This law requires a condo without our income level to be audited by a third party, which our property manager has not done. Additionally, we have not voted to waive this requirement.\n\nThe law gives me the power to sue, but I would bear 1/7th the costs paid to me because of my portion of ownership. Additionally, I do not want to hurt my relationship with 6 neighbors (one of which is the property manager).

However, I cannot determine if the word \"convenience\" means that I should be able to review documents on a Saturday or if the convenience is the property manager's own convenience.

This interpretation balances the rights of the co-owner to access information with the practical needs of the property manager. Option A is too restrictive and doesn't consider the co-owner's schedule, while B ignores the property manager's convenience. Option D could be disruptive and doesn't account for the property manager's need to prepare or schedule the review.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I rent a \\~50 year old terraced house in the UK, and had some plumbing work done recently. The plumber said the stopcock doesn't work, and so had to freeze the pipes to get the work done. This makes me nervous both for my own things and the insurance in case an accident should result in an unhindered flow of water. Is this something the owner is obliged to fix?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your problem is not just that you don't have a working stopcock, but that you now know that you don't have one. Of course it's not illegal by itself, the problem is what is going to happen if you have an insurance case. \n\nYour home insurance most likely has to pay for accidental damage. But any damage that would be caused by not being able to close the stopcock, when you knew it wasn't working, they could claim that this is due to gross negligence. \n\nWhether they would succeed with that claim or not, I don't know, but fixing the stopcock seems to be a much, much cheaper solution. \n\nPS. Seems I made a wrong assumption here \\- that it was *your* home, owned by you. The same reasons that would have made it a good idea for you to fix the stopcock obviously make it a good idea for the landlord as well. So I would make sure that you tell the landlord as soon as possible. If something goes wrong, and the insurance doesn't pay, your landlord would be responsible for the damage. \n\nWhether it's *legal* to not fix the stopcock \\- that's a different matter. I thought you were the owner. You would have endangered yourself and your property. Nothing illegal with that. But with the landlord it's different; he wouldn't be endangering himself but someone else's property.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in the UK discovers that the stopcock in their rented property doesn't work. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's legal obligations and potential consequences?\n\nA) The landlord has no legal obligation to fix the stopcock, as it's not explicitly illegal to have a non-functioning stopcock.\n\nB) The landlord must fix the stopcock immediately, or they will be breaking UK housing laws.\n\nC) The landlord should be informed promptly, as failing to fix the stopcock could potentially lead to liability for damages in case of a water-related incident.\n\nD) The tenant is responsible for fixing the stopcock and may be held liable for any resulting water damage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While it's not explicitly illegal to have a non-functioning stopcock, the landlord should be informed promptly about the issue. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The landlord has a responsibility to maintain the property in a safe condition.\n2. A non-functioning stopcock poses a risk to the property and tenant's belongings.\n3. If water damage occurs and the landlord knew about the faulty stopcock but didn't fix it, they could be held liable for negligence.\n4. Insurance companies might not cover damages if they can prove gross negligence due to a known, unfixed issue.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while it's not illegal, it doesn't address the potential consequences. Answer B is too extreme, as there's no immediate legal requirement to fix it. Answer D is incorrect because maintenance of major plumbing fixtures is typically the landlord's responsibility, not the tenant's."

By not disclosing the modifications made to the smartphone when attempting to return it, Person A has committed fraud. Even if not explicitly asked, there is an implied assumption that the product being returned is in its original condition or that any alterations have been disclosed. Withholding this information prevents the seller from making an informed decision about the return and potentially leads to financial loss for the seller, as they may not be able to resell or refurbish the modified device. This omission of crucial information constitutes fraud, as it induces the seller to accept a return under false pretenses."

Is this normal or should I be concerned?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is this normal or should I be concerned?\n\nAvoid signing contracts with that type of clauses.\n\nClauses regarding legal fees usually are enforceable and can include attorney fees even if not stated explicitly. See [*Lindenhurst Realty Co. LLC v. Modern Air Strike Inc.*, 2014 NY Slip Op 33385(U)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/innyco20150108276):\n\n> Although a promise to pay \"legal costs\" has been held to be\n> insufficient to impose a duty to pay another party's attorney's fees\n> \\[...], a promise to pay \"legal fees\" in the context of an entire\n> agreement, has been held to be sufficiently clear and unmistakable to\n> impose that burden\n\n(citing cases).\n\nUltimately you need to (1\\) ascertain from the literal terms of the lease whether legal fees are meant to include attorney fees, and (2\\) see how case law from your \\[unspecified] jurisdiction compares to [*Air Turbine Technology v. Quarles \\& Brady*, 165 So.3d 816 (2015\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inflco20150603119):\n\n> Under Florida law, the term \\`costs' is not generally construed to\n> include attorney's fees absent an express contractual provision that\n> defines expenses to include fees.\n\nAttorney fees can be very costly regardless of whether the clause is in terms of \"reasonable\" rather than actual expenses. [*Gresham v. Meadow Ridge Cincinnati Assoc.*, Ohio CoA (Jul. 5, 2020\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inohco20220705527) shows how attorney fees tend to be disproportionate: The ruling awarded the reimbursement of tenant's deposit ($395\\), statutory damages of $300, and $5,695 in attorney fees.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) This clause is standard in all lease agreements and should not be a cause for concern.\nB) The tenant should refuse to sign the lease, as such clauses are always unenforceable.\nC) The tenant should carefully consider the implications and potentially negotiate this clause, as it could lead to significant financial liability.\nD) The clause is only enforceable if it explicitly mentions \"attorney fees\" rather than just \"legal fees\".\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate response. The documentation advises caution when encountering such clauses, stating \"Avoid signing contracts with that type of clauses.\" It also indicates that these clauses are often enforceable and can include attorney fees even if not explicitly stated. The potential financial impact could be significant, as demonstrated by the Gresham v. Meadow Ridge Cincinnati Assoc. case, where attorney fees far exceeded the initial dispute amount. Therefore, careful consideration and possibly negotiation of this clause would be the most prudent course of action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation does not suggest this is standard or should be accepted without concern. Option B is wrong because the clause is often enforceable, not always unenforceable. Option D is inaccurate because the documentation states that \"legal fees\" in the context of an entire agreement has been held to include attorney fees, even without explicit mention."

This legal concept applies when an employer creates working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign. In this case, the contractor's actions in issuing a \"quit-ticket\" instead of a lay-off, despite the worker's request and personal circumstances, could be seen as forcing the worker into a situation where they appear to have quit, potentially breaching their union contract.

The current law does not prevent a polygamist or someone who practiced polygamy in the past or expresses a belief in polygamy from being eligible for an immigrant visa. But aliens coming to the United States to practice polygamy are barred.\n\nBefore 1990, there was a law on the books by which someone who merely \"advocated the practice of polygamy\" could have been barred.\n\nThis question has been answered on Quora [for the U.S.](https://www.quora.com/If-a-polygamist-from-Saudi-Arabia-immigrates-to-the-U-S-what-is-the-legal-status-of-his-wives), again [for the U.S.](https://www.quora.com/How-do-the-US-and-EU-governments-deal-legally-with-Muslims-who-immigrate-and-have-more-than-one-wife) (where the question asked about \"US and EU\"), and [for Canada](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-when-a-man-with-multiple-wives-visits-or-relocates-to-a-country-where-polygamy-is-illegal-or-not-recognized).

However, determining who is the \"real\" wife, if any of them, would depend on the facts of the case, the specific laws of the target jurisdiction, and the purpose of the determination. It could very well be that every one of the other marriages would void a new marriage in the destination country and entitle the children to child support, but none of them would entitle the wife to a spouse's visa or the father to visitation rights after a purported divorce.\n\nSee also this [answer](https://www.quora.com/If-a-man-is-legally-married-in-one-country-what-would-prevent-him-from-practicing-bigamy-if-he-comes-to-the-U-S-and-marries-a-woman-here-assuming-his-first-wife-lives-in-the-other-country/answer/Annika-Schauer) about whether it's possible for a married immigrant to commit bigamy by entering the United States pretending to be unmarried. Sure there are people who try, and it's more likely to succeed with the cooperation of the foreign spouse(s), but it's against the law and can be grounds for deportation, imprisonment, annulment of the second marriage, or exclusion of any polyspouse who is outside the country.",

        "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A man with three wives from a country where polygamy is legal wants to immigrate to France. Under French law, which of the following is most likely to be true regarding his marital status?\n\nA) All three marriages will be recognized as valid in France\nB) Only the first marriage chronologically will be recognized, and the other two wives will have no legal status\nC) The man can choose which of the three wives to designate as his legal spouse in France\nD) None of the marriages will be recognized, and the man will be considered legally single in France\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: France, like most Western countries, does not recognize polygamous marriages. In such cases, typically only the first marriage that was entered into is considered legally valid. The other marriages would not be recognized under French law. This aligns with the general principle described in the passage that when polygamous families immigrate to countries where polygamy is illegal, usually only two people can enter as a couple, while others are considered legally separate. The first chronological marriage is often given precedence in determining legal status. Options A and C are incorrect as they would imply recognition of polygamy. Option D is unlikely, as completely invalidating all marriages would be an extreme measure not typically taken by countries dealing with this issue."

Ortega*, [24 U.S. (11 Wheat) 467](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep024/usrep024467/usrep024467.pdf) (1826\\). That case was a prosecution of a person who \"offered violence\" against the [*charg\u00e9 d'affaires*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charg%C3%A9_d%27affaires) of the King of Spain in the United States. Despite the *charg\u00e9 d'affaires* being such a \"public minister\" contemplated by Article III, Section 2, Clause 2, the case did not \"affect\" him.\n\n> It is a case, then, which affects the United States, and the individual whom they seek to punish; but one in which the minister himself, although he was the person injured by the assault, has no concern, either in the event of the prosecution, or in the costs attending it.\n\nThe Supreme Court has *not* explicitly ruled that the person affected must be a party in order for Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 to apply, but Congress has acted as if *Ortega* implied this. When Congress passed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251, the purpose was to indicate that the jurisdiction described in Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 would no longer be exclusive. Congress used the word \"parties\" and that has not been found to be less inclusive than what is covered by Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 (but simply because the case that would tease out the distinction has not arisen).\n\nPerhaps there is some circumstance where the property interest of a non\\-party ambassador might be affected such that the Supreme Court would have original jurisdiction, but 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b)(1\\) would not operate to give concurrent jurisdiction to other courts.",

While the Supreme Court in United States v.

And in the current health crisis, the school board and health authorities can order things for the protection of others and this can be enough justification to exclude individuals or several people from groups. After all, being teste or not is clearly not a protected class under the Civil Rights Act, and neither is easily regarded as a form of first amendment speech \\- unlike a black armband (*Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community*). Being untested is much more akin to being a person on a ship and then attempting to disembark in a quarantine zone \\- which was decided in *Compagnie Francaise \\& Lousiana Board of Health* (there are two of those btw). The [majority opinion in the SCOTUS case](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/186/380) (1902\\) writes (emphasis mine):\n\n> 24 True it is that, in some of the cases relied on in the argument, it was held that a state law absolutely prohibiting the introduction, under all circumstances, of objects actually affected with \\[a contagious] disease, was valid because such objects were not legitimate commerce. But this implies **no limitation on the power to regulate by health laws** the subjects of legitimate commerce.\n> \n> \n> 34 \\[A]ssuming that all the treaties relied on are applicable, we think it clearly results from their context that they were not intended to, and did not, deprive the government of the United States of those **powers necessarily inhering in it and essential to the health and safety of its people.**\n\nUsing a similar vein as in *Compagnie Francaise*, the public health interest might be enough for even a public school to only allow presence in the building with a test and otherwise demand online or remote learning (which isn't always an option) or even just suspend people that are not tested until such a time their presence is deemed safe.\n\nA private school is vastly more free in rulemaking, and as even a public school can muster strict scrutiny regarding presence teaching, a private school surely will get away with it. But nothing can force a private school to suspend teaching, switching to online classes or demand to test, unless they like to or their accreditation hinges on it \\- and here religious schools come in: There are religious groups that to an extent of not allowing medical procedures on their members, including COVID\\-testing. Those schools could ban people from attending that are tested.\n\n---\n\nEndnote\n-------\n\nPublic Health Interest is a hammer that can be rather heavy. It can't be used to discriminate against HIV, as that doesn't spread from touch and sneeze, but it can be used to ban people from buildings that have Communicable Diseases. While nobody classed COVID 19 as such yet, *having* such an illness \\[Plague, Cholera, Botulism, and others] allows the government to isolate you under strict scrutiny or even has been used to quarantine whole areas in the past (see the *Compagnie Francaise* case). And as you see in the current pandemic, legislative bodies globally do dish out rules for schools and public places in short order, some of which include testing strategies, and ways to overwrite consent via a state order. Some are struck down: some of them on procedural grounds (e.g. wrong body), others on grounds of equality (e.g. religious bias).",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this policy?\n\nA) The policy is illegal because the CDC states it is unethical and illegal to test someone who does not want to be tested.\n\nB) The policy is legal because private schools have complete freedom in their rulemaking and can implement any health-related policies they choose.\n\nC) The policy is illegal because it violates students' religious freedoms protected by the First Amendment.\n\nD) The policy may be legal, but the school could face challenges if it conflicts with the religious beliefs of some students or families who object to medical testing.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While private schools generally have more freedom in their policies than public schools, they still need to consider potential conflicts with religious beliefs. The CDC's statement about testing being illegal likely refers to forced testing, not making it a condition of attendance. Private schools can implement health policies, but religious schools in particular need to be mindful of potential conflicts with the beliefs of their students and families. Some religious groups object to certain medical procedures, including testing, so the school could face challenges if their policy conflicts with these beliefs. This makes option D the most nuanced and accurate response to this complex situation."

According to the documentation, judges typically use the current fair market value (resale value in this case) of an asset at the time of divorce, which is $60,000 in this scenario. However, this value is subject to expert testimony from appraisers and may be influenced by potential tax implications if the asset were to be sold immediately after the divorce. The original purchase price, depreciated accounting value, and fair market value at purchase may be considered as evidence, but they are not the primary factors in determining the asset's value for division purposes.

But this would be a rather dangerous strategy, because if human laws don't apply to them, then by the same argumentation human rights might not apply to them either. If they insisted on being tried as an animal, then the court could very well reason that the best way to deal with a dangerous animal that can not be controlled and can not be kept away from humans is to euthanize it.",

Option B is incorrect because there's no evidence supporting the claim that a fan can be legally considered air conditioning in any jurisdiction. Option D is incorrect because Airbnb's claim is not legally binding and contradicts common definitions of air conditioning. The most accurate statement is C, as the customer may be entitled to damages to compensate for the lack of promised air conditioning, such as the cost of renting an air conditioner or booking alternative accommodations with proper cooling."

Apologies for length.\n\nTo make the situation as clear as possible, I've called the twins Draco and Harry.\n\nDraco meets Ginny and goes out on several dates but she won\u2019t have sex with him because she\u2019s not sure about him. He breaks a date (to screw another woman instead) and sends his identical twin, Harry, in his place. Ginny has such a good time with Harry that she tries to convince him to come back to her place for sex. Harry refuses because he's a good guy and she\u2019s Draco\u2019s girl.\n\nOn a future date, Ginny has consensual sex with Draco (because the dates with Harry were so wonderful). But Harry continues to step in whenever Draco breaks a date, because he\u2019s desperate to spend time with Ginny and has fallen in love with her. Eventually, Harry can\u2019t help himself, he has sex with Ginny.\n\nThe twins continue to share Ginny over a period of a year without her knowing they are two different men. Harry proposes and convinces Draco that he should attend the ceremony. Draco agrees because he\u2019s really just using Ginny for sex anyway.\n\nAfter three years of marriage, Draco thinks Ginny is getting suspicious, and coming between him and Harry. Draco resolves that Ginny has to go. Draco tries to shoot Ginny, but Harry steps in at the last minute and shoots Draco in the head, saving Ginny\u2019s life (and the life of her unborn child, and a police officer Draco has left for dead in the bathtub upstairs).\n\nHarry confesses their entire scam to the police. He only continued the scam because he was in love with Draco\u2019s girl, and didn\u2019t tell Ginny the truth because he was terrified of losing her. \n\n**He didn't create the deception specifically to gain consent.**\n\nEven though Ginny wants nothing to do with Harry anymore, she won\u2019t bring charges of rape. Harry's still her husband and the sex was always consensual. Also, she can\u2019t help herself, she still loves him.\n\nWhat arguments could a prosecutor bring forward to accuse Harry of rape?\n\nAnd what arguments against could a defence counsel present to prevent Harry being charged?\n\n---\n\nNotes: \n\nI've already done a lot of research on this. I'm aware of the law (in as much as a person with no legal experience can be).\n\nBut: \n\nI've spoken to a Metropolitan Police Officer who said that, while consent by deception is rape, the prosecutor would have a flimsy case in these circumstances. \n\nAnd I spoke to a lawyer who said, consent by deception is rape, there is no getting around it. Even without Ginny, the prosecutor would bring charges of rape. Whether a jury would deliver a guilty verdict is another matter.\n\nUnder s76 of the Sexual Offences Act 2006, it is possible to commit rape by gaining consent through deception. \n\nThe Riddle of Rape\\-by\\-Deception and the Myth of Sexual Autonomy says that \"rape by deception is almost universally rejected in American criminal law.\" But this is England.\n\nAnd Mr Justice Stephens said, \"the only sorts of fraud which so far destroy the effect of a woman's consent as to convert a connection consented to in fact into a rape are frauds as to the nature of the act itself, or as to the identity of the person who does the act. Consent in such cases does not exist at all because the act consented to is not the act done.\" And the identity of who Ginny gave consent to is in question.\n\n@ohwilleke posted a comment on a similar question saying, \"Consent obtained by deception is consent in every jurisdiction I have examined\"\n\n---\n\nWith conflicting advice, I'd be interested to know what arguments you might bring forward depending on whether you were prosecuting or defending Harry.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both Harry and Draco have raped Ginny\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe relevant provision is [s76](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/76) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003\\. It is conclusively presumed that there was no consent if \"the defendant intentionally induced the complainant to consent to the relevant act by impersonating a person known personally to the complainant.\"\n\nAt various times, both Harry and Draco did this.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of identical twins Harry and Draco deceiving Ginny, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications in England?\n\nA) Only Draco can be charged with rape, as he initiated the deception.\nB) Neither twin can be charged with rape because Ginny consented to sex each time.\nC) Both Harry and Draco can be charged with rape under s76 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.\nD) Only Harry can be charged with rape, as he continued the deception for a longer period.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to s76 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, it is conclusively presumed that there was no consent if \"the defendant intentionally induced the complainant to consent to the relevant act by impersonating a person known personally to the complainant.\" Both Harry and Draco engaged in this behavior at various times, impersonating each other to gain Ginny's consent for sexual acts. Therefore, both twins could potentially be charged with rape under this law, regardless of Ginny's willingness to press charges or her continued feelings for Harry. The fact that Harry didn't initially create the deception or that Draco initiated it does not exempt either of them from the legal consequences of their actions."
