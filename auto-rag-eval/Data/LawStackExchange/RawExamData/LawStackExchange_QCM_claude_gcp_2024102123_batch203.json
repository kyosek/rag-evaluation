I was asked if we had a way to track how many users have declined analytics in case we needed that information for an audit.\n\nWe are, of course, storing a strictly necessary cookie to remember a decline decision on the user's browser (client side only). However, wouldn't collecting server side analytics about a user declining analytics (even if anonymous) be an inherit violation of GDPR.\n\nThe more I think about this the more I'm getting a headache. Would a GDPR audit ever ask for this information or would we shoot ourselves in the foot by collecting this information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you could *count* decline\\-events, but not *track* users who declined tracking. But I also think such information isn't useful for demonstrating compliance. Therefore, you should avoid storing extra data about people who do not give consent.\n\nWhen consent is required for analytics.\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR provides a general framework for processing personal data. The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) overrides this general framework when it comes to cookies and similar technologies related to accessing information on the end user's device. Per ePD, such access is only allowed when it is strictly necessary to provide the service explicitly requested by a user, otherwise consent is required. Thus, analytics cookies require consent and setting an analytics\\-declined cookie is strictly necessary.\n\nBut this consent requirement relates specifically to storage cookies, not to collecting analytics data. Thus, you might have a legitimate interest in collecting data with cookie\\-less analytics, which could involve counting cookie\\-consent decline events. Unfortunately, most analytics systems collect very broad categories of data and cannot be limited to a necessary subset. Even such limited analytics (unless they are truly strictly necessary for operating the site) should support an opt\\-out. I don't think you could legitimately gather analytics about such opt\\-out events.\n\nGDPR audits.\n------------\n\nYour motivation for collecting statistics about consent\\-decline events is to be prepared for a GDPR audit. This is probably not necessary, but it depends.\n\nIt might be useful to distinguish between internal/voluntary audits and data protection audits by the supervisory authority.\n\n* You might voluntarily review your compliance to convince stakeholders that you're compliant, and such voluntary audits might be part of the *appropriate technical and organizational measures* a data controller has implemented in accordance with Art 24, Art 25, and Art 32 GDPR.\n\nYou should collect any statistics you need for this purpose, e.g. to ensure that the opt\\-in rate looks realistic. But since you can set the parameters of this audit, it makes no sense to collect data \u201cjust in case\u201d.\n* Under Art 58(1\\), your supervisory authority can audit your data processing and can compel you to provide any information it requires. This is similar to how a tax authority can compel you to produce business records for auditing purposes.\n\nThis is closely related with your general obligation to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR (Art 5(2\\)). More specifically, the controller is required per Art 7(1\\) to be able to demonstrate that the data subjects have given valid consent, but does not prescribe how to demonstrate this.\n\nHow to demonstrate that valid consent was given.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor demonstrating that consent was given, there are no clear best practices. However, this topic is briefly discussed in [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). They recommend that you retain records about the following:\n\n* that a data subject in a given case has consented\n* how consent was obtained\n* when consent was obtained\n* information provided to data subject at the time\n* that the controller's workflow meets all relevant criteria for valid consent\n\nSome of these are process\\-level concerns about how you ask for consent. For example, you might record video walkthroughs of your consent management solution to demonstrate how consent can be declined, given, and revoked. You should definitely keep a version history of the text and information that was displayed to users when they were asked for consent. I think you should also be able to explain in your front\\-end code how the result from your consent management solution is used to load relevant features (and that they aren't loaded before consent is given). If a feature or service is made conditional on consent, it might be good to have a short written analysis that consent is still freely given under the requirements of Art 7(4\\).\n\nBut other aspects relate to the individual data subject and the individual consent\\-giving event. Some consent management solutions send a small record about the consent to a backend server where it is stored with a timestamp, so that it can be later traced that and when consent was given. I've also seen consent management tools that show a timeline of events to the user (when consent was requested, and when consent for which purpose was given and revoked). I think such detailed insight into an pseudonymous individual's consent status is a very powerful way to demonstrate compliance.\n\nWhat is not relevant here is information about data subjects who declined consent in the first place. Consent means opt\\-in. The default is that no consent is given. To demonstrate that consent was obtained in a valid manner, information about data subjects who didn't consent isn't necessary or useful.\n\nSo I expect that you would be fine in an audit without collecting such data. In fact, the lack of a clear purpose and necessity for collecting this data could be argued to be without legal basis and violate the GDPR's data minimization principle. And even when recording information about those data subjects who did consent, the EDPB guidelines remind us that this \u201cshould not in itself lead to excessive amounts of additional data processing\u201d."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR guidelines, which of the following is NOT a recommended practice for demonstrating valid consent was obtained from data subjects?\n\nA) Retaining records of how consent was obtained for each data subject\nB) Keeping a version history of the information displayed when asking for consent\nC) Recording video walkthroughs of the consent management solution\nD) Collecting data on users who declined to give consent\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct as the EDPB guidelines recommend retaining records about how consent was obtained.\nB is correct as keeping a version history of information provided to users when asking for consent is recommended.\nC is a valid method to demonstrate how consent can be given, declined, and revoked.\nD is incorrect because collecting data on users who declined consent is not necessary or useful for demonstrating compliance.

Maintaining the assumption that one of the two people who saw the patient is a medical practitioner and signed the paperwork, then the question is whether purporting to be Dr. X and signing paperwork that results in the unlawful seizing of a person constitutes a breach of that professional duty of care. There is an article, \"Liability Risks for Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners\" (Elsevier paywall) which gives an overview of liability issues for psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners which points out the possibility of civil and criminal sanctions for a bad faith involuntary hospitalization action. [This](https://aonaffinity.blob.core.windows.net/affinitytemplate-prod/media/nso/images/documents/cna_cls_np_101917_cf_prod_sec.pdf) (free) article surveys some of the underlying legal issues, and summarizes the duty of care issue as asking whether the provider's care deviates from the accepted standard of care for such a provider. This then involves expert testimony regarding what that standard is. I very much doubt that it is \"standard care\" to violate state law w.r.t. emergency hospitalization.\n\nThe key distinction between medical negligence and medical malpractice is that malpractice involves an intent to go ahead despite the risk of injury.

They may require you to have some form of medical insurance and may require you to seek treatment under certain circumstances: depending on the nature of the incident that this is a response to (in particular, what kind of disruption may have arisen).\n\nA private school can require pretty much whatever it wants, as long as the act is generally legal (they cannot compel you to steal). They cannot unilaterally change the terms of their contract with you, but you'd have to do some digging to figure out what contract if any you have with them. \n\nIn either event, if they can legally expel you, they can impose conditions on what you have to do in order for them to *not* expel you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A college student with a history of mental health hospitalizations is presented with a contract by the Dean of Student Life.

For a public college, there needs to be a statutory basis for imposing such restrictions, as they are government agents with limited ability to restrict personal liberties. Private colleges have more leeway in setting conditions, but they cannot unilaterally change existing contractual agreements with students. In both cases, the college's ability to enforce such a contract is closely tied to their power to expel the student.

But from what I read online it seems that a processor is anyone that deals with any personal data, even partial data, as part of a service provided to the controller. So it sounds like *everyone* that deal with personal data as part of their job is a processor, except the end users of the service. But since processors must be bound by a specific contract to deal with the needs of the controller (article 28 says \"processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller), then I'm afraid it will soon become a huge mess with a gazillion contracts to sign.\n\nFor example, John Doe has a website with a contact form. The contact form collects data, and the end user should accept the privacy policy written by John Doe. John Doe is the controller. However, John Doe's website is managed by a web agency! Is this web agency a processor? I guess so. So John doe needs to write a contract and have the web agency sign it. If every website owner does this, the web agency will have to read and sign hundreds of contracts. But the web agency hosts the sites on a web hosting provider, which in turn becomes another processor! And they use Gmail, provided by Google, which in turn is yet another processor that will have to sign millions of contracts. And so on, in an potentially endless cycle, just thinking that if you read your work email from your iPhone you might have to send a contract to Apple too. \n\nIt seems a huge mess to me, but I'm not sure I get it right. It looks like everyone is a processor except the end user, but the confusing thing is that the the law seems to say that it's the controller the one who decides the contractual terms, so it's not just a matter of accepting a privacy policy like we have been doing so far. So far, Google has provided a service to you, and you agreed to their privacy policy. Now it seems it's you, if you are a controller or a processor, that have to come up with a contract and Google has to accept it (if they want to). Like it's the other way around compared to the usual privacy policies. Of course this will probably never happen, and Google will probably come up with predefined contracts that both parties can agree on, but at that point what difference would there be between the contract required by GDPR and the usual privacy policies everyone has been using so far?\n\nI hope the question is clear enough. I'm basically very confused about the actual role and duties of processors in real\\-world scenarios.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You premise is correct.

Yes, the GDPR says that a contract between the controller and processor must exist, but [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the GDPR does not say anything about *how* the controller shall document these instructions. Basically, in cases like the one you describe where John Doe relies on a web agency for having a contact form on the web, there will be a standardized (by the web agency) service agreement between the John Doe (controller) and the web agency (processor). There is nothing stopping the parties from agreeing that this service agreement that John Doe accepted as part of the onboarding procedure is *also* the DPA as required by the GDPR.\n\nPutting something like the following in the service agreement would do it:\n\n> The parties agree that this Service Agreement between You (controller) and Us (processor) set out Your *complete and final instructions* to Us in relation to the processing of Personal Data and that processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between You and Us. You also agree that We may engage Sub\\-processors to process Personal Data on Your behalf. The Sub\\-processors currently engaged by Us and authorized by You are listed in Annex A.\n\nI think we will se a lot of amendments in service contracts as the GDPR gets better understood, but I don't really see a flood of DPAs in *addition* to these amended service contracts."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the GDPR, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the relationship between controllers and processors?\n\nA) Controllers must draft and sign individual contracts with each processor, no matter how many there are.\n\nB) Processors can only be large tech companies like Google or Apple that handle significant amounts of data.\n\nC) Existing service agreements can be amended to include GDPR-compliant processor instructions, avoiding the need for separate contracts.\n\nD) End users of a service are considered processors and must sign contracts with the controller.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Nationality law is codified at [8 USC 1401 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III), with the sections governing loss of nationality beginning at [8 USC 1481](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-III). The regulations concerning nationality generally are found at [8 CFR 301 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/chapter-I/subchapter-C), but there are not many regulations concerning loss of nationality.\n\nPassport law is found in an entirely different title of the US Code, and titles are the highest level of division in the code. It is in [22 USC 411 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-4). There are provisions that restrict eligibility for a passport scattered around in there without any section applying specifically to passport revocation. That is found in the related regulations.\n\nPassport regulations are codified at [22 CFR Part 51](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51), with revocation being the subject of [Subpart E, which is 51\\.60 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51/subpart-E).\n\nThere may be an explicit statement in the regulations that passport revocation does not affect citizenship. I did not look very thoroughly. But a bit of logical reasoning shows why it must be so:\n\n1. The conditions for loss of US nationality are very well defined. They are also fairly tightly circumscribed by several decisions of the US supreme court in the decades following the second world war.\n2. The conditions for revocation of a passport are much less strict; as an example, a passport may be revoked under 22 CFR 51\\.62 and 51\\.60 if the bearer \"is the subject of an outstanding Federal warrant of arrest for a felony, including a warrant issued under the Federal Fugitive Felon Act (18 U.S.C. 1073\\).\"\n3. US nationality is required to hold a US passport, but US nationals do not need to have a US passport.\n4. Therefore, a US passport may be revoked for a reason that cannot lead to loss of US nationality, and, when that happens, US nationality is retained.\n5. The condition mentioned in point 2 is clearly insufficient for depriving someone of US nationality, not least because the subject of an arrest warrant is only suspected of having committed a crime. Depriving a suspect of their liberty is acceptable to the extent necessary to bring that person to trial, but further deprivations beyond that end would violate the constitution's guarantee of due process.\n\n---\n\nA word on \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" in US law is in order, lest the use of the two terms seem inconsistent or arbitrary. US nationality is broader than US citizenship. All US citizens are US nationals, so loss of US nationality implies loss of US citizenship. However, there are some people who are US nationals without being US citizens, so it is more precise to speak of \"loss of nationality\" than \"loss of citizenship,\" and indeed that is the term used in US nationality law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between U.S. passport revocation and U.S. citizenship status?\n\nA) Revocation of a U.S. passport automatically results in the loss of U.S. citizenship.\n\nB) U.S. passport revocation and loss of U.S. citizenship are entirely separate processes governed by different sections of U.S. law.\n\nC) A U.S. citizen whose passport is revoked becomes a non-citizen national of the United States.\n\nD) U.S. passport revocation always occurs simultaneously with the loss of U.S. citizenship.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. U.S. passport revocation and loss of U.S. citizenship are indeed separate processes governed by different sections of U.S. law. Passport laws are found in Title 22 of the U.S. Code, while nationality laws are in Title 8. The conditions for revoking a passport (e.g., outstanding federal arrest warrant) are much less stringent than those for loss of citizenship. Importantly, many U.S. citizens never obtain a passport, demonstrating that citizenship does not depend on passport possession.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because passport revocation does not automatically affect citizenship status. Answer C is wrong because passport revocation does not change one's status from citizen to non-citizen national. Answer D is false as passport revocation can occur for reasons unrelated to citizenship status and without affecting it.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the distinction between passport-related matters and citizenship status in U.S. law, a nuance often misunderstood in public discourse."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48032/landlord-requiring-rabies-vaccination-for-a-dog-under-3-months-old-california", "docs_id": 48032, "title": "Landlord requiring rabies vaccination for a dog under 3 months old (California)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'll be getting an ESA (Emotional Support Animal) at the beginning of February.

[42 USC 3602(h)(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3602) includes mental impairment under the term \"handicap\", so assuming you have the appropriate official documentation, then [you cannot be discriminated against](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3604) in rental housing. The landlord must make a \"reasonable accommodation\", which probably means suspending the vaccination requirement until the dog is old enough. Of course, if the landlord resists, you will have to file a complaint and get HUD to rule. California has a [similar law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=12927).\n\nHowever, to prevail in a discrimination complaint, you may have to specifically demonstrate that you can't \"reasonably comply\" with the landlord's requirements (a person making a disability claim has a necessity burden to shoulder). The fact of having a mental disability does not mean that a landlord has to do whatever you say. Your doctor's evidence would have to address the necessity of not getting a different dog. That is, why not get a dog that is old enough to be vaccinated?

Under federal and California state laws, landlords must make reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities, including those with emotional support animals. In this case, a reasonable accommodation would be to temporarily suspend the vaccination requirement until the puppy is old enough to be safely vaccinated. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ESAs are not automatically exempt from all pet policies; reasonable accommodations are required, but some conditions can still apply. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it doesn't consider the landlord's obligation to make reasonable accommodations for disabilities. \n\nOption D, while touching on an important point about the tenant's burden to demonstrate necessity, is not the most appropriate first step.

Let's say there are two friends walking down a busy street, teasing each other. One of them playfully pushes the other who falls into the oncoming traffic. That person doesn't make it. Will the friend who pushed be charged with manslaughter or homicide, if he were to be charged at all? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [Canadian law](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-51.html), causing the death of human being is homicide. If the homicide is \"culpable\", it is an offense (crime). In the described scenario, it might be culpable homicide if the death was due to \"criminal negligence\". That would be the case if in doing a thing, the person \"shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons\".\n\nWe've now reached the end of what statutory law has to say about the question. Court cases take us [a bit further in understanding criminal negligence](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CriminalNegligence.aspx). The wisdom of the courts is distilled to ts essence in jury instructions, which say\n\n> The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's\n>  conduct showed a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonable\n>  person in the circumstances; and that a reasonable person in the same\n>  circumstances would have foreseen that this conduct posed a risk of\n>  bodily harm.\n\n[R. v. Tutton](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/465/index.do) is an example: the court finds that\n\n> The phrase \"wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of\n>  other persons\" signifies more than gross negligence in the objective\n>  sense. It requires some degree of awareness or advertence to the\n>  threat to the lives or safety of others or alternatively a wilful\n>  blindness to that threat which is culpable in light of the gravity of\n>  the risk assumed.\n\nUltimately, though, the fact\\-finder must evaluate the behavior against a highly subjective standard as to \"what a reasonable man would do\". I cannot imagine a scenario where shoving a person realistically could lead to them falling into traffic and getting killed but there the shoving was ordinary horseplay. Pushing a person in the direction of oncoming traffic is abnormal behavior that shows shocking disregard for the probable harm caused to another. But perhaps there is some innocent scenario where this was really just a tragic outcome. So the answer is, it could be culpable homicide, or not, depending on the facts.\n\nTo be classed as murder (rather than manslaughter) the person has to intend to cause death (\u00a7229\\), which is missing from this scenario."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Canadian legal context, two friends are walking down a busy street.

In Canadian law, this situation could potentially be classified as culpable homicide if the death was due to \"criminal negligence.\" This occurs when a person shows \"wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\" The key factors would be whether the accused's conduct showed a marked departure from that of a reasonable person, and if a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk of bodily harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because first-degree murder requires intent to cause death, which is not present in this scenario. Option B is partially correct in that manslaughter is a possibility, but it's not necessarily the most accurate answer, as the charge depends on the specific circumstances and the court's interpretation of the accused's actions. Option C is incorrect because accidental deaths can still result in criminal charges if negligence is involved.

See for example [ch. 35 of Title 12](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/chapter-35). The bank cannot claim \"It's not our fault, an employee did it\" (the Latin for this is \"[respondeat superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respondeat_superior)\", whereby a part is also responsible for the acts of their agents). As far as I know, there is no law against asking for information that can't be given. This does assume, however, that your mother does not have a legal right to the information (which could arise from some form of co\\-signing). Also, would assume that they have a normal privacy policy, and not one where they say \"We will tell your mother if she asks\" (they would have [informed you of that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6801), so read the privacy policy).

One might have the opinion that judicial review is just the unelected branch of government overriding decisions of the executive (or their officials). If so, that's rather undemocratic. If you believe that judges are merely applying their preconceived opinions in coming to a ruling, then there is no point studying it in detail (hence lazy).\n\nFalsifiability is a useful property in a theory. If I believe that there is no point studying the rulings because judges are just pulling answers out of the air, then there isn't any evidence you can provide to convince me otherwise. I might be correct in my belief but it isn't one based on evidence.\n\nWhat the author is arguing is that, if you're a student of the law, you need to study rulings in detail and look at the statutes, authorities and precedents quoted. Only then can you have an informed opinion on whether a more or less conservative (or whatever) judge might have come to a different ruling."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: What is the author's main argument regarding the approach to studying judicial review, and how does it relate to the concept of falsifiability?\n\nA) Judicial review is inherently political and cannot be studied objectively, thus making any analysis non-falsifiable.\n\nB) Students should focus solely on the political implications of judicial decisions rather than the legal reasoning behind them.\n\nC) The study of judicial review requires a detailed examination of legal reasoning and case law, rejecting non-falsifiable assumptions about judicial motivations.\n\nD) Falsifiability is irrelevant in legal studies, and students should rely on their normative outlooks to understand judicial review.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The author argues that while political and personal values may influence judicial review, it is crucial for students to focus on the legal details and reasoning behind decisions. He criticizes the notion that judicial review is \"just politics or values in a different guise\" as \"lazy and non-falsifiable thinking.\" The correct approach, according to the author, is to examine the legal specifics that shape the grounds of review and their application. This aligns with the concept of falsifiability, as it encourages students to base their understanding on evidence that can be tested and potentially disproven, rather than relying on unfalsifiable assumptions about judges' motivations or the nature of judicial review."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3495/sentenced-to-death-when-pregnant", "docs_id": 3495, "title": "Sentenced to death when pregnant", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What happens if a female is sentenced to death while pregnant. Would the execution be delayed until she gave birth?

If it is found that the female is not pregnant, the warden must execute the judgment; if it is found that she is pregnant the warden must suspend the execution of the judgment, and transmit a certified copy of the finding and certificate to the Governor. When the Governor receives from the warden a certificate that the defendant is no longer pregnant, he must issue to the warden this warrant appointing a day for the execution of the judgment.\n\nThis defence dates back to English common law \\- [14th century English common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleading_the_belly).\n\nIt's also worth noting that the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx) Article 6(5\\), which the vast majority of countries are party to states:\n\n> Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women.\n\nAlthough treaty reservations may be made, it's unlikely to be a valid reservation, as states can't make a reservation with respect to a prohibition. **In short, most countries and jurisdictions are likely to have similar laws in place.**"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, a pregnant woman is sentenced to death for a federal crime.

Once the woman is no longer pregnant, the execution could potentially be rescheduled. \n\nOption A is incorrect as it directly contradicts federal law. Option B goes beyond what the law specifies, as it mentions delaying until after weaning, which is not part of the legal requirement. Option C is also incorrect, as the law does not mandate an automatic commutation to life imprisonment; it only requires suspension of the execution during pregnancy.\n\nThis question tests understanding of specific legal provisions regarding capital punishment and pregnancy, as well as the ability to distinguish between suspension of execution and commutation of sentence."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38806/estate-planning-spouses-with-survivorship-clause-could-a-named-beneficiary", "docs_id": 38806, "title": "Estate Planning - Spouses with survivorship clause - could a named beneficiary &quot;double up&quot; on simultaneous death scenario?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Lets say there is a married couple and they both have identical wills; with a survivorship clause along the lines of:\n\n* I direct that the reside of my estate shall be paid, transferred and delivered to my spouse (xxx) for his/her own use... provided s/he survives me for a period of (30\\) thirty days.\n* In the event my spouse (xxx) predeceases me or does not survive me for a period of (30\\) thirty days, then: give $10k to the church and split the remainder in equal shares to my children.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* if both spouses have the same children and die at the same time, does the church get $10K or $20K ?\n* if the church gets $20k; how would you change the will so the church get $10K total regardless who dies first and the time between the deaths.\n\nLinks to source would be greatly appreciated.

Therefore, John (being older) is presumed to have died first. Since all assets are jointly owned, only John's will is executed, treating Jane as if she had predeceased him.

Courts don't often look kindly on actions whose sole purpose is enabling someone else to do something that is prohibited. If you're making a script that helps people do something they're allowed to do, in a way that's better for at least somebody and makes nobody worse off, that's often a different story.\n\nMajor websites will generally indicate whether or not you're allowed to do this. \n\nSome sites are fairly strict about prohibiting scraping (e.g. Craigslist, which [at one point shut down Padmapper](http://blog.padmapper.com/2012/06/22/bye-bye-craigslist/)'s alternative more\\-useful presentation of their content). \n\nOthers, like Wikipedia, much more actively encourage reusing content from their sites as long as you meet [certain conditions such as a link back to the original source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates a script that scrapes content from various news websites and reformats it for easier reading on tablets.

While not redistributing content (option A) is important, it's not the sole determining factor. Access to paywalled content (option B) can be relevant, but it's not the primary consideration. Explicit permission (option C) isn't always required if the terms of service allow for such actions. Option D is correct because it emphasizes the importance of adhering to each website's specific terms of service, which may vary. Courts generally frown upon actions that enable users to violate these terms, even if the script itself doesn't directly redistribute content. The legality can differ based on whether the script helps users do something allowed in a more efficient way versus enabling prohibited actions."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59443/in-the-us-what-kind-of-lawyer-represents-the-government-in-court", "docs_id": 59443, "title": "In the US, what kind of lawyer represents the government in court?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Just want to know whether the government has a special lawyer or something like that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the situation\n---------------------------\n\n### In a criminal case\n\nWhen the government is prosecuting a criminal case, they are represented by a *prosecutor*.

This section does not apply to an adult who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age for use only in target practice under the adult's supervision or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the adult's supervision.  \n> \n> (b) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon in the line of duty. This section does not apply to an adult who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age in the line of duty.  \n> \n> (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941\\.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593\\.

While the first 2 are more or less familiar to everyone knows anything about Japanese martial arts, the last one had to be looked up by everyone following the case to discover that it's the \"secret weapon of the Ninja\"(even more than the shuriken).\n* (3\\.c) says that the whole of this entire section applies\\[adding the brackets to make following the formal logic easier] **only** if (the person under 18 is in violation of 941\\.28\\[barrel length under 16 inches]) **or** (is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304\\[Restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age] **and** 29\\.593\\[Requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval]).\n\nIn programming terms(for those so inclined), 3\\.C could be written as:\n\n```\nIF ((barrelLengthInches < 16) OR (huntingUnder16Applies AND huntingCertificateApplies))\nTHEN statute948.60Applies\nELSE statute948.60DoesNotApply\n\n```\n\nSince the barrel length is over 16'' and Rittenhouse is over 16 and no hunting permit was required for his activities, the whole section of the law did not apply. Assistant District Attorney James Kraus [argued](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/explainer-judge-drop-rittenhouse-gun-charge-81285031) that the exception renders the state\u2019s prohibition on minors possessing dangerous weapons meaningless. In essence, that the legislators drafting that law spent too much time watching cheesy early 90's action movies and thinking of how to save Wisconsinites from the Ninja threat, to draft the law properly, so it should be read according to its intent from the title of the section.\n\nHowever, there is a binding Common Law precedent, dating back from the 16th century called the \"Rule of Lenity\", also called \"Strict Constructionism\" in the US, whereby if the legislature screws up, it's the legislature's problem. In the original case, the law in England forbade \"felonious stealing of **Horses**, Geldings or Mares\". A thief was caught, but argued that since he only stole **one** horse and the law specified horses, the law didn't apply to him. He was let off and the law hastily rectified. Pre\\-revolutionary Common Law precedent is binding in the US and it was re\\-affirmed multiple times, e.g. United States v. Wiltberger, where a US sailor got off with killing another US sailor in a Chinese estuary, because the law only applied on the \"high seas\". So, the charge was tossed and the defense didn't press the issue further.\n\n**However**, the really interesting bit is that even though it didn't get to be argued since Rittenhouse was 17, the way the law is actually written, this section **only** applies if (huntingUnder16Applies **AND** huntingCertificateApplies). That means that there is literally **nothing** in Wisconsin barring a **12** year old(under 12 is separately forbidden in the 29\\.304/huntingUnder16Applies section) from possessing and using an AR\\-15(or AK\\-47\\), as long as the barrel is \\>16'' and a hunting license isn't required for the activity.\n\nI think that the legislature will amend the law with haste, before it can be tested on 12 year olds.\n\nP.S. the other guy who gave him the gun will get off with this precedent too, since the statute for his charge is:\n\n> This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941\\.28\\.\n\ni.e. the same 3 sub\\-sections as for Rittenhouse."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Wisconsin, according to statute 948.60, under what circumstances does the law prohibiting possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18 apply?\n\nA) It applies to all minors possessing any firearm, regardless of barrel length or hunting certification.\n\nB) It applies only if the minor possesses a firearm with a barrel length under 16 inches OR is under 16 and lacks proper hunting certification.\n\nC) It applies only if the minor possesses a firearm with a barrel length under 16 inches AND is under 16 and lacks proper hunting certification.\n\nD) It does not apply to any minors possessing firearms, as long as they are not hunting.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the statute, section 948.60 applies only if the person under 18 is in violation of s. 941.28 (possession of a firearm with a barrel length under 16 inches) OR is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 (restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age, and requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval). The key point is that these conditions are connected by an OR, not an AND. This means that the law applies if either condition is met, not only if both are met simultaneously.

I'm afraid that i will build my projects in depending of free products and some day developers will say: \"We're changing license, now you must pay for commercial license or use our paid cloud service\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you received a copy of a copyrighted work under a particular license in the past, that work is licensed to you under the terms of that license. If the copyright holder stops offering the work under BSD terms, that does not lessen the fact that you *already did* receive the work under BSD terms. The copyright holder may choose to stop distributing new copies to other people under the old license, but the old license grant offered to you in the past will persist, unless either\n\n1. the license expires, or\n2. the licencor explicitly revokes your license grant.\n\nThe BSD license (and any OSI\\-approved license) does not have an expiration date, so we do not need to worry about the first possibility.\n\nA license can be revoked only if either\n\n1. the terms of the license explicitly allow the licencor to do so, or\n2. the license was granted in such a way that the licencor received no economic consideration for the license grant.\n\nThe BSD license is silent on revocability, so we must see whether there is economic consideration involved. According to [*Jacobsen v. Katzer*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17776182574171214893), a public open\\-source license grant may have economic consideration, even absent any exchange of money:\n\n> Traditionally, copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money. The lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration, however. There are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties. For example, program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge. Similarly, a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects. Improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder.\n\n(See also [Are licenses irrevocable by default?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/q/4012/50) on OpenSource.SE.)\n\nThus, there is a strong possibility that there is consideration involved in your case, and the licencor may not be able to revoke the license already granted to you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company has been using an open-source project licensed under the BSD license for several years in their commercial product.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the software company's rights and obligations?\n\nA) The company must immediately cease using the open-source project and switch to the paid commercial license to continue using the software.\n\nB) The company can continue using the version they have under the BSD license indefinitely, but must pay for any updates or new versions.\n\nC) The company has no rights to use the software anymore, as open-source licenses can be revoked at any time by the copyright holder.\n\nD) The company can continue using and modifying their existing version under the BSD license terms, regardless of the license change for future versions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. When a company receives a copy of software under a specific license like BSD, they retain the right to use that version under the original license terms, even if the copyright holder changes the license for future versions. The BSD license does not have an expiration date and is not easily revocable due to the concept of \"economic consideration\" as established in cases like Jacobsen v. Katzer. This consideration can include non-monetary benefits such as increased market share or reputation. Therefore, the company can continue to use, modify, and distribute their existing version under the original BSD license terms, regardless of changes to the license for new versions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company doesn't need to immediately switch to the new license for the version they already have.

Could Stripe successfully sue the new company for using such a slogan?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A slogan such as \"The Stripe of Bitcoin\" might well be taken to indicate that the seller of a product or service is trading on the good reputation associates with the mark \"stripe\". If so, that would probably be a form of trademark infringement, assuming thst \"Stripe\" is protected as a trademark, unless the permission of the holder of the trademark \"Stripe\" was obtained. Payment processing and cryptocurrency handling are sufficiently closely related that customer confusion is possible.\n\nNote that **competitive** use is generally permitted. One can, for example market a soft drink with the tag \"*The cola that's better than Coke*\" without permission from Coca\\-cola (which i doubt anyone would ever get). This is because when a marketer says \"X is better than Y\" no one reasonably thinks X is sponsored or approved by Y, nor will anyone be lead by this tag into thinking that X and Y are the same.\n\nOther forms of ***nominative use*** are also allowed without permission from the trademark holder. For example, a computer component might have been advertised as: \"*compatible with Intel Pentium*\", as this is just using a trademark to name a related product, and does not imply affiliation or sponsorship.\n\nBut a tag such as \"*The Rolls\\-Royce of pencils*\" might be ruled to be infringing, even though Rolls does not, as far as I know, make pencils.\n\nNote that the details of trademark law vary significantly from one country to another.

Any content on YT is protected by copyright. Transcribing a movie would be creating a derivative work, which requires permission from the copyright owner. The same goes for transcribing a half of a movie. The minimal individual components of a text, the words and phrases, are not protected by copyright. A sentence, or two, or ten, get you into the realm of fair use analysis. There are 4 core factors and a \"tie\\-breaker\" about transformativeness, where e.g. if you only take a tiny bit that's consistent with fair use, if it's taken for an educational / research purpose that's pro fair use, if it's for a non\\-profit reason that's a vote for fair use, and a transcription is highly transformative. Of course, it's impossible to tell if your plan is *actually* fair use, because what happens is that you get sued for infringement, then you can use fair use as a defense. So it is legally more involved than the case where you actually did not copy or transcribe anything (they got the wrong guy, or, you are actually the original author).\n\nDictionary sentences are relevant because dictionaries generally copy sentences from existing literature, though often they are out of copyright at this point.

It was not the currency of an EU member state, and even if it was it would've been permitted for personal use...\n\nbut I feel uncomfortable having inadvertently brushed so close to the boundary between what's permitted and what's outlawed.\n\nWith the flurry of new regulations introduced since the Russian invasion, I suspect that there might be a lot more that I'm not aware of. The concerns of (new) laws that affect us personally without us knowing about them it's a generic one, and I know that \"Ignorance of the Law is No Excuse\".\n\nUsually the concern is about [new emergency regulations which affect large swaths of the population](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/54905/is-ignorance-of-the-law-a-valid-excuse-for-not-following-emergency-laws-with-no), but here I think that the issue is for laws (or interpretation thereof) that affects some [obscure circumstances](https://www.layroots.com/lobster-law-101/). Due to the relatively small population of Russian citizens in the European Union (EU), and due to the extremely small amount of travellers visiting Russia from the EU, I understand that regulations that affects only those in these circumstances are not be advertised as much as for other laws, but this does not answer the question... how to mitigate risks in accidentally breaching recently introduced new regulations? How to be aware of all of them?\n\nI'm interested in answers relevant for any place in the world, but especially EU/EEA and neighboring countries (UK, Switzerland, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that, as a practical matter, you can't be aware of every change in the law that could conceivably affect you. Even lawyers don't have enough time to keep up with every change in the law until after a specific legal issue presents itself. Firms selling legal research products have scores and hundreds of employees working full time every day to keep track of every change in the law, to the exclusion of all other working time in their lives.\n\nYou can read the mainstream media and trade publications in fields in which you are engaged which often address these questions. You can take continuing education courses in your occupation or profession. You can confer with a lawyer before taking action in areas where you aren't familiar with the law. You can proceed with caution when you do something that everyone else you know of who is similarly situated is not doing. You can pay special attention to the news and government provided information during periods of major emergencies.\n\nBut, the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse is sometimes simply harsh and unfair. Nonetheless, this rule is the law with respect to most kinds of laws in most legal systems.\n\nAs a practical matter, law enforcement authorities and courts will often show leniency towards someone who innocently violates a new law of which they were unaware, at least the first time, sometimes letting them off with a warning or a minimal penalty.

(I'm assuming the answer here will probably be \"well it depends on what state and county...\")\n\nThank You!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Uniform Commercial Code is a law governing personal property security interests (i.e. mortgages in personal property). In other words, it governs using personal property as collateral for loans.\n\nUnder the UCC, there are two important steps: attachment and perfection. A security interest is effective against the party granting it when it \"attaches\" usually immediately upon the signing of the security agreement. But, a security interest is not effective in bankruptcy or against third parties until it is \"perfected\".\n\nHow is a security interest perfected?\n\nYou have to look at Sections 301\\-324 of Article 9 of the current version of the Uniform Commercial Code, or, in states that haven't adopted the most recent version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 301 et seq. of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe way a security interest is perfected varies by the type of property involved. \n\nSecurity interests in some property can only be perfected by possession (i.e. a pawn transaction) or control. \n\nPerfection of some kinds of property (e.g. automobiles, airplanes, copyrights) are governed by specific laws outside the UCC: security interests in automobiles must be shown on the certificate of title, security interests in airplanes and copyrights are perfected in special national registries.\n\nWhen there is no special rule that applies, security interests are perfected by filing with a state level official, usually the state government's Secretary of State for the state where the debtor resides or is organized if the debtor is an entity.\n\nHistorically, under the 1998 version of the UCC adopted in all U.S. states, in addition to the state filing, it was also necessary to make a filing in the real estate records of the county where the property was located for certain kinds of personal property with a connection to real estate, the most common of which were \"fixtures\" which are items of tangible personal property that are attached to real estate, and for security interests in growing crops which are by their very nature attached to the land upon which they grow. Counties have never shared their filings with the state, so a state level search is not sufficient to determine if fixtures or agricultural property are lien free in states where there a valid filings made under the 1998 version of the law that are still in force.\n\nThe requirements to perfect an agricultural lien or a lien in fixtures in the modern version of Article 9 of the UCC (finalized for adoption by states in 2010\\) are found at Section 310 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which dispenses with the county level filing requirement of the 1998 Act. \n\nThe [2010 version of Article 9 has currently been adopted by every U.S. state](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=UCC%20Article%209%20Amendments%20(2010)). There was a strong push for all states to adopt the 2010 amendments with a uniform effective date of July 1, 2013, so as to allow states to adopt the amendments uniformly and have them become operative simultaneously (thereby avoiding unnecessary conflicts and confusion with respect to interstate transactions). Mostly this was successful, but there may have been isolated exceptions.\n\nFor the most part, the grandfathered filings have now expired. But there may be some states, particularly those which were late adopters, where grandfathered filings are still effective."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company in State X wants to perfect a security interest in fixtures attached to a debtor's property. State X adopted the 2010 version of UCC Article 9 on July 1, 2013. The fixtures were installed and the security agreement was signed on June 15, 2013. Where should the company file to ensure proper perfection of its security interest?\n\nA) Only with the Secretary of State of State X\nB) Only with the county recorder where the property is located\nC) Both with the Secretary of State of State X and the county recorder\nD) No filing is necessary as the security interest attached before the 2010 version took effect\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the transition between the 1998 and 2010 versions of UCC Article 9, as well as the rules for perfecting security interests in fixtures. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The security agreement was signed before the 2010 version took effect in State X, so the 1998 rules would apply.\n2. Under the 1998 version, perfection of security interests in fixtures required filing both at the state level (usually with the Secretary of State) and in the real estate records of the county where the property was located.\n3. Even though State X adopted the 2010 version (which only requires state-level filing), the security interest was created before the new rules took effect, so the old rules would still apply.\n4. To ensure proper perfection, the company should file both at the state and county levels to comply with the rules in effect at the time the security interest was created.\n\nThis question is challenging because it requires understanding the transition between UCC versions, the specific rules for fixtures, and how adoption dates affect ongoing security interests."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44738/do-firefighters-contitute-a-legislative-power", "docs_id": 44738, "title": "Do firefighters contitute a legislative power?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to this article [ref here](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/new-york-fire-commissioners-call-for-new-9-11-investigation/), [ref here](https://www.globalresearch.ca/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-new-911-investigation/5684982), [ref here](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-demand-new-911-investigation) and [ref here:](https://www.ae911truth.org/news/540-new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-for-new-9-11-investigation) \n\n> ...History has just been made, as the first legislative body in the\n>  country officially announces their support for reopening the 9/11\n>  investigation.

The primary reason for requiring a license to practice law is to ensure that legal practitioners are properly authorized, regulated, and competent. This serves the best interests of the administration of justice and maintains high professional standards.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while licensing may limit competition, this is not the primary purpose of the requirement. The main goal is to protect the public and ensure quality legal services.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, although licensing does generate some revenue, this is not the primary motivation for requiring licenses to practice law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because individuals are generally allowed to represent themselves in court (pro se representation).

Yesterday, it was [reported](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/) that a big security flaw existed in virtually all Intel processors sold in the last decade. Intel has known about it for several months and has informed the OS vendors so they could publish patches before the vulnerability was made public, as is the custom in these cases. This looks to my non\\-lawyer eyes like blatant insider trading. Is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The accusation would be the crime of securities fraud (\"insider trading\" is legally meaningless), under [15 USC 78j(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j). There is a bit more elaboration in [17 CFR 240\\.10b5\\-1](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=se17.4.240_110b5_61&rgn=div8). That law prohibits using \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in\" in connection with a securities transaction. Under [15 USC 78ff](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78ff), violation of the law can result in a fine of up to $5 million and 20 years, thus it is a crime. As a crime, the standard of proof required is must higher than it in for a civil forfeiture (which can be as low as \"reasonable suspicion\"). In the US, and pursuant to the Due Process clause, that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that is (from [in re Winship](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html)), \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged\". \n\nThe statute itself does not state the elements that must be proven to secure a conviction, but they can be discerned based on jury instructions (which are circuit\\-specific). The 9th Circuit instruction is [here](http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/415). You can see that there are 4 specific allegations that have to be chosen between, and the prosecutor has to have at least alleged one of those prohibited acts (so that the jury can decide if the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did that thing).\n\nThe evidence you have presented could constitute \"reasonable suspicion\", but not \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\". If we had a different standard of proof in criminal trials, where it was sufficient to just suspect based on a small bit of evidence that a person may have done something prohibited, then the conclusion could be different. Or, if you had stronger evidence surrounding the sale, your argument might carry a bit more weight. In other words, criminal prosecution is based on quite a lot of specific and objective evidence about what happened. An example of the kind of evidence and allegations required to get the ball rolling can be seen [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/994881/download); for \"insider trading\" specifically, look [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/980156/download) (this case is based on an FBI investigation, where an agent will presumably testify to hearing the defendant state a plan to violate the law)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a potential securities fraud case against a CEO who sold company shares shortly before a major security flaw in the company's products was publicly disclosed, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal standard and evidence required for prosecution?\n\nA) Reasonable suspicion based on the timing of the stock sale would be sufficient evidence for a criminal conviction.\n\nB) The prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the CEO used manipulative or deceptive devices in connection with the securities transaction.\n\nC) A civil forfeiture case would require a higher standard of proof than a criminal prosecution for securities fraud.\n\nD) The statute explicitly outlines all elements that must be proven to secure a conviction for securities fraud.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct because in a criminal securities fraud case, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused used \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with a securities transaction, as stated in 15 USC 78j(b). This high standard of proof is required in criminal cases due to the Due Process clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reasonable suspicion is not sufficient for a criminal conviction. The standard of proof in criminal cases is \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is much higher.\n\nOption C is false because civil forfeiture cases actually have a lower standard of proof compared to criminal cases. The documentation mentions that civil forfeiture can be based on \"reasonable suspicion,\" while criminal cases require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the statute itself does not explicitly state all the elements that must be proven.

Many countries will prosecute if a crime took effect in their country.

In a globalized context, multiple countries may have grounds to prosecute based on their respective laws and jurisdictions. Country A might prosecute for the negligent decision made within its borders. Country B could potentially prosecute for the use of faulty parts in their territory. Country C might have jurisdiction as the location where the crash occurred. Country D might have laws allowing for prosecution when its citizens are victims abroad. Additionally, other countries with relevant laws regarding international incidents or aviation safety might also claim jurisdiction. The ability to prosecute would depend on each country's specific laws and international agreements, but the potential for multiple countries to be involved in prosecution is high in such a complex, international scenario."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86574/is-it-legal-to-publish-hashes-of-words-or-phrases-from-copyrighted-articles", "docs_id": 86574, "title": "Is it legal to publish hashes of words or phrases from copyrighted articles?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It it legal to publish a list of cryptographic hashes of words and two\\- and three\\-word phrases from an article, in random order? \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" would become:\n\n* Lorem\n* Ipsum\n* Dolor\n* Sit\n* Amet\n* Lorem ipsum\n* Ipsum dolor\n* Dolor sit\n* Sit amet\n* Lorem ipsum dolor\n* Ipsum dolor sit\n* Dolor sit amet\n\nThe words and phrases would then be hashed with an algorithm such as MD5, and the hash list would be published in a random order. They will be mixed with such lists from thousands of other articles with no correlation between hashes and articles, so it will be virtually impossible to recover an article's text, even after recovering the words and phrases with a dictionary or brute\\-force attack.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is legal to publish clear\\-text words and short phrases from an article, because word and short phrases are not protected by copyright. It is therefore legal to publish a transformation of such words and phrases.\n\nYou can consider a given novel to be a sequence of words and short phrases. It is not legal to sequentially publish the words and phrases of a protected novel, for example as a web page with a million sequentially numbered chapters each containing a couple words of original text. It would be legal to alphabetically list all of the words employed in a novel, along with a token count.\n\nIn order to prove copyright infringement, the plaintiff in the lawsuit would have to prove that the allegedly\\-infringing work as a certain degree of similarity to the protected work. Suppose that the fifth word of the original and supposed copy is \"the\" \u2013 that is not sufficient similarity to prove copying. The question of degree of similarity is a very fact\\-intensive inquiry.\n\nIf a novel is in fact copied and run through the blender to produce unrecognizable word slurry, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the necessary degree of similarity between the original and the copy. This involves exposing the reconstruction procedure. Given any sufficiently large database of words (the word\\-count list mentioned above), one can also select words from the database so that the selection procedure maximally matches the original text (then you devise a mapping post hoc that \"reconstructs\" the original text from the slurry). The defense can counter this argument by positing a different algorithm that converts the slurry into Mother Goose rhymes. Whether not the plaintiff's argument that there was copying depends crucially on the uniqueness of the reconstruction.\n\nSo, the summary. First, words and phrases are not protected by copyright law. Second, entire works, which contain words and phrases, cannot be copied at all regardless of any transformations you apply. The law is stated in terms of copying, and not in terms of \"creating a text that has a particular relation to a protected word\". However, the law also has to deal with the known facts, and cannot require time\\-travel as a means of proving that there was copying. Therefore, the law takes \"similarity\" as a substitute for direct knowledge of an action in the past. It is therefore possible that a person can get away with actual copying, if the plaintiff cannot prove that the basis of the secondary text must have been the plaintiff's protected text."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A writer creates a novel and publishes it.

Publishing this mixed list of hashes online\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) This action is completely legal as individual words and short phrases are not protected by copyright.\n\nB) This action is illegal because it's a form of copying the entire work, regardless of the transformations applied.\n\nC) This action is legal as long as the original text cannot be reconstructed from the published hashes.\n\nD) The legality of this action depends on whether the copyright holder can prove a sufficient degree of similarity between the original work and the published hashes.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The legality of this action is not straightforward and depends on several factors. While it's true that individual words and short phrases are not protected by copyright (which might suggest answer A), the process described involves the entire work, not just isolated words or phrases.\n\nAnswer B is too absolute, as the transformation and mixing with other works complicate the issue of whether this constitutes copying in a legal sense.\n\nAnswer C introduces a condition that, while relevant, is not the sole determining factor in copyright law.\n\nAnswer D is the most accurate because it reflects the nuanced approach of copyright law in such cases. The copyright holder would need to prove a sufficient degree of similarity between the original work and the transformed version to establish infringement. This involves demonstrating that the hashed and mixed version retains enough unique characteristics of the original work to be considered a copy. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to show that the transformation process doesn't negate the copying, and that there's a unique way to reconstruct the original work from the hashes. The defense could argue that the transformation is so thorough that no meaningful similarity remains. Ultimately, this would likely be a fact-intensive inquiry in court, making answer D the most appropriate choice."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90876/whats-the-legality-and-potential-recourse-of-selling-something-as-tuna-that-i", "docs_id": 90876, "title": "What&#39;s the legality (and potential recourse) of selling something as Tuna that isn&#39;t Tuna at all", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the US many sushi places sell \"white tuna\" which actually isn't a Tuna at all but Escolar, a fish from a different family and genus. That seems to be primarily a popular marketing ploy: Tuna is substantially more expensive than Escolar. It also doesn't remotely taste like tuna either. The practice is akin to selling chicken as \"white beef\" at beef prices.\n\nIs is not only is it grossly misleading, it is also potentially dangerous. Escolar is banned in (for example) Japan and Italy because they consider it toxic. Being banned in Japan is particularly ironic for a Sushi fish. Anyway: Tuna is much less of a health risk than Escolar.\n\n* Is this legal or what is the legal interpretation of this mislabeling?\n* What legal recourse does a customer have if they come across it?\n\nIf locality matters, let's start with US, Massachusetts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Federal deceptive advertising regulations do not apply to restaurant menus, and sale of escolar is legal in the US. Legal recourse would have to be via state law. Such legal action is conceivable, for example it would be \"menu fraud\" to sell chuck steak as \"Kobe beef\", and the practice of selling shark meat disks as scallops is likewise illegal. Fish are problematic since multiple species can be commonly called by a single name (sole, halibut, cod, snapper, sardine, herring). It is possible that in a certain market, \"white tuna\" is standardly understood to be albacore tuna, therefore it would be fraudulent to sell escolar as \"white tuna\". That would be the point that has to be proven in a legal action, that the term has a specific interpretation. Analogously, there are a number of creamed vegetable products sold as \"hummus\" which contain no chickpeas (by original definition, hummus *is* chickpeas and not soybeans). By dint of such variant use over time, it is not deceptive to sell mashed soybeans as \"hummus\". The tuna industry may well hope to limit the use of the term \"tuna\", but there is no regulation defining \"white tuna\". It should be noted that there *is* a regulation, [21 CFR 161\\.190](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=161.190) for canned tuna, dictating that only albacore tuna may\nbe called \"white meat tuna\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer in Massachusetts discovers that a sushi restaurant has been selling escolar labeled as \"white tuna\" on their menu.
