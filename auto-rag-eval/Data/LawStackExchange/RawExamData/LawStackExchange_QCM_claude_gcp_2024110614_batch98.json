I'm essentially on a zero\\-hour contract, however my contract says that when work is available I will be given 24 hour/week \"basic\". There is usually more than enough work to go around and I can ask for overtime, with the exception of a few days in winter when our client airlines reduce their schedules.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was always a race for people to book Christmas off as the vast majority fairly reasonably don't want to work on Christmas Day and some are reliant on public transit (the company knows this and chose to hire us anyway). We're usually done by 11am unless a flight is delayed so it's not like I can't enjoy the holidays *and* work them (I can also refuse to work the past my scheduled finish time), however unless they remember to put me on shifts with colleagues who I can get a ride to/from work, it gets prohibitively expensive to get to and from work in a taxi.\n\nAbout a year before I started, the employment contract for new employees was changed. Staff before this point receive double pay for working bank holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Day. We, the newer staff, don't have that luxury. The older staff do not get double rate for leave taken on bank holidays, however.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, the situation regarding Christmas is uncertain. It's widely suspected that the company, trying to cut losses after keeping two thirds of the workforce on furlough for months and (to their credit) covering the last 20% of our paychecks, is going to only give the shifts to the staff they don't have to pay double rate for, and only approve leave for those who are paid double rate or otherwise force them to take leave. Because of our contracts, the newer staff will cost the half the amount the older staff will. The management has reshuffled after a couple of them left, so we don't know if they're still aware of the issues we face or not, if they are willing to make those accomodations, or are going to assign shifts based on how much it'll cost alone.\n\nI know employers can choose when we can take leave, but what's the legality in this situation, could this be considered discriminatory in any way, for example, if someone who made the leave request first is deferred over someone more expensive to have in work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If everyone hired after date X has a different contract from anyone hired before that date it is not discriminatory.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) This practice is inherently discriminatory and violates UK employment law\nB) The company can legally implement this policy as long as it's based solely on contract dates\nC) The practice is legal only if the company offers alternative compensation to newer employees\nD) The company must prioritize leave requests based on seniority to avoid legal issues\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application of UK employment law principles. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, \"If everyone hired after date X has a different contract from anyone hired before that date it is not discriminatory.\" This principle applies here, as the different pay rates for bank holidays are based on contract dates, not on protected characteristics.\n\n2.

A lesser included charge is a crime for which all the elements must be established to prove the greater charge, but the converse is not true.\n\nThus, if someone is charged only with manslaughter in an indictment to which they plead not guilty, they cannot be convicted of murder. But, if someone is charged with murder in an indictment, to which they plead not guilty, they can be convicted of either murder or manslaughter which is a lesser included charge relative to a murder charge.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nBasically, the criminal justice process goes through the following steps in **a felony case** (some of which may be omitted in misdemeanor and/or petty offense cases):\n\n1. Someone is charged with a crime in a **criminal complaint** and **arrested**. These two events can occur in either order. If the complaint is made first, an arrest warrant will be issued by a magistrate and form the basis for a subsequent arrest and booking. If an arrest is made first, usually because a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe a crime was committed, the criminal complaint will be drawn up once the defendant has been arrested and booked.\n2. After both events in step 1 are complete, a **first appearance** of the defendant **in person** before a magistrate or judge is held in a matter of one to three days, or even a matter of hours, at which counsel is appointed if the defendant is indigent, the defendant is formally advised of the charges in the criminal complaint, and bail is set (or denied for cause or waived). Confusingly a first appearance is sometimes called an \"arraignment on the complaint\", but I am assuming that your question used the term \"arraignment\" in the predominant sense of an arraignment on an information or indictment.\n3. Then, in felony cases (but not misdemeanors), the criminal complaint is reviewed for probable cause following a **preliminary hearing** and if probable cause is found to exist it is converted to an \"information\" (if the preliminary hearing is waived by the defendant, the complaint is automatically converted to an \"information\"); or a **grand jury** reviews the criminal complaint for probable cause and if probable cause is found to exist it is converted to an \"indictment.\"\n4. The defendant is **arraigned** **in person** on the information or indictment. In an arraignment, the defendant is formally informed of the charges in the information or indictment, and the defendant enters a preliminary plea to each of the charges in the information or indictment. This would typically take five minutes to half an hour, depending upon the number of charges brought.\n5. **Pre\\-trial proceedings** (e.g., \"discovery\" and motion practice), if any, are conducted by the lawyers for the prosecution and the defense.\n6. A **trial** is held (if the defendant demands it, before a jury).\n\n**Caveat:** There are also more steps prior to the filing of a criminal complaint or arrest (related to searches, seizures and interrogations), and there are also more steps after the trial (related to sentencing, appeals and collateral attacks on convictions and the sealing of records and pardons and commutations), but none of those steps are pertinent to this question.\n\nA jury trial would simply never be (definitively and officially) scheduled until an arraignment of the defendant was conducted. So, while it is true that a jury trial would not be conducted on charges in an indictment until the defendant is arraigned (i.e., until the defendant enters a plea to the probable cause screened charges), in the ordinary course, this is a trivial matter.\n\nBut, because criminal trials can only be conducted after a defendant has been arraigned in person, the only time that a defendant can be tried in *abstentia* (i.e., without being present at the trial), is when the defendant is arraigned and enters a not guilty plea or the equivalent, and then absconds after that points but before the trial is conducted.\n\n(I'm not a complete expert on this, it may be necessary for the defendant to be present when the trial is commenced as well, but I don't need to know to answer this question.)\n\nAlso, while the requirement of an indictment by a grand jury for felonies exists in federal court under the U.S. Constitution, and in some state courts (mostly in the Eastern U.S.) under state constitutions, the U.S. Constitution permits a state to substitute a preliminary hearing giving rise to an \"information\" for a grand jury indictment if its state constitution permits.\n\nMy source for this post is a hard copy of the book Israel, Kamisar and LaFave, *Criminal Procedure and the Constitution* (1994\\).

During the trial, new evidence suggests the death may have been accidental. The jury is deliberating, and one juror asks if they can consider a lesser charge.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, a defendant can be convicted of a lesser included charge relative to one for which an information or indictment is secured and upon which the defendant is arraigned.\n\n2. Manslaughter is typically considered a lesser included offense of murder, as it involves the unlawful killing of another person but without the element of premeditation or intent required for murder.\n\n3. The jury does not need a new arraignment to consider a lesser included offense. The original arraignment on the greater charge (murder) is sufficient to allow consideration of lesser included offenses.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because it's too restrictive and doesn't account for lesser included offenses.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because a new arraignment is not necessary for lesser included offenses.\n\n6. Option D is incorrect because it's too broad. The jury cannot consider \"any charge\" but is limited to the original charge and its lesser included offenses.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the arraignment process, the nature of indictments, and the principle of lesser included offenses.

Nevertheless, excluding these from the response to a data subject access request seems sensible. Possible arguments:\n\n* The information in search results is not associated with your account; consequently a copy of the data in the account does not include search results.\n* You can obtain a copy of this data yourself by using the search functionality, it is therefore unnecessary to include it in a download. (Note that the right to data portability is often conflated with the right to access, but access does not require a machine\\-readable format.)\n* Personal data in search results is difficult to attribute to a particular person since multiple people might have the same name and one person might use multiple names. To avoid the inclusion of wrong information, such attribution should only be done manually.\n* The data in search results is only processed as textual data, not as personal data. (Not quite true since websites might be literally linked to a person, but that isn't the case in general.) Similarly, a postal service does not process the personal data in the mail they deliver.\n* A request to access to the search index is unfounded and excessive, and may therefore be refused.\n\nGoogle does somewhat implement the right to be forgotten, but correctly points out that their index merely reflects the websites on the internet, and to actually remove the data you need to get it taken down from the websites that published it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tech company has developed a novel search engine that creates highly personalized results based on users' unique names.

The correct answer, C, represents the most balanced approach that addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It acknowledges that search results can include personal data, but also recognizes the practical challenges of including all such data in a subject access request response.\n2. It aligns with the idea that account-linked data should be provided, which is consistent with Google's approach of providing emails and other account-specific information.\n3. It offers a way for the user to access relevant search results themselves, addressing the argument that such data is already accessible to the user through normal search functionality.\n4. It includes an explanation for why full index access is not provided, which could cover points such as the difficulty of attributing search data to a specific individual, the potential for including incorrect information, and the argument that a request for the entire search index could be considered excessive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't consider the practical and legal arguments against providing full index access. Option B is too extreme, as it incorrectly assumes that no search index data could be considered personal data.

O demands that BFP return the tie to O, but BFP refuses.\n\n> Advise BFP.\n\nHere's the relevant part of my textbook's answer.\n\n> The issue here is unilateral mistake as to identity. The question is deliberately ambiguous on whether the contract is oral or written. You can argue either way, but must apply appropriate law (*Lewis v Averay* in the case of an oral contract and *Shogun Finance v Hudson* in the case of a written contract). The result of the litigation O v. BFP depends on whether the contract is characterized as written or oral.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> R offers O \u00a310 for the tie, which O accepts.\n\nIt is not explicitly stated but it is heavily implied that this offer and acceptance was verbal, not written. Since this is *the* contract, it is arguably an oral contract.\n\nHowever, an alternative argument could be made that the \u201csale note\u201d subsequently reduced the contract to writing. If this document contained an [entire agreement clause](https://legalvision.com.au/entire-agreement-clause/), then this argument would be unassailable. If it didn\u2019t, then a counter\\-argument that the \u201csale note\u201d is simply a post\\-contractual record of what happened. Alternatively, the \u201csale note\u201d could be argued to be void since it contains an illegal term \\- all consumer goods are returnable if they are defective in England and Wales.\n\nThe parol evidence rule can only be invoked once the written document is established to be the contract, it cannot be used to exclude evidence about whether it is or isn\u2019t the contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario involving O (original owner) and R (rogue), BFP (bona fide purchaser) seeks advice regarding the ownership of the tie. Which of the following legal arguments would be most effective for BFP to retain possession of the tie?\n\nA) Argue that the contract between O and R was entirely oral, invoking the principle in Lewis v Averay\nB) Claim that the \"Sale Note\" constitutes a written contract, applying the ruling in Shogun Finance v Hudson\nC) Assert that the \"Sale Note\" is void due to the non-returnable clause, rendering the entire transaction invalid\nD) Contend that O's acceptance of a cheque from R constitutes a separate agreement, superseding the initial sale\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts and precedents. The most effective argument for BFP would be to characterize the contract between O and R as oral, invoking the principle from Lewis v Averay. \n\nIn Lewis v Averay, it was established that in cases of face-to-face dealings where there's a mistake as to identity in an oral contract, the contract is voidable, not void. This means that if a third party (like BFP) acquires rights in good faith before the contract is avoided, those rights are protected.\n\nOption A is correct because if the contract is deemed oral, BFP's position as a good faith purchaser would be stronger. The initial verbal offer and acceptance (\"R offers O \u00a310 for the tie, which O accepts\") supports this characterization.\n\nOption B is less effective because if the \"Sale Note\" is considered the primary contract (applying Shogun Finance v Hudson), it would likely be void ab initio due to the mistake as to identity, which would not protect BFP's interests.\n\nOption C, while creative, is a weaker argument. The non-returnable clause being potentially unenforceable doesn't necessarily invalidate the entire transaction, and focusing on this might distract from the stronger argument about the nature of the contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because accepting a cheque is a method of payment, not a separate agreement that would supersede the initial sale.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex legal scenarios, apply relevant case law, and identify the most strategic legal argument for a given party's interests."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72960/if-my-electronic-devices-are-searched-can-a-police-officer-use-my-ideas", "docs_id": 72960, "title": "If my electronic devices are searched, can a police officer use my ideas?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On my phone, I have many different ideas for startups, books, and other creative endeavours. Most of them are probably (or certainly) worthless, but a few have some potential. As I understand it, these ideas aren't protected by intellectual property law, because they are just ideas.\n\nIf the police search my phone (say, when I cross an international border), and read my notes app with these ideas, can an enterprising police officer then use the idea originally gained from their search? If they do, can I sue them for stealing my idea? Or am I out of luck because ideas aren't protected?\n\nInterested in answers from any and all jurisdictions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mere ideas are not, as others have said, protected by copyright. However, the police officer in such a situation may have a duty of confidentiality, particularly if s/he is informed that the contents of the phone are confidential.\n\nFor example the [\"Officer's Code of Conduct\"](https://www.cantonohio.gov/389/Officers-Code-of-Conduct) of Canton Ohio, says:\n\n> Whatever a Police Officer sees, hears or learns of that is of a confidential nature will be kept a secret unless the performance of duty or legal provision requires otherwise. Members of the public have a right to security and privacy, and information obtained about them must not be improperly divulged.\n\nMany police departments have similar codes of conduct or policies. Such a policy might apply in the circumstances described in the question.\n\nIn [this page on \"Confidential information\"](https://www.taylorwessing.com/synapse/protection_confidential_info.html) posted by the TaylorWessing law firm, it is said that:\n\n> There are three circumstances in which the disclosure of information gives rise to an obligation of confidence:\n> \n> \n> * An obligation imposed by contract \u2013 for example, non\\-disclosure agreements.\n> * An obligation implied because of the circumstances of disclosure \u2013 this is determined on the basis of whether a reasonable man standing in the shoes of the recipient of the information would have realised that the information was being given to him in confidence.\n> * An obligation implied because of the special relationship between the parties concerned \u2013 for example, employer/employee relationships.\n> \n> \n> The best way of ensuring that confidential information is recognised and treated as such is by contract. If no express requirement for confidentiality is imposed, the manner in which the discloser treats the information can be held as indicative of its level of confidentially. Talking about information in public places, for example, would cause the recipient to assume it was not confidential in nature.\n> \n> \n> An action for breach of confidence is based on the conscience of the recipient who must have agreed or known that the information is confidential. Thus an action for breach of confidence can be brought against the original recipient of the information and any subsequent recipient who becomes aware of the fact that the information is confidential.\n> \n> \n> An action for breach of confidence may be brought against a person who has used or disclosed, or threatened to use or disclose, confidential information without permission.\n\nA police officer engaged in a search of confidential documents, whether found on a phone, on a computer, or in a filing cabinet, is in a \"special relationship\" with the sub ject of the search, and the \"circumstances of disclosure\" are unusual. Use of such information for private, personal gain unrelated to any police function might be held to violate an implied duty of confidentiality, particularly if the officer is informed of the confidential nature of the documents.\n\nIf the documents contain or constitute ***trade secrets***, unauthorized use will give grounds for a lawsuit. This would not apply to proper use within a police investigation or criminal case, but it would apply to private use or disclosure by the officer.\n\nin [\"Release of personal information to\npolice: your privacy rights\"](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fs-privacy-release-of-pi-to-police-your-privacy-rights.pdf) from the Government of Ontario it is said that:\n\n> Ontario public sector organizations, such as provincial ministries and agencies, municipalities, schools, and transit systems, are required by\n> law to protect your personal information and to follow certain rules when collecting, using, and disclosing your personal information.\n\nThis document is primarily about when other governnment agencies can release personal information to law enforcement, but it might be taken to imply a similar obligation to respect privacy being imposed on law enforcement officers.\n\nIn [this page](https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/data-pro/data-protection/what-is-the-data-protection-act/) and other linked pages the UK metropolitian police indicate that they are subject to the [Data Protection Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/pdfs/ukpga_20180012_en.pdf) This is closely related to the GDPR.

While it's true that mere ideas are not protected by copyright (eliminating option A), and that generally ideas aren't protected by intellectual property law (making option B seem plausible), the situation is more complex.\n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced legal position described in the documentation. Police officers may have a duty of confidentiality, especially when handling private information during searches.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the startup's obligations under GDPR?\n\nA) The startup must implement end-to-end encryption for all stored data to comply with GDPR requirements.\nB) The startup needs to obtain explicit user consent before allowing any data to be stored within the app.\nC) The startup is not subject to GDPR for this app, but should advise users about potential GDPR implications if they use it for business purposes.\nD) The startup must provide a mechanism for users to request deletion of their data from the company's servers at any time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of GDPR principles to a specific scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The app stores data locally on the user's device, not on the company's servers. This means the startup itself is not processing the personal data, which is a key factor in GDPR applicability.\n\n2. For personal use, the app falls under the exception in Art. 2(2)(c) of GDPR, which excludes processing \"by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.\"\n\n3. However, if a user decides to use the app for business purposes (e.g., storing customer photos), they might become subject to GDPR. The startup should be aware of this possibility and inform users accordingly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because encryption is not mandated by GDPR for locally stored data, especially when the company doesn't have access to it. Option B is incorrect because user consent is not required for data the company doesn't process. Option D is incorrect because the company doesn't store data on its servers, so there's nothing for users to request deletion of.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple GDPR concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuances of data controller responsibilities versus user responsibilities in different contexts."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22010/who-owns-copyright-for-program-created-during-an-unpaid-research-position", "docs_id": 22010, "title": "Who owns copyright for program created during an unpaid research position", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been doing part\\-time unpaid research at a prominent medical institution.

I did not use any of their resources to create it, was not compensated for it and designed and built the program with little input. I don't mind giving them the technology, but am worried that I won't be recognized as its creator, and that the copyright can be used to claim ownership rights to my future projects, since I frequently recycle code that I've written. On the other hand, I need a reference and don't want to strain any relationships. Any thoughts on how to proceed is welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are an employee hired to program, your employer holds the copyright, as a \"work for hire\". So the main questions are, are you an employee, and is this work done in the scope of your employment? The fact that you did not receive a salary isn't entirely dispositive \u2013 I take it this was some sort of internship, where you receive academic credit. Under that premise, they might argue that you were an employee (but they might lose that argument in court). The other issue, whether this was done \"on the job\" versus \"during the time period when you had an affiliation\" is not something that can be judged from a legal perspective. They will have a certain position about what you were doing, which you may or may not agree with, so it depends on how compelling your argument is vs. their argument that it was work\\-related. Since the scope of one's \"employment\" is not narrowly defined by some initial agreement (it can change), the fact that you did this \"at the request of the department head to be distributed by the institution\" indicates that it wasn't something unrelated to the job, which you did as a hobby. So on the face of it, it looks that this is indeed within the scope of the job.\n\nThere is a separate and distinct possibility, that one of the forms you signed actually signed away your rights (which would moot the question about you benig an employee). It is not at all uncommon for affiliation agreements (intern, employee, adjunct member, independent contractor) to include a clause assigning the institution the rights to your IP.\n\nYou are correct that there is a potential for them to interfere with future programming projects of yours. If they in fact own the source code, then they own all of the sub\\-bits of the code. Copyright protects the means of expression, but not the underlying facts. What is unknown (in law) is where that dividing line is software. It would not overcome copyright protection to simply replace all of the variable names (e.g. \"item\\_count\" \u2192 \"count\\_of\\_items\"), and cosmetically reorganizing code a also doesn't get rid of copyright protection. However, variable names and structure of code often (ideally?) follows from the nature of what the program does, so necessarily (to take an example), all bubble sort programs resemble all other bubble sort programs to the point that one might accuse an author of infringement. It's an interesting and not clearly answered question, how similar two functionally identical pieces of code can be without there being infringement.\n\nAgain, since copyright protects expression and not ideas, if in the course of writing a program you discover a clever algorithm for doing something (rather than dividing by the nth power of 2, shift right n), that knowledge is not protected by copyright, and it is to be expected that if you learn how to solve a problem once, you can re\\-invent the solution again (and it will strongly resemble the earlier solution). This murky copyright situation means that writing any new code in a somewhat overlapping area is a bit risky, since there is a high probability that any new code would have the level of substantial similarity that constitutes evidence of infringement.\n\nThere is no reliable way to find out whether they would succeed in an infringement suit, other than to get sued and see what happens.

Option C is the best course of action because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the institution's likely strong legal position. As the top answer suggests, the fact that the app was created \"at the request of the department head to be distributed by the institution\" indicates it was likely within the scope of the internship, even if unpaid.\n\n2.

But chances are you won't be dealing with the bank; the bank will have to deal with the producers and art directors of the film, and vice versa, and you will be out of the loop. You will need to convince all parties to work together and reach a business licensing agreement to allow you to have a custom bank/credit card.\n\nYou will need to find the producers of the film and ask them if they will license the artwork to the bank; they won't be licensing the artwork to you. And they probably won't like your adaptation of the artwork, so they will want to do their own artwork and design suite. If that happens, they will need to sign a deal with the bank system. And there will be money involved; I can't see the artist licensing their artwork for free to another business, so the bank will need to decide if it is worth it to get more customers to open card accounts.\n\nIt's worth a try; sometimes it is possible to get a one\\-off personal clearance from a copyright holder for a single license of artwork. It's possible you could get a letter from the artist/producer to take to the bank, drafted by their lawyer, releasing the bank system from any copyright infringement with the artwork for the single card.\n\nMaybe it will give the producers of animated films the idea that they should license their artwork for checks and bank/credit cards. i.e., [http://wowjapan.asia/2015/12/anime\\-visa\\-gets\\-three\\-official\\-attack\\-titan\\-credit\\-card\\-designs/](http://wowjapan.asia/2015/12/anime-visa-gets-three-official-attack-titan-credit-card-designs/) Or at least you might get a nice email from the film producers turning you down.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A film enthusiast wants to create a custom credit card featuring artwork from their favorite animated movie.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications for the newspaper?\n\nA) The newspaper is likely to face a successful defamation lawsuit because John Doe was ultimately cleared of charges.\nB) The newspaper is protected from defamation claims as long as they used the word \"arrested\" instead of \"committed.\"\nC) The newspaper could be held liable for defamation if they sensationalized John Doe's character beyond stating the facts of the arrest.\nD) The newspaper has no legal risk because they reported on an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the defamation laws as explained in the documentation, particularly in relation to media reporting on criminal cases. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The newspaper is protected by the truth defense (Section 2(1) of the Defamation Act 2013) for reporting the fact of John Doe's arrest, as it was true at the time of reporting.\n\n2. Simply reporting an arrest, even if the person is later cleared, is not grounds for defamation if it's factually accurate.\n\n3. However, as demonstrated in the Christopher Jefferies case, newspapers can be held liable for defamation if they go beyond reporting facts and engage in character assassination or sensationalism.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because truthful reporting of an arrest is not defamatory, even if charges are later dropped.\n\n5. Option B is partially correct but oversimplified; using \"arrested\" instead of \"committed\" is important, but not a blanket protection against all defamation claims.\n\n6. Option D is incorrect because while reporting on ongoing investigations has some protections, it doesn't provide blanket immunity from defamation claims, especially if the reporting is sensationalized or goes beyond factual statements.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts from defamation law, apply them to a realistic scenario, and understand the nuances of media reporting on criminal cases."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55130/what-is-the-legal-tax-position-of-a-uk-person-working-remotely-for-uk-firm-in", "docs_id": 55130, "title": "What is the legal &amp; tax position of a UK person working remotely for UK firm, in non-UK locations, in Europe and globally?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by [this question on travel.stackexchange.com](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/157770/my-girlfriend-lives-in-the-uk-and-i-want-to-be-able-to-come-and-leave-as-i-pleas).\n\nI am mainly asking about a UK viewpoint, but am interested others (Europe, USA, commonwealth, etc), because at its root, this is a cross\\-jurisdiction question.\n\nPerson X has a UK limited company Y, and his/her work on consultancy based, often remote, sometimes visiting clients in person.

How would that apply if a team of software developers had a virtual \"pair programming\" session, with one in USA, one in UK, and one in the Far East ? \"Where\" has that software been written?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a tricky question on the intersection of visa and tax laws. It is tricky because every country can make its own rules that apply when you are in that country or do business in that country. Even within the EU, there is no uniform approach because *freedom of movement* merely covers the right to work in a country, but not the rules which have to be followed when doing so. Thus, you have to fall back to reading each individual country's rules and legislation.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Whether you are even allowed to work or which work activities are permitted depends on your visa or visa\\-free status. If you are a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you can come to and work in every EEA country, until the end of the Brexit transition period, subject to the same rules as residents in that country.\n\nOften, visa\\-free visits or business visa allow some business activities such as attending meetings with clients or collecting information, but not performing actual work. If you're interested in what business activities the UK allows visitors from other countries to do, take a look at the [visitor rules](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor-rules).\n* Income tax may be due at the place of tax residency or where the income is generated/earned, in particular where you actually perform the work. There is a widespread belief that you only gain tax residency after staying in one country for 6 months, but this is misleading in the general case: every country makes its own rules, and income tax may be due even without (permanent) tax residency.\n\nThe relevant countries (the country where you work and the country where you normally reside) might have a tax agreement that specifies where tax is due. Within the EU, it is fairly common that a person works in a different country than the one they reside in, so there is a well\\-developed network of tax treaties. Often, certain activities are exempt from local taxes, such as compensation for visiting researchers or regular employment.\n\nThere's also a good chance that profit from independent work / business profits are only taxable at the place(s) where that enterprise has a permanent establishment \u2013 but it depends on the details.\n\nThis section is based on the OECD model tax treaty ([https://doi.org/10\\.1787/mtc\\_cond\\-2017\\-en](https://doi.org/10.1787/mtc_cond-2017-en)) which most treaties follow closely. If no tax treaty exists that exempts your income from local taxation, you must consult the local tax laws.\n* VAT rules are entirely different, and for B2B services are generally taxed at the location of the client (place of supply rules). But every country makes its own rules. Exception: within the EEA, cross\\-border B2B supply is always taxed at and by the client via the reverse\\-charge mechanism.\n\nSo things can get quite tricky, and a business visitor should inform themselves beforehand what activities they are allowed to perform abroad and whether there are tax implications.\n\n> is it any different from a UK author going travelling, taking lots and lots of notes, or even writing his/her next novel whilst in various locations, and publishing once returned to the UK?\n\nHere no tax implications arise because the travelling author is not paid during their travels, but they have to consider visa rules when performing their work. Such rules often have exemptions for artists. However, it depends on the rules of the travelled country.\n\n> what basis does a government have for deciding \"where\" work was done?\n\nEach country is sovereign and can make its own rules.\n\n> How would that apply if a team of software developers had a virtual \"pair programming\" session, with one in USA, one in UK, and one in the Far East ? \"Where\" has that software been written?\n\nIt is not generally relevant where software was written, aside from copyright or export regulation issues which might have their own rules. Since each of the three programmers is working in their own country, no particular visa or income tax issues arise. However, if they have a common employer, the employer does have to consider the local employment laws regardless of where the employer is established, which may include paying some taxes in every country.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based software consultant is considering working remotely from various countries while traveling.

Option C is the most likely to create complex legal and tax implications for several reasons:\n\n1. Duration: A six-month stay in Germany is long enough to potentially trigger tax residency issues. Many countries have specific rules about tax obligations for stays exceeding 183 days (about six months).\n\n2. Work performed: The consultant is actively developing software, which goes beyond permitted activities for many business or tourist visas. This could violate visa regulations.\n\n3. Client location: The US client adds an extra layer of complexity, as it involves cross-border service provision outside of the EU/EEA framework.\n\n4. Permanent establishment: A prolonged stay might be interpreted as creating a \"permanent establishment\" in Germany, which could have significant tax implications for the UK company.\n\nOption A is less problematic due to its short duration and the client being in the UK.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As explained in the documentation, in a judge-only trial (which is typical for small claims court), the judge serves as both the trier of fact and the interpreter of law.\n\n2. The judge's role as trier of fact involves considering all testimony and evidence presented, including verbal accounts of conversations, and making judgments about credibility.\n\n3.

SAo google has no copyright on the resulting translation. But copyright protection is only available for \"original works of authorship\". (See [17 USC 102](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) in the US, and similar laws elsewhere.) A machine\\-produced translation is not an original work, and it is surely not then work of the author of the overall book.\n\nHowever, the author would still have a copyright on the book **as a whole**. The legal situation is no different than if the author had simply quoted a 19th century work. One may incorporate public domain works into a later work, and that later work is still protected by copyright, provided that there is enough original contentr to make the work as a whole \"an original work of authorship\". Others may use the PD \\[arts, or the original from which they are taken, but not the rest of the work (beyond what fair use would allow in any case).\n\nFor example, I have made a number of posts here on LAW.SE.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The original 19th-century article is in the public domain, so there's no copyright on the source material.\n2.

Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, where identification also includes indirect identification with the help of additional information and third parties, or just being able to single out one data subject's records. If there are no reasonable means that could likely lead to identification, the data is truly anonymous and GDPR wouldn't apply. Aggregate statistics are often anonymous.\n\nBut while the results of your survey might not be covered by GDPR, the individual survey responses would definitely be personal data.

The correct answer, B, is the strongest argument for increased valuation because:\n\n1. It combines multiple factors that courts consider when determining damages, including potential future earnings, societal contributions, and the unique value of the individual's work.\n\n2. A renowned medical researcher working on breakthrough cancer treatments represents a significant potential impact on society, which goes beyond mere economic value. This aligns with the higher-end estimates mentioned in the documentation (up to $10 million or more).\n\n3. The work on cancer treatments implies both high earning potential and immeasurable societal benefit, which could justify a valuation well above the standard ranges mentioned in the EPA, FDA, and Transportation Department figures ($7.9-$9.4 million).\n\n4.

Unless the work was created a long time ago, or was created by the US government (not the same as \"funded by government money\"), you should assume that the work is protected. That means that you must have permission to copy it. Sometimes, a work has associated with it some such permission, in the form of a \"license\". Without such a license, you have to request the copyright owner for permission to copy \u2013 whether or not they say that the work is protected by copyright (because by law it is protected, so they don't have to say that it is).\n\nIf you request permission to copy, and do not receive the required permission, then you cannot legally copy the work.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Copyright protection exists automatically for creative works, even without explicit copyright notices. The absence of copyright information doesn't mean the work is unprotected.\n\n2. Lack of response to a permission request doesn't imply consent.

At some point C will replace B as the owner of (or person legally responsible for) the adjoining property.\n\n4 examples capture the situations I can think of:\n\n1. B consents, but sells the property or dies, and C takes over. I assume C either should have taken due diligence and inquired during purchase, or B has a duty to disclose, or C \"took a chance\" on any legal matters if B died leaving no documents behind and C bought it anyway. But in any case, C finds out and objects. **Can C withdraw any of the consents B gave, or is he bound by B's acts so far? Must A re\\-request any consents?**\n2. B sells to C, and subsequently, A raises an unforeseen/unexpected expense allocation dispute. B may have incurred or defrayed the expense, or perhaps some of the inconvenience was suffered by B and some by C. **In either case, the Act only seems to contemplate the current owner/occupier C, being able to engage in the surveyor dispute resolution process. What happens?**\n3. The works are complex and undertaken in stages. Once commenced, they must be completed, but a description of the work for which consent will be requested at stage 2 or 3 cannot be known until stage 1 is complete, which will potentially take more than 12 months. Immediately after being told about the works and serving a consent notice, B (without telling A of this) sells to C, disclosing the stage 1 works and consent notices. A has in writing that B understood there would be further works beyond the original consented party wall notice for stage 1, but these were likely to take place outside the time limit for current consent. Meanwhile C wishes to argue that this constitutes a mere acknowledgement by B of A's future intent, and B clearly did not give PW Act consent to stage 2 or 3, and nor will C. Further the property is safe structurally so \"necessity\" doesn't apply. **Who wins? If C, then how can any owner safeguard himself from that situation? What should A have done if the works might have been of uncertain nature or duration, in his original notice to B?**\n4. A and B, as friends, decide that, as not sending irksome legalistic notices back and forth isn't a breach of the Act or an Offence, they will amicably agree A will do the works on a verbal agreement, and keep B apprised. In return for B's agreement and support, permission to enter B's garden through the side gate as needed, and generally making it easier to do the works, A will in turn undertake the works in a way that costs a bit more but is beneficial to B. In law, this would seem to be valid and also a contract, This works well until B dies and C becomes the owner. C is able to verify from numerous local families, and from emails A produces, that such an agreement did exist in the terms stated. **Is C bound by B's agreement, and can A enforce all, some or none of it, or indeed continue the works, from that point onward?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do the consents and notices stay with the original neighbouring owner, or stay with the property (hence move to the new one)?\n\nConsents remain valid\n\n> How would courts handle the fallout from a midway change of neighbours in practice, given the Act doesn't say a thing on the topic?\n\nIn accordance with the Act.\n\n> How far if at all, is a new owner bound by the consent of a prior owner\n\n100%\n\n1.

However, for any additional work not covered in the original consent, A would need to seek new consent from C.

This scenario involves the concept of beneficial ownership, which distinguishes between legal ownership (having one's name on the account) and beneficial ownership (having a right to the funds in the account).\n\nIn joint accounts, while all parties may have legal ownership and the ability to withdraw funds, this doesn't necessarily mean they have beneficial ownership of all the funds.

They are likely acting to protect the interests of all parties until the beneficial ownership can be clearly established, especially in the absence of a known will.\n\nOption A is incorrect because testamentary succession typically applies to assets not held in joint accounts.

Building anything on common HOA property without HOA permission probably violates the HOA governing documents. The HOA could probably fine you or enjoin you from doing so. If you had followed the HOA process to build something, it would probably have imposed requirements upon who could do the work. This said, if it is a limited common element serving one unit, rather than a general common element serving all units, the HOA might be more tolerant.\n2. But, frequently there is a statute of limitations that is fairly short to complain about building a structure without permission or without a proper permit.\n3. Not all construction work requires building permits or contractor's licenses. A simple patio or deck might not require one. Typically, a local government enacts a version of the Uniform Building Code and you'd have to check municipal ordinances.\n4. Building permits are usually administered by local government, rather than state government officials.\n5.

The correct answer, C, reflects the complexity of the situation:\n\n1. Not all construction work requires building permits or contractor's licenses, so the association needs to check local ordinances to determine if these specific structures required permits.\n\n2. Building anything on common HOA property without permission likely violates HOA governing documents, regardless of permit requirements. This gives the association potential grounds for action.\n\n3. There may be a statute of limitations for complaints about unpermitted structures, but the exact timeframe isn't specified and may vary.\n\n4. Building permits are usually administered by local government, not state-level entities like the DBPR.\n\n5. The association needs to consider all these factors before deciding on a course of action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes all modifications require licensed contractors, which isn't necessarily true for simple structures. Option B oversimplifies the statute of limitations issue and ignores HOA document violations. Option D incorrectly involves the state-level DBPR and arbitrarily limits action to structures built within the last year.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, integrate multiple legal concepts, and identify the most comprehensive approach to addressing the issue."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50124/hotel-in-ibiza-offers-vouchers-upon-booking-cancellation-due-to-coronavirus", "docs_id": 50124, "title": "Hotel in Ibiza offers vouchers upon booking cancellation due to coronavirus", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had made 2 bookings with a hotel in Ibiza with a non\\-refundable rate few months ago.

The appropriate severity of professional discipline for particular kinds of conduct is largely a matter of case law and separate law provides for the procedural framework for administering the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Rules themselves specifically disavow the task of decided what kind if professional discipline is appropriate for any particular kind of conduct of an attorney.\n\nPersonal ethics and behavior are governed primarily by rules 8\\.02 (defamatory speech about judges and other legal officials), and 8\\.04 (various kinds of misconduct including personal misconduct), although there are some stray bits that can come up in connection with other rules.\n\nRule 1\\.08 involves improper conduct in transactions with clients that do not pertain to the matter in which the client is represented (e.g. unfair business deals with clients). Texas is among a minority of states that does not automatically treat having sex with client that commences only after the attorney\\-client relationship is formed as a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 8\\.04 is sometimes called the \"officer and a gentleman\" clause of attorney professional ethics after an analogous provision, [Article 113](https://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/digest/IIIA59.htm), of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to members of the United States armed forces. It is a residual misconduct provision that covers lots of misconduct in a lawyer's personal affairs that isn't otherwise regulated by the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 8,04 and its official comments are as follows:\n\n> Rule 8\\.04\\.

The\n> same is true of abuse of positions of private trust.\n\nWith respect to the portion of the question asking:\n\n> What personal kinds of personal misconduct might result in such\n> penalties?\n\nSome of the most serious violations of the rules that are likely to lead to disbarment include misappropriation of client property, abandonment of a legal practice with active clients, revealing highly prejudicial client confidences with no color of justification for doing so, committing a crime involving fraud or a felony, or failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.\n\nOf those, committing of a crime involving fraud or a felony would be the one most likely to result in disbarment that involves *personal conduct*, as opposed to professional conduct. Other kinds of personal conduct might result in a lesser sanction, however, as noted in Rule 8\\.4\\. Of course, it isn't all that hard to imagine some circumstance \"involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\" (think \"[George Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos)\" absent any criminal conduct) that isn't strictly speaking a crime, or \"conduct constituting obstruction of justice\" in a matter unrelated to client matters (e.g. obstructing an investigation of a family member of the lawyer in connection with an academic institution's investigation) that could rise to this level as well.\n\nBut, again, the matching of punishment to particular conduct is rooted in case law. Also, a pattern of various kinds of misconduct or repeat offenses are often treatment more seriously than a single instance of misconduct by a first offender would be in isolation.\n\nIncidentally, every U.S. jurisdiction has a set of Rules of Professional Conduct with the same numbering system, although the substantive content of different states' rules with the same number is not always the same.\n\nSo, for example, Rule 8\\.4 covers the same subject\\-matter in every U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and every other U.S. territory, even though there may be important substantive differences between the versions of Rule 8\\.4 adopted in different states.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Texas lawyer is facing disciplinary action for multiple instances of misconduct. Which combination of actions would most likely result in disbarment rather than a lesser form of discipline?\n\nA) Engaging in barratry and failing to comply with mandatory continuing legal education requirements\nB) Misappropriating client funds, committing a felony involving moral turpitude, and refusing to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation\nC) Having a sexual relationship with a client that began after representation and making defamatory statements about a judge\nD) Failing to notify of cessation of practice and engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly Rule 8.04 and the commentary provided. The correct answer, B, combines three of the most serious violations mentioned in the documentation:\n\n1. Misappropriation of client property is explicitly stated as one of the \"most serious violations of the rules that are likely to lead to disbarment.\"\n\n2. Committing a felony involving moral turpitude falls under Rule 8.04(a)(2) and is defined as a \"serious crime\" in 8.04(b). The documentation specifically mentions that \"committing a crime involving fraud or a felony\" is one of the personal conduct violations most likely to result in disbarment.\n\n3. Failing to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation is also listed as one of the most serious violations likely to lead to disbarment.\n\nOption A includes violations that, while serious, are not among those most likely to result in disbarment. Barratry is a violation, but not necessarily one of the most severe, and failing to comply with continuing education requirements typically results in administrative suspension rather than disbarment.\n\nOption C involves personal conduct issues, but neither having a sexual relationship with a client (which Texas does not automatically treat as a violation) nor making defamatory statements about a judge (covered under Rule 8.02) are typically grounds for disbarment, especially compared to the more serious violations in option B.\n\nOption D includes administrative violations that, while subject to discipline, are not typically grounds for disbarment unless part of a larger pattern of misconduct.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze and integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and differentiate between levels of severity in professional misconduct, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7272/is-the-benchmarking-clause-in-vmwares-eula-actually-valid", "docs_id": 7272, "title": "Is the Benchmarking clause in VMware&#39;s EULA actually valid?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The [VMware End User License Agreement](https://www.vmware.com/download/eula/universal_eula.html) reads as follows: \n\n> **2\\.4 Benchmarking.** You may use the Software to conduct internal performance testing and benchmarking studies.

I do not see the WSJ TOS mentioning a license required to summarize or rewrite their material.\n\nIt is fundamental that copyright protects the expression of ideas (among other things) but *not* ideas or information. The subtlety with \"information\" is that, in some places like most of Europe a collection of organized information of non\\-copyrightable material can be copyrighted as a whole.\n\nThat is not the case in the U.S. although there was an unsuccessful attempt in the Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act of 2003/4\\.\n\nAlso, plagiarism, appropriation of ideas without attribution, is an academic integrity issue, not a legal issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

The correct answer is B because U.S. copyright law, specifically 17 U.S.C. 102(b), states that copyright protection does not extend to ideas, concepts, or information, regardless of the form in which they are described. \n\nOption A would still be considered copyright infringement as it closely mimics the original expression. Option C, while potentially fair use, might still contain too much of the original expression to be fully safe without permission. Option D could be permissible but might not fully capture the scenario of rewriting an entire article.\n\nOption B most closely aligns with the legal principle that copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. By rewriting the article using different wording while maintaining the same ideas and information, the blogger is creating a new expression of the same underlying non-copyrightable elements (ideas and information), which is permissible under U.S. copyright law.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the distinction between ideas and expression in copyright law, the specific U.S. code citation, and the application of these principles to a real-world scenario.

Option B is the most likely successful strategy for several reasons:\n\n1. The assault occurred 7 years ago, which exceeds the 2-year limit for claiming compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, eliminating option A.\n\n2.

Converting a fine to compensation (option C) is not a standard legal procedure, especially years after the original sentencing.\n\n4.

So long as you have permission from the property owner to be there, you can invoke Castle Doctrine.\n\nIt should be noted that Castle Doctrine is not a law, but rather a legal theory of a narrow self\\-defense claim. In general, Self\\-Defense in the United States breaks down to \"Duty to Flee\" vs. \"Stand Your Ground\" with the latter being much more common in the U.S. while all 50 states have Castle Doctrine in a private space (three do not have it codified but rely on state laws). Castle Doctrine simply means you have a legal right to \"stand your ground\" on your own private property regardless of the state's \"Duty to Flee\" stance in public spaces.\n\nFlorida is a \"Stand Your Ground\" state for purposes of self\\-defense, which means that, so long as you have a legal right to be in a space, you have the right to use deadly force in self\\-defense even if you can retreat from the situation.

If the TOS says scraping is not allowed, you may still be able to license the content; ask them.\n\nI'm sure the site has safeguards to prevent scraping, and subverting those will also be covered in the TOS. Read it. And the legal penalties for breaking their TOS. The TOS is a legal contract you sign when you access the site.\n\n> I reasoned that since the same data is offered online for anyone using\n>  a browser free of charge, should be the same for a program right?\n\nNo. The TOS will outline the difference in usage between humans and bots and scripts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software developer has created a script to automatically scrape real estate data from a website every 24 hours. The website does not provide an API, and the developer had to modify the script's User-Agent to bypass access restrictions. The website's Terms of Service (TOS) prohibit automated data collection. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of running this script?\n\nA) The script is legal because the data is publicly available and free of charge\nB) The script is illegal due to copyright infringement, regardless of the website's TOS\nC) The script's legality depends solely on whether it causes harm to the website's performance\nD) The script likely violates the website's TOS and may infringe on copyright, potentially leading to legal consequences\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts related to web scraping and copyright law. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The website's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit automated data collection, which the script violates. By accessing the website, the developer implicitly agrees to these terms, creating a contractual obligation.\n\n2. Copyright laws generally protect compiled data, even if individual facts are not copyrightable. Regular, systematic copying of data can infringe on these rights, regardless of whether the information is freely accessible.\n\n3. Bypassing technical measures (like changing the User-Agent) to access the data may be seen as circumventing access controls, which could have additional legal implications.\n\n4. The lack of an API and the website's efforts to block scraping indicate that the owners do not consent to automated data collection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because public availability doesn't negate copyright or contractual obligations. Option B is too absolute, as copyright infringement can be nuanced and depend on factors like fair use. Option C is incorrect because legality isn't solely determined by performance impact. This question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple legal concepts and apply them to a real-world scenario in the tech industry."}}
