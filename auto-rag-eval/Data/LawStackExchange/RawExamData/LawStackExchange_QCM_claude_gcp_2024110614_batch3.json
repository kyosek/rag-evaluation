We are paid for the time the same as if we had been working. The self\\-help classes are by a \"Foot Zone\" therapist, and so far have involved both pseudo\\-science and religious undertones and terminology specific to the LDS (\"Mormon\") faith. The subject matter falls far, far outside the scope of work at our small software company. (Here's an article about the speaker, [Julie Cheney](http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/south/elk-ridge/foot-zone-therapy-a-natural-way-to-heal-users-say/article_df09d5f3-86ef-573e-b04e-cdad3da0a0b6.html))\n\nBoth the CEO and our one HR employee (small company, about 40 employees) are fully in support of these classes. These two people backing these classes means that even if it's not technically mandatory, there's certainly pressure for employees to attend or to at least not complain openly about it.\n\nEveryone in attendance was under the impression that it was mandatory, though at the end there was an unclear comment by the CEO indicating that it *might not* be truly mandatory.\n\nI plan to have a 1\\-on\\-1 talk with my manager to bring up the problems I have with this series of courses. I expect he will then bring it up with upper management and/or HR. I have plenty of good points and I already know that this manager disliked the class fairly strongly.\n\nIn the US, and in Utah, are there any laws prohibiting or proscribing this sort of thing by an employer? Does it matter if they are mandatory, as opposed to strongly encouraged but technically not mandatory?\n\nUPDATE:\nAs of Friday, Jan 8th, it's officially mandatory. Good grief.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (For a definitive answer, consult an employment attorney).\n\nAccording to the federal [Equal Opportunity Employment Commission](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/religion.cfm), in general,\n\n> An employee cannot be forced to participate (or not participate) in a religious activity as a condition of employment.\n\nThis requirement comes from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\.\n\nAnswer 14 on [this page](http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/qanda_religion.html) elaborates:\n\n> Some private employers choose to express their own religious beliefs or practices in the workplace, and they are entitled to do so. However, if an employer holds religious services or programs or includes prayer in business meetings, Title VII requires that the employer accommodate an employee who asks to be excused for religious reasons, absent a showing of undue hardship.\n> \n> \n> Similarly, an employer is required to excuse an employee from compulsory personal or professional development training that conflicts with the employee\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would pose an undue hardship. It would be an undue hardship to excuse an employee from training, for example, where the training provides information on how to perform the job, or how to comply with equal employment opportunity obligations, or on other workplace policies, procedures, or legal requirements.\n\nSo the questions would be:\n\n* Is the activity in question a \"religious service or program\"? This might be ambiguous, and you might have to consult an employment attorney for a more informed opinion.\n* Does it \"conflict with your sincerely held religious beliefs or practices\"?\n* Would it be an \"undue hardship\" for the employer to excuse you?\n\nNote that this law might not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. It also doesn't apply if you work for an employer such as a church, or a religiously affiliated hospital or educational institution, or the like.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small software company in Utah has implemented a series of mandatory \"self-help\" classes for employees during work hours. These classes include content with religious undertones specific to the LDS faith and are conducted by a \"Foot Zone\" therapist. An employee objects to attending these classes due to their personal beliefs. What is the most appropriate course of action for the employee to take, considering both legal and professional aspects?\n\nA) Immediately file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nB) Request a formal exemption from the classes citing religious accommodation under Title VII\nC) Discuss concerns with their direct manager and request clarification on the mandatory nature of the classes\nD) Anonymously report the company to the Utah Labor Commission for potential religious discrimination\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the situation from multiple angles, including legal considerations, workplace dynamics, and professional communication. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate first step for several reasons:\n\n1. It aligns with the employee's stated plan to have a 1-on-1 talk with their manager, which is a professional approach to addressing workplace concerns.\n\n2. It allows for clarification on whether the classes are truly mandatory, which is crucial information for determining if there's a potential legal issue. The documentation mentions some ambiguity about the mandatory nature of the classes.\n\n3. It gives the company an opportunity to address the concern internally before escalating to external authorities, which is generally preferred in professional settings.\n\n4. If the discussion doesn't resolve the issue, it establishes a record of the employee's attempt to address the problem through proper channels, which could be important if legal action becomes necessary later.\n\nOption A is premature without first attempting to resolve the issue internally. Option B might be appropriate if the classes are confirmed to be mandatory and have clear religious content, but it's not the best first step. Option D is too drastic as an initial action and could potentially harm the employee's professional relationships.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply knowledge of employment law, professional communication, and conflict resolution to a complex real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than simple recall."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77453/art-commission-and-copyright-issues", "docs_id": 77453, "title": "Art commission and copyright issues", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are artists who takes commission on internet: they create a work based on my request, and I pay them for the work.\n\nIf I make a request which involves other intellectual property, would it be considered copyright infringement?

The correct answer is C because it involves creating a character that is very similar to Iron Man, which is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as a trademarked and copyrighted character owned by Marvel Comics. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, dwarves are mythical creatures and clerics are general terms referring to religious figures. These are not copyrighted concepts and can be freely used in a new game.\n\nOption B is also incorrect for similar reasons. Traditional character archetypes are not copyrightable ideas, but rather general concepts that can be used across various works.\n\nOption D is incorrect because game mechanics themselves are generally not copyrightable.

Did Blizzard have to get licenses from the IP owners to include these references in their games ? This could be a possibility since there is really a *lot* of such references in WOW.\n\nIt could be also covered by 'fair use' but very unlikely.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking pop\\-culture references, like literary references, are neither trademark infringement nor copyright infringement.\n\nTrademarks\n----------\n\nOften a referenced item is in fact not a trademark. Most character names, for example, are not protectable as trademarks, because they are not used to identify the product or service, nor to advertise the product or service for sale. Similarly many pop\\-culture references which are associated with various groups, events, or products are not being used to identify or promote those things, and so are not protectable as trademarks.\n\nEven when a reference is (or includes) a trademarked phrase, it is unlikely to be trademark infringement. As long as the user of the trademarked term or phrase is not using it so as to identify the product or service where it is used, is not using it to advertise or promote that product or service, is not using it in such a way as to cause confusion by reasonable people on what the source of the product or service is, and is not using it so as to falsely state or imply that the product ore service is endorsed, sponsore, or approved by the owner of the trademark, then the use is not in fringement.\n\nOne may use a trademark to identify a related product or service, to indicate compatibility, or to make comparative claims, and that is ***nominative use*** (using the mark as the name of the thing marked). Nominative use is specifically not infringement.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nNames, taglines, titles, mottos, and other short phrases are not protected by copyright at all. See the US Copyright office Circular 33 \\-\\- Works Not Protected by Copyright, where it is stated:\n\n> Words and short phrases, such as names, titles, and slogans, are uncopyrightable because they contain\n> an insufficient amount of authorship. The Office will not register individual words or brief combinations of words, even if the word or short phrase is novel, , distinctive, or lends itself to a play on words.\n\nThis circulart includes as exMPLES:\n\n> * The name of a character\n> * Catchwords or catchphrases\n> * Mottos, slogans, or other short expression\n\nAs I wrote in [https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/60965/what\\-are\\-the\\-fair\\-use\\-rules\\-in\\-the\\-usa\\-for\\-short\\-quotes\\-from\\-books\\-or\\-song\\-lyric](https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/60965/what-are-the-fair-use-rules-in-the-usa-for-short-quotes-from-books-or-song-lyric)\n\n> Literary references, including short quotes, to other works of fiction are commonly allowed as fair use. They are usually appropriately attributed.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Such references normally do not serve as a replacement for the original. They normally do not harm the market, actual or potential for the original. And they are often ***transformative***, that is, they re\\-user has a different purpose and achieves a different effect from the original. All of these factors are important in fair\\-use decisions, and all lean toward fair use for literary or pop\\-culture references.

This approach goes beyond simple references and could be seen as reproducing substantial portions of copyrighted works.\n\nOption A (character names) is likely safe, as names are not copyrightable and rarely protected as trademarks when not used to identify products or services. Option C (catchphrases) falls under \"words and short phrases\" which are not protected by copyright according to the US Copyright Office. Option D (parodying logos) would likely be considered transformative use and protected as fair use or parody.\n\nThe question requires analyzing the different types of references and their potential legal implications, integrating concepts of copyright, trademark, and fair use from the documentation.

The key point comes from the GDPR definition of personal data, which includes \"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\" The Blurhash, despite being a highly abstracted representation, still relates to the identified user and their profile picture. It doesn't matter that the person can't be directly identified from the Blurhash alone.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while copyright considerations might make the Blurhash a derivative work, this doesn't override GDPR requirements for personal data.

If it is not happening, a fair use defense is stronger, if it is happening, a fair use defense is weaker.\n\nThe law, in general especially in common law jurisdictions like the U.S. and England, is incredibly context and fact specific, and copyright law questions of derivative work and fair use are circumstances where this is particularly true.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An independent artist creates an ASCII art version of a famous photograph, which they intend to sell as prints in an online art marketplace.

(so that it could be Googled)\n* What items would be on the list?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Many attorneys would have an \"intake form\" that they would like you to complete in advance, and every lawyer will want your name and contact information at a first meeting. But, other attorneys would prefer to meet with you first, without getting details about the work to be done, as many patent applicants are very reluctant to put information in writing that is shared with others and many patent applicants don't know what is relevant. \n\nThere is no special terminology for the things that you should prepare for prior to meeting with an attorney. And, anyone who completed a provisional patent application is not so half\\-baked in their idea that it is premature to meet with a patent lawyer. Having done a provisional patent application is more than enough due diligence and preparation for such a meeting. \n\nThe marginal cases where preparation by clients is often lacking are those cases where the concept of the invention isn't fully fleshed out yet and the inventor is trying to work with a patent lawyer to figure out what part of \"idea space\" isn't already protected by patents.\n\nThere are basically three kinds of information that are relevant:\n\n1. When was the invention invented, made public, or shared with anyone? Is there anyone else who could be considered a co\\-inventor? For example, if you have an employment agreement discussing intellectual property, you should bring it.\n2. You would need your full provisional patent application, which will explain most of the necessary information but may need to be clarified for a final application. If visual aids are helpful to explaining your invention or you have prototypes small enough to bring with you, you should bring them, even if they are beyond the scope of the provisional patent application's contents.\n3. You ideally should do some due diligence regarding \"prior art\" to provide some assurance that the idea you propose hasn't already been patented or discovered, but not every patent applicant has the ability to do such a prior art search. At a minimum, you should be able to say in good faith that you've never seen a similar invention and explain why you think personally that your invention is novel. Generally, you should not order a professional patent search before you have discussed it with your patent attorney. But, if you are able to do so and have reviewed existing patents, reviewed literature you are able to access, and have done some Google searches for similar ideas, that would be more than reasonable preparation. But, don't delay meeting with a patent lawyer because you haven't done those things. A patent lawyer needs lead time to prepare the application by the deadline for doing so (ideally, several months, and at a minimum, several weeks to a couple of months).\n\nIn addition, you should be prepared to discuss why your invention is not obvious to someone skilled in the relevant field and what utility your patent has to a user of the invention. Similarly, you should be ready to discuss the larger context of the field in which you have an invention, such as how others usually deal with the issue that your invention addresses in the status quo and what other notable new inventions there are in that field. \"Buzz words\" related to your kind of invention are also very helpful for doing searches of prior art.\n\nFinally, you should be prepared to demonstrate that you have the capacity to pay for the patent lawyer's work. Patent lawyers almost never do pro bono (i.e. charitable) patent work for individual inventors (sometimes they might, for example, for a university clinic aimed at inventing things for use in the Third World), and are loathe to do work on a contingent or on credit basis, although sometimes they would be willing to work on credit if you could provide security for the debt beyond the patent itself (e.g. putting the equity in your home up as collateral).\n\nA patent lawyer would almost always charge more than $10,000 to do the work beyond an initial consultation (which wouldn't be free but might cost $100\\-$1000\\), and often a patent could cost $100,000 for each patent for legal work, if it was at all complex. \n\nPatent lawyer have among the highest hourly rates of all kinds of attorneys. So, the more clearly thought out you are, the better organized your paperwork is, and the more efficiently you can communicate your invention, the less you will pay for meeting with the patent lawyer while \"the meter is running.\"\n\nEven in the unlikely case that the patent lawyer will do the work on credit, the patent lawyer will at a minimum insist that you provide the filing fees up front. If you are truly broke, you need a business partner to finance the patenting process for you. You can look at the relevant fee schedules at the patent and trademark office website. The patent lawyer would also expect any out of pocket costs for things like a professional prior art search, having quality drawings prepared, courier fees, and mailing costs to be paid in advance, even if doing some of the legal work on credit.

The correct answer, B, directly addresses the potential discrimination issue raised in the documentation. \n\nThe Brexit agreement, as described, would allow EU laws to continue applying in the UK, enforced by EU institutions.

Otherwise, you will need to dig in the particularities of your case.\n\nNote that HR's mere presentation to you of \"all the benefits\" is not necessarily tantamount to you \"*ha\\[ving] no reason to read that policy document*\".

Option C is the most effective strategy because it focuses on the key legal concept of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. By arguing that the company obscured an important clause by hiding it in a separate document, the employee can potentially demonstrate that the company acted in bad faith.\n\nOption A is incorrect because referencing external documents in contracts is generally acceptable if done properly.

The key factors to consider are:\n\n1. The tenants signed a lease with individuals who misrepresented themselves as landlords, which could be considered fraud.\n2.

It maintains transparency by providing detailed disclosures about the true nature of deposits as loans to the bank and the associated risks.

One is that it violates some specific (statutory) law, the other is that it violates some common\\-law principle especially pertaining to contracts. We can quickly dispose of the possibility that you have violated a statutory law: there is nowhere in the US where you are compelled by law to do anything about foreign language classes (take, avoid, pass, whatever). \n\nYour university has the right to establish and enforce whatever requirements it deems proper for awarding degrees and credits, and has the legal power to act broadly in providing an education. Let's say that they have stated a requirement that everybody must take 2 quarters of some foreign language, then if you don't do that, they are entitled to withhold the degree from you. Whereas, if you had satisfied all of the requirements for the degree, then they could not arbitrarily withhold the degree \\-\\- it is now a thing that you have a property right to.\n\nJust as the university has the right to impose requirements (with appropriate advance notice), they also have the right to suspend requirements, generally or according to circumstances (as long as it is not arbitrary). A typical actual example is \"that class hasn't been taught for 3 years\". In this case, the requirement was not suspended, but an agent of the university acting within the scope of their appointment judged that the requirement had already been satisfied in your case. The university administration might not actually approve of the professor's choice and might change their rules or sanction the professor (at *my* university this was common practice, albeit never officially sanctioned), but it is the sort of thing that is within the scope of the professor's job (to judge that you have satisfied the \"bottom\\-line\" requirements of the course).

Which of the following legal scenarios is most likely to occur?\n\nA) The student could be prosecuted for fraud, as they misrepresented their language skills to gain course credit.\nB) The university could legally rescind the student's degree, citing violation of academic integrity policies.\nC) The professor could be held personally liable for breach of contract with the university.\nD) The university would likely be unable to rescind the degree without facing significant legal challenges.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario most closely aligns with option D. The documentation states that the university has the right to establish and enforce requirements, but also to suspend them or judge them as satisfied through its agents (in this case, the professor). The professor, acting within their scope of appointment, made a judgment that the student had satisfied the course requirements. Even if the university administration disagrees with this decision, the student acted in good faith, believing the professor's actions were allowed. \n\nThe explanation explicitly states that \"the university would be buying itself a pile of legal trouble if it were to rescind your degree.\" This indicates that option D is the most legally sound outcome. Options A and B are incorrect because there's no indication of fraud or academic integrity violation by the student, who followed the professor's guidance.

The correct answer, B, best addresses the entrepreneur's stated needs while balancing the interests of all parties involved.\n\nOption A, while providing the most control to the LLC, is likely excessive given the entrepreneur's statement that they \"don't mind not owning copyright.\" This could also discourage collaboration with talented photographers and models who want to retain their copyright.\n\nOption B aligns with the entrepreneur's desire for distribution rights without full copyright ownership. A licensing agreement with exclusive distribution rights for a fixed term allows the LLC to use the photos for their intended purpose while respecting the creators' intellectual property rights. This arrangement can be structured to accommodate potential future paid work and provides a clear legal framework for all parties.\n\nOption C lacks the formal protection needed in a business relationship and could lead to disputes over usage rights and compensation in the future. While no money is being exchanged initially, the entrepreneur mentions potential future payments, making a formal agreement necessary.\n\nOption D is overly casual for a business arrangement and fails to provide any legal protection for the entrepreneur or the creatives. It doesn't address the distribution rights the entrepreneur seeks and could lead to misunderstandings and legal issues down the line.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the respondent to consider multiple factors: the entrepreneur's stated needs, the potential for future paid work, the rights of the creatives, and the importance of formal agreements in business relationships.

Could the vandal either be prosecuted or sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some problems with this kind of vandalism, one of them clearly that the internet is international and vandalism can be performed from everywhere on servers everywhere in the world. And so it may be (both technically and legally) difficult to get hold of the vandal. Therefore, most wikis primarily focus on blocking offending accounts or their IPs and hope that this helps at least for a while. Only if it doesn't and the vandalism continues for extended time periods, legal measures are considered.\n\nLegally speaking though, vandalism is prohibited by many jurisdictions and of course by the terms of use of the wiki operators.\n\nFor instance, the [Swiss criminal code](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en) Art 147 explicitly puts \"abusing of data processing equipment\" under penalty and hence gives website operators a legal backup for setting up rules for the use of their services.\n\n> Computer fraud\n> Art. 147\n\n> 1 Any person who with a view to his own or another's unlawful gain, by the incorrect, incomplete or unauthorised use of data, or in a similar way, influences the electronic or similar processing or transmission of data and as a result causes the transfer of financial assets, thus occasioning loss to another, or immediately thereafter conceals such a transfer shall be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty.\n\n> 2 If the offender acts for commercial gain, he shall be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding ten years or to a monetary penalty of not less than 90 daily penalty units.\n\nTechnically, the law even requires prosecution *ex officio*, even though without a hint from the operator, the police won't start an investigation. I'm sure the US has a similar law. The problem is, as with all internet crimes, it's practical application, particularly because often website operator and offender are not living in the same country.\n\n**Edit**\nAfter reading the exact text again (it was unavailable yesterday) Art 147 is mostly about fraud performed by computers (classical \"hacking\") but it shouldn't be difficult to argue that fighting and reverting vandalism requires significant (technical and personal) effort and hence the operator looses money. Additionally, there's Art 144bis which matches even better for the scenario here:\n\n> Damage to data\n> Art. 144bis\n\n> 1.

The company wants to pursue legal action. Which of the following approaches is most likely to be effective in addressing this issue?\n\nA) File a lawsuit in U.S. federal court for copyright infringement\nB) Implement stricter IP blocking and account creation policies\nC) Pursue criminal charges under local cybercrime laws where possible\nD) Sue individual vandals for monetary damages in civil court\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal and practical challenges of addressing wiki vandalism in an international context. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that \"most wikis primarily focus on blocking offending accounts or their IPs\" as the first line of defense. This is because it's the most immediately effective and practical solution.\n\n2. Legal measures are typically considered only if vandalism \"continues for extended time periods,\" suggesting that technical solutions are preferred initially.\n\n3. The international nature of the internet makes legal prosecution challenging, as noted: \"the internet is international and vandalism can be performed from everywhere on servers everywhere in the world.\"\n\n4.

Basically saying \"Look, you kids are running all over my property. I've warned them that thy can get hurt falling on a rock or wall. Now, you are warned as well.

I know it sounds harsh, but you said New England; that's where I live and I know the trespass laws are *not* in your favor ... especially when it comes to kids. Take Connecticut as an example: This is their law on trespass and kids (not just attractive nuisance!):\n\n> A possessor of land owes each person who enters his land a certain\n> duty of care based on the person's status. The legal significance is\n> that a possessor of land has the duty to an invitee to inspect the\n> premises for hidden defects and to repair or erect safeguards, if\n> necessary, to make the premises reasonably safe. He has no duty to\n> inspect or to repair or erect safeguards for licensees. But he is\n> liable if he knows of a condition, realizes it involves unreasonable\n> risk, has reason to believe the licensee will not discover it, and he\n> permits the licensee to enter or remain without warning or making the\n> condition reasonably safe.\n\nGenerally, an owner owes trespassers no duty of care because he has no reason to expect them to be on his property. Therefore, he does not have to warn or protect them from potentially harmful conditions on the property.\nHowever, *an exception applies if a property owner knows, or has reason to anticipate, that children will trespass on his land. In this case, a special duty arises and the owner must take steps to **protect children** from any of the property's dangerous conditions.* The post you just made indicates even you think that the rock walls, or other \"normal garden features\" could be dangerous; and they can be!\n\nThe law requires that ***you*** take reasonable steps to eliminate the condition or by otherwise keeping children away from it.\n\n### DUTY OWED TO TRESPASSER\n\nIn Connecticut, the following rules apply to a possessor of land with respect to a trespasser.\n\n1. He may not intentionally harm the trespasser or lay a trap for him.\n2. The trespasser is entitled to due care after his presence is actually known.\n3. There is no duty owed regarding the condition of the premises.\n4. The possessor of land has no duty to trespassers if he is engaged in a dangerous activity until the person's presence is know.\n5. The possessor of land has no duty to warn trespassers of dangerous hidden conditions (Conn. Law of Torts, \u00a7 47\\).\n\n### Duty Owed to Trespassing Children\n\nConnecticut's appellate courts have adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts rule regarding the duty of a property owner to trespassing children (Duggan v. Esposito, 178 Conn. 156 (1979\\), Neal v. Shiels, Inc., 166 Conn. 3 (1974\\), Greene v. DiFazio, 148 Conn. 419 (1961\\), Wolfe v. Rehbein, 123 Conn. 110 (1937\\), Yeske v. Avon Old Farms School, Inc., 1 Conn. App. 195 (1984\\)).\n\n> Under this rule, if an owner knows or has reason to know that children\n> will be on his property, he has the duty to protect them from injury\n> by either fixing the harmful condition or ensuring that the children\n> will not have access to that part of the property.\n> \n> \n> The rule states that a possessor of land is liable for harm to\n> trespassing children caused by an artificial condition on the land if\n> (1\\) the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely\n> to trespass in that place, (2\\) the condition is one the possessor\n> knows or has reason to know and should realize will involve an\n> unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to children, (3\\) the\n> children because of their youth do not discover the condition or\n> realize the risk, (4\\) the utility of maintaining the condition and the\n> burden of eliminating the danger are slight compared with the risk to\n> children involved, and (5\\) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable\n> care to eliminate the danger or otherwise protect children\n> (Restatement (Second), 2 Torts 339\\).\n\nPut in the letter that you are disclaiming any liability for injury to them that may occur on your property, and make them aware of all the ways they could be injured \u2013 so they've been informed. You don't have a duty to remove rock walls because unsupervised kids jump off them. They are not invitees, they are trespassers. So make it known you do not want them on the land and for any further breach you will call the police. Because otherwise you could be responsible.\n\nUsing CT again as an example, you could include the legal statute about trespass in your notice:\n\n### Trespass Crimes and Infractions\n\n> A person commits first degree criminal trespass when (1\\) he enters or\n> remains in a building or any other premises after the owner or an\n> authorized person personally communicates an order to leave or not\n> enter and (2\\) he knows that he is not licensed or privileged to be\n> there.

This approach addresses several key legal considerations:\n\n1. It establishes a formal record of communication, which is crucial in potential future legal proceedings.\n\n2. The letter can include specific references to trespass laws, as mentioned in the documentation. For example, citing Connecticut's law on trespass and children demonstrates the homeowner's awareness of legal obligations.\n\n3. By detailing potential dangers on the property, the homeowner fulfills their duty to warn about conditions that could pose an \"unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to children.\"\n\n4. The certified mail ensures proof of receipt, which is important in establishing that the parents were informed of the situation.\n\n5. This approach goes beyond simple verbal warnings (option B), which may not be legally sufficient or provable.\n\n6. It's more comprehensive and legally sound than just installing \"No Trespassing\" signs (option A), which alone may not fully protect the homeowner given the special duty owed to trespassing children.\n\n7.

Is there such a method?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are correct that it is quite expensive to patent something in U.S. law.\n\nUnder U.S. patent law, once an idea is publicly published, if no one else has a patent application for the same idea that is pending, the idea enters the public domain and no one can obtain a patent of that idea. The publication become \"prior art\" with respect to any future patent application which cannot be protected by patent law.\n\nOf course, if you publish an invention which you discovered independently, that someone else already has a patent application pending for that will be approved the following week, the fact that you published it after the patent was applied for doesn't prevent the person with the pending patent application from having it approved.\n\nThe term \"invention\" rather than \"idea\" is what I will use for the remainder of this answer, because there are many ideas which may not be patented, while the lion's share of patentable ideas are appropriately described as \"inventions.\" But, understand that as used in this answer, the term \"invention\" is being used to refer to the concepts and ideas necessary to make the invention, and not to a particular instance of a product made using those concepts and ideas.\n\nWhen an invention is in the public domain, anyone can utilize the invention free of charge without a license. People who use the invention are not even required to acknowledge that you invented or discovered it.\n\nAn invention is also not eligible to be patented if more than a year has elapsed since the first sale of a product using it. But, in that case, the invention can still be protected as a trade secret until it is voluntarily disclosed in some fashion to someone who is not subject to a non\\-disclosure agreement. (I say voluntary, because the fact that, for example, an unauthorized corporate spy sees the trade secret doesn't end the status of the invention as a trade secret.)\n\nSome inventions, are effectively publicly disclosed and published the moment that anyone looks at it closely. \n\nThe patentable element of other inventions are invisible to an end user, or to observer of an end user.\n\nFor example, if the invention involves something in the interior of a device, or the invention involves something not visible to the naked eye (e.g. a process for synthesizing an industrial chemical from other chemicals where the chemical formula of the ingredients and end result can't be determined without a microscope or analytical chemistry tests), merely showing someone a product made using the invention will not put it in the public domain.\n\nIt is generally legal to reverse engineer or independently come up with an invention which is merely a trade secret. It is not legal to use a patented invention or process, even if it is not directly copied and is instead reverse engineered or independently discovered, during the lifetime of the patent.\n\nThere is no straightforward way to put an invention into the public domain while retaining any right to acknowledgement that you invented it or otherwise exercise control through a licensing agreement without patenting it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An inventor has developed a novel manufacturing process but is concerned about the high costs of patenting. They want to prevent others from patenting the idea while making it freely available for public use. Which of the following strategies would best achieve this goal while potentially preserving some recognition for the inventor?\n\nA) File a provisional patent application and abandon it after one year\nB) Publish a detailed description of the process in a peer-reviewed journal\nC) License the invention using a Creative Commons-style agreement\nD) Register the process as a trade secret and selectively disclose it\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because publishing a detailed description of the process in a peer-reviewed journal would effectively place the invention in the public domain. The documentation states, \"Under U.S. patent law, once an idea is publicly published, if no one else has a patent application for the same idea that is pending, the idea enters the public domain and no one can obtain a patent of that idea.\" This strategy achieves the inventor's goal of preventing others from patenting the idea while making it freely available for public use. Additionally, publication in a peer-reviewed journal could provide some recognition for the inventor, although it doesn't guarantee control or mandatory acknowledgment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because filing and abandoning a provisional patent application doesn't necessarily put the invention in the public domain or prevent others from patenting it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation doesn't support the existence of a Creative Commons-style agreement for inventions. It states, \"There is no straightforward way to put an invention into the public domain while retaining any right to acknowledgement that you invented it or otherwise exercise control through a licensing agreement without patenting it.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because registering the process as a trade secret and selectively disclosing it doesn't achieve the goal of making the invention freely available for public use. The documentation mentions that trade secrets can be protected until voluntarily disclosed, but this approach doesn't prevent others from potentially patenting the idea if they independently develop it.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a real-world scenario involving intellectual property strategy."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82321/wording-in-a-legal-document-made-in-an-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk", "docs_id": 82321, "title": "wording in a legal document made in an Employment Tribunal in the UK", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a legal document, pertaining to an Employment Tribunal held in the UK, what does the following statement mean:\n\n\"Save as expressly admitted or denied above, no admissions are made as to any part of the Claimant's claim.\"\n\nIt sounds to me that the solicitor is saying that \"even if we missed something out in our denials, then we deny it\"?\n\nOr does it mean \"we are saying nothing about any claims made if we did not notice that claim\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Literally that they only admit or deny the claim(s) they explicitly stated they admit or deny, they do not admit to anything else by implication or inference.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A law firm is preparing a response to a claim filed against their client in an Employment Tribunal in the UK.

It means that the responding party (in this case, the law firm) is only admitting or denying the specific points they have explicitly addressed in their response. This statement serves to prevent any unintended admissions by implication or inference.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the phrase doesn't automatically deny all unaddressed claims; it simply doesn't admit to them. Option B is misleading, as while the firm may address additional claims later, this isn't the primary purpose of the statement. Option D is incorrect because the statement doesn't request the tribunal to disregard any claims; it merely clarifies the scope of the firm's admissions and denials.\n\nThe correct interpretation (Option C) aligns with the explanation provided in the documentation, which states that they \"only admit or deny the claim(s) they explicitly stated they admit or deny, they do not admit to anything else by implication or inference.\" This approach protects the responding party from accidentally admitting to claims they haven't thoroughly considered or intentionally addressed, while also not outright denying claims they haven't specifically rebutted.\n\nThis question requires the examinee to analyze the legal language, understand its implications in the context of tribunal proceedings, and apply this understanding to determine the most accurate interpretation of the phrase's legal effect."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45356/is-it-duress-if-you-feel-you-are-forced-to-sign-a-contract-by-an-employer", "docs_id": 45356, "title": "Is it duress if you feel you are forced to sign a contract by an employer?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I was promoted, I was given a significant sign\\-on bonus, but was made to sign a document that said if I left within 12 months, I would have to pay back the gross amount in around two weeks.\n\nI want to say I was made to sign it under unfair circumstances and come to an agreement with my employer.\n\nIs there any reasonable claim to duress, coercion or a similar description that applies to this situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If I did not sign promotion bonus document, my career would be over.

I'm pretty sure that, just a few years ago when I lived there, all such packaging had indication of trademark status. Did the law change since then? Can someone provide details, please? (Or maybe those three marks happened to lose their trademark status and are up for grabs?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Trademark symbols\n-----------------\n\nSuch symbols and notices were never required. Many company lawyers thought that they helped make a stronger case for infringement actions if someone did infringe.

However failure to use it may reduce the damages available in the case of infringement.\n\nI cannot find any provision of US law authorizing or requiring the use of the tm symbol. It appears to be a matter of common law, that is judge\\-made law, and a reference to court cases would be needed.\n\nThere have been significant developments in US trademark law in recent years, but mostly in the degree to which First Amendment concerns are being held to limit tr4ademark protections. I found no change in regard to the symbols, their use, meaning or effect.\n\nMany countries, unlike the US, do not grant protection to trademarks unless they are registered, so the tm symbol is largely a US usage.\n\nWhat Changed?\n-------------\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in US law on this issue in recent years. I see lots of tm and \u00ae symbols on everyday products. I just looked at the power supply for my laptop and it has a tm after the maker's name. I just looked at a candy bar wrapper and it carries an \u00ae. If there WAS a recent court case that changed the practice or influenced a change I haven't heard of it, and I've done some reading in recent major trademark cases. But I am not a lawyer, much less an IP lawyer, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnother possibility is that the comparatively large symbol adjacent to the large logo on the front of the package was removed, and a smaller logo, with symbol, was placed on the back of the package.

Obviously concerned, I asked her how much she had drank, to please stop and indicated I could keep him for an additional couple of hours while she took efforts to sober up.

For example, you know for sure that the other parent is drunk and driving, or the other parent is drunk and on the ground unable to move and the child is in danger, etc.\n\nIf you involve the police over your partner excessive drinking than, and they find that she was not excessively drinking, you will face false accusation charges and her lawyer will try to make you look like the bad guy trying to take away her children.\n\n**how drunk does my ex have to be for me to deny a drop\\-off?

It would be wise to have a witness around, so write down the person name as well for reference, (NOT MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO BE WITNESSES, But you can write down the people names that you know were around that incident.)

It really reduces to this sentence: \"Having concluded there's no genuine dispute as to any of the material facts, I conclude that the Plaintiff is\nentitled to judgment on liability as a matter of law\". There is ample discussion in the preceding pages establishing that the two sides agreed on the legally\\-material facts. Defendants (who represented themselves) may have had some idea for a \"matter of law\" defense, and did propose that plaintiff is a \"public figure\" (thus bring in the \"actual malice\" standard), but the judge ruled against that.

The judge stated, \"Having concluded there's no genuine dispute as to any of the material facts, I conclude that the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment on liability as a matter of law.\" This indicates that the court found Fetzer's statements to be provably false, not matters of opinion.\n\nThe \"opinion based on disclosed facts\" defense typically protects statements that are clearly presented as the speaker's interpretation of facts. However, in this case, Fetzer's claims about the death certificate being fake were presented as factual assertions, not opinions. The court found no genuine dispute about the material facts \u2013 namely, that the death certificate was authentic and that Fetzer's statements about it were false.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the issue wasn't Fetzer's lack of evidence, but rather that his statements were deemed false statements of fact, not opinions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the judge specifically ruled against the plaintiff being a public figure, which would have raised the standard for defamation.\n\nOption D, while potentially true, is not the primary legal reason for the failure of the defense. The core issue was the nature of the statements as false facts rather than opinions, not the specific accusations made.\n\nThis case illustrates the limits of the \"opinion based on disclosed facts\" defense in defamation law, especially when dealing with provably false statements presented as facts rather than clearly labeled opinions or interpretations."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59925/can-a-law-enforcement-officer-temporarily-grant-his-authority-to-another", "docs_id": 59925, "title": "Can a law enforcement officer temporarily &#39;grant&#39; his authority to another?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The emergency services dispatch of Small\\-town, USA receives a call from a citizen near city limits. The citizen placed the call after he drove past a roadkill deer off to the side of the road.

To my knowledge, a LEO is the only one with the authority \u2013 save a wildlife related authority \u2013 who could discharge a firearm for the purpose of euthanizing a wounded animal. So my question here is:\n\n**Can an officer legally authorize the citizen to shoot the animal instead?**\n\n(Since the call is so far out it may not be worth the police resources if there are other calls to handle.)\n\nIf so:\n\n**Does this apply to dispatch as well? Can the officer allow *dispatch* to tell the citizen that he has permission?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nThis is governed by state law (for state law enforcement officers granting this authority) or federal law (in the case of authority granted by a federal law enforcement officer), so the details may vary from case to case.\n\nIn many circumstances, however, a law enforcement officer has the authority to temporarily 'grant' his authority to another private citizen in order to deal with a specific incident.\n\nWhen this is done one says that the law enforcement officer \"deputized\" the person who was given this authority.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### The Power To Deputize Civilians\n\nMost states have statutory circumstances under which certain kinds of law enforcement officers can deputize a non\\-law enforcement officer to carry out a law enforcement function under the supervision, direction and control of a law enforcement officer, on an incident by incident basis.\n\nFor example, if a single sheriff responds to a bar fight with several people who need to be arrested, under most state's law, the sheriff could authorize a bouncer or patron at the bar who wouldn't have the power to make a citizen's arrest under the circumstances (e.g. because the patron arrived at the scene after the alleged fight took place) to detain a suspect whom the sheriff has the power to arrest, until additional law enforcement personnel can come to the scene to assist.\n\nColorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 16\\-3\\-202 is typical of such a statute. It states:\n\n> (1\\)\u2002A peace officer making an arrest may command the assistance of any\n> person who is in the vicinity.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002A person commanded to assist a peace officer has the same\n> authority to arrest as the officer who commands his assistance.\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002A person commanded to assist a peace officer in making an arrest\n> shall not be civilly or criminally liable for any reasonable conduct\n> in aid of the officer or for any acts expressly directed by the\n> officer.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)\u2002Private citizens, acting in good faith, shall be immune from any\n> civil liability for reporting to any police officer or law enforcement\n> authority the commission or suspected commission of any crime or for\n> giving other information to aid in the prevention of any crime.\n\nFurther, another Colorado statute provides that \"conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when it is required or authorized by a provision of law or a judicial decree binding in Colorado,\" including laws \"defining duties of private citizens to assist public servants in the performance of certain of their functions.\" Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 18\\-1\\-701 (in pertinent parts).\n\nThe exact details of how someone is deputized, who may deputize someone, and what authority this conveys varies in detail from state to state. Also, often this is done piecemeal, rather than globally, or is implied in part under common law agency principles. The power of a law enforcement officer to deputize someone to kill a dying deer hit in a car accident is likely to be in a different statutory section than the power of a law enforcement officer to deputize someone to make an arrest.\n\nPeople who are deputized by a law enforcement officer in this fashion are collectively called a [posse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse).\n\nThe posse was heavily used in rural areas and frontier areas into the early 20th century, but this authority is now, while still utilized, much less commonly used, and less familiar, especially in urban areas with large professional police departments. In these areas, it is more common for police to resort to mutual aid agreements with regional law enforcement agencies to seek reinforcements who are law enforcement officers at some other agency, rather than seeking help from private citizens.\n\n### Other Solutions\n\nOften, conduct that literally fits the definition of prohibited conduct, like possession of a wildlife carcass without a license, is resolved in regulations or definitions in a statute or regulation that exclude the conduct in question from what is prohibited.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, the definition of hunting, which is what you need a license to do, is defined in such a way as to exclude road kill related incidents. *See, e.g.,* Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 33\\-1\\-102(25\\.5\\), (29\\) and (43\\).\n\n### The Legal Doctrine Of Reliance On Official Authority\n\nThere is also another legal doctrine that can make it possible to achieve almost the same result.\n\nAs a matter of U.S. Constitutional law, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a criminal defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance upon authoritative assurances that the defendant will not be punished for his actions. *See U.S. v. Laub*, 385 U.S. 475 (1967\\); *Cox v. Louisiana*, 379 U.S. 559 (1965\\); and *Raley v. Ohio*, 360 U.S. 423 (1959\\).\n\nFor example, suppose that a 911 dispatcher tells a passing motorist that she has the authority to authorize the motorist to shoot and kill the deer because she is deputizing the motorist to do so, and that the applicable state law actually provides that a private citizen may be deputized to euthanize a deer struck in a car accident when a law enforcement officer deputizing the citizen is physically present. Despite this fact, if the motorist has no reason to believe that the dispatcher doesn't have this authority (even though the dispatcher does not have this authority under state law), the motorist is immune from criminal liability for shooting a deer out of season without a license pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court cases cited above.\n\nAnd, while the dispatcher's conduct may have technically violated state law by directing someone to violate the law under circumstances when the dispatcher did not have the authority to do so, the District Attorney is likely to decide that this technical violation of the state's hunting laws by the dispatcher, whether or not the dispatcher knew that the dispatcher did not have the authority to deputize the motorist, is not an offense that warrants prosecution. Indeed, prosecutors routinely overlook technical violations of the law by law enforcement officers who are carrying out their duties in good faith or for other non\\-selfish reasons (e.g. out of a desire to treat the downed deer humanely without diverting law enforcement resources urgently needed elsewhere at the time).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A citizen calls the emergency dispatch of Small-town, USA about a mortally wounded deer on the roadside.

The most appropriate action balances legal authority, humane treatment of the animal, and resource management.\n\nOption B is correct because:\n\n1. It respects the legal authority structure. As mentioned in the documentation, law enforcement officers often have the power to deputize civilians for specific incidents. By having the officer verbally deputize the citizen through the dispatcher, we maintain the proper chain of command.\n\n2. It addresses the issue of distance and resource management. The question states that the nearest officer is 30 minutes away, making this a practical solution that doesn't unnecessarily tie up police resources.\n\n3. It provides a legal framework for the citizen's actions. By being deputized, the citizen would likely be protected from criminal liability under statutes similar to Colorado's CRS \u00a7 16-3-202, which provides immunity for those assisting officers.\n\n4. It allows for humane treatment of the animal without overstepping legal boundaries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because dispatchers typically don't have the authority to directly authorize such actions. This could lead to legal complications.\n\nOption C, while legally safe, ignores the animal's suffering and doesn't address the immediate issue, conflicting with the goal of humane treatment.\n\nOption D is problematic as it provides no clear authorization or protection for the citizen's actions, potentially leading to legal issues.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple ideas from the documentation, including deputization, resource management, and the limits of dispatcher authority."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94588/what-is-the-origin-of-the-term-court-as-a-reference-to-the-judicial-institutio", "docs_id": 94588, "title": "What is the origin of the term \u201ccourt\u201d as a reference to the judicial institution?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does the legal usage of the word court as in a court of law derive from the idea of a royal court, as an expression of the idea that the original courts of law were ultimately simple vehicles for the exercise or discharge of royal authority on behalf of the royal sovereign?\n\nIf not, then what is the origin of the use of the word court to denote the judicial institutions that we call courts of law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does the legal usage of the word court as in a court of law derive from the idea of a royal court, as an expression of the idea that the original courts of law were ultimately simple vehicles for the exercise or discharge of royal authority on behalf of the royal sovereign?\n\n[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court#Etymology):\n\n> The meaning of a judicial assembly is first attested in the 12th century, and derives from the earlier usage to designate a sovereign and his entourage, which met to adjudicate disputes....", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In a mock trial simulation, students are debating the historical development of legal institutions.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. States have the constitutional power to regulate or deregulate combat sports. The documentation clearly states that \"States have the power to ban boxing, football, wrestling, judo, lacrosse, hockey, rugby, fencing, and any other contract sport if they wish to do so, under the U.S. Constitution.\" This implies that deregulation would also be constitutional.\n\n2.

The correct answer, B, addresses the core problem identified in the documentation: that an agent cannot ethically or legally represent multiple direct competitors selling identical goods due to the inherent conflict with fiduciary duties.\n\nBy structuring the relationship as a consignment arrangement or independent reseller model, the company avoids the legal pitfalls of agency. This approach allows the individual to sell products from multiple manufacturers without breaching fiduciary duties, as they would be operating as an independent entity rather than as an agent for any particular company.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, the conflict of interest in representing direct competitors is too severe to be waived by a simple clause in an agency agreement.

To protect its competitive advantage, WonderWidget takes all sorts of measures to ensure that AAA Widgets never learns about the benefits of the cinnamon additive.\n> \n> \n> WonderWidgets hires Jane, an engineer with a PhD in cinnamonology to make improvements to the additive. She signs a confidentiality agreement promising to protet the company's trade secrets. After a year with WonderWidgets, Jane is recruited by AAA Widgets. WonderWidgets sues them both to prevent them from consummating an employment relationship.\n\nAssuming that the information Jane acquired from WonderWidgets is a protected trade secret, the idea here is that everyone knows exactly why AAA is hiring Jane, and that it would basically be impossible for Jane to work for them without applying the knowledge she acquired from WonderWidgets, i.e., there her employment would lead to an inevitable disclosure of WonderWidgets' trade secrets.\n\nI think most people would agree that there's at least a reasonable argument to be made in favor of WonderWidgets, there are also efforts to apply this doctrine in much shakier circumstances. For instance, WonderWidgets might try to prevent its janitor from going to work for AAA because it taught him how to mop floors, and it has cleaner floors than AAA, and therefore its cleaning techniques must be superior, and therefore those techniques must be protected.\n\nThere are some states in which WonderWidgets would win the cinnamon case, and some where Jane would win, because the state doesn't recognize inevitable\\-disclosure at all. I don't know of any states where WonderWidgets would win the janitor case.\n\nOf course, most cases are not as clean\\-cut as either of these hypotheticals, but I'd say the one you're asking about is closer to the second one than the first.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer, Alice, leaves her job at TechCorp to start her own AI company. TechCorp sues Alice, claiming she's using their intellectual property. Alice argues she's only using general knowledge and skills gained during her employment. Given the legal principles discussed, which of the following scenarios would most likely result in a successful lawsuit by TechCorp?\n\nA) Alice uses publicly available machine learning algorithms similar to those she worked with at TechCorp\nB) Alice implements a unique AI model she conceptualized but didn't develop while at TechCorp\nC) Alice replicates TechCorp's proprietary AI training process, which significantly outperforms standard methods\nD) Alice hires former TechCorp colleagues to work on general AI problems they're familiar with\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the \"inevitable disclosure\" doctrine and the balance between an employee's right to use their skills and an employer's right to protect trade secrets. Option C is the correct answer because it involves the direct replication of a proprietary process, which likely constitutes a protected trade secret. This scenario most closely aligns with the \"cinnamon additive\" example in the documentation, where specific, non-public knowledge is being used.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using publicly available algorithms doesn't involve proprietary information. Option B is less likely to succeed as a lawsuit because ideas conceptualized but not developed at the previous job are generally considered the employee's intellectual property. Option D, while potentially concerning for the employer, doesn't necessarily involve the use of trade secrets if the employees are working on general AI problems rather than specific proprietary techniques.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the legal principles, application to a new scenario, and evaluation of the varying degrees of intellectual property infringement, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22470/who-is-responsible-for-copyright-infringement-on-p2p-distributed-systems", "docs_id": 22470, "title": "Who is responsible for copyright infringement on P2P distributed systems?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's suppose there is a P2P system for storing files on a blockchain.

Or could the legal responsibility fall onto the uploaders?\n\nI'm not sure which governments or jurisdictions could claim copyright ownerships since the blockchain is replicated worldwide.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No government would claim claim copyright ownership, except in the case that a government had received copyright for a work from some source (e.g. a donation). It is the author of the work who claims ownership.\n\nYou will have to figure out the technical details of such file sharing, but the legal details are pretty simple: everybody involved would be liable. Any such data is contained on one of more physical devices, and gets copied to one or more devices. Each act of copying is an infringing act, so if there are copyings to 1,000,000 devices, there are 1,000,000 devices whose owners are liable for copyright infringement.\n\nThe person who distribute the software might also be liable, per [MGM v.

Liability would be less likely if the service were a legitimate file\\-storing system that typically was used legitimately. Since tracking down a million servers is a bit of a task, the software distributors are likely to be the first target.\n\nAs for *where* a person would sue, the issue is not where the infringers are, it is where the protection exists: is the work protected by US law?

The documentation states that \"everybody involved would be liable,\" which includes both uploaders and block holders (node operators) who have copies of the infringing content.\n2.

That permission can be rescinded, but only by the owner. The owner seems to have given permission and has stated in advance some conditions under which permission might be rescinded. The towing company could be called (by the owner) to act as the agent for the owner and remove the offending vehicle; but the towing company cannot just up an do this on their own. If they *were* to spontaneously tow a vehicle without officially acting on behalf of the owner, they would be liable for damages, owing to their having torted some guy's chattels. So the company will want to know that they are protected, in acting as the agent of the property owner. One way to do that is to verify that the person calling the towing company is the owner. Another would be to get the caller to swear that they are the owner and indemnify them against damages, in case they get sued. That pound of cure is more costly and annoying than the ounce of prevention of making sure that you're towing a car with proper authorization, so it's unlikely that they would just tow the car on your say\\-so.\n\nYou might try suing the complex owner for some kind of breach of contract, if you think you have a contractual right to a parking space and they are negligent in doing what's necessary to meet your contractual right.

The tenant cannot directly contact a towing company (A) because, as explained in the top answer, towing companies will only act on the authorization of the property owner.

The question is, who is responsible, the vendor or the manufacturer? Under The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the manufacturer primarily bears liability. The bad news is that the seller is not primarily responsible, unless they have \"done something\" with the product (installed it, modified it, further warrantied it), but also is \"the identity of the manufacturer is not known or if known the service of notice or process or warrant cannot be affected on the manufacturer or it the manufacturer is not subject to the law which is force in India\", i.e. the manufacturer is in another country and isn't subject to Indian law.

In this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal obligations and implications?\n\nA) The DA must provide all discovery materials directly to the defendant once they choose to proceed pro se.\nB) The judge has the authority to prohibit the former attorney from sharing discovery materials with the defendant.\nC) The defendant's right to discovery is satisfied when materials are provided to their initial court-appointed attorney.\nD) The former attorney is legally obligated to provide copies of all discovery materials to the defendant upon request.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of discovery rules and pro se representation in criminal proceedings. The correct answer is C because the DA's obligation to provide discovery is fulfilled when the materials are given to the defendant's attorney of record, even if the defendant later chooses to represent themselves. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the DA is not required to provide discovery directly to the defendant if it was already given to their attorney. Option B is a distractor based on the judge's actions in the scenario, but it misrepresents the judge's actual authority in such matters. Option D is incorrect because while it might seem logical, the former attorney is not legally obligated to provide copies to the defendant, especially if instructed otherwise by the judge.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the legal principles involved, integration of multiple concepts (discovery rules, pro se representation, attorney-client relationships), and application to a real-world scenario.

I can do this by subcontracting (in which case the rights and obligations are still mine \\- I'm just using someone else to fulfil them), or by selling individual contracts (which is how debt collection businesses operate), or by selling the entire business.\n\nIt would be completely normal that the contracts you agreed to when you opened your accounts would allow the bank to sell them.

The documentation states that \"Contracts are transferrable\" as a default rule, and this likely applies to bank accounts unless explicitly stated otherwise in the terms.\n2. The answer suggests reviewing the original account terms and conditions, which aligns with the advice given in the documentation to \"Check the terms and conditions.\"\n3.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. California law, which supersedes lease agreements, explicitly protects tenants from being charged for normal wear and tear, regardless of initial property condition.\n\n2. The lease itself includes a clause stating that the security deposit may be used to \"repair damage, excluding ordinary wear and tear,\" which aligns with state law.\n\n3. The \"new\" condition acknowledgment in the lease establishes a baseline for the property's condition but does not override the legal protection against charges for normal wear and tear.\n\n4. The landlord's attempt to renovate the entire property at the tenant's expense likely goes beyond addressing specific damages and enters the realm of normal wear and tear, which is not the tenant's responsibility.\n\n5.

My conclusion is that for most of the web\\-sites we manage, Google's IP anonymization is *adequate* to ensure *security of processing* as required by the DPIA process. However, on some sites that are likely to visited by users interested in what the GDPR calls \"special categories of personal data\" (Article 9\\), we either do not use Google Analytics, or we add additional layers of security in case the USA Government orders Google to disregard the stipulations in the DPA and hand over the data (yes, the US Government can legally do that \\- read the fine print in the Privacy Shield accord).\n\nAs for Facebook Analytics, I think you've simply misunderstood their [policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).\n\nNowhere in that policy document does Facebook say that they \"are not collecting Personal Identifiable Information\".\n\nAFAIK, they collect tons of it, in all sorts of obnoxious and sneaky ways.\n\nWhat they actually say about PII in the context of Analytics is this:\n\n> We do not *share* information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.\n\nLet me remind you that one of their \"analytics partners\" was Cambridge Analytica, so if this promise not to share is true, it looks like a pretty new policy.\n\nOK, moving on to cookie compliance.\n\nTo you (the controller), both Google and Facebook are processors.\n\nGiven the history of the NSA and the methods it have used and AFAIK still use to get US\\-based companies to hand over the personal data about Europeans through orders issued by secret FISA courts, plus the fact that total nutcases currently are in charge in the USA, I am not going to rely on the privacy policy of any US\\-company for protection of personal data.\n\nSo *if* I make use of Google Analytics (and I often do, they provide a great service), I always make sure that my users opt\\-in on that (hard cookie concent), even I make use of their IP anonymization feature (YMMV).\n\nAs for Facebook, the fact that they promise *not* to share PII with third parties is irrelevant because they *collect* personal data.

Under [Ontario law](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-l15/latest/rso-1990-c-l15.html), to establish a prescriptive easement, the trespassers would have to prove to the court that they:\n\n> 1. Used the property without permission;\n\n> 2. Used it openly and peacefully; and,\n\n> 3. Used it **continuously, uninterruptedly for 20 years.** (You can interrupt their use by giving them permission to use it for 20 years!)\n\n([This article](https://www.hummingbirdlaw.com/property-easements/) summarizes easements in Ontario; the discussion in [a recent decision](http://limitations.ca/?p=694) discusses the statutes in some detail.)\n\n**Implied Easement:** An easement is *implied* if it is necessary for the use of the property. For example, take your previous question. If your parents severed a portion of their property and sold it to you, there would be an implied easement across their land to give you access to the severed portion. The reasoning being that you would only buy the land if you had access to it, so you have the easement as an implication of buying it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A property developer is considering purchasing a wooded lot in Ontario that lies between two existing properties. The neighboring property owners have been using an informal path through this lot for their children to play together for the past 15 years. The developer plans to build on the lot, which may disrupt this path. What is the most accurate legal assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The neighbors have an implied easement due to the path's long-standing use\nB) The developer can freely build without considering the path, as it's not essential for property access\nC) The neighbors could potentially claim a prescriptive easement, but haven't met all the legal requirements yet\nD) The developer must maintain the path as it's considered a \"luxury access\" between properties\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the concept of easements in Ontario law, particularly prescriptive easements. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The neighbors don't have an implied easement, as these are typically for necessary access, not convenience (ruling out option A).\n2. While the developer isn't automatically obligated to maintain the path (ruling out option D), they can't disregard it entirely due to potential legal implications (ruling out option B).\n3. The situation most closely aligns with a potential prescriptive easement. However, the neighbors haven't met all the requirements yet:\n   - They've used the property without permission (assuming)\n   - They've used it openly and peacefully (likely)\n   - But they haven't used it continuously for 20 years (only 15 years mentioned)\n\nThis question tests the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple aspects of easement law.

The new owners of the house are using the parcel without permission, including mowing the lawn, installing a swing set, and building a fire pit. The original owner has attempted to sell the parcel and has put up \"No Trespassing\" signs, which are repeatedly removed. Given this scenario, what is the most critical legal consideration for the parcel owner to address?\n\nA) Immediate filing of a criminal trespassing complaint against the new homeowners\nB) Negotiation of a formal lease agreement for the parcel's use\nC) Prevention of adverse possession through timely legal action\nD) Seeking damages for the unauthorized improvements made to the parcel\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most critical legal consideration in this scenario is the prevention of adverse possession. In Ohio, the period for adverse possession is 21 years, as mentioned in the documentation. The new homeowners' actions (using the land, mowing it, installing structures, and removing \"No Trespassing\" signs) could potentially lead to a claim of adverse possession if left unchallenged for the statutory period.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D address aspects of the situation, they don't capture the most significant long-term legal risk.

Option D (seeking damages) doesn't address the core issue of potential loss of ownership.\n\nOption C is the most appropriate because it recognizes the urgency of taking legal action to assert ownership and prevent the possibility of losing the property through adverse possession. This aligns with the advice in the documentation to hire an attorney and take the matter to court, as simply asking the new homeowners to stop using the land has been ineffective.

We never had a good brother relationship. We always try to avoid each other as best as we can.

Instead, break\\-ins are (depending on the nature of the crime) prosecuted as trespassing (Hausfriedensbruch, \u00a7 123 StGB), criminal damage (Sachbesch\u00e4digung, \u00a7 303 StGB) and/or theft (Diebstahl, \u00a7 242 StGB). (Some cases may fit additonal statutory offenses, e. g. tampering with an electronic lock can be computer fraud (Computerbetrug, \u00a7 263a StGB) and hurting someone can be robbery (Raub, \u00a7 249 StGB) and/or personal injury (K\u00f6rperverletzung, \u00a7 223 StGB).)\n\nThis means: If your brother breaks the lock, then that's vandalism. If your brother walks in (without authorization), it's trespassing and if your brother steals your stuff, it's stealing.\n\nOn top of that, since your brother is living in the same household as you, breaking into your room may also be considered domestic violence. The violence protection act (Gewaltschutzgesetz) is very harsh when it comes to domestic violence: The offender can be ordered by court to hand over their home to the victim and to stay away from the home. This means that if your brother breaks into your room, your brother may be removed from the house by court order.\n\nNon\\-compliance with a court order issued under the Gewaltschutzgesetz (e. g. your brother tries to show up at your house after he was ordered to stay away), can be prosecuted under civil *and*(!) penal law.\n\nYou can read the English translation of the German penal code (STrafgesetzbuch, StGB) here (although I prefer to use German because all translations at gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de tend to be low quality): [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/englisch\\_stgb/englisch\\_stgb.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html) \n\nAnd the Violence protection act is here (unfortunately untranslated):\n[https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001\\.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001.html)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

But, British statutes did not have direct force and effect in the U.S. after independence.\n\nAs much as anything else, this simply reflect how the nature of statutes v. common law was understood in the late 18th and early 19th century. Nobody expected that British statutes would be directly applicable, so they weren't.\n\nThere may have been instances where common law rules actually had their roots in British statutes that were mostly forgotten in long layers of British common law case law, and many statutes expressly adopting British case law also expressly incorporate selected relevant British statutes of generally applicability. But, no British statutes were applicable \"automatically\" in the U.S.\n\n> For example, before Congress enacted the Naturalization Act of 1790,\n> would a person born outside the US to a US citizen father have been a\n> US citizen by dint of the US \"inheriting\" the British Nationality Act\n> 1772 mutatis mutandis?\n\nNo. Basic ways of thinking about what nationality or citizenship even was or meant would have been received, but not by receiving the British Nationality Act 1772 as U.S. law.\n\n> And before Congress enacted the Crimes Act of 1790, would an American\n> who levied war against the US, gave aid and comfort to its enemies, or\n> counterfeited US currency have been convicted and sentenced under the\n> Treason Act 1351?\n\nNot really.\n\nFrom the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 until the adoption of the Articles of Confederation on June 11, 1777, as a practical matter, the revolutionary forced had very little actual control of the courts in an enforceable way, there was an insurgency against the British underway, and it was an ad hoc effort from day to day and month to month that was muddled through without a formal structure or guidance at a colony by colony level, or even more granularly within a colony.\n\nIn the period from June 11, 1777 until the new U.S. Constitution was implemented in 1789\\-1790, under the [Articles of Confederation](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation), the situation was fluid and irregular. State governments made most statutory and common law, adopting their colonial era colonial statutes but not necessarily British statutes that their local legislature didn't adopt. Central government laws usually acted on the states, not directly on individuals, much like treaties today. There was little or no directly applicable central government legislation.\n\nMany topics, like citizenship, were simply ignored in this era. The U.S. Constitution adopted in 1789, and the initial acts of the First Congress to implement it, were a response to the realization that after the war and its immediate aftermath had settled down, that the newly formed country needed to regularize, institutionalize, and deal with a lot of governance issues and legal questions that nobody had had the time or resources or authority to deal with while a war had been going on.\n\nFor much of this time period the Revolutionary War was in progress and it wasn't always obvious who even controlled the courts or had practice authority to enforce court judgments. The [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) was not concluded until 1783\\.\n\nIt was an improvisation at first, and not necessarily a uniform one, since the Articles of Confederation conceived of the U.S. as many countries in an alliance with each other rather than an actual single nation that had to address legal issues uniformly.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the federal court system under the U.S. Constitution of 1789 that remains in force, the only institution of the central government was Congress and its committees, which functioned as a legislative body, a body selecting people with executive authority, and as a court of last resort from state court judgments. Everything was carried out at the state level except for courts\\-martial.\n\nStructurally, the Articles of Confederation were a fused system, akin to the U.K. Parliament which had its highest court of appeals and its prime ministership fused with the legislative authority of parliament, layered on top of 13 separate sovereign state governments.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the period between the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the implementation of the U.S. Constitution (1789-1790), a dispute arises regarding the citizenship status of a child born abroad to an American father.

Words in any statute, charter or ordinance giving authority to 3 or more persons authorize a majority to act when the statute, charter or ordinance does not otherwise specify. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a vacancy on an elected or appointed body does not in itself impair the authority of the remaining members to act unless a statute, charter or ordinance expressly prohibits the body from acting during the period of any vacancy and does not in itself affect the validity of any action no matter when taken.\n2. [Shall; must; may.](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/1/title1sec71.html) \"Shall\" and \"must\" are terms of equal weight that indicate a mandatory duty, action or requirement. \"May\" indicates authorization or permission to act.

Additional meetings must be held as necessary to conduct the business of the board and may be convened at the call of the chair or a majority of the board members. Four members of the board constitute a quorum.\n\nAnd finally, since it might be relevant, here is one general rule pertaining to all occupational boards...\n\n6. Quorum; chair (Title 10 \u00a78010\\) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a majority of the members serving on a board or commission under section 8001, subsection 38 constitutes a quorum. The board or commission shall elect its chair.\n\n---\n\nI want to know how a vacancy on this board might affect the actions the board can take. Suppose there are only 6 members appointed to the 7 member board for the course of 2 calendar years.\n\nLaw \\#1, which I cited above, almost seems to answer the question in favor of the undermanned boards. However, that law says specifically that where **authority** is given to a group, then the majority of that group is permitted to act. Law \\#1 does not say that where a **duty** is imposed upon a board, that the majority may assume that duty alone. And we see that there is definitely a distinction in law \\#2\\. Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nIf you're thinking is that we would be lead to an absurd conclusion in thinking the whole of the land surveyor's board would be required to also (as in law \\#4\\) \"administer and enforce\" and that the \"obvious\" purpose of law \\#1 was to avoid such a burden, I think it is certainly possible that the board could develop its own bylaws to handle voting procedures during absences. If the board, on day 1, voted to empower a smaller minority to handle certain business, that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation. No?\n\nIt is not so important to me that there **always** 100% of the time be a full board. The important thing to me is that these occupational boards are meant to be filled by a majority of professionals in the field, plus a couple of lay persons for balance. Guess which seats are empty most often? The lay persons. I understand you can't always get people to show up, but if the laws say the board is composed of lay persons too, they ought to show up at least once a year like the law says. That's my take, and I think it provides a little bit of legislative intent to back up that side of the argument.\n\nCase history on this sort of thing is scant, as far as I can see. Again, I reiterate the question...here in Maine, how do you think vacancies on a board impact board actions? And why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Point \\#1 put simply says that when a decision or action (mandatory or otherwise) is given to 3 or more people then the decision of the majority is binding. For 1 or 2 people the decision must be unanimous.\n\nA quorum is either a) what the boards rules say (point 5\\) or b) a majority of the board (point 6\\) whichever is lesser. For the board you detail (7 members 4 for a quorum) the answer is the same either way \\- 4 members at the meetings make a valid meeting.\n\nIf there are 4 or more members on the board, the board can function providing that 4 or more members attend each meeting. \n\n> Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nNo, there must be one meeting where a quorum is in attendance.\n\n> ... that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation.

The criteria for *appointment* to the boards may specify a given number of professionals and lay\\-persons, however, once appointed they are *all* board members.

Basically, the story is that Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin put every melody on a hard drive, thus automatically copyrighting them, in order to defend the independent creation of small musicians. In the following thought experiment, I am going to take one step further and try to copyright all creative works created hereafter. I'm not sure of its practicality, but I assure you it would be fun.\n\nLet me first introduce the Infinity Hard Drive. It is simply a device that echoes back its input. For example, if you feed a document/painting/music into it, it would echo back the identical document/painting/music. Essentially, it is merely a repeater that is unable to store anything like a conventional one, but you will see why I call it a hard drive in a moment.\n\nSay Alice publishes her creative work, and I would like to sue her for violating my copyright. I have the evidence that if someone feeds Alice's work into the Infinity Hard Drive, it will return the identical work. In fact, you can find anything in the Infinity Hard Drive, as long as you know what you are looking for.\n\nYou might say \"Seriously? You are literally taking Alice's work to generate yours!\" But think about it: what would Alice do if Bob sues her for violating his copyright law? She would read Bob's work, and try to find the relevant drafts on her drawer that proves her work is original and independent. Relevance is the key here: if Alice has thousands of drafts at hand, it would make no sense to submit all of them to a court in response to a lawsuit concerning a specific work. Alice can read Bob's work to find her relevant work, so why can't the Infinity Hard Drive read someone's work to find my original work? I am arguing that conceptually, the process is more like using Alice's work to query my infinite collection of creative works to compute the location where my work resides, rather than generating one from scratch. Maybe Alice doesn't need to read Bob's whole work, but this is because her collection is finite. The Infinity Hard Drive is infinite in capacity, so naturally, it takes more information to find a specific work. In fact, Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin also need to take a melody to locate its counterpart in their hard drive, so if their approach works, so will mine.\n\nTo reiterate, the Infinity Hard Drive serves as a \"tangible medium of expression\" of my infinite collection of creative works. From my understanding, the internal mechanism of such a media does not matter. It can be a piece of paper, an SSD, or the Infinity Hard Drive which conceptually contains everything. What really matters is the outcome, that \"(works) can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\"\n\nJust to clarify, what I\u2019m trying to (automatically) copyright is not the Infinity Hard Drive itself, or the process of \"querying\" stuff in it, or the idea of making one. I am copyrighting the conceptual contents within. Just like you don't copyright the ink on a paper or electronic signals on a hard drive; you copyright the conceptual content born.\n\nI probably also need to prove that my work is \"the result of creative decisions of a human being\", but that is arguable. We know that [a randomly\\-generated book is not a violation of copyright](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1985/is-a-randomly-generated-book-a-violation-of-copyright). Also, how could J.K. Rowling prove her work is creative instead of the accurate deception of an alternative universe? Anyway, if the contents of the Infinity Hard Drive is not copyrightable, then nothing is, because it contains everything.\n\nFinally, how do I prove that Alice had access to my infinite collection of creative works prior to her creation? Well, you are reading this right now, and the Infinity Hard Drive is, in fact, ubiquitous, e.g. a mirror, or a computer that echoes back your keystrokes on the screen.\n\nNow, can I sue you for copyright infringement with the Infinity Hard Drive? To extend the scope of this question a little, can I also claim its ownership? originality? If the answers to the above questions are all \"No\", then can I defend myself from a copyright infringement lawsuit with the Infinity Hard Drive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright requires originality\n------------------------------\n\nYour infinity hard drive appears to be a machine designed to violate copyright by immediately copying anything presented to it.\n\nDamien Riehl and Noah Rubin were creating original melodies. These do not have copyright until they are fixed in a tangible medium. That's what the hard drive is for. This is insurance against *them* being sued if they release a song and someone claims it violates that person's copyright \\- they can produce in court the melody with a date stamp of 2015 (or whatever). GitHub or similar would be even better evidence.\n\nIn this context there is a specific allegation that melody X infringes copyright.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The cellular provider can sue the consumer for breach of contract, but cannot sue the repair shop due to the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act.\n\nB) Both the consumer and the repair shop are protected from legal action by the cellular provider due to the DMCA exception created by the 2014 law.\n\nC) The cellular provider's terms of service override the DMCA exception, allowing them to sue both the consumer and the repair shop for financial damages.\n\nD) The consumer is protected by the DMCA exception, but the repair shop may be liable for inducing breach of contract between the consumer and the cellular provider.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and their real-world application. The correct answer is B because the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act of 2014 created an exception within the DMCA that explicitly permits users to circumvent technological restrictions for the purpose of unlocking their phones. This law takes precedence over any attempt by cellular providers to circumvent it through terms of service agreements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misinterprets the scope of the DMCA exception, which protects both consumers and those who assist them in unlocking phones. Option C is incorrect because terms of service cannot override federal law. Option D is a plausible distractor that misunderstands the extent of the DMCA exception's protection.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of information about the DMCA exception, the nature of contract law, and the limits of terms of service agreements.

The data is collected (e.g. hard drives), it is typically loaded into a litigation support application. There will be a formal definition of responsive document. In the Enron case it was certain type of trades. Responsive documents are identified and redacted. This is formally called review. Typically each page produced will have a bates number. Then the documents and agreed meta data are produced to the opposing party. There are a few common formats for these load files. Along with the production will be a chain of custody showing what server(s) and people that had access. It is formally called a production. Like me as a programmer they don't typically even let me have access to the customer data. If I have to get in I certainly don't change data but they would need to list me as someone that had access. Not every produced document will be introduced as evidence. The sides have to provide each other and the court a list of documents by bates number. There is no formal chain of custody between the time it is produced and introduced as evidence that I can tell.

The correct answer is C because the documentation clearly states that uploading videos without holding the copyright or a specific license is universally accepted as copyright infringement.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, \"Everything is allowed unless it is prohibited.\" There's no mention of specific laws in Finland prohibiting travel to Italy during the pandemic.\n\n2. The analogy to drunk driving is addressed, but the key difference is that drunk driving laws have been specifically enacted, while in this case, there's no mention of similar laws for pandemic-related travel.\n\n3. The documentation emphasizes that travel restrictions are political decisions, not legal ones. If the Finnish government hadn't explicitly prohibited travel to Italy, there would likely be no legal basis for punishment.\n\n4. However, the social implications of knowingly risking public health are significant, which aligns with the \"social repercussions\" mentioned in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of such laws in Finland, and the drunk driving analogy is explicitly contrasted.

Similarity depends on the overall effect of a mark, and the main test is the likelihood of confusion or deception of reasonable customers or potential customers. If the text is, say, multiple words, none of which is the word \"supreme\" or any similar word, then it might arguably be not the Supreme logo, but a different logo that has some similar elements.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"some versions of the 'Supreme' Logo have been successfully registered,\" meaning that using an exact copy with different text (option A) would likely still be considered infringement.\n\n2.

In that early form, the King's Court exercised both judicial and legislative functions. In 1215, with the Magna Carta and the beginning of Parliaments, [the House of Lords assumed the judicial functions of the King's Court](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834884).\n\nPrior to 1876, it was possible for any member of the House of Lords to hear appeals. Eventually, however, the judicial function tended to be exercised by those appointed specifically to judicial office in the House of Lords, although this was not a formal restriction until 1876\\.\n\nSince 1876 and [until 2009](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/), the judicial function of the House of Lords was formally restricted to be exercised by the [Law Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary) (see s. 5 of the [*Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/39-40/59/enacted/data.pdf)). However, the outcome of the appeal was also still formally an action of the entire House of Lords, on the recommendation of the panel of Law Lords that heard the appeal (see Stanley Clark, [\"Gentlemen, Their Lordships\", p. 1443\\-44](https://books.google.ca/books?id=OBE7jTuhi74C&pg=PA1443&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). And custom was that only the Law Lords that heard the appeal would vote, with all other members of the House of Lords abstaining.1 Rather than lords via hereditary peerage, the Law Lords were Lords/Ladies holding special qualifications and having received specific appointment to be a \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.\" Among other qualifications, they would have already served in a high court or practised as a barrister for fifteen years.\n\nAs an example of the kind of background a person might have before appointment as a Law Lord, this is [Lord Denning's Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Denning,_Baron_Denning):\n\n> He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 and became a King's Counsel in 1938\\. Denning became a judge in 1944 when he was appointed to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and transferred to the King's Bench Division in 1945\\. He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1948 after less than five years in the High Court. He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1957 and after five years in the House of Lords returned to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls in 1962, a position he held for twenty years.\n\nIn 2009, the judicial function of the House of Lords [was transfered to the UK Supreme Court](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/).

In common law jurisdictions, the \u201charm\u201d must be some sort of clear and imminent peril to life and safety, such as the situation you describe (although B needs to prove all the elements).

The factor that would most significantly weaken Person A's defense is option B, where they continue to drive the vehicle for several hours after escaping immediate danger.\n\nThis directly contradicts the requirement that \"they ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed.\" By continuing to drive the stolen vehicle long after the immediate threat has subsided, Person A would be exceeding the scope of the necessity defense.\n\nOption A is irrelevant to the legal defense, as the value or type of vehicle doesn't impact the necessity of the action. \n\nOption C might slightly weaken the defense by reducing the perceived immediacy of the threat, but an armed assailant, even if injured, still presents a clear danger to life.\n\nOption D could potentially weaken the defense by suggesting there were alternatives available, but it doesn't as directly violate the principles of the necessity defense as option B does. Passing businesses might not guarantee safety, especially if the assailant is in close pursuit.\n\nOption B most clearly demonstrates a failure to meet one of the key requirements of the necessity defense, making it the strongest factor in weakening Person A's legal position."}, "95": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46383/does-canada-have-a-law-against-automatic-software-updates", "docs_id": 46383, "title": "Does Canada Have A Law Against Automatic Software Updates?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![Windows 10 Setup 1909 Legal Agreement](https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2KGk.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2KGk.png)\n\nThe Windows 10 1909 November setup license agreement has a provision which seems to suggest Microsoft must provide Canadians with the ability to entirely disable updates.

What I'm curious about is how enforceable this aspect of the contract is.

A written contract merely serves as evidence (really good evidence) of what those terms and conditions were.\n\nFor this to matter, it would have to be part of a dispute about the contract. If the parties looking at the term know and agree on what it means then that is what it means. If there is a dispute about this term then a 3rd party (e.g. judge, arbitrator) will look at the term and the context of the contract (both the written contract and the actions of the parties in giving effect to the contract) and decide what they think the parties meant.\n\nFor the example given, I don't think there is any room for dispute about what is meant and it would be disingenuous of either party to claim that there could be. \"Time is of the essence\" is a commonly used legal phrase with a well understood meaning \\- it explicitly makes time a condition of the contract; generally, time is a warranty. A condition is a term for which termination of the contract is a possible remedy; you cannot terminate for breach of a warranty. \"Time of the essence\" is either a typo or, if deliberate, is clearly trying to get across the same concept.\n\nTL;DR\n\n100% enforceable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about contract law and the \"time is of the essence\" clause, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner is reviewing a commercial lease agreement that includes the clause \"TIME OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS LEASE\" without further explanation.

While the documentation suggests that \"TIME OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS LEASE\" would likely be enforceable and understood to mean the same as the standard \"time is of the essence\" clause, the lack of explanation and slight variation from the standard phrasing could potentially create ambiguity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as explained in the documentation, minor grammatical errors or typos do not typically render a clause unenforceable if the intent is clear. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the \"time is of the essence\" clause itself is not inherently unfair to either party; it simply makes time a condition of the contract rather than a warranty.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the clause is not redundant; it serves a specific legal purpose in making time a condition of the contract.\n\nThe question requires analysis of the given information, application of legal principles, and consideration of potential real-world implications in a contract dispute scenario.

The reason for the limitation is that if your employer asks for money back, you obviously should be able to defend yourself, for example by proving that you never received that money. After five or six years it is assumed that you wouldn't be able to provide any such evidence, so nobody can ask for the money back anymore. \n\nThat's not specific to overpaid wages but quite general. \n\nIn addition there is the question whether the pilots should have known they were overpaid. For example, I'm quite happy with my salary, but if it was less, I would look for and find a different job that pays better. If the company claimed in five years time that I had been overpaid all the time, then I would say that if they had given me the \"correct\" lower payment, I would have found a better job elsewhere, so asking me to repay the money seems quite unfair. \n\n(Why do you need to defend yourself?

The correct answer is C because the situation presents \"specific and articulable facts\" that go beyond mere suspicion of unnecessary travel. The documentation states that \"8 teenagers in a car repeated driving a loop experientially looks like cruising, which is not in the category of necessary travel.\" In this scenario, we have four young adults (similar to teenagers) repeatedly driving through the same area (analogous to \"driving a loop\"), which aligns with the example given.\n\nThis behavior, combined with the late hour and the existence of a \"shelter in place\" order, provides the officer with reasonable suspicion to conduct a Terry stop. It's important to note that this doesn't reach the level of probable cause (eliminating option A), but it goes beyond a mere hunch or feeling (eliminating option B).\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests an overly restrictive interpretation that isn't supported by the documentation. The answer requires integrating the concept of reasonable suspicion with the specific circumstances of the COVID-19 restrictions and the observed behavior.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal principles to a novel situation, requiring critical thinking about how \"specific and articulable facts\" can be interpreted in the context of temporary emergency orders."}}
