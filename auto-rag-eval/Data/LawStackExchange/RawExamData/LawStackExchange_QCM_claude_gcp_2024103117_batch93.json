Turns out, the [DBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name) they run by has zero connection to a corporation or a limited liability company, if any. (Or at least you couldn't find any...)\n\nYou need to name all the defendants on the front page of your superior court complaint (including Doe defendants and people under a DBA or with a fictitious business name or a once business now forfeited, suspended or dissolved etc.).\n\nWhen naming actual businesses, it looks something like this: \"ONE ROUND PEACH, INC., dba PEACH, a corporation\" or \"TWO SMALL CHERRIES, LLC, dba CHERRIES, a limited liability company\", or in the case of Doe defendants, for example, simply put at the end \"and DOES 1 through x, inclusive\" where \"x\" is whatever number of Doe defendants are referenced in the complaint or may be referenced in the future.\n\nFor e.g.:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FY2vT.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FY2vT.png)\n\nHow does a defendant look like among the named defendants of the first page here who you only know by their DBA or fictitious name or they don't even have anything else?\n\nMaybe \"dba S.H. LONG BANANA, a fictitious business\" or what is the best practice? *What's the spiel?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, one quick bit of terminology. The top of the front page of a summons and of a legal complaint (which also usually appears at the top of the front page of every other document filed in a case, although sometimes in abbreviated form) in a civil lawsuit is called the **caption** of the case.\n\nSecond, it doesn't sound to me like the business is \"fictitious\". If it truly didn't exist, you wouldn't be suing it, because you could never serve anyone associated with it with process and couldn't collect or enforce a judgment against anyone if you won the lawsuit.\n\nInstead, it is fair to assume that there is a real business that someone or some group of people conduct business under that has a certain name, which isn't registered with the Secretary of State or other appropriate official in the state in which you are bringing suit, or in any other state known to you.\n\nSuppose that that name under which business was conducted by this firm was \" S.H. LONG BANANA\".\n\nYou could sue **\"S.H. LONG BANANA, a business doing business in California that is not registered with the Secretary of State in the State of California.\"** or simply **\"S.H. LONG BANANA\".**\n\nThis would be agnostic over whether it is a sole proprietorship operating under a trade name not registered in California, a general partnership, an unregistered trust doing business under an unregistered trade name, or an unincorporated nonprofit association, or formally formed entity registered in another state that is doing business in California without authorization to do so.\n\nAn unregistered business owned and conducted by one person is, by default, a sole proprietorship unless some other business form is registered, or there is a trust conducting business through its trustee.\n\nA group of two or more people who conduct a business for profit that is not registered is by default a general partnership.\n\nA group of two or more people who conduct the affairs of an unregistered organizations not for profit, are by default an unincorporated association.\n\nAlso, your inability to find a registration of an entity in the State of California means that an entity is not authorized to do business in the State of California, but does not not mean that it isn't registered as a corporation, limited liability company, non\\-profit corporation, cooperative, limited partnership association, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability limited partnership, or some other kind of entity (e.g. a GmbH under German law) in some other jurisdiction unknown to you.\n\nIt isn't that uncommon for a business from another state to fail to register with the state as a foreign business operating in the state. The main penalty for a foreign business not registering in a state is that it isn't allowed to bring lawsuits in that state's courts until it is registered.\n\nIf you know that one or more of the principals is James Wyn (a name I chose from a character in a work of fiction lest I defame anyone), you might instead, or in addition, sue **\"James Wyn, dba S.H. LONG BANNANA\".**\n\nUsually, you are going to need at least one natural person to sue so that you can deliver a summons and complaint to that person.\n\nIf you aren't close to the statute of limitations, you may be able to sue that natural person who you can identify, get preliminary disclosures or discovery, and then amend your complaint to state the true defendants.\n\nThe Racketeering and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) also recognizes the possibility of bringing suit against a group of people who comprise a *de facto* criminal enterprise, and you could look at examples of how lawsuits brought under that statute (which authorizes private civil causes of action as well as criminal charges) in that manner are captioned.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: You are preparing to file a lawsuit against a business entity that you believe is operating illegally.

While David's public image is not a work of fiction, I would suppose that the right of parody or reference still applies. Apparently, this is not the case. \n\nWhat is the situation in the EU? What is the situation in the USA? Should I split my question into two questions, one asking about EU and the other one about USA?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, nothing that you describe is clearly a parody. Parody is different from making a reference or allusion to another work or including an homage to another work. As a good rule of thumb it is very hard to parody something that is already in the light/comedy genre, and simply reimagining someone else's work in a new context is not a parody. Instead, a parody generally makes a point that the author of the original work would find unpleasant or distasteful rather than being honored by it. The main point of the parody exception is that the targets of it would rarely consent to let you use their works for that purpose.\n\nSecond of all, you don't have a \"right\" to do anything of these things. Almost everything you describe is a derivative work which infringes a known copyright. The question is whether you have a defense to the claim of infringement.\n\nThe things that you describe may or may not be fair use. The fair use defense to a claim of derivative work copyright infringement is something that is evaluated in a rich factual context on a case by case basis, usually enriched by testimony from expert witnesses regarding what is commonly accepted and not accepted as permissible in this context and genre. Nothing you suggest is 100% certain to escape infringement liability, and nothing you suggest is 100% certain to be infringing. You are in a gray area and you are rolling the dice.\n\nIn addition to the \"fair use\" defense, you might also be able to resort to the \"scene a faire\" doctrine which states that elements of a work which would otherwise be infringing are permissible if they are pervasive conventions of a genre of work.\n\nFor example, the fact that your dark stormy castle in a gothic horror work looks like every other dark stormy castle in the genre, because that is what \"gothic horror works\" do, is a defense to a derivative work infringement claim. \n\nSimilarly, lots of standard cord progressions in popular music in a song you wrote would be protected by this doctrine. \n\nTo the extent that works in the genre you are creating in are almost always awash with references to other works in the genre, this would be a helpful boost to your argument that a defense would apply to your infringement of a derivative work because \"fair use\" is a matter of community custom and standards.\n\nOn the other hand, to the extent that you go beyond mere references to other works in the genre and instead are really just writing fan fiction, you are probably infringing and the fair use defense would not apply.\n\nIf you were sued you could probably not be able to get the case resolved one way or the other without a full presentation of all of the relevant facts by both sides in the case. These examples would not be amenable to summary resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, on the merits, I think that there is a good case to be made in each of the examples that you identify that it is a \"scene a faire\" or is \"fair use\". But, you have to understand that you are appealing to community indulgence of technically illegal activity, rather than truly doing so as a matter of \"right\" which is not a helpful way to think about what you are doing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of including references or homages to other works in your own creative work?\n\nA) You have an absolute right to include references or homages to other works as long as they are small in comparison to both the original work and your own work.\n\nB) Any reference or homage to another work is automatically protected under fair use and cannot be considered copyright infringement.\n\nC) Including references or homages to other works puts you in a legal gray area where the determination of infringement depends on various factors and context.\n\nD) References and homages are always considered parody and are therefore automatically protected from copyright infringement claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that including references or homages to other works puts you in a legal gray area. There is no absolute right to include such elements, and they are not automatically protected under fair use or parody exceptions. Instead, each case would be evaluated individually based on various factors, including the nature and extent of the reference, the context in which it's used, and the norms of the particular genre or medium. While defenses like fair use or the \"scene a faire\" doctrine may apply, their applicability is not guaranteed and would depend on the specific circumstances of each case. This situation creates uncertainty and risk, as opposed to a clear-cut right or automatic protection."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79533/how-is-ethanol-categorized-in-the-12-bimschv-germans-implementation-of-seveso-d", "docs_id": 79533, "title": "How is Ethanol categorized in the 12 BImSchV (Germans implementation of Seveso Directive)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The 12 BImSchV (essentially germany implementation of the Seveso III directive, as far as I understand) defines certain industrial or other plants as hazardous, according to the substances stored there.

As it says, \"Your voting residence is your address in the State in which you were last domiciled, immediately prior to leaving the United States.\"\n\nLaws about domicile vary from state to state, and sometimes for different purposes; in one state, the law about domicile for state income tax might be worded differently than the law about domicile for getting a driver license. The general idea is it is the place you intend as your permanent home, and intend to return to when you are temporarily absent.\n\nSo if, while you were in Maryland, you thought of it as a temporary absence from Pennsylvania, then Pennsylvania was still your domicile. Likewise for New Jersey. And since it's about your intent, if you tell all the government officials you encounter or correspond with that even on your last day in New Jersey, you always intended to return to Pennsylvania, the government would be hard\\-pressed to prove otherwise.\n\nKeep in mind that whichever place in the US was your last domicile is now your voting residence. It may be that the place is no longer your domicile. Reasons why it may not be your domicile could be that you now intend to stay in your current overseas home permanently. Or perhaps the US place has been torn down and an office building built on the site.\n\nA voting residence is a different concept from a domicile, because if you move permanently overseas, you might not be entitled to a US driver license, you probably don't have to pay income tax to any state\\*, but you're always entitled to vote in US elections.\n\n\\*You still have to file US income tax returns, and possibly pay tax.\n\nAs the web page linked above mentions, a person who never lived in a state may not be able to vote in federal elections, because the people elected in federal elections, like representatives, senators, and electors of the electoral college, all represent a particular place.

Unless the individual can prove they maintained a domicile intention to return to Ohio or California while living in New York, their voting residence would be New York.\n\nIt's important to note that voting residence is different from domicile or birthplace. Even if the person has stronger ties to Ohio or California, for voting purposes, the last state of residence before leaving the U.S. is typically considered the voting residence.

In [Michaels v. McPherson Kansas](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/kansas/ksdce/6:2013cv01128/91570/149/0.pdf), the appellate court refers to and upholds a lower court ruling that plaintiff suffered employment discrimination under the ADA (among other things). The appeal does not discuss the core issue in ADA law, whether the condition significantly limits a person's life, which strongly suggests that defendant accepted the conclusion that sleep apena can be a disability. On the other hand, in [Taylor v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/55/604/2376460/), a discrimination case involving sleep apnea was dismissed \u2013 but crucial to the dismissal was that he was successfully treated (also relevant was the lack of notice given the the employer).\n\nFinally, in [Keyes v. Catholic Charities](http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/101543np.pdf), federal court found that plaintiff's condition was not a disability under the meaning of the term in ADA. This does not mean that sleep apnea is \"not a disability under the law\", it means that \"defendant is not disabled under the law\", that is, the conclusion is based on the particulars of the individual condition, which is why the answer is \"maybe yes, maybe no\". There is a two\\-prong inquiry into the condition. First is a determination whether the person is \u201csubstantially limited in any major life activity other than working, such as walking, seeing, or hearing\u201d, compared to the general population.

In this scenario, the employee's condition appears to be significantly affecting their work, and they are actively seeking treatment, which could support a claim for disability status.

What matters is that the contract be clear enough for the parties to be aware of the terms and conditions to which they are committing. Both of the scenarios you outline seem lawful. They are binding to the extent that the definitions \\& language therein duly inform the parties of the substance of the contract. Definitions in a contract are most pertinent where the meaning of a term is intended to supersede and replace the commonplace meaning thereof.\n\nA contract would become null and void if the substance of that contract contravenes legislation. If legislation outlaws not only the effect of a clause but also its meaning, then the \\[un\\-]lawfulness of that clause is not altered simply by crafting definitions of terms. In other words, laws or legislative intent cannot be elluded by relabeling concepts in a contract.\n\nWhenever lawful, the attempt to trick a party with tactics (such as the use of uppercase you mention) is likely to be voidable by that party. The rationale is the same: The draftsman's attempt to confuse the user contravenes the contract law tenet that the parties *knowingly* enter the contract at issue.\n\nNotice that in the preceding paragraph I wrote \"*whenever lawful*\" rather than \"*although lawful*\".

In many of those cases there is a statement from at least one of the sides. Are all those results (I know, many are about the same case, but still, a lot) full of stupid clients?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's a bit like talking to the police: anything you say might be used against you, so the conventional wisdom is to say nothing. It is a good rule of thumb. When you are paying a professional to represent you, why make things complicated by speaking on your own behalf about the same issue?\n\nAs you point out, not everyone follows this rule. In some circumstances there might be benefits to discussing your case publicly, such as fundraising or deterrence. Whether the risk outweighs the benefits will depend on the details of the legal case and your role in it. Lawyers are likely to emphasise the following risks:\n\n* If you are a witness whose credibility is in issue, any public statement could potentially become a [prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements) which is used against you in cross\\-examination. Again, one of the purposes of hiring a lawyer is to be careful about how you communicate your position on a litigious matter and reduce the risk of careless remarks having unexpected consequences. Speaking publicly undermines this goal.\n* In Commonwealth countries, there is a significant risk that public comment on a case before the court could amount to [sub judice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_judice) contempt of court. Attempting to litigate the case in the media can be perceived as undermining the authority of the court. Lawyers are expected to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice and would be reluctant to condone anything that could be regarded as a contempt. This contributes to a culture where discussing active litigation is \"not the done thing\" and may itself cause problems with a witness's perceived credibility, aside from the risk of a contempt allegation.\n\nSpeaking publicly about litigation is risky and the consequences are difficult to predict, which is why people often engage lawyers to do it.

The review of the application of the law is more on the decisions the judge made and not the prosecutor. Typically if the judge was in error, the case is vacated and remanded to the lower court to be tried again with the recommended corrections to avoid the past mistake. This essentially means that the case that was appealed never happened (thus removing Double Jeopardy concerns and allowing the Prosecutor to try the defense again, if he still has sufficient cause to retry. Many cases where new evidence is produced will do this as the evidence might not be enough to change a Jury Panel's mind.).\n\nA successful first level appeal also unfetters the Prosecutor from Double Jeopardy restrictions. In the U.S., the ban on Double Jeopardy essentially bans the prosecutor from making an appeal after the verdict of the case is read, regardless of outcome (a finding of Not Guilty ends the whole matter then and their and the accused cannot be retried by that specific jurisdiction for that specific crime... They might have to deal with the Feds, but the Feds have specific guidelines on when they can try a case that has been tried by the state.).\n\nThere are a few cases where the successful appeal can be a career ending move on the prosecution and that is through some evidence of Prosecutorial Misconduct, i.e. the Prosecution did something wrong that resulted in the case being swung in his favor. This commonly is a Brady Disclosure Violation or failure on the Prosecution's part to turn over all evidence they have, including exculpatory evidence. This is considered a crime on the prosecution part and is egregious enough that the Bar will revoke their license to practice law.\n\nFor a good look at the Appellant process, check out *Making a Murder* on Netflix, specifically with an eye for the Season Two content which is about both subjects of Season One going through the Appellant phases of their case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is found guilty in a municipal court trial, but upon appeal, the decision is reversed and the defendant is found not guilty.

Normally, health insurance claims made by current employees can increase MoneySavers health insurance renewal rate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's probably not unlawful to ask, but an answer cannot be *required* immediately.\n\nPer the [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/publications/an-employees-guide-to-health-benefits-under-cobra.pdf), Susan has 60 days to elect COBRA coverage (the qualifying event here being the termination of Susan's employment):\n\n> Your plan must give you at least 60 days to choose whether or not to elect COBRA coverage, beginning from the date the election notice is provided or the date you would otherwise lose coverage under your group health plan due to the qualifying event, whichever is later.\n\nIt would be unlikely for an employer to discourage an employee from electing COBRA coverage due to costs to the employer, as you suggest:\n\n> Susan is still employed and thus could be treated differently in her last two weeks depending on how she responds because the company is struggling financially and is looking for every opportunity to save money.\n\nSusan electing to use COBRA coverage is unlikely to cost the company money, because the employer is [permitted to charge her the entire cost of the coverage, plus 2 percent to cover the cost of administering it](https://www.bizfilings.com/toolkit/research-topics/office-hr/what-is-cobra-what-employers-need-to-know) ([additional DoL source](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-for-employers.pdf)).\n\nAs far as privacy goes, I don't think anything illegal has occurred here. The most prevalent law regarding privacy of health information, HIPAA, [generally does not apply to employers](https://ogletree.com/insights/what-all-employers-need-to-know-about-protecting-employee-health-information/).

In fact, it is even more liberal than the US, including representation in civil cases for the most part as well (there are a few exceptions, like libel, and from what I've read, even that is changing). \n\nRather than the main source of free representation being called public defenders, they are referred to as Legal Aid, which is a government funded agency much like public defenders are in the United States.\n\nArticle 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that legal aid will be made available to those who lack sufficient resources, in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.\n\nIn the event legal aid is too busy to accept a new client, the court will appoint a solicitor from a list of private firms/practitioners that will act in the same capacity.\n\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees the right to a fair trial in both civil and criminal proceedings. This has been interpreted as providing for a general requirement of some measure of \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the state and the individual or between the parties in the case, and the overall structure of the article, as well as the case law of the Court, stresses the vital connection between the right to legal assistance and the general interest in guaranteeing the right to a fair trial. \n\nWhen faced with a criminal charge, the right to legal assistance is explicitly set out in Article 6 (3\\) (c). An entitlement to free legal aid in civil cases is available in cases where the absence of legal support would make any equality of arms impossible and would effectively deprive an applicant of access to the proceedings as such, for example, when a case can be filed to a court only if assisted by a lawyer in circumstances when an applicant cannot clearly afford one. \n\nMy guess is, if your friend was denied counsel under legal aid, she has too much income or to many assets to qualify, or she is involved in a case that does not qualify.

The UK's legal aid system is indeed guided by Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. These articles ensure that legal aid is available to those who lack sufficient resources and guarantee the right to a fair trial in both civil and criminal proceedings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the UK system provides free legal representation for both criminal and most civil cases, with some exceptions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because in the UK, free legal representation is primarily referred to as \"Legal Aid\" rather than \"public defenders.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because the right to free legal representation in the UK is not absolute or unconditional.

I completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree debt free, have $100,000\\+ in savings and got hired out of college as a software developer at a healthy $90,000 starting salary.

My sister also lives off my mom and has never held a serious job. **Psychiatrists have suggested diagnoses of both schizophrenia and/or borderline personality disorder**.\n\nI have severe concerns about inheriting a home jointly with someone who is disordered should anything happen to my mom. Myself and my sister get along (usually) however the big issue is that she has nowhere to go should my mom pass away and will refuse to sell the home whereas I want to sell the home as fast as possible such that I do not own a joint venture with her. **She does not understand that owning a home doesn't mean one \"owns\" the home \\- there is mortgage to pay, property taxes, utilities, etc. In her opinion, this is a conspiracy by Big Brother government to overthrow the public.** Inevitably, the home will be lost due non\\-payment, neglect, among other possibilities.\n\n**The question**\n\nA question from my mom: Is it possible to re\\-draft a will such that a third party could sell the home on our behalf?

Having researched these yourself, you will be in a far more equipped position when talking to a lawyer to get things underway.\n\n**Direction 1: Trusts**\n\nYour issue may not be solvable by a will because what a will does is essentially **distribute** assets. It simply specifies who gets what of what the deceased owned \u2014 as opposed to ordering people to do certain things. The house could certainly be granted to a third party, but there will be no way to oblige that party to sell it and transfer back to you; they could keep it for themselves and you and your sister would get nothing.\n\nA [trust](https://www.investopedia.com/university/estate-planning-guide/estate-planning5.asp) (instead of a will) can probably be a solution.\n\n**Direction 2: Guardianship of your sister**\n\nMentally ill persons can own property but their ability to decide what to do with it can be taken away by [guardianship](https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/guardianship-and-mental-illness/).

If the authorities that enforce a statute affirm that they are not enforcing it, this is often enough to defeat a case on standing grounds.\n\nFor example, rather than establishing a landmark precedent decriminalizing polygamy (or declining to do so), the 10th Circuit held in *[Brown v. Buhman](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/14-4117/14-4117-2016-04-11.html)*, Case No. 14\\-4117 (10th Cir. April 11, 2016\\), that the case must be dismissed without prejudice as moot, because the Utah District Attorney's office who was sued in the case adopted a policy in May of 2012 that it would only prosecute polygamy cases when they were incident to frauds committed on a prospective spouse or third parties, effectively freeing the Sister Wives family from risk of prosecution.\n\nThe end result creates no precedent on the underlying issue of the decriminalization of polygamy (which also would have invalidated a virtually identical Colorado statute), and shifted the official prosecution policy of just one DA's office in Utah that can be changed prospectively at any time. The key language of the ruling was as follows:\n\n> The Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cUCAO\u201d) subsequently closed its\n> file on the Browns and adopted a policy (\u201cthe UCAO Policy\u201d) under\n> which the Utah County Attorney will bring bigamy prosecutions only\n> against those who (1\\) induce a partner to marry through\n> misrepresentation or (2\\) are suspected of committing a collateral\n> crime such as fraud or abuse.

Here is a source from the National Registry of Exonerations which states the age of crime, and the percentage of groups with false crime declarations:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1rrf.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1rrf.jpg)\n\nOne reason is that minors can be easily psychologically manipulated, and so by chance Fred if under 18 would not be considered to give any worth of confession unless proven to go against him.\n\nIn some cases, the individual who made the false confession may be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice, particularly if their false confession led to an innocent person being convicted or if their false testimony impeded an ongoing investigation when the individual is not a minor. This is covered by perjury, a crime of expressing fake statements. In United States Code, Chapter 79 of Section 1632, it states:\n\n> (1\\) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\n\n> in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\n> is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.\n\nThe following law only applies to a sensible adult, who has intentionally, without a psychological circumstance, made a false statement to defend someone. It is hard later, for the prosecutor to prove the claimant innocent if the confession has solid ground and worth.\n\n---\n\nNote that though false confession can come under perjury crime, an exemption exists for minors or those psychologically unwell or influenced. It reminds us of *Miranda v Arizona*, where Miranda, an inmate in prison cased over by Phoenix Police (Credits:[@TannerSwett](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/18320/tanner-swett)) who would torture an innocent inmate to confess a crime. In collective terms, it was called Miranda Warnings, where the inmate was warned, using torture to confess fakely.\n\nIt would be clear from torture. In the 1936 case *Brown v. Mississippi*, which was the first time the Supreme Court excluded a confession from a state court prosecution, this was the issue. For days, three suspects had been tortured. The deputy in charge testified when asked how hard one of the defendants had been whipped: Not too much for a Black person; not nearly as much as I would have done if I had been in charge.\n\nAn image of courtesy, The Crisis Magazine 1935:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVT2q.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVT2q.jpg)\n\nThe Supreme Court passed American reforms where Miranda was passed, and torturing was banned with evidence for both interrogation and confession. At the time Miranda was written, more \"modern\" methods of questioning were being used: rather than beating, isolation, deception, and exhaustion. It seems unlikely that an innocent suspect would confess to a serious crime if they were not subjected to torture or other forms of violence or death threats. Confessions are extremely potent forms of proof of guilt for precisely this reason.\n\nTo sum up, we conclude:\n\n1. If Fred was a stable adult, he is punished under the perjury crime\n2.

Otherwise, you have no basic for taking them to court. On the other and, you could be trying to say something entirely different, namely that someone has taken the name of your goods but not the goods themselves, and sold something else under your name (or a very close approximation therein). That could be trademark infringement, and you could go to court over that.\n\nThe nature of your product name would matter significant. If the product were named \"Artisanal Jewelry\", there is little hope for success for success in a lawsuit (given that this is not a registered name). Such a name is a descriptive mark, and you would have to prove that the public associates \"Artisanal Jewelry\" specifically with your product. If the product is named Xoachhcaox Jewelry, that is an arbitrary and unique name, and it would not be too difficult to establish that they have infringed your trademark right. Let's say that the competitor names their product Xoachcaox Jewelry \u2013 the likelihood that a person would be confused as to which is which is very high.

The situation described potentially involves trademark infringement, not copyright infringement (ruling out A). While the absence of a contract limiting the distributor's actions would make it harder to sue for breach of contract, it doesn't eliminate all legal options (ruling out B). The cooperative doesn't need to prove the distributor is selling their exact products (ruling out D). Instead, they may have a case for trademark infringement based on the similarity of names (\"Moonstone Makers\" vs. \"Moonstone Crafters\") if they can demonstrate factors such as likelihood of consumer confusion, the distinctiveness of their brand name, and potentially the distributor's intent.

However, I am interested in how to write an NDA from scratch DIY without a lawyer, and am having a hard time finding any examples online that seem respectable.\n\nIf one would like to share information with another party (either an employee of another company or just a friend or acquaintance), I am confused as to what exactly would count as a valid NDA.\n\nFrom what I've seen, many of the example NDAs say something along the lines of \"...confidential information will be shared orally, and followed up in 30 days in written form so as to be valid.\" I was initially under the impression that just having the NDA say everything was purely communicated orally \\-\\- with nothing in writing \\-\\- would be sufficient. But maybe perhaps writing down what is confidential that was talked about somehow makes it better.\n\nAlso, I don't see how you can write it down efficiently enough, so as to avoid essentially creating a detailed patent document lol. If you describe orally something for an hour, that could be the outline of a patent in principle, so it would seem that you would then need to \"follow up with them in 30 days or less with a written form of the confidential information\". This to me seems (a) hard and time consuming, and (b) a security leak. At the same time it would help clarify exactly what was talked about, that's for sure.\n\nSo my question is, what the key attributes are of an effective (software related) one\\-sided NDA.\n\nIt seems to me that you could simply have a generic NDA for all of potential software ideas, saying basically \"Anything I share with you related to any legally allowable business activity or idea is confidential\" and that's it, not needing to list anything in particular. Once you start saying you need to list particular things, I don't see how you can avoid going down the rabbit hole and writing a detailed patent\\-like document.\n\nAlso I'm wondering what sorts of edge cases you must cover. Or, in general, if a legal document must cover every possible edge case, or can somehow just cover the main ones and leave the rest as assumed somehow. For example, some NDAs say something to the effect of \"You are free to reveal the confidential information to authorities if it comes down to it\" or \"You may disclose information to whomever if you first get written permission from me.\" I don't see why it's necessary to say this stuff. There's so much you could potentially say, I don't see why you can just leave this out. If it turns out that the situation comes up where they would like to disclose something in the future to someone, then they could ask you and you could come up with an amendment to the contract, or another contract specific to that.

If these \"data\" were about the real world, they are not created, and copyright only protects creative efforts. Creativity can come in a number of forms, such as the sentence structure used to state an idea, but it can also be found in a system of relations between small expressions, like \"20 km diameter\", \"67 billion Earth gravities\", \"7,000 kg per cc\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright protection of fictional data in tabletop games?\n\nA) Fictional data in games, such as weapon properties in AD&D, are always protected by copyright regardless of their arrangement.\n\nB) Individual measurements in fictional worlds, like a sword's length or weight, are copyrightable on their own.\n\nC) Fictional data may be protected by copyright as part of a creative system, even if individual elements like \"20 km diameter\" are not protected alone.\n\nD) Fictional data in games cannot be protected by copyright because they are similar to real-world measurements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While individual measurements or simple facts, even in fictional worlds, may not be copyrightable on their own, they can be protected as part of a larger creative system. This is similar to how real-world data arrangements can be copyrighted, even if the individual data points are not.

The theory of Constructive Trust can allow A to recover the full $100 million, but only if all four elements are met. These elements are: (1) wrongful appropriation, (2) title held by the defendant, (3) traceability of the property, and (4) unjust enrichment. In this case, all elements appear to be satisfied: B stole the ticket (wrongful appropriation), B has title to the winnings, the property can be traced from the original $1 ticket to the $100 million prize, and B would be unjustly enriched by keeping the winnings from a stolen ticket.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the increase in value and the principle of Constructive Trust.

This federal statute makes it a crime to access a computer without authorization or exceed authorized access under certain circumstances. The fact that the case involved \"computer intrusion\" and theft of confidential information from a computer system likely used in interstate commerce (given the national scope of SAT testing) brings it under the purview of this federal law.

There are also data residency concerns that the website must be hosted on the University's servers instead of services like GitHub Pages or Netlify because of that.\n\nI view these concerns with a great deal of incredulity. **Is a site that collects no visitor data yet displays publicly available information affected by the GDPR?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, whether that information is public or not. The student website is definitely processing personal data of faculty. Any website is also necessarily processing personal data of visitors due to technical reasons, even though hosting has been outsourced to a third party. There's always a server, you just might not be managing it yourself.\n\nThus, GDPR applies.\n\nJust because it processes personal data doesn't mean that the student website would be illegal. It just means the students are responsible for GDPR compliance of that website. Since the website is controlled by students and not by the university, the university DPO has no say here and the university can't demand the website to be hosted in a particular manner. Nevertheless, the DPO's suggestions might be quite sensible.\n\nTypical GDPR compliance steps include:\n\n* having a clear purpose for which the personal data is being processed\n* having a legal basis for that processing (here, probably a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d which will require a balancing test), see Art 6\n* providing transparent information to the data subjects\n\t+ providing a privacy notice to website visitors, see Art 13\n\t+ notifying faculty per the requirements in Art 14 GDPR\n* preparing to fulfill data subject rights such as access, rectification, and erasure\n\t+ when using a legitimate interest, there's also a right to \u201cobject\u201d (opt\\-out)\n* implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security and compliance of your processing activities, see Art 24\\+32\n* making sure that third parties to which you outsource processing activities are contractually bound as \u201cdata processors\u201d to only use the data as instructed by you, see Art 28\n* if you transfer data to non\\-European countries, having appropriate safeguards in place\n\nDoes this sound complicated? It can be complicated. The point is that the internet is no longer the lawless Wild West. Just because you *can* easily publish a site with personal data, doesn't mean that you *should*. The GDPR is about requiring data controllers to find an appropriate balance with the rights and interests of the affected persons. Of course there are countries with less regulation, but there are also countries with fewer taxes and that isn't necessarily good for society.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid these responsibilities will be to stop publishing the site as students \u2013 and instead taking up the university DPO's offer to have the university run the site. Which is less fun, of course, but the adult thing to do. If this motivates you further: note that the data controller (the people responsible for the site) must publish their contact information in the privacy notice, typically name \\+ email \\+ street address.\n\nThe GDPR contains no exceptions that would help here.\n\n* There is an exception for purely personal or household activities. But if the website would be available to the general public, it would be difficult to argue that this is purely personal. There's also case law such as the *Lindqvist* case requiring a narrow interpretation of that exception.\n* In Art 9, the GDPR does mention that some restrictions are lifted if the data subject made the information public themselves.

Even though the website displays publicly available information and doesn't actively collect visitor data, it is still processing personal data of faculty members (their contact information). Under GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, regardless of whether it's public or not. Additionally, any website processes some visitor data for technical reasons, even if it's minimal.\n\nTherefore, the website must comply with GDPR requirements. This includes having a legal basis for processing (likely \"legitimate interest\"), providing transparent information to data subjects (both faculty and visitors), preparing to fulfill data subject rights, implementing appropriate security measures, and ensuring any third-party processors (like hosting services) are properly contracted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because public availability of information doesn't exempt it from GDPR.

I don't know what other alternatives are out there, but this might not explicitly prohibit an instruction\\-trace on the executing code, and they may want to (although I am not sure what the exact scope of \"reverse engineer\" is). In saying \"*reduce* the Software to a human\\-perceivable form\", the choice of the word \"reduce\" is no doubt significant. A reasonable man would conclude that an effort to simplify the raw binary code into something more graspable (such as opcodes) is a reduction to perceivable form. However, a screen dump via cat or a hex print doesn't affect the informational content of the file, it just changes the mode of representation: it makes it perceivable, but does not reduce the software in any way (does not reduce the entropy of the bit pattern). If they had intended to say \"*render* it in a human perceivable form\", they could have, so we should focus on the impact of \"reduce\".

The law is typically worded broadly enough that not following a justifiable order from an officer can be considered criminal.

If multiple DPAs are involved, they would coordinate with each other. There is no EU body that you could contact directly. But if the different DPAs have a dispute regarding this investigation, the EDPB would provide a consistency mechanism. This mechanism has been used in the past e.g. to force the Irish DPA to correctly apply the GDPR against companies from the Meta group, like WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nThough it might slow things down, it could be advantageous to have multiple DPAs involved, precisely so that the investigation is double\\-checked. If the lead supervisory authority declines the case, this would also enable the other DPA to do its own investigation.\n\nSo, it would be a good idea to lodge a complaint with the DPA of your home country, and let it forward the issue to other DPAs as needed.

These laws are not intended to protect adult robbers (if the person engaged in robbery were an armed seven years old, that might be another story). California, however, has discarded the attractive nuisance doctrine that used to be part of its law, in 1970, in the case of *Beard v. Atchison*.\n\n**Common Law Premises Liability In California**\n\nThe common law duty that a property owner owes to trespassers is to keep it free of deadly traps. You have liability if you turn your lawn into a literal mine field full of explosive land mines. But, you did not at common law owe a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable accidental injury to trespassers such as robbers. So, there would be no common law duty here.\n\nBut, California has abandoned the strict common law distinction in premises liability between invitees, licensees, and trespassers in lieu of a general duty to use reasonable care that is fairly tailored to the precise circumstances of the accident. [California Civil Jury Instruction No. 1001](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1000/1001/) (2000\\) citing *Ann M. v.Pacific Plaza Shopping Center*, 6 Cal.4th 666, 674\\-675, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207 (1993\\).\n\nCalifornia, rather than focusing on the nature of the duty that the landlord owes to a trespasser, focuses more on this factor as part of the question of issues like whether the harm was foreseeable.\n\n**A Statute That Is On Point And Controlling Here**\n\nDespite this evolution in California's common law of premises liability, however, California does have a statute that singles out felons who are injured on someone else's property in the course of a felony, specifically, [California Civil Code \u00a7 847](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-847.html), which states (emphasis added):\n\n> (a)\u2002**An owner**, including, but not limited to, a public entity, as\n> defined in Section 811\\.2 of the Government Code , of any estate or any\n> other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossessory,\n> **shall not be liable to any person for any injury or death that occurs upon that property during the course of or after the commission\n> of any of the felonies set forth in subdivision (b) by the injured or\n> deceased person.**\n> \n> \n> (b)\u2002The felonies to which the provisions of this section apply are the\n> following: \u2009(1\\) Murder or voluntary manslaughter; \u2009(2\\) mayhem; \u2009(3\\)\n> rape; \u2009(4\\) sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of\n> great bodily harm; \u2009(5\\) oral copulation by force, violence, duress,\n> menace, or threat of great bodily harm; \u2009(6\\) lewd acts on a child\n> under the age of 14 years; \u2009(7\\) any felony punishable by death or\n> imprisonment in the state prison for life; \u2009(8\\) any other felony in\n> which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person, other\n> than an accomplice, or any felony in which the defendant uses a\n> firearm; \u2009(9\\) attempted murder; \u2009(10\\) assault with intent to commit\n> rape or robbery; \u2009(11\\) assault with a deadly weapon or instrument on a\n> peace officer; \u2009(12\\) assault by a life prisoner on a noninmate; \u2009(13\\)\n> assault with a deadly weapon by an inmate; \u2009(14\\) arson; \u2009(15\\)\n> exploding a destructive device or any explosive with intent to injure;\n> \u2009(16\\) exploding a destructive device or any explosive causing great\n> bodily injury; \u2009(17\\) exploding a destructive device or any explosive\n> with intent to murder; \u2009(18\\) burglary; \u2009**(19\\) robbery**; \u2009(20\\)\n> kidnapping; \u2009(21\\) taking of a hostage by an inmate of a state prison;\n> \u2009(22\\) any felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or\n> deadly weapon; \u2009(23\\) selling, furnishing, administering, or providing\n> heroin, cocaine, or phencyclidine (PCP) to a minor; \u2009(24\\) grand theft\n> as defined in Sections 487 and 487a of the Penal Code ; \u2009and (25\\) any\n> attempt to commit a crime listed in this subdivision other than an\n> assault.\n> \n> \n> (c)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section arises at\n> the moment the injured or deceased person commences the felony or\n> attempted felony and extends to the moment the injured or deceased\n> person is no longer upon the property.\n> \n> \n> (d)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section applies only\n> when the injured or deceased person's conduct in furtherance of the\n> commission of a felony specified in subdivision (b) proximately or\n> legally causes the injury or death.\n> \n> \n> (e)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section arises only\n> upon the charge of a felony listed in subdivision (b) and the\n> subsequent conviction of that felony or a lesser included felony or\n> misdemeanor arising from a charge of a felony listed in subdivision\n> (b). \u2002During the pendency of any such criminal action, a civil action\n> alleging this liability shall be abated and the statute of limitations\n> on the civil cause of action shall be tolled.\n> \n> \n> (f)\u2002This section does not limit the liability of an owner or an\n> owner's agent which otherwise exists for willful, wanton, or criminal\n> conduct, or for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against\n> a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.\n> \n> \n> (g)\u2002The limitation on liability provided by this section shall be in\n> addition to any other available defense.\n\nThis statute is controlling and would probably immunize the property owner from liability in the fact pattern of the question.
