I also want to notarize the letter for some other paperwork that is not related to the employer. \n\nThe question: can a notary public notarize the letter after I sign before her? or should the manager who signed the letter also appear before the notary public (which is nearly impossible)?\n\nFollow\\-up question: how does such a letter notarized? would it be just stamped and signed by the notary public?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several forms of notarized documents, the most common of which are affidavits (which are written statements of a person made and signed under oath) and acknowledgements (which is a notarized statement that a document was signed before a notary, usually used for documents related to real property).\n\nThere would be no legitimate reason I can think of to notarize an offer letter, and the fact that you want to do that probably means that you are confused about some other aspect of the law that would make you think that you would want to or need to do something like that.\n\nA more common thing to do, for example, in anticipation of a lawsuit, would be to prepare and execute an affidavit which states that the letter, attached as an exhibit, was signed by you, and anyone else that you have personal knowledge signed it, for your signature before a notary.\n\nA notary is not allowed to execute an affidavit (or a very similar document called a verification which is a very short document saying that the facts stated in a single document asserting a claim in a court case are true and correct in a form substantially similar to an affidavit) if it is signed outside the notary's physical presence (in theory because the notary administers an oath before you sign it). \n\nAn acknowledgement can be executed by a notary if the person who signed the document comes before the notary in person and acknowledges that it was signed by him or her, even if the notary was not there when it was actually signed. The notary would state the date that you acknowledged it in person to the notary in the acknowledgement and would not make any statement regarding when it was actually signed.\n\nThere is special formalized legal language that must accompany each kind of notarization, which is called the \"jurat\". Then the notary signs and dates the jurat in the appropriate place and applies a notary seal near the jurat in the indicated location (if any) mark \"L.S.\" for \"location of seal\" in latin.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A job applicant wants to notarize their signed offer letter for personal reasons unrelated to the employer.

An acknowledgement can be executed by a notary if the person who signed the document (in this case, the job applicant) comes before the notary in person and acknowledges that they signed it, even if the notary was not present during the actual signing. The notary would state the date of the acknowledgement, not necessarily the date of signing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an affidavit requires the document to be signed in the presence of the notary, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the employer's presence is not required for an acknowledgement of the job applicant's signature.\n\nOption D is incorrect because notarizing an offer letter is not a standard practice, and proper notarization involves more than just a stamp and signature.

You are trying to use other people's content and likeness for your advertisement. Unless you are certain that you can do this in your relevant jurisdictions, without their consent, this sounds like a very bad idea.\n\nAt least under GDPR, \u201cbut they made it public\u201d is not an excuse. Personal data is personal data regardless of how you acquire it. The GDPR also has a very broad concept of identifiability that goes beyond direct identifiers or PII. If you want to use other people's personal data, you need a legal basis, and must provide them notice about your processing. Consent (informed opt\\-in) is one legal basis, legitimate interest (opt\\-out) another. You are suggesting to avoid this by blurring PII, but you may also have to blur other content that is indirectly identifiable. Real anonymization that meets the GDPR's definition is a *really hard* problem.\n\nIn some cases, a legitimate interest is able to avoid such problems. E.g. if I make a video with commentary about a Tweet, it would likely be OK to show surrounding personal data like the responses including the identities of the various accounts, to the degree that this is relevant to the commentary and/or necessary for proper attribution. However, that commentary likely has strong protections under freedom of expression. At least from an European viewpoint, a tutorial, demo, or advertisement would not have a freedom of expression argument that would shift a GDPR legitimate interest balancing test in your favour.\n\nInstead of blurring almost everything in your video or working on GDPR compliance, content licenses, and release forms, you should consider a different solution: create dummy content just for your videos.

This avoids potential issues with copyright, personality rights, and data protection laws like GDPR. \n\nOption A is insufficient, as it doesn't address all forms of personally identifiable information. Option B is incorrect, as public availability doesn't exempt the creator from legal obligations regarding personal data use. Option C, while more thorough than A, still poses risks of indirect identification and doesn't address the underlying legal issues of using others' content without consent.\n\nCreating dummy content (option D) allows the video creator to demonstrate the browser extension without risking violation of privacy laws or needing to obtain consent from numerous individuals.

In situations where work is performed without a pre-agreed price, the law typically requires payment of a \"fair price\" or \"reasonable value\" for the services rendered. This is based on the principle of quantum meruit (Latin for \"what one has earned\"). The fair price is determined by considering factors such as the contractor's typical hourly rate, the time spent on the job, the cost of materials used, and the complexity of the work. While the absence of a written contract or estimate complicates the situation, it does not negate the homeowner's obligation to pay for services received.

The mother is shot. The 2 daughters are also murdered.\n\nThe PDF argues that the mother, if she survived somehow, would still be guilty of statutory rape. However, I cannot find any info whether she is actually charged for that or not. It seems that no sane DA would charge her with that.

But under the law, both are guilty of rape. The rapist for well, rape. The woman for having sex with an underage rapist.\n\nAre there any actual cases that are like this?\n\nAre there cases like this where the rape victim does not report the crime knowing that she will be found guilty too?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Laws vary by state, of course. In Wisconsin, according to the 1993 case [State v. Neumann](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1856146004085540361&q=179%20Wis.%202d%20687&hl=en&as_sdt=4,50&as_vis=1):\n\n> the offense of second\\-degree sexual assault by sexual intercourse does not require proof of intent\n\nand therefore someone who claimed to be too drunk to know what he was doing was still guilty. Although that was a case involving adults and therefore a different statute, I think the statutes are similar enough to produce a similar result in a case involving a minor.\n\nBut even though intent isn't required, according to the 2007 case [State v. Lackershire](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7292968643997194864&q=2007%20WI%2074&hl=en&as_sdt=4,50&as_vis=1) she's still be not guilty in Wisconsin. It flat out says that:\n\n> If the defendant was raped, the act of having sexual intercourse with a child does not constitute a crime.\n\nAdditionally, in your case, there was a gun to her head. Under Wisconsin law, the woman could not be guilty of statutory rape, because of [this law](http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/939.46):\n\n> 939\\.46\u2003 Coercion.  \n> \n>  (1\\)\u2002A threat by a person other than the actor's coconspirator which causes the actor reasonably to believe that his or her act is the only means of preventing imminent death or great bodily harm to the actor or another and which causes him or her so to act is a defense to a prosecution for any crime based on that act, except that if the prosecution is for first\\-degree intentional homicide, the degree of the crime is reduced to 2nd\\-degree intentional homicide.\n\nThe paper you link to mentions several possible defenses like coercion, and how each defense is not applicable in some states. I don't think it ever clearly establishes that there is a state where there is *no* defense. The example you (and the paper) give occurred in Florida. I couldn't find an applicable statute in Florida law, but that appears to be because it's in common law instead of a statute. According to the 1981 Florida case [Wright v. State](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1981895402so2d4931779):\n\n> Florida has recognized the common law defense of duress as a defense to crimes other than homicide\n\nso I don't think the woman would have been guilty under Florida law, either. The paper states that she was in fear for her life and that of her daughters, and it is extremely apparent in hindsight that her fear was reasonable.\n\nI imagine that if the author was able to find an actual case where a victim was prosecuted under similar circumstances (or even one where the victim clearly *could* have been prosecuted under the law of that state) he would have used that case as his example instead. It seems that he couldn't... and that might tell you something.

The legal situation varies by state. Some states, like Wisconsin, have explicit laws stating that a person who is raped cannot be guilty of statutory rape when the rapist is a minor. Other states recognize common law defenses such as coercion or duress, which would likely apply in a case involving a threat with a deadly weapon.

Therefore, the woman's potential culpability would indeed depend on the specific laws of the state where the incident occurred.

If a party not represented by an attorney does not designate an e\\-mail address for service in a proceeding, service on and by that party must be by the means provided in subdivision (b)(2\\).\n\nSo it looks like you would probably want to see if you can sign up for the court's e\\-filing system, which would automatically result in service to your e\\-mail address.

Usually watermarks are used to reduce the commercial value of an image or video. It doesn\u2019t affect copyright. It is unlikely that someone can claim adding a \u201cdo not copy\u201d watermark to an image creates a derived work. And a \u201cdo not copy\u201d watermark is likely not creative enough to have its own copyright.\n\nYou may have permission to reproduce the video *with* watermark, but that depends. If not and if the video is copyrighted then it was copyright infringement. Damages may be lower because of the lower commercial value.\n\nPS. Since the video is your own: It happens that a free (no cost) video adds a watermark, so you can try it out, but cannot use it commercially. Like you wouldn\u2019t want a watermark in your wedding video; if you pay for the editor the watermarks go away.\n\nAs I said, it is unlikely that the creator of the watermark can claim copyright, because copyright requires a creative process and the watermark will have very little creativity. It is even less likely that the creator of the watermark takes you to court about it and wins, or sends a DMCA takedown notice. They are not interested in that. And others can\u2019t accuse you of copyright infringement.\n\nIf it is like an advert for the software, they most likely want you to make as many copies as possible.

The watermark itself is unlikely to be copyrightable as it typically lacks the creativity required for copyright protection. The video editor company probably wants users to share watermarked videos as free advertising.

This statement accurately reflects the complex nature of bail as described in the provided information. Bail is not merely an incentive but a condition for temporary release, as stated in the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679. The duration for which bail can be held varies by jurisdiction.

For example, the statistics on criminal cases filed by offenses through December 31, 2021 can be found [here](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/d-2/statistical-tables-federal-judiciary/2021/12/31). And the statistics on criminal cases terminated by offense and type of disposition can be found [here](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/d-4/statistical-tables-federal-judiciary/2021/12/31). These tables break the offenses handled in the federal court system down into about 100 categories and are available for geographic subregions of the U.S. (particular district courts and particular court of appeals circuits). This is reasonably specific in a system than handles about 57,000 criminal defendants in a typical year.\n\nThe [federal bureau of prisons](https://www.bop.gov/resources/research_and_reports.jsp) likewise published regular statistics on who is detained for which offenses.\n\nThe [U.S. Sentencing Commission](https://www.ussc.gov/research) also issues some relevant and useful reports with information not available elsewhere. For example, there is a [report summarizing sentencing data](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/state-district-circuit/2021/10c21.pdf) in the 10th Circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals for 2021 that breaks offenses down into 30 categories with data on the number of offenders charged, the number of plea or go to trial for each of these 30 categories, the type of sentence imposed (e.g. probation, fine, prison), mean and median sentence lengths, and other data.\n\nMany state court systems likewise published annual reports regarding their case loads, and many state corrections departments likewise publish regular reports regarding inmates serving sentences for crimes.\n\nThe information that is available is not generally as granular as a specific criminal statute. At the federal court level, offenses charged and tried are broken down into about 100 categories, with selective more finely detailed break out detail in some reports, and the federal bureau of prisons data is less fine grained than that. Some U.S. Sentencing Commission data is more specific, some is less specific.\n\nEvery once and while, usually for purposes of estimating the budget impact of proposed legislation, researchers, especially in the Congressional Research Service, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the relevant appropriations committees of each house of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, or the Office of Management and Budget in the White House office, will contact administrators in the relevant federal agencies and get more fine grained data which is necessary for more accurate estimates for legislative purposes and is released in reports that they issue related to that legislation. But that is piecemeal and is not available comprehensively.\n\nSometimes academics and journalists and political action oriented interest groups and think tanks also estimate these numbers in academic journal articles, either with this kind of insider data or with a representative sample of cases (sometimes obtained with a Freedom of Information Act request).

For Sarah to automatically acquire U.S. citizenship when her father naturalized, she must meet all the following conditions:\n1. Be under 18 years old (which she is)\n2. Be a lawful permanent resident (have a green card)\n3. Have at least one biological parent who is a U.S. citizen (her father became one)\n4.

I assume you are a programmer who would be assembling a web page for the client, and you have a copy of the image, let's say on a thumb drive.

The web developer could potentially be held liable for copyright infringement, even if they were unaware the image was copyrighted. This is because the act of copying the image from the client's provided material to the web server constitutes reproduction of copyrighted material, which is a form of infringement if done without proper authorization.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a contract clause assuming images are acceptable to use does not protect against third-party copyright claims. Such clauses may limit liability between the developer and client, but do not affect the rights of the copyright owner.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the source of the image doesn't determine liability. The act of reproduction itself can be infringing, regardless of who chose the image.\n\nOption D is incorrect because copyright infringement doesn't require knowledge or intent.

I should also point out article 60:\n\n> A citizen of the Russian Federation may exercise his or her rights and\n> duties in full from the age of 18\n\nThere are also protection requirements: Intellectual property shall be protected by law, dignity shall be protected, idem honour, the \"right to protection against unemployment\", maternity and childhood, and the family, and so on. There is a potential contradiction between the liberty\\-type rights and the protections guaranteed in the constitution. Nations differ in how they resolve these contradictions. Sometimes, a nation submits to the authority of a transnational court. Usually, they are resolved on a system\\-internal basis, by the Supreme Court of the nation, according to principles of legal interpretation adopted by that nation.\n\nIn the US, no individual right is absolute: every right can in principle be subordinated to some government interest. We have a concept of [strict scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny), which limits how governments can infringe on protected rights. Thus you have the right to free speech, but it is limited so that you cannot make death threats because it is a compelling government interest to prevent death threats.\n\nIf you were to sue the government for violating your right to life by compelling you to attend school in the age of covid, there are various defenses that the government could offer to justify the education requirement. One is, simply, that those under 18 don't enjoy full rights enumerated for adults, therefore you can be compelled to go to school, in contradiction to the right to freedom of action. School attendance is a \"compelling government interest\", which can be used to justify infringement of rights. School attendance in the face of covid is not a guaranteed death sentence, but it increases risk of harm somewhat. Serving in the military, which is obligatory (Art. 59\\) also increases the risk of harm \u2013 much more substantially compared to going to school. In the US legal system, there are certain guidelines regarding the balancing act between government interest and individual rights, and yet it is still very hard to predict what government actions will be slapped down vs. sustained by the courts on that basis.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the relationship between constitutional rights and government actions during a pandemic?\n\nA) Constitutional rights are absolute and cannot be infringed upon under any circumstances, even during a pandemic.\n\nB) The right to education always takes precedence over the right to life in constitutional considerations.\n\nC) Government actions that potentially infringe on rights, such as mandating school attendance during a pandemic, are subject to a balancing test weighing individual rights against compelling government interests.\n\nD) Transnational courts have the final say in resolving contradictions between liberty rights and protection requirements in national constitutions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage indicates that no individual right is absolute and can be subordinated to government interests. It mentions the concept of strict scrutiny in the US, which involves balancing protected rights against compelling government interests. The example of mandating school attendance during a pandemic is presented as a situation where the government might justify infringing on certain rights (like the right to life) for the compelling interest of education. The passage also notes that it's difficult to predict how courts will rule in such cases, implying that a balancing test is applied.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that no individual right is absolute. Answer B is incorrect as the text doesn't suggest that education always takes precedence over the right to life. Answer D is incorrect because while the passage mentions that some nations submit to transnational courts, it also states that contradictions are usually resolved internally by a nation's supreme court."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70194/appliance-store-sold-our-custom-order-to-someone-else-when-it-arrived-in-invento", "docs_id": 70194, "title": "Appliance store sold our custom order to someone else when it arrived in inventory that we had paid for", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We bought and paid for custom appliances (5 items) that took about 2 months to get them in.

The mention of misdemeanors and felonies in the fee assessment language is due to Government Code 70373, which groups various offenses together for processing fee purposes.

Due to friction between my daughter and the employer, my daughter recently quit but she realized that she was being underpaid for much of this year (2023\\) because the minimum wage here in California is currently $15\\.50 for 2023 but she was still getting paid $14\\.00, the California minimum wage for 2022, when she recently quit (in August 2023\\). Now according to my daughter there is a provision in California law which allows employers to pay only 85% of minimum wage for new workers with no prior experience for their first 160 hours of work. For 2023, that \"new worker\" wage level would work out to $13\\.17 per hour, but my daughter said that she exceeded her first 160 hours of work for the employer back in March 2023\\. So, basically, my daughter was being paid under the proper CA 2023 minimum wage for over the past 4 months.\n\nWhen my daughter contacted her former employer about this problem, the employer was apologetic and emailed back saying that a financial transaction to her to correct for the underpayment would be sent as soon as my daughter emailed back an enclosed payment settlement form. The settlement form basically says \"I hereby agree that the net payment of $XXX represents the full and final settlement of my account with Company XXX\", and there are signature lines at the bottom of the form for my daughter's signature as well as my signature as her parent.\n\nI'm currently thinking \"Why should I, the parent, need to sign anything here?\".

Probably \\- I haven\u2019t read them.\n\nIn other words, they\u2019re asking her to sign a contract saying she gets $XXX now, and can\u2019t make any further claims against them.

The parent's signature on the settlement form is a precautionary measure taken by the employer to prevent the minor from potentially voiding the contract in the future. Minors have the ability to void contracts if they are not in their best interest, so having the parent sign as the legal guardian helps ensure the agreement remains binding.

While minors have limitations on entering contracts, the primary reason for the parent's signature in this case is to prevent future voiding of the contract, not to make it initially binding.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the parent's awareness of the employment is not the primary reason for requiring their signature on this settlement form."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/47288/is-law-prepared-to-somebody-leaving-earth-regardless-of-the-outer-space-treaty", "docs_id": 47288, "title": "Is Law prepared to somebody leaving Earth regardless of the Outer Space Treaty?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've read two other questions about [Legality of space colonization](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/13649/28822) and [Am I legally allowed to build my own rocket and fly to space by myself?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/11053/28822).

The main legal question is whether you are operating a website. A website operator has to comply with various laws that require them to remove content. For example, if you operate a website that allows users to distribute content that they upload, they can distribute copyright\\-protected content, and you can be held liable for copyright infringement. DMCA in the US provides a way for you to not get sued, but you have to be able to remove putatively infringing content, so you could get sued if you can't remove illegal content.

You happen to be moving that day, so all of your belongings are in \"plain view\" between the yard, open house, and open moving truck. The cop decides he *really* doesn't like you and so, even though there is no nexus between you or your property and the crime he is investigating he decides to seize all of your property as \"evidence.\" Because it's in \"plain view\" he doesn't need a warrant. He properly logs your property into evidence, and then lets you know you won't see it until the case has been adjudicated. (What case, and when will that be?

You may *personally* be sure that your claims are not in fact libelous (because you know they are true), but the relevant concern here is whether you can prove that your claims are not libelous in a court of law.\n\nIf your employer sues you for libel, you have the advantage that your have already organized a substantial defense. You could use the same evidence from your nonpayment case as you do in the libel case against you, which makes it substantially easier to handle the libel suit. If it held up in court during the nonpayment case, it may do well in the libel suit as well. Of course, if you do not win your nonpayment suit, then that does *not* speak well about the ability of your evidence to hold up in court.\n\nEven if you do win, however, take care that the scope of your claims does not exceed what you can actually prove: if you have 10 verifiable witness statements from people defrauded by your manager, but you claim in your ad that he defrauded hundreds of people, then obviously your available evidence does not go very far in defending against the libel charge. Those ten witnesses may be enough for you to win your nonpayment case, but not necessarily enough to defend you against libel, depending on your exact statements.\n\nAs another answer already notes, stealing is quite different from nonpayment: the former implies bad\\-faith intent to permanently deprive you of something, while nonpayment could simply be the result of a poorly run business or unexpected financial setback. If you only have evidence of a history of nonpayment with no evidence about motivation, an accusation of stealing might be difficult to prove.\n\nMy guess as a non\\-lawyer is that a safe statement to make might be, \"I have successfully sued Comapny X \\[or whoever the defendant was] for nonpayment, and included as evidence 10 other accounts of people who suffered a similar fate.\" Such a statement is an easily verifiable matter of public record.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A former employee successfully sued their previous employer for non-payment and wants to publicly share this information. Which of the following statements would be the safest to make in an advertisement without risking a libel lawsuit?\n\nA) \"The owner of Company X is a thief who regularly steals from employees.\"\nB) \"Company X has defrauded hundreds of employees by refusing to pay them.\"\nC) \"I successfully sued Company X for non-payment, and my case included evidence from 10 other former employees with similar experiences.\"\nD) \"Company X's owner intentionally withholds pay from all employees to increase profits.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the safest statement to make because it is based on verifiable facts from the legal case. It doesn't make broad accusations or claims beyond what can be proven. Option A uses the term \"thief,\" which implies criminal intent that may be difficult to prove. Option B claims \"hundreds\" of employees were defrauded, which goes beyond the available evidence. Option D asserts intentional wrongdoing, which may not be provable based solely on the non-payment case. Option C sticks to the facts of the case and the evidence presented, making it the least likely to result in a successful libel claim."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5366/requiring-salary-information-and-medical-history-before-job-interview", "docs_id": 5366, "title": "Requiring salary information and medical history before job interview", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Rakuten Japan is asking all candidates to fill out the following forms before their first interview, including, for instance, itemized salary information from your current or previous position (verification \\[\u6e90\u6cc9\u5fb4\u53ce\u7968] may be requested later) and your medical history. \n\n[http://global.rakuten.com/careers/files/sd/\\[Name]\\[Rakuten]\\_Recruiting\\_questionnaire.doc](http://global.rakuten.com/careers/files/sd/[Name][Rakuten]_Recruiting_questionnaire.doc) (English, There is also a Japanese version of this document, but for some reason I am not able to post more than 2 links in this question)\n\n<http://global.rakuten.com/corp/careers/files/Health_Check_Sheet.xlsx> (Japanese and English)\n\nAccording to the Rakuten HR people these documents are \u201cnecessary in the selection process\u201d i.e. you will not be able to continue the selection process without submitting this information.\n\nAccording to the Rakuten Privacy Policy for Recruitment Activities that candidates must accept before submitting an online application, \u201c\u2026the Rakuten Group Company reserves the right to retain such information to the fullest extent required or permitted by law\u201d, regardless of the results of the selection process.\n\nApparently sense of privacy is not among the dimensions along which Rakuten aims at \u201cdiversifying \u2026 the people we employ\u201d (Hiroshi Mikitani, Market Place 3\\.0: Rewriting the Rules of Borderless Business, p.65\\).

One theory is \"general jurisdiction\" and the other is \"specific jurisdiction.\"\n\n*General Jurisdiction*\n\nWhen a court has \"general jurisdiction\" over a person, it can hear claims against that person arising anywhere in the world based upon any legal theory upon which relief may be granted by a court. Essentially what you seem to be really asking is whether funding through the U.S. Development Finance Corporation gives U.S. courts general jurisdiction over the foreign company.\n\nThe answer to this is \"no.\"\n\nThe only courts that have general jurisdiction over a company are the courts of the jurisdiction under whose laws it is established (e.g. Delaware for a company formed under Delaware law), and courts of a jurisdiction where a company has a headquarters significant enough for the company to be considered \"at home\" there (most companies would have only one headquarters, but some companies might have two or three of them that are equally core to its top level operations).\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court adopted this rule in a unanimous 9\\-0 decision in the case *Daimler Ag v. Bauman*, [571 U.S. 117](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/571/117/), 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014\\), which overruled a line of cases generally credited to the U.S. Supreme Court case of *International Shoe v. State of Washington*, [326 U.S. 310](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/310/) (1945\\). *International Shoe* had been widely interpreted for decades, before being effectively overruled by *Daimler*, to mean that simply having a registered agent in a state, a permanent employee based in a state, or a permanent office for the conduct of business in a state that need not be the company's headquarters, is sufficient to give U.S. courts general jurisdiction over that company.\n\nThe facts of the question, however, suggest that the foreign company wouldn't even meet the old *International Shoe* case standard. Certainly, the mere existence of the funding from a U.S. government agency, in and of itself, would not give U.S. courts general jurisdiction over a foreign company.\n\n*Specific Jurisdiction*\n\nThe other theory under which a court may assert jurisdiction (in an *in personam* case like a breach of contract case) is called \"specific jurisdiction\". This theory requires that the party sued did something to \"purposefully avail itself\" of the laws of the place where the court is located in connection with the course of events or transaction that form the basis of the lawsuit. Sometimes \"specific jurisdiction\" is also called \"[long arm jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-arm_jurisdiction)\".\n\nSo, unless the lawsuit related to the funding transaction from the government agency in some way (e.g. a suit by the agency to collect on a loan from it to the foreign company after it fails to repay the money lent to it as agreed), this funding transaction is not sufficient to establish \"specific jurisdiction\" over the foreign company.\n\nInstead, the transaction and events that form a basis for the lawsuit would have to have sufficient contacts with the U.S. to justify an exercise of \"specific jurisdiction\" over the company. A company isn't required to submit to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts for all dealings with U.S. persons simply as a result of receiving this funding.\n\n*Domestication of Foreign Judgments*\n\nIf the U.S. courts did not assert jurisdiction over the foreign company, however, and the U.S. person then won a foreign lawsuit against the funding recipient, the U.S. person could probably [domesticate the foreign judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_of_foreign_judgments) in a U.S. court (i.e. obtain formal recognition in a U.S. court that a valid judgment has been entered by a foreign court against a person), in order to garnish the proceeds of the U.S. Development Finance Corporation loan that would otherwise have been payable to the foreign person.\n\n*Footnote on Tag Jurisdiction*\n\nWhen you sue a natural person, a court can assert jurisdiction of that person (even in an *in personam* case), if that person has a summons from the court in that case is hand delivered to them in the state where the court is located. This is allowed even if neither the state where the court is located, nor the case, have any other connection to that person. *Burnham v. Superior Court*, [495 U.S. 604](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/604/) (1990\\). This is sometimes called \"tag jurisdiction\".\n\nBut, while the U.S. Supreme Court has not definitively ruled that companies are not subject to tag jurisdiction, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit (which is an intermediate federal appellate court immediately below the U.S. Supreme Court and covers most of the Western United States) has held that corporations aren't subject to tag jurisdiction, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider a certiorari petition from that ruling. *[Martinez v. Aero Caribbean](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/08/21/12-16043.pdf)*, 764 P.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2014\\) cert. denied 135 S.Ct. 2310 (2015\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A foreign company, XYZ Corp, incorporated in Germany, receives funding from the US Development Finance Corporation.

The funding from the US Development Finance Corporation alone does not grant US courts general jurisdiction over XYZ Corp (eliminating option A). The case of Daimler AG v. Bauman established that general jurisdiction typically only applies where a company is incorporated or has its principal place of business.\n\nHowever, US courts may have specific jurisdiction if the contract or its performance had sufficient contacts with the US. This aligns with the concept of \"purposeful availment\" mentioned in the passage (supporting option C).\n\nOption B is incorrect because while a forum selection clause in the contract would be relevant, it's not the only way to establish jurisdiction. \n\nOption D is overly broad and incorrect.

I'm essentially on a zero\\-hour contract, however my contract says that when work is available I will be given 24 hour/week \"basic\". There is usually more than enough work to go around and I can ask for overtime, with the exception of a few days in winter when our client airlines reduce their schedules.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was always a race for people to book Christmas off as the vast majority fairly reasonably don't want to work on Christmas Day and some are reliant on public transit (the company knows this and chose to hire us anyway). We're usually done by 11am unless a flight is delayed so it's not like I can't enjoy the holidays *and* work them (I can also refuse to work the past my scheduled finish time), however unless they remember to put me on shifts with colleagues who I can get a ride to/from work, it gets prohibitively expensive to get to and from work in a taxi.\n\nAbout a year before I started, the employment contract for new employees was changed. Staff before this point receive double pay for working bank holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Day. We, the newer staff, don't have that luxury. The older staff do not get double rate for leave taken on bank holidays, however.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, the situation regarding Christmas is uncertain. It's widely suspected that the company, trying to cut losses after keeping two thirds of the workforce on furlough for months and (to their credit) covering the last 20% of our paychecks, is going to only give the shifts to the staff they don't have to pay double rate for, and only approve leave for those who are paid double rate or otherwise force them to take leave. Because of our contracts, the newer staff will cost the half the amount the older staff will. The management has reshuffled after a couple of them left, so we don't know if they're still aware of the issues we face or not, if they are willing to make those accomodations, or are going to assign shifts based on how much it'll cost alone.\n\nI know employers can choose when we can take leave, but what's the legality in this situation, could this be considered discriminatory in any way, for example, if someone who made the leave request first is deferred over someone more expensive to have in work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If everyone hired after date X has a different contract from anyone hired before that date it is not discriminatory.

A lesser included charge is a crime for which all the elements must be established to prove the greater charge, but the converse is not true.\n\nThus, if someone is charged only with manslaughter in an indictment to which they plead not guilty, they cannot be convicted of murder. But, if someone is charged with murder in an indictment, to which they plead not guilty, they can be convicted of either murder or manslaughter which is a lesser included charge relative to a murder charge.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nBasically, the criminal justice process goes through the following steps in **a felony case** (some of which may be omitted in misdemeanor and/or petty offense cases):\n\n1. Someone is charged with a crime in a **criminal complaint** and **arrested**. These two events can occur in either order. If the complaint is made first, an arrest warrant will be issued by a magistrate and form the basis for a subsequent arrest and booking. If an arrest is made first, usually because a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe a crime was committed, the criminal complaint will be drawn up once the defendant has been arrested and booked.\n2. After both events in step 1 are complete, a **first appearance** of the defendant **in person** before a magistrate or judge is held in a matter of one to three days, or even a matter of hours, at which counsel is appointed if the defendant is indigent, the defendant is formally advised of the charges in the criminal complaint, and bail is set (or denied for cause or waived). Confusingly a first appearance is sometimes called an \"arraignment on the complaint\", but I am assuming that your question used the term \"arraignment\" in the predominant sense of an arraignment on an information or indictment.\n3. Then, in felony cases (but not misdemeanors), the criminal complaint is reviewed for probable cause following a **preliminary hearing** and if probable cause is found to exist it is converted to an \"information\" (if the preliminary hearing is waived by the defendant, the complaint is automatically converted to an \"information\"); or a **grand jury** reviews the criminal complaint for probable cause and if probable cause is found to exist it is converted to an \"indictment.\"\n4. The defendant is **arraigned** **in person** on the information or indictment. In an arraignment, the defendant is formally informed of the charges in the information or indictment, and the defendant enters a preliminary plea to each of the charges in the information or indictment. This would typically take five minutes to half an hour, depending upon the number of charges brought.\n5. **Pre\\-trial proceedings** (e.g., \"discovery\" and motion practice), if any, are conducted by the lawyers for the prosecution and the defense.\n6. A **trial** is held (if the defendant demands it, before a jury).\n\n**Caveat:** There are also more steps prior to the filing of a criminal complaint or arrest (related to searches, seizures and interrogations), and there are also more steps after the trial (related to sentencing, appeals and collateral attacks on convictions and the sealing of records and pardons and commutations), but none of those steps are pertinent to this question.\n\nA jury trial would simply never be (definitively and officially) scheduled until an arraignment of the defendant was conducted. So, while it is true that a jury trial would not be conducted on charges in an indictment until the defendant is arraigned (i.e., until the defendant enters a plea to the probable cause screened charges), in the ordinary course, this is a trivial matter.\n\nBut, because criminal trials can only be conducted after a defendant has been arraigned in person, the only time that a defendant can be tried in *abstentia* (i.e., without being present at the trial), is when the defendant is arraigned and enters a not guilty plea or the equivalent, and then absconds after that points but before the trial is conducted.\n\n(I'm not a complete expert on this, it may be necessary for the defendant to be present when the trial is commenced as well, but I don't need to know to answer this question.)\n\nAlso, while the requirement of an indictment by a grand jury for felonies exists in federal court under the U.S. Constitution, and in some state courts (mostly in the Eastern U.S.) under state constitutions, the U.S. Constitution permits a state to substitute a preliminary hearing giving rise to an \"information\" for a grand jury indictment if its state constitution permits.\n\nMy source for this post is a hard copy of the book Israel, Kamisar and LaFave, *Criminal Procedure and the Constitution* (1994\\).

The nature of the contract is indeed ambiguous. The initial offer and acceptance were verbal, but the subsequent signing of a \"Sale Note\" introduces ambiguity as to whether this document supersedes the oral agreement or merely records it.\n\n2.

If they do, can I sue them for stealing my idea? Or am I out of luck because ideas aren't protected?\n\nInterested in answers from any and all jurisdictions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mere ideas are not, as others have said, protected by copyright. However, the police officer in such a situation may have a duty of confidentiality, particularly if s/he is informed that the contents of the phone are confidential.\n\nFor example the [\"Officer's Code of Conduct\"](https://www.cantonohio.gov/389/Officers-Code-of-Conduct) of Canton Ohio, says:\n\n> Whatever a Police Officer sees, hears or learns of that is of a confidential nature will be kept a secret unless the performance of duty or legal provision requires otherwise. Members of the public have a right to security and privacy, and information obtained about them must not be improperly divulged.\n\nMany police departments have similar codes of conduct or policies. Such a policy might apply in the circumstances described in the question.\n\nIn [this page on \"Confidential information\"](https://www.taylorwessing.com/synapse/protection_confidential_info.html) posted by the TaylorWessing law firm, it is said that:\n\n> There are three circumstances in which the disclosure of information gives rise to an obligation of confidence:\n> \n> \n> * An obligation imposed by contract \u2013 for example, non\\-disclosure agreements.\n> * An obligation implied because of the circumstances of disclosure \u2013 this is determined on the basis of whether a reasonable man standing in the shoes of the recipient of the information would have realised that the information was being given to him in confidence.\n> * An obligation implied because of the special relationship between the parties concerned \u2013 for example, employer/employee relationships.\n> \n> \n> The best way of ensuring that confidential information is recognised and treated as such is by contract. If no express requirement for confidentiality is imposed, the manner in which the discloser treats the information can be held as indicative of its level of confidentially. Talking about information in public places, for example, would cause the recipient to assume it was not confidential in nature.\n> \n> \n> An action for breach of confidence is based on the conscience of the recipient who must have agreed or known that the information is confidential. Thus an action for breach of confidence can be brought against the original recipient of the information and any subsequent recipient who becomes aware of the fact that the information is confidential.\n> \n> \n> An action for breach of confidence may be brought against a person who has used or disclosed, or threatened to use or disclose, confidential information without permission.\n\nA police officer engaged in a search of confidential documents, whether found on a phone, on a computer, or in a filing cabinet, is in a \"special relationship\" with the sub ject of the search, and the \"circumstances of disclosure\" are unusual. Use of such information for private, personal gain unrelated to any police function might be held to violate an implied duty of confidentiality, particularly if the officer is informed of the confidential nature of the documents.\n\nIf the documents contain or constitute ***trade secrets***, unauthorized use will give grounds for a lawsuit. This would not apply to proper use within a police investigation or criminal case, but it would apply to private use or disclosure by the officer.\n\nin [\"Release of personal information to\npolice: your privacy rights\"](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fs-privacy-release-of-pi-to-police-your-privacy-rights.pdf) from the Government of Ontario it is said that:\n\n> Ontario public sector organizations, such as provincial ministries and agencies, municipalities, schools, and transit systems, are required by\n> law to protect your personal information and to follow certain rules when collecting, using, and disclosing your personal information.\n\nThis document is primarily about when other governnment agencies can release personal information to law enforcement, but it might be taken to imply a similar obligation to respect privacy being imposed on law enforcement officers.\n\nIn [this page](https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/data-pro/data-protection/what-is-the-data-protection-act/) and other linked pages the UK metropolitian police indicate that they are subject to the [Data Protection Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/pdfs/ukpga_20180012_en.pdf) This is closely related to the GDPR.

Both X and Y clearly expressed their intent to be bound by the contract, X by paying the agreed money, Y by signing the contract. \n\nIn my opinion, that contract is perfectly legal and enforceable. And if anyone could claim it is not valid, that would be X whose signature is missing, but not Y. Not that I think X could get their money back.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Stormy Daniels NDA case, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of the agreement?\n\nA) The NDA is automatically unenforceable because it involves concealing information that the public has a right to know for national security reasons.\n\nB) The NDA is likely enforceable as a contract, given that both parties demonstrated their intent to be bound by it through their actions.\n\nC) The NDA is unenforceable because it violates First Amendment rights by restricting speech about public figures.\n\nD) The NDA can only be challenged by the party whose signature is missing from the contract, not by the party who signed it.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, an NDA is essentially a contract, and in this case, both parties demonstrated their intent to be bound by it. One party (X) paid the agreed amount, while the other party (Y) signed the contract. This mutual expression of intent typically makes a contract enforceable, even if one party's signature is missing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mere involvement of potentially sensitive information doesn't automatically invalidate an NDA. Courts would need to weigh various factors to determine if public interest outweighs the contract.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the First Amendment protects free speech, individuals can voluntarily agree to limit their speech through contracts like NDAs, which are generally considered enforceable.\n\nOption D is partially true but incomplete. While the party whose signature is missing might have a stronger case to challenge the contract, it doesn't mean the signing party has no grounds to contest it under certain circumstances."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2274/is-there-a-case-to-be-pursued-for-a-non-domesticated-bank-account-attachment", "docs_id": 2274, "title": "Is there a case to be pursued for a non-domesticated bank account attachment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm going to try and be as brief as possible because I just want to get an idea if there is something to pursue here as a case:\n\nI had old community debts from my marriage in CA; one of those debts was pursued by a collection agency, also in CA. The collection agency knew that I was in NV. An attachment to my bank account was pursued and granted, that levy was served by the Sherrif's department (also in CA). Sheriff served that levy to my nationwide bank; the bank also knew I was in Nevada. \n\nI had my bank account released by a bankruptcy judge in NV. Part of the reason why it was released was because the judgement against my bank account was never domesticated in Nevada. \n\nIn short, I had three CA agencies \\- the collector, the Sherrifs and the nationwide bank \\- all of whom knew I was in Nevada, all act upon a non\\-domesticated judgement. The NV constable was never aware of the judgements against me. For all intents \\& purposes, both the Sheriffs and Chase reached across state lines when they all knew that I was no longer in CA and an established resident in NV.\n\nCan I pursue a case against all three of them for not domesticating the judgement. At some point, doesn't the Sheriff and/or Chase have the responsibility to say \"no, we can't act on this across state lines\"? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not.\n\nAs I read your question you legitimately owe money on a debt proven in California. The proper way for the creditor to recover it in Nevada was by domesticating the judgement (essentially an administrative rather than judicial action) and this didn't happen.\n\nThe only person who has suffered damage through this is the court system in Nevada by not being able to collect their fee for domestication. On what basis of damage to you are you proposing to sue?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, why is it unlikely that the individual can successfully pursue a case against the collection agency, sheriff's department, and bank for failing to domesticate the judgment in Nevada?\n\nA) The actions taken were legal because the debt originated in California\nB) The individual suffered no financial damages from the lack of domestication\nC) Only the Nevada court system has standing to sue for the missed domestication fee\nD) The bankruptcy judge's decision to release the bank account negates any potential case\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The key point in the top answer is that the individual has not suffered any damages due to the failure to domesticate the judgment. The debt was legitimate, and the only entity that lost out financially was the Nevada court system, which didn't receive the domestication fee. Without personal damages, the individual lacks grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality of the actions is questionable due to the lack of domestication, regardless of where the debt originated.\n\nOption C, while touching on a valid point about the court system losing out on fees, is not the primary reason why the individual can't pursue a case. The individual's lack of standing is due to absence of personal damages, not because only the court can sue.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the bankruptcy judge's decision resolved the immediate issue with the bank account, it doesn't negate potential legal issues with how the judgment was pursued across state lines."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28541/gdpr-a-mobile-app-that-allows-user-to-store-media-do-we-have-to-option-user-co", "docs_id": 28541, "title": "GDPR - A mobile App that allows user to store media do we have to option user consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a few doubts about GDPR law.
