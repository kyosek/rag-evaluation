She claimed she thought she was in her apartment. How would a defense of \"mistake of fact\" apply in said case? IANAL and seek to understand the subject matter\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Amber Guyger was convicted of murder under [Texas Penal Code section 19\\.02](https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/penal-code/penal-sect-19-02.html):\n\n> A person commits the offense of murder if the person 1\\) intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual or 2\\) intends to cause serious bodily injury and commits and act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual.\n\nThe Texas mistake\\-of\\-fact defense is codified at [Penal Code section 8\\.02](https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/penal-code/penal-sect-8-02.html):\n\n> It is a defense to prosecution that the actor through mistake formed a reasonable belief about a matter of fact if his mistaken belief negated the kind of culpability required for commission of the offense.\n\nTo assert a mistake of fact defense, then, you need to demonstrate that you reasonably believed something that changes whether or not you met the *mens rea* requirement of intentionally or knowingly causing a death/serious bodily injury.\n\nAn example would be firing a gun at what you reasonably thought was a corpse, or a mannequin, or Superman. In any of those circumstances, you would not have intended or known that you were going to cause someone's death. If you reasonably believed your gun was unloaded, you would not have known you were going to kill someone if you pulled the trigger.\n\nIn Guyger's case, Whether she was in her apartment or someone else's, she still knew that putting two bullets in a man eating ice cream would cause his death or serious bodily harm.\n\nIn the Guyger case, the defendant claimed she was mistaken about what apartment she was in, but that doesn't change whether she had the intent to kill Mr. Jean.\n\nThat mistake *does* implicate the Texas \"Castle doctrine\" statute, [Penal Code section 9\\.32](https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/penal-code/penal-sect-9-32.html):\n\n> A person is justified in using deadly force against another ... when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary ... to protect the actor against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful deadly force.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The actor's belief ... that the deadly force was immediately necessary ... is presumed to be reasonable if the actor ... knew or had reason to believe that the person against whom the deadly force was used ... unlawfully and with force entered ... the actor's occupied habitation\n\nIf her mistake was reasonable, that would give her reason to believe Mr. Jean had unlawfully and with force entered her home, making it presumptively reasonable that she used deadly force.\n\nBut the mistake of fact defense only looks at mistakes that change whether you committed the offense, not whether an affirmative defense is available to you, so it doesn't really change whether the defense is available.\n\nNonetheless, it's generally accepted that a person can use self\\-defense doctrines like this even when they're mistaken about whether they're in danger. The question for the jury in those cases is whether the defendant's mistake was reasonable.\n\nBecause the jury convicted her, it necessarily did not believe that she had made a reasonable mistake."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Amber Guyger case, why was the \"mistake of fact\" defense not successful in her murder trial?\n\nA) Because she intentionally entered the wrong apartment\nB) Because her mistake about which apartment she was in did not negate her intent to cause death or serious bodily injury\nC) Because the Castle doctrine does not apply to police officers\nD) Because mistake of fact defense is not recognized in Texas\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The \"mistake of fact\" defense in Texas requires that the mistake negates the kind of culpability required for the offense. In Guyger's case, even though she may have mistakenly believed she was in her own apartment, this mistake did not negate her intent to cause death or serious bodily injury when she shot Botham Jean. The murder statute in Texas requires that a person intentionally or knowingly causes death, or intends to cause serious bodily injury. Guyger's mistake about her location did not change the fact that she intentionally shot Jean, knowing it would cause death or serious injury. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while she did enter the wrong apartment, this wasn't the reason the mistake of fact defense failed. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the Castle doctrine can apply to anyone, including police officers, but it wasn't directly relevant to the mistake of fact defense.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Texas does recognize the mistake of fact defense, as codified in Texas Penal Code section 8.02."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14157/what-slaughter-laws-exist-in-the-us-and-europe", "docs_id": 14157, "title": "What slaughter laws exist in the US and Europe?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I mean actual laws for industrial farms applicable to killing animals.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [7 USC 1902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/1902) allows one of two slaughter methods:\n\n> (a) in the case of cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine, and\n>  other livestock, all animals are rendered insensible to pain by a\n>  single blow or gunshot or an electrical, chemical or other means that\n>  is rapid and effective, before being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast,\n>  or cut;

The question mentions:\n\n> **Taxes**, which I presume must be authorized and regulated by the US Constitution, but I don't know the details\n\nNot exactly. The states existed before the Federal government. They are not created by the Federal Constitution, nor authorized by it. A number of restrictions on state powers and actions are specified by the Federal Constitution, and a number of others are imposed by Federal law. (the Federal courts have found implied restrictions beyond the explicitly stated ones.) But there is no Federal provision granting states the power to impose taxes, only restrictions on that pre\\-existing power.\n\nStates cannot impose taxes so as to violate rights federally guaranteed, or to place *unreasonable* burdens on the exercise of those rights. For example, states cannot impose different taxes or tax rates on a racial basis. States cannot impose different taxes on residents of other states temporarily present in, or doing business in the state. States cannot impose different taxes on people newly moved there from other states, compared to long\\-established residents. State taxes must not violate the Equal Protection clause. However, states may choose the type and amount of taxes to impose. They can use sales tax, VAT tax, property tax, income tax, excise tax, flat tax, or any combination that their legislatures pass. Different taxes may be imposed on different professions or kinds of businesses.\n\n> Does the US Constitution guarantee all citizens have the natural right to conduct their own business affairs?\n\nNot as such, no. The Due Process and Equal Protection clauses limit to some extent the ability of a state to prohibit a particular business on a whim. But when a state asserts that a particular business is harmful, and demonstrates a plausible basis for that view, so that the law passes \"Rational basis\" review, the state can prohibit it, or heavily regulate it, or license it. \n\n> If so, does a citizen lose the right to legally own and operate a business if they cannot afford requisite state or local business license fees?\n\nA state may require a license to engage in a particular occupation, and may require a fee, one\\-time or recurring, high or low, for that license. In addition, a tax may be imposed on those in a particular business or profession, which is not imposed on other kinds of business. For example, in many states, lawyers must pay an annual license fee, or they are not allowed to practice. So must many other regulated professions, such as hairstylist. One who cannot afford the fee may not engage in the business or profession. The state may waive or reduce fees for those too poor to afford them, but need not do so, and many states do not so so.\n\nSimilarly, the state may charge a fee for a driver's license, and one who cannot pay it may not legally drive. \n\n> Likewise, does a citizen lose the right to utilize the court system to petition for a redress of grievances, if they cannot afford the requisite court fees?\n\nMany states have provisions waiving or lowering court fees for those who cannot afford them, but in most cases this is applied only in severe cases, say where a person would have to go without food to afford court fees. There have been a few federal cases requiring fee waivers for those who cannot afford court fees, mostly in connection with criminal defendants. There is not currently a general federal rule requiring court access for those who cannot afford court fees. Perhaps there should be. A case could be made that Equal Protection requires this, but Federal Courts have not so held.\n\nFederal courts **have** held that holding people in jail or prison because they truly cannot afford fines, bail, or court fees is an unconstitutional denial of Equal Protection. But states need not waive such fees; they can be deferred and charged should the person earn enough money to (just barely) afford them. Even this rule is not yet invariably enforced, and many state courts routinely ignore it.\n\nBy the way \"petition for a redress of grievances\" doe snot normally refer to bringing a court case, but to asking a legislature to change a law, or asking an administrator or executive to exercise permitted discretion in a particular way. \n\n> And lastly, if a citizen is convicted of a crime or infraction, and the sentence requires the convict to utilize government services (e.g. prison services, probation services, registration services, etc.); under the US Constitution, can state government agencies providing these services legally require the convict to pay fees for these services (e.g. prison service fees, probation service fees, registration service fees), if these fees were not explicitly included in the sentence as fines?\n\nYes it can impose such fees, but usually only when neither the convict nor his or her dependents will be impoverished by such fees, as I understand it. \n\n> If a state attempts to pass or enforce state legislation dictating such fees, should this legislation generally be struck down as unconstitutional?\n\nSuch laws will not be held unconstitutional by US Federal courts under the Federal Constitution, unless they are found to violate Equal Protection, Due Process, or other specifically imposed restrictions on the state. For example, fees which were in practice imposed on people of one religion, but not those of another, would be struck down. But a fee imposed on everyone will not usually be overturned.\n\n\"The law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to steal bread from shops, beg in the streets, and sleep under bridges.\" \\-Anatole France"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about state-imposed fees and taxes in the United States is most accurate?\n\nA) States must receive explicit authorization from the U.S. Constitution to impose any form of taxation on their citizens.\n\nB) Federal courts have consistently ruled that states must waive all court fees for individuals who cannot afford them, regardless of the severity of their financial situation.\n\nC) States are prohibited from imposing different tax rates on various professions or types of businesses, as this would violate the Equal Protection clause.\n\nD) States can require license fees for certain professions, and individuals who cannot afford these fees may be legally barred from practicing those professions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because the information provided states that many regulated professions require license fees, and those who cannot afford them may not legally engage in that business or profession.

Some laws target races by saying \"we will compensate for X past action\", but then the law is for people who suffered from the action, like discriminatory housing policies, which Hispanic and other residents suffered from too.\n\nIs it legal for Evanston to give grants to black residents and not, say, Asian residents?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a starting point, and because it is a common occurrence, we can conclude that the government *can* give a benefit to someone without having to give the same benefit to everyone. It is a political matter that a divorced spouse is entitled to Social Security benefits based on a marriage that lasted at least 10 years, and not 9 years. More such restrictions on benefits are listed [here](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10035.pdf). Equal protection does not \"everybody gets the benefit\".\n\nSecond, the government can give benefits to people whom it has harmed, again a point that hopefully does not require extensive justification. Third, and this leads to a concrete example, under the Japanese\\-American Evacuation Claims Act of 1948, $37 million was paid by the federal government to 26,000 who were sent to the Japanese\\-American concentration camps during WWII, so there is an \"effects\\-based\" racial discrimination that this benefit was only given to a specific racial group, because the underlying wrong was also racially\\-based, and likewise Aleut residents of the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof islands were likewise compensated for harm done to them by the government. A person is not barred from compensation by wrongful government action just because the persons and others who are compensated for governmental wrong were the victims of a racially discriminatory wrong (therefore there is a racal correlate to the class of victims).\n\nVictims of government harm can be conceptually divided into two groups: direct victims, and indirect victims. There is no controversy over the legality of the government compensating individuals for its wrongful actions. The only plausible point of legal objection would be over compensating people who descended from victims of government harm. There is a legal difference between lineage\\-based discrimination and race\\-based discrimination, simply because lineage\\-based discrimination is *not* racial discrimination, which is forbidden. There is a greater chance that lineage\\-based reparations could pass strict scrutiny, in that it more narrowly tailors the benefit to exactly reach the compelling government interest, as opposed to a policy that broadly gives a compensatory benefit to anyone who self\\-identifies as being of a particular race.\n\nFinally, the question might be asked whether a program of government compensation for wrongful acts can be selective, in which victims it identifies for compensation. Yes, it can, for example the [Radiation Exposure Compensation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_Exposure_Compensation_Act) for specific classes of persons harmed by government in connection with atmospheric A\\-bomb tests and uranium mining \u2013 it does not compensate *all* individuals who were harmed by government action.

If a certain police act is prohibited by the Constitution, Congress cannot legislatively allow that act, whether in a single state or uniformly across all states.

In single party states, any single person who is part of a call or communication can record it. In \"two party\" states, everyone that is part of the call must be **informed**.\n\nThere are numerous exceptions and stipulations however.\n\n**GREAT EXPECTATIONS**\n\nFirst off, is there an \"expectation of privacy.\" Again this varies by state and case law. Generally, if there is no expectation of privacy, then there is a clear exception to record. For instance, if you are in a busy restaurant, and people around you can hear or eavesdrop, you have no expectation of privacy.\n\nCourts have also ruled that if you are in the presence of a police officer performing official duties, there is also no expectation of privacy (not for either of you).\n\n**IS IT LIVE OR IS IT MEMOREX**\n\nAre you being recorded? If you are in a two/all party state, and you have an expectation of privacy (a phone call made in your home) then one of the following **must** occur:\n\n1. If the police are recording you without your knowledge, they must have a court order permitting them to do so as part of an investigation.\n2. Otherwise you must be notified with a statement at the beginning of the call that the call is being recorded. (Typically your option is to hang up or continue. Continuing the call implies your consent.)\n3. In *some states* the notification can be in the form of a \"duck\" or a beep every 15 seconds (time period varies, this is also different per state).\n\n**OPINION NOT ADVICE BELOW**\n\n***I would think*** that being notified that a call is being recorded ends any expectation of privacy for any involved party. Assuming the state law and related case law supports recording when there is no expectation of privacy, this circumstance would seem to permit recording legally.\n\nDoubly so if your were talking to police in official capacity (did you notice a beep every xx seconds?)\n\n*CAUTION:* Because this varies so much by state, and because even the various Federal District Courts are not in unanimous agreement on the minutiae, there may be other factors to consider."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a two-party consent state, you receive a call from a state official that begins with a notification that the call is being recorded. You inform the official that you are also recording the call, and they claim it's illegal for you to do so. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The official is correct; only government agencies can record calls in two-party consent states.\n\nB) You are legally allowed to record the call because the official's notification eliminated any expectation of privacy.\n\nC) You need to obtain written consent from the official before you can legally record the call.\n\nD) The legality of your recording depends on whether the official is a law enforcement officer or not.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In two-party consent states, all parties must be informed of the recording. However, when the state official notified you that the call was being recorded, this eliminated any expectation of privacy for all parties involved. The notification implies consent for recording, and this applies to both parties. Therefore, you would likely be legally allowed to record the call as well.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the law doesn't typically give exclusive recording rights to government agencies. Answer C is incorrect because verbal notification is usually sufficient; written consent is not typically required. Answer D is incorrect because the legality in this case is more dependent on the notification and consent rather than the official's specific role.\n\nIt's important to note that laws can vary by state and there may be other factors to consider, but based on the information provided, B is the most accurate answer."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78113/is-it-legal-to-break-into-a-property-from-which-you-are-unlawfully-evicted-by-th", "docs_id": 78113, "title": "Is it legal to break into a property from which you are unlawfully evicted by the landlord while they are currently inside if you don\u2019t threaten/harm?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The landlady gave no formal notices or court processes to end my lease or repossess the property.

This is interesting. What jurisdictions does this include?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No jurisdiction of which I am aware allows for service of process to be made via social media as a matter of course.\n\nBut some jurisdictions (indeed, almost all U.S. jurisdictions) allow what is called \"substituted service\" by a means not usually allowed in cases where it would normally not be permitted if service can not be obtained by standard means of personal delivery to the person being served, or personal delivery to someone else authorized by court rule or statute to accept service on behalf of the person being served, that is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice to a defendant.\n\nIn Colorado, for example, the usual means of making service of process are set forth in Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e), but Colorado Rule of Civl Procedure 4(f) allows a party seeking to serve someone with process who has made duly diligent efforts to do so via the Rule 4(e) methods to instead serve process by a customized means set forth in Rule 4(f) which states:\n\n> (f) Substituted Service.

A plea of guilty or not guilty is entered at an arraignment, which sometimes is combined with a first court appearance and sometimes is conducted separately.\n\nA preliminary hearing happens much later in the criminal justice process, after an arraignment (which is sometimes combined with a first court appearance), and after counsel is assigned to represent the person who is charged. A preliminary hearing is an adversarial mini\\-trial before a judge at which the prosecution presents evidence sufficient to establish probable cause on previously disclosed charged in a somewhat summary fashion (not necessarily everything to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt), and the attorney for the defendant can cross\\-examine witnesses, object to questions improper under the rules of evidence, and introduce exonerating evidence (although this last option is only rarely utilized). A preliminary hearing is a substitute for a grand jury indictment as a means to screen whether charges are supported by probable cause.\n\nUsually, but not in absolutely all cases, if the arrest is pursuant to an arrest warrant, the arrest warrant will be presented to the person being arrested immediately prior to, at the time of the arrest, or immediately after the arrest is made, and the arrest warrant will provide some insight into the charge.\n\nBut, unless a state statute or court rule provides otherwise, a charge does not usually need to be disclosed during the actual process of making an arrest, or while the person arrested is being transported to a police station or jail for booking, although the charge often is disclosed at that time or even before the arrest is made.\n\nFrequently, someone is read their *Miranda* rights before the charge is identified.\n\nSome of the fine details are a matter of state specific court rules and statutes, but the general outline of the process described above is the U.S. constitutional requirement.\n\nThe process for arresting a minor is not very different from the process for arresting an adult, but usually, when a minor is arrested, a parent or guardian must be promptly notified of the arrest and the charge, if possible.\n\nMany states have a minimum age for arresting a minor for committing a crime or juvenile delinquency offense, which is typically somewhere in the range from age seven to age twelve, although there is considerable variation on this point. This is an area of the law where active efforts to pass reform legislation to take a less punitive approach with younger minors are underway.\n\n**Minors Taken Into Custody For Other Reasons**\n\nAlso, while adults are overwhelmingly arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime, a minor is sometime placed under law enforcement or social services custody in a manner that looks like an arrest, but isn't, for a reason other than a charge that the minor is actually believed to have committed a crime.\n\nFor example, suppose that a five year old child is found in an apartment at which two adults presumed to be the child's mother and father, are found dead (the reason for their deaths doesn't really matter). In that situation, the law enforcement officer at the scene would generally take physical custody of the child pending the arrival of a social services officer at the scene who would then take physical custody of the child from the law enforcement officer until another suitable guardian could be located, even though there is no suspicion that the child committed a crime.\n\nThe name for this process varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nIn New York State, for example, this is called \"person in need of supervision\" case (PINS for short), which is sometimes thought of as a civil custody matter and is sometimes classified as what is called a \"status offense\" that justifies the government taking custody of a minor even though the minor has not committed a crime."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States criminal justice system, at what point must a charge against an arrested person be identified?\n\nA) Immediately upon arrest\nB) Within 24 hours of arrest\nC) At the preliminary hearing\nD) By the time of booking or first court appearance\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, a charge must be identified very early in the criminal justice process.

The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes, and any disposition of cryptocurrency, including using it to pay taxes, can trigger a taxable event. This is true even for involuntary transfers, as exemplified by the tax sale scenario mentioned in the documentation. The fact that paying taxes is generally considered involuntary does not exempt the transaction from potential capital gains or losses.

Even though the changes are physically small, they are enough.\n\n> A crucial factor in current legal analysis of derivative works is transformativeness, largely as a result of the Supreme Court's 1994 decision in Campbell v. Acuff\\-Rose Music, Inc. The Court's opinion emphasized the importance of transformativeness in its fair use analysis of the parody of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" involved in the Campbell case. In parody, as the Court explained, the transformativeness is the new insight that readers, listeners, or viewers gain from the parodic treatment of the original work. As the Court pointed out, the words of the parody \"derisively demonstrat\\[e] how bland and banal the Orbison \\[Pretty Woman] song\" is.\n\nFor an author to have copyright in the derivative they must:\n\n1. Meet the (low) threshold of originality for copyright to exist.\n2. Make their derivative lawfully \\- either because they have permission or because their use falls under an exception to copyright like fair use or fair dealing.\n\nHowever, they do *not* have copyright in the original elements.

A person is suspected of some crime like selling drugs, not arrested, but told by a police officer to go away and never come back. This is way beyond the power of the police. After due legal process, a proven (not just suspected) public menace could be ordered by the court to stay away from the park.\n\nA police officer can, of course, order a person to leave a park when they violate a [park rule](http://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=672), in fact rule number 1 is \"It is unlawful for any person to do or *to allow or permit* any of the acts prohibited by this chapter in any park in Salt Lake City\", so the police cannot legally turn a blind eye to rule violations. Violation of park rules is an infraction which can earn you a ticket of up to $299\\. However, the officer can tell you to go away, rather than giving you a ticket or arresting you. But an police order cannot issue a unilateral restraining order.\n\nApart from city laws, there are general [state laws](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter6/C76-6_1800010118000101.pdf) regarding trespass and destruction of property. The state criminal trespass law says that \n\n> A person is guilty of criminal trespass if...knowing the person's...\n>  entry or presence is unlawful, the person enters or remains on to\n>  which notice against entering is given by...personal communication to\n>  the person by the owner or someone with apparent authority to act for\n>  the owner\n\nIn this case, the owner is the city, and the officer has apparent authority to act for that owner. In the case of private property, the owner or his agent has very broad authority to give notice requiring you to leave (e.g. if you don't like their politics or their shirt); but in the case of public property, the government has more narrowly circumscribed authority to kick you out."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A police officer in Salt Lake City, Utah suspects a person of selling drugs in a public park, but has no concrete evidence.

The images you've added don't seem alike enough to be confusing to me (I don't think I'd be mistaking one for the other), but in a lot of settings the app name will have only text, not an image. Then you get at the trademark issue for the term \"NFL\" itself. \n\nNFL can trademark that three\\-letter sequence, and there are good reasons for them being able to keep control of that trademark to authenticate sourcing. For example, if I said \"this hamburger is from McDonalds\" you have certain expectations about it based on the brand, and McDonalds the company has a legally protected interest in preventing me from saying that if it wasn't true. I have no right to put that 9\\-letter sequence on my burger joint without a license from the corporate giant. \n\nSimilarly, The NFL has a legally protected interest in preventing somebody from advertising or implying that an information source or the information contained therein is licensed and/or an official source of information, if that's not true. A reasonable person might expect that an information source about NFL player injuries, with \"NFL\" in its name, would be an official licensed source of that information; the real NFL can seek an injunction and/or penalties if that's not actually the case. \"Pro Football Player Injury Tracker\" might not carry the same expectation. \n\nAt the bottom of [NFL.com](http://www.nfl.com/), they claim, emphasis added, that \"**NFL and** the NFL shield design are registered trademarks of the National Football League.\" So they have put folks on notice they intend to defend that three\\-letter sequence as theirs, at least for all subjects related to professional American football. \n\n[Sean Mullin says](http://www.ehow.com/list_6647869_nfl-super-bowl-trademark-regulations.html) \"The NFL is notorious for guarding its intellectual property rights to the full extent of the law.\" X should probably spend some time with an IP lawyer. \n\nIf you're asking if it's *possible* for X to legally use the NFL's trademark, the short answer is **yes**. It is possible for X to license use of the trademark from the NFL so long as the NFL is willing to grant/sell the license on terms that X also agrees to.\n\nSee [this prequalification page](https://www.nfl.info/NFLConsProd/Welcome/cpAgreement.htm) linked to from [this law firm's website](http://www.legalteamusa.net/tacticalip/2013/10/25/the-nfl-and-trademarks/), or click \"Become a Licensee\" [here](https://www.nfl.info/NFLConsProd/Welcome/index.html) to see that in context."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: X develops an app called \"NFL Injury Tracker\" that provides information about injuries to players in the National Football League.

Using \"NFL\" in the app name could imply official association or licensing, which may confuse consumers. Similarly, using a logo that closely resembles the NFL shield could also suggest an official connection. The NFL is known to strongly protect its intellectual property. To avoid potential trademark infringement, X would likely need to obtain a license from the NFL to use both the name and a similar logo.

But it does provide constitutional protections that are enforced more strictly (which is to say that the laws possibly violating a right are subject to \"strict scrutiny\" in \"intermediate scrutiny\") in some circumstances, and more leniently with more deference to the legislature in other circumstances (which is to say that the laws are subject to \"rational basis\" review). These standards of review, including rational basis review, are the product of court interpretations of the U.S. Constitution in case law.\n\nOften a law will colorably violate equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protections in U.S. law. If the law does so, but the non\\-equal treatment does not involve a 'protected class\", it is subject to \"rational basis\" review for constitutionality, which is very lenient.\n\nFor example, the law might say that people on the north and west sides of their streets get to vote in the morning, and people on the south and east sides of their streets get to vote in the afternoon. People on different sides of the street are not treated exactly equally. But, the side of the street that you live on is not a protected class, so this law would be upheld against a constitutional equal protection challenge if there was any rational basis for it. In this case, it would probably be upheld on the grounds of administrative convenience and managing scarce election administration resources.\n\nOn the other hand, a law that said that black people vote in the morning and white people vote in the afternoon, since it involves race, a protected class, are subject to strict scrutiny and a law that made that distinction would be struck down.\n\nSo probably, would a law that said that women vote in the morning and men vote in the afternoon, since sex distinctions are usually subject to intermediate scrutiny. And, while the intermediate scrutiny standard wouldn't be met under modern U.S. law in modern U.S. conditions of society, in the circumstances of daily life of the 1880s, when women were overwhelmingly home makers in some localities, and many men worked at 9\\-5 jobs away from home in those localities (perhaps a mining town), the law might even have been upheld under an intermediate scrutiny standard. In reality world, cases like that more often come up, not in election law cases, but in cases where there is discrimination on the basis of gender in tee time allocations at public golf courses.\n\nAlso, when a law is subject to rational basis review, the reasons that the legislature passes the law, if they would be rational if true, are sufficient to validate a law even if the reasons that would make the legislation rational are not, as the legislature believed them to be, actually true as a factual matter, unless it is physically impossible for what is described to happen under a law of nature, for example (e.g., it the prison warden is ordered to hold a prisoner in a cell in which the law of gravity does not exist).\n\nFor example, if the law says that school children must have their route diverted if a black cat would otherwise have crossed their path, because otherwise they will have bad luck, that law could be upheld in a rational basis analysis, even though crossing the path of a black cat does not, in fact, give you bad luck.\n\nLikewise, a law doesn't have to be the best or most accurate way to make a rational distinction to meet the rational basis. The fact that a better alternative way to handle the issue that the law addresses doesn't mean that it fails to survive rational basis review.\n\nBut if a law truly is, as the question has assumed by definition, completely irrational, it will not be found constitutional even under a rational basis test. So, if there is any colorable equal protection violation or other colorable constitutional violation subject to rational basis review, a completely irrational law will be struck down.\n\nThere are maybe half a dozen or a dozen cases in all of U.S. case law since the adoption of the 14th Amendment that have been found not to meet that test out of hundreds or thousands of challenges on grounds where the rational basis test applies. But on rare occasions, it does happen.\n\n**Canons Of Statutory Construction**\n\n*The Canon Against Absurdity*\n\nAlso, there is a canon of statutory construction against absurdity. Generally speaking, if a plain reading of a statute leads to an absurd result, a court will apply this canon of statutory construction to determine that the legislative intent was something other than what the law actually literally said even if that is the clear plain meaning of a statute.\n\nThis often comes up when the word \"not\" gets omitted in a complex sentence, reversing the clear intent of the law. In this situation, the canon of statutory instruction against absurdity will often supply the missing word giving the law the opposite meaning of what it irrationally actually says.\n\nThe canon of statutory construction against absurdity is often applicable if the statute read as it was actually adopted is irrational.\n\n*The Canon Against Interpretations In Degradation Of The Common Law*\n\nAnother canon of statutory interpretation that sometimes comes into play pertinent to \"customary\" law or \"common law\" established by cases rather than a statute in the U.S., is that statutes will not be deemed to be \"in degradation of the common law\" (i.e. to override a common law rule of law) unless the legislative intent to do so is clear. So, often a law that seems odds with be interpreted in the context of a way to simultaneously honor it (even if it isn't the most natural interpretation of the language) while leaving the existing common law and equity jurisprudence established by case law in place.\n\nFor example, if a statute holds that someone who signs a document is bound by it, this statute would usually not be held to override the common law rule that a signature obtained through fraud about what someone is actually signing (e.g. substituting a check when someone thinks that they are signing a receipt), called fraud in the factum, would usually held not to be pre\\-empted and contradicted by the statute, even though the statutory does not expressly identify this common law exception to its plain language.\n\nOn the other hand, the degradation of the common law canon of statutory construction is usually not applied, often with irrational or absurd result, in the case of a federal statute related to employee benefits called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which has been held to have extraordinarily broad pre\\-emptive effects.\n\n**The General Rule Is That Stupid Or Unwise Laws Are Valid**\n\nThis said, there is a difference between irrational, and merely stupid or unwise. The legislature is free to pass otherwise constitutional law that are stupid or unwise. And, if there is no doubt, given the legislative history and the language of the statute, that the legislature really did mean what the statute says, and the statute doesn't colorable violate any constitutional right, even equal protection, it will be upheld, even if it seems bizarre or irrational.\n\nFor example, if it is absolutely clear that you can convict dead people of crimes and that the legislature really meant what it said when it said that if you do, the corpse of the dead person needs to be kept in a prison cell for the duration of the prison sentence, then that law would probably be upheld and enforced by a court, even though it is bizarre and crazy.\n\nThere are probably at least half a dozen or a dozen decided cases in which a court has said, that a law is completely stupid or unwise, but it is not colorably unconstitutional or complete irrational, and so the court upholds the law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the United States legal system, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding irrational or absurd laws?\n\nA) Courts always strike down irrational laws using the peremptory norm principle from international law.\nB) The Constitution explicitly prohibits irrational laws, making them automatically void.\nC) Courts may uphold seemingly irrational laws if they pass the \"rational basis\" test under constitutional review.\nD) Customary law always takes precedence over codified law when dealing with irrational statutes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, while the U.S. Constitution doesn't explicitly prohibit irrational laws, courts apply different levels of scrutiny when reviewing laws for constitutionality. Many laws are subject to \"rational basis\" review, which is very lenient. Under this standard, a law may be upheld even if it seems irrational, as long as there is any conceivable rational basis for it. \n\nOption A is incorrect because peremptory norms apply only to international law, not domestic U.S. law. \n\nOption B is wrong because the Constitution does not explicitly prohibit irrational laws; rather, courts have developed standards of review through case law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because customary law does not always take precedence over codified law. In fact, the canon of statutory interpretation against degradation of common law suggests that statutes can override common law if the legislative intent is clear.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how U.S. courts handle potentially irrational laws, the concept of rational basis review, and the relationship between constitutional, statutory, and common law."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30778/fictional-character-copyright", "docs_id": 30778, "title": "Fictional Character Copyright?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Person 1 creates a fictional character and said character fits guidelines to pass both the Well\\-Delineated test and the Sam Spade test.

Also, cases only get filed with one nature of suit code, so if it touches on multiple areas of the law, this can be a pretty terrible way to go.\n\nThe other approach you can look into, if you're looking for bulk data is to check out the [Integrated Database](https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb) provided by the Federal Judicial Center. It provides a CSV about all civil cases for the past decade or so that you can dig into. Check out the title, section, and subsection fields. The only issue here is that they're largely blank. My organization has a [cheat sheet](https://free.law/idb-facts/) for the IDB if that's helpful. \n\nFinally, if you want to be *really* thorough, the trick is to cast a really wide net, and to them filter the results somehow. So, for example, you could download the docket and initial complaint for all cases in a particular Nature of Suit code, and then search within those initial complaints for the particular law you're looking for. This tends to get very expensive fast, but it's a service we offer at my organization.\n\nI think that's pretty much it for options. It's really not great, but the IDB is an underrated and mostly unknown resource."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A law student is researching class action employment discrimination cases under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Also keep in mind that the only thing I will be doing is using software. I am wondering first about copyright in free software. If I make a public video with me using free software can that be flagged as copyright?\n\nI am sure different software have different policy's but how about open source or more specifically , GNU public license v.3\\.0\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is, **it's complicated.** Now for the long answer:\n\nIn principle, if portions of the software are being directly included in the video (e.g. the art assets of a video game), then this can give rise to liability as a derivative work. This is true regardless of the license, unless the software is in the public domain.\n\nIn practice, allowing fans to upload videos of video games (colloquially called a \"Let's Play\" because the title is often \"Let's Play \\[name of game]\") is a commonly\\-accepted norm in the video game industry, regardless of what the law has to say about it. This is the case for a variety of social and economic reasons which are out of scope here, but in short, video games are hard to objectively review, and Let's Plays are usually a poor substitute for them, so an LP is more likely to encourage sales than suppress them. You should not assume that every publisher will always respect this norm, but it is commonly accepted by most publishers. It is commonly, but incorrectly, believed that these videos are categorically fair use; this is not necessarily the case because fair use is an intensive, fact\\-bound inquiry. It might be true, but there isn't case law to that effect, so it would be imprudent to make such a categorical claim at this time.\n\n(Videos which consist mostly or entirely of cutscenes, with no gameplay or commentary, are more of a gray area. Some publishers may not be happy if you post something like that, although in my experience, enforcement tends to be either lax or nonexistent.)\n\n> I am sure different software have different policy's but how about open source or more specifically , GNU public license v.3\\.0\n\nThe subset of people who release their software under an open source license are (usually) not very interested in suing people for this kind of secondary use. As a courtesy, I would suggest linking to the public repository or website where you downloaded the software, identifying it by name in the video, and taking any other reasonable attribution steps which the authors have publicly requested. This is not a legal requirement, but most projects would likely appreciate it.\n\nAs described above, they *could* construe your video to be a derivative work of the software and ask that you license it under the GPL. But I've never heard of that actually happening, and people do upload Let's Plays of (for example) [Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.google.com/search?q=battle+for+wesnoth+let%27s+play&tbm=vid) all the time without getting into legal trouble. All content in Battle for Wesnoth is under [a copyleft license](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Wesnoth:Copyrights#The_Battle_for_Wesnoth_-_Code_Contributions) (either GPLv2 or CC\\-BY\\-SA 4\\.0\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A content creator makes a \"Let's Play\" video featuring gameplay footage from an open-source video game licensed under GNU Public License v3.0.

The GPL v3.0 license doesn't automatically grant permission for unrestricted use in videos. However, the open-source community generally tolerates and often encourages such usage, especially if proper attribution is given. Option A is incorrect because fair use is not automatically applied and depends on specific circumstances. Option B is overly strict; while theoretically possible, it's not a common requirement. Option D is false because open-source software is still protected by copyright, just with more permissive terms of use."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16466/what-entitlements-do-i-have-if-someone-uses-my-video-on-facebook-and-gets-millio", "docs_id": 16466, "title": "What entitlements do I have if someone uses my video on Facebook and gets millions of views?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I posted a video on Facebook and a page asked if they could use the video.

Auto\\-tune songs are often examples of these kinds of songs. If it is legal, is one allowed to credit the song partially to the celebrity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A legal recording could be with consent or without, depending on the state you are in. If the person speaking is speaking publically, consent is irrelevant; if they are having a private conversation with you, then it depends on the state. In about 20% of states including California, all parties have to consent, otherwise just one party has to consent. Assume this happens in California, which has the most restrictive rules. So for the recording to be legal, the person must be informed that they are being recorded (if they continue to talk having been informed, that is implied consent). That is just about legality of recording.\n\nAdditionally, there is a property right (in California), \"personality rights\", which limits ability to exploit another persons image etc. [California Civil Code section 3344](http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-3344.html) prohibits using name, the voice, signature, photograph, or likeness of another, either in a product or in advertising (but not \"news\" type purposes), without their prior consent, and violating that law could lead to a hefty damages award. Consent to record is not the same as consent to exploit, so if you ask Tom Cruise in a private conversation \"can I record you?\", that does not constitute consent to exploit his personality.\n\nThere is an open question as to whether a First Amendment argument can overcome. In [Nussenzweig v DiCorcia](http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2006/2006_50171.htm), a case in New York, the suit was over an analogous photographic exploitation. In that case, there was a debate over whether the use of the photograph constituted \"art\" or \"trade\", and the photographee lost on First Amendment grounds. In this case, a person's photograph was used (without consent) in an art collection which was sold, but the court held that the right to artistic expression trumps the requirement for consent. However, the court also recognized that states differ in art standards, citing \n[Comedy II Publications, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/25_Cal4th_387.htm), 25 Cal 4th 387, a case in California. The crucial difference between New York and California is that in California, art is \"transformative\" and not just \"duplicative\" likeness. The court formulates\n\n> a balancing test between the First Amendment and the right of\n>  publicity based on whether the work in question adds significant\n>  creative elements so as to be transformed into something more than a\n>  mere celebrity likeness or imitation\n\nand states that\n\n> What the right of publicity holder possesses is not a right of\n>  censorship, but a right to prevent others from misappropriating the\n>  economic value generated by the celebrity's fame through the\n>  merchandising of the \"name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness\"\n>  of the celebrity.\n\nSo, potentially there is a First Amendment defense of such a use.\n\n\"Crediting\" the speaker might be seen as a false endorsement of a product, and one could run afoul of the Lanham Act, [15 USC 1051](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1051). The issue would be whether one could reasonably infer that the subject had in some form endorsed or given consent to such a usage, and a statement like \"We thank Tom Cruise for his voice snippets\" could easily give such an impression. A statement like \"Snippets of Tom Cruise's voice were obtained by recording at a public rally in Winnemucca\" is less likely to imply endorsement; if there are hundreds of such credit\\-attributions in the work, the impression of consented endorsement is lessened and the impression of \"harvesting\" is increased."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, a musician legally records a conversation with a celebrity at a private event after informing them that they're being recorded.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) The musician can freely use the snippets and credit the celebrity, as consent to record implies consent to use the recording for any purpose.\n\nB) The musician cannot use the snippets at all, as California's two-party consent law prohibits any use of recorded conversations without explicit permission for that use.\n\nC) The musician can use the snippets but cannot credit the celebrity, as doing so might imply endorsement and violate the Lanham Act.\n\nD) The musician may be able to use the snippets if the song is considered transformative art, but crediting the celebrity could still lead to legal issues under personality rights laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question touches on several complex legal issues. Option A is incorrect because consent to record does not imply consent to exploit one's personality rights. Option B is too restrictive; while California does have a two-party consent law for recording, this doesn't automatically prohibit all uses of the recording. Option C is partially correct about the risks of implying endorsement, but it's too absolute in stating the snippets can be used without consideration of other factors.\n\nOption D is the most accurate. It acknowledges that using the snippets might be permissible under First Amendment grounds if the song is considered transformative art, as per the California Supreme Court's ruling in Comedy III Productions v.

This order can include the following terms:\n> \n> \n> * **cease the discriminatory practice and take measures to prevent the practice from occurring in the future** (see s. 53(2\\)(a) of the Act);\n> * make available to the victim the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied (see s. 53(2\\)(b) of the Act);\n> * compensate the victim for any lost wages as a result of the discrimination (see s. 53(2\\)(c) of the Act);\n> * compensate the victim for the additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation as a result of the discrimination (see s. 53(2\\)(d) of the Act);\n> * compensate the victim up to $20,000 for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discrimination (see s. 53(2\\)(e) of the Act);\n> * **compensate the victim up to $20,000 if the discrimination was wilful or reckless** (see s. 53(3\\) of the Act); and,\n> * award interest on an order to pay financial compensation (see s. 53(4\\) of the Act).\n\nSimilar remedies are available in [British Columbia](http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/human-rights-duties/remedies/index.htm)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, if an employee (A) experiences discrimination from a manager (M) based on their disability, but doesn't lose their job due to intervention from the company owner, which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for A to seek justice?\n\nA) File a personal lawsuit against M for attempted discrimination\nB) File a complaint with a human rights commission or tribunal\nC) Sue the company for allowing discriminatory practices\nD) Take no action since A didn't ultimately lose their job\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) While A might want to personally sue M, the documentation doesn't suggest this as the most effective route. Personal lawsuits may be more challenging to win and don't utilize the established systems for addressing discrimination.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. The documentation specifically mentions human rights commissions and tribunals as appropriate venues for addressing discrimination, even if the employee didn't lose their job. These bodies can order various remedies, including compensation for pain and suffering and measures to prevent future discrimination.\n\nC) Suing the company isn't recommended here, as the company actually intervened to correct the situation once they became aware of it. The discrimination came from M personally, not company policy.\n\nD) Taking no action is not advised. The documentation clearly states that M's actions constitute prohibited discrimination, even if A didn't ultimately lose their job.

Under the [Uniform Parentage Act](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A&full=true#26.26A.300), when there is a legal dispute as to parentage (\"is X a parent of Y?\")\nand X either volunteers for genetic testing, or is tested under order of the court or a child support agency, then the courts and the law gets involved in genetic testing. Testing cannot be used to challenge the parentage of an individual legally established to be a parent in other ways, or to establish the parentage of a donor. There are prerequisites to the court ordering a test,\nfor example a party may make a sworn statement that there is a reasonable possibility that X is the child's genetic parent, or swears that it's reasonable that the person is not a genetic parent.\n\nAssuming the court issues an order, then [RCW 26\\.26A.315](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A.315) governs the procedures for the testing. As for the qualifications of the lab and test, the requirement is that\n\n> (1\\) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied on by experts\n> in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory\n> accredited by: (a) The AABB, formerly known as the American\n> association of blood banks, or a successor to its functions; or (b) An\n> accrediting body designated by the secretary of the United States\n> department of health and human services.\n\nand the sample requirements are\n\n> (2\\) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample or a\n> combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other\n> body tissue or fluid.

The section under debate is [30\\.71](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-14.html#h-41) on temporary reproductions, especially subsection (b):\n\n> It is not an infringement of copyright to make a reproduction of a work or other subject\\-matter if\n> \n> \n> (a) the reproduction forms an essential part of a technological process;\n> \n> \n> (b) the reproduction\u2019s only purpose is to facilitate a use that is not an infringement of copyright; and\n> \n> \n> (c) the reproduction exists only for the duration of the technological process.\n\n---\n\nI don't want to duplicate what articles above have already stated, but I'd like to dive deeper into [Bishop v. Stevens, \\[1990] 2 S.C.R. 467](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii75/1990canlii75.html), cited by the first two articles as a similar case ([reaffirmed in 2015](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2015/2015scc57/2015scc57.html?resultIndex=1) after a few rounds of statute amendments). In it the Supreme Court held that prerecorded \"ephemeral\" copies used to facilitate a broadcast was an infringement.\n\nThe key piece of reasoning is: \n\n> \\[... the broadcaster] has not established that, at the time of their enactment, the sections of the Act providing for the right to broadcast a performance must have been understood to include the right to prerecord. Even now it remains fully possible, and quite common, to broadcast live performances.\n\nTo me, there are two key differences why this logic might not directly transpose to the streaming pirated movies situation:\n\n1. \"Ephemeral\" prerecorded copies aren't necessarily \"temporary\" copies within the scope of section 30\\.71 above, particularly subsections (a) and (c) might not strictly be met.\n2. This case discusses the point of view of the *broadcaster* which is analogous to the *hoster*, not the end\\-user. While making ephemeral/temporary copies might not be strictly necessary for broadcasting, viewing online content necessarily creates at least a temporary copy on the end\\-user's computer.\n\n---\n\nTwo other random notes:\n\n1. None of the involved sections have a \"reasonableness\" or \"should have known\" clause whereas they are present in other parts of the Copyright Act. This means whether its legal should theoretically depend strictly on the facts (i.e. if it turns out to be illegal, pleading \"oh I didn't know it was pirated\" won't work).\n2. Funny enough, I don't actually see anything in the law that would differentiate between streaming online pirated video and your example of something illegal being aired on TV provided its digital (presumably some part of the TV has a temporary copy too)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under Canadian copyright law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of streaming pirated movies?\n\nA) Streaming pirated movies is definitively legal as long as the user doesn't download or save the content permanently.\n\nB) Streaming pirated movies is definitively illegal and users can be sued for copyright infringement.\n\nC) The legality of streaming pirated movies is currently unclear and falls into a legal grey area.\n\nD) Streaming pirated movies is legal only if the user was unaware that the content was pirated.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

You would need to look in e.g. the minimum term addendum if the service is Comcast and you have an obligation to stay with them for some period, to see what your legal obligations are. However, the service provider can waive early termination fees.\n\nTypically, these kinds of contracts don't involve signing anything; agreeing (on the phone) is sufficient. It would not matter whether a person can remember any such terms, the question is whether they could have been aware of them when the agreement was reached. A person's mental state might be such that they are incapable of understanding or consenting, in which case there would not be a contract. I would say that it constitutes a completely separate question (i.e. it would overload this question to add that on), to investigate how the law deals with contracts and people with dementia (whether or not applicable in the instant case).\n\nSetting aside the mental\\-state question, there is also an open legal question as to what a given customer has agreed to. The benefit of a printed contract to sign is that this question is clearly known. The problem with phone sales is that salesmen do not in fact read out the terms of the contract, and often fail to mention material details, so it may be that a person has not been told of an early termination fee. [Some companies](http://legal.hughesnet.com/ServiceTermsAndConditions-current.cfm) have such information available online (my ISP does not), but you can't go from \"could theoretically find\" to \"was given notice\". If it's not reasonably knowable that there is such a fee, then the clause might not be enforced. However, it could require a lawsuit (and probably appeals) to establish such case law (if it hasn't been \u2013 I don't know of a precedent here).

The documentation states that there are no special laws in Washington relieving a person of contractual obligations due to disability. The contract's enforceability could depend on various factors, including how the terms were communicated (e.g., verbally, in writing, or online) and the person's mental capacity at the time of agreement. While mental state could potentially invalidate a contract if the person was incapable of understanding or consenting, this would need to be evaluated separately.

For example, a Braile transcription is rather easily *in* that exception, as it is almost illegible for the vast majority of seeing people, and only needs to come in a box that has the needed stickers of the original copyright and that one may not copy or re\\-convert.\n\nAnother thing that this applies to is *phonorecords*. These are physical items that carry audio in a way that it can be reproduced by a machine. Typically in these days those are CDs, Cassettes, or Vinyl, but in the past, [Reel\\-to\\-Reel magnetic tape](https://youtu.be/5KHSz9Gi-II), [shellac](https://youtu.be/6YF1w77mbec?t=172) (there's a sound difference to Vinyl), [wax cylinders](https://youtu.be/4wtifAGsV3k) and even [Punchcards](https://youtu.be/399UPZVki1Q) have been used as phonorecords. It's unclear if a flash drive could be a phonorecord, but I tend towards \"no, unless it is a Read\\-Only\\-Memory\".\n\nAs you observed, that exception **only** provides for phonorecords and copies, not the actual audio or digital files. This might be an old remnant, but it requires that a copy for the disabled has a physical manifestation that may not be copied again and only is to be given to eligible people. A file on a computer does not satisfy these rules.

I believe that there are two questions of general interest in the closed posting. The second question is:\n\n**When do online insults become criminal defamation in Germany, and who initiates the prosecution?**\n\nThe German constitutional court recently ruled on a technical issue regarding online defamation: Renate K\u00fcnast can demand that social media companies provide information about certain users, which then allows her to proceed bringing a case against those individuals. While the ruling is not in a defamation case itself, but the findings of the constitutional court will become a guideline to other courts when they judge specific cases.\n\nCan you summarize the current understanding of what is, and what isn't, defamation in a social media platform?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: preface\n-------\n\nAs evidenced by the [federal constitutional court\u2019s recently published decision](https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2022/bvg22-008.html), law is no exact science.\nI cannot possibly \u201csummarize the current understanding\u201d because \u201cone room, two lawyers, three opinions\u201d.\nNevertheless, let me show you *a* legal opinion addressing some issues and demonstrating the mechanics of a criminal case.\n\nGerman law distinguishes between judgmental statements (\u201cYou\u2019re a fat pig!\u201d) and factual claims (\u201cBaker X uses cockroaches for her bread.\u201d).\nWith respect to MFW\u2019s original question, doing the latter toward third parties, like on a social media site, could qualify as defamation, a *separate* criminal offense.\nAt any rate (and considering the question/comments), either of which is *also* an insult toward the person at hand (\u201cYou\u201d or \u201cBaker X\u201d).\n\nopinion\n-------\n\n1. **insult through action**  \n\nBy responding to a post of Doctor Who with \u201cDoctor Who is a fat pig.\u201d on the social media website Foobar, OM might have committed the crime of insult, [\u00a7 185 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1891).\n\t1. applicability of German penal law  \n\n\tGerman penal law must be applicable at the time and place of the offense.\n\tProsecution of insults is possible if the crime was committed in Germany, \u00a7 3 StGB.\n\tThe place of commission is every place where OM acted, \u00a7 9 \u2160 StGB.\n\tActs are all activities ensuring the furtherance of the crime\u2019s success.\n\tOM does not operate Foobar or its webservers, but necessarily composed and initiated publication of the post.\n\tHowever, due to the website being accessible *globally* via the world wide web, it is not automatically established OM was in Germany during his/her actions.  \n\n\tNevertheless, much like a person throwing a rock across the border, applicability of German penal law is still indicated via \u00a7 3 StGB if the purpose of the crime in question is to protect *domestic* interests.\n\tIn the present case, \u00a7 185 intends to protect, among other things, the individual interest *honor* of people in Germany.\n\tSince DW regularly stays on German territory, her honor is at risk and must therefore be protected by the German state.\n\tHence applicability of German penal law is found, regardless where OM specifically was at the time of her/his actions.  \n\n\t(Further reading: BGHSt 46, 212\\)\n\t2. elements of the offense  \n\n\tOM\u2019s post must display all elements of an insult.\n\t\t1. physical elements of the offense\n\t\t\t1. object of the offense  \n\n\t\t\tGiven the context of replying to a post of DW, OM\u2019s post unambiguously identifies DW as the subject of the potential insult.\n\t\t\tDW is a living person, thus a suitable holder of honor.\n\t\t\t2. act  \n\n\t\t\tOM must have acted accordingly.\n\t\t\tAn insult is the announcement of own contempt or disrespect toward someone else.\n\t\t\tThe statement \u201cDoctor Who is a fat pig.\u201d compares DW with an animal.\n\t\t\tAnimals are considered inferior to humans.\n\t\t\tIn particular, the choice \u201cpig\u201d is associated in many cultures as an \u201cunclean\u201d animal.\n\t\t\tFurthermore, the adjective \u201cfat\u201d implies a certain immobility, another bad quality.\n\t\t\tThus OM expressed contempt or disrespect of DW.  \n\n\t\t\tHowever, since OM wrote his/her post in English it could be the case DW did not understand any of that.\n\t\t\tAn insult \u201cthrough\u201d a translator or interpreter cannot be attributed to the perpetrator anymore.\n\t\t\tTherefore it is necessary, the addressed person has at least a basic understanding of the language and/or script used.\n\t\t\tIn the present case, DW has an MD obtained in Germany.\n\t\t\tShe is sufficiently capable of directly understanding the disrespectful contents at hand.\n\t\t\t3. factual attribution  \n\n\t\t\tMoreover, the act can be attributed toward OM.\n\t\t2. mental elements of the offense  \n\n\t\tUnless otherwise stated all crimes must be committed with intent, \u00a7 15 StGB.\n\t\tIntention is the wish to effect the physical elements of the offense knowing all circumstances of the crime.\n\t\tOM deliberately posted the insult, or at least was consciously accepting the risk to insult and therefore acted with criminal intent.\n\t\t3. intermediate conclusion  \n\n\t\tBy posting \u201cDoctor Who is a fat pig.\u201d on the social media website Foobar OM has committed the crime of an insult.\n\t3. unlawfulness  \n\n\tThe elements of the offense indicate unlawfulness, unless the offense was warranted.\n\t\t1. vindicatory consent  \n\n\t\tProtection of *honor* as a disposable interest can be relinquished, yet in the present case DW did not expressly agree to being insulted, and the Terms of Service of Foobar DW agreed to actually forbid hate speech in general.\n\t\t2. presumed vindicatory consent  \n\n\t\tWithout express consent and DW agreeing to Foobar\u2019s ToS, it could be the case DW\u2019s honor was no interest warranting protection.\n\t\tDW\u2019s post OM responded to might have been provocative or unethical, yet she did not give reason to believe that she did not care about her honor, e.\u202fg. by insulting someone else, and in particular not OM him\u2011/her\u2011self, \u00a7\u00a0199\u00a0StGB.\n\t\t3. protection of legitimate interests  \n\n\t\tOM\u2019s post could have been done to safeguard legitimate interests, \u00a7\u00a0193\u00a0StGB.\n\t\tCritical opinions about scientific, artistic or commercial achievements are allowed if an insult as a matter of form and content or the circumstances do not show the sole intent to insult.\n\t\tDW expressed an opinion in a public venue like Foobar certainly with the intent to initiate debate, yet OM\u2019s post primarily shows disrespect toward DW, without expressing criticism to her post.\n\t\tTherefore OM\u2019s post has not been done to safeguard legitimate interests.\n\t\t4. intermediate conclusion  \n\n\t\tOM\u2019s act was unlawful.\n\t4. guilt  \n\n\tAn unlawful act fulfilling all elements of the offense indicates guilt, thus OM is considered is guilty.\n\t5. sentence considerations  \n\n\tSince the insult happened through dissemination of materials, the permissible sentence is up to two years of imprisonment or a fine.\n\tThe court recognizes following considerations:\n\t\t* The brevity and ordinary nature of the insult.\n\t\t* OM\u2019s rap sheet, queried on 2022\u201102\u201126, is empty.\n\t\t* OM and DW are not related.\n\t\t* OM has not apologized to DW.\n\t6. conclusion  \n\n\tBy posting \u201cDoctor Who is a fat pig.\u201d on the social media site Foobar OM is guilty of unlawfully insulting DW.\n2. **criminal prosecution requirements**  \n\nProsecution of an insult is only possible if a criminal complaint was submitted, \u00a7\u00a0194\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0StGB.\nWhen DW reported the offense to the Police of Lower Saxony on 2022\u201101\u201110, she initiated a provisional criminal complaint.\nAs she is the subject of the insult, she is entitled to initiate such, \u00a7\u00a077\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB.\nThe 3\u2011month\\-submission deadline was met, \u00a7\u00a077b\u00a0StGB.\n3. **criminal prosecution obstacles**  \n\nThe statute of limitations grants a five\\-year limitation period, \u00a7\u00a078\u00a0StGB, so there are no obstacles.\n4. **conclusion**  \n\nOM is sentenced to a fine of thirty daily units.\nSince OM refused to disclose their economic situation, an estimated monthly net income of three thousand euros is presumed, thus a daily unit amounts to one hundred euros.  \n\nConsidering OM\u2019s guilt, \u00a7\u00a046\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0StGB, imprisonment, especially more than six months, \u00a7\u00a047\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB, was not indicated.\n\nafterthought\n------------\n\n* The \u201cdissemination through materials\u201d qualification is a recent addition, Federal Gazette 2021 \u2160 page 441, article 1, number 6\\.\nIt was meant to take effect on July 1, 2021 (article 10, subsection 1\\), but came into effect early on April 3, 2021, FG 2021 page 474\\.\nIf you insulted someone on or before April 2, 2021, the maximum sentence is one year imprisonment or a fine, \u00a7 2 \u2160 StGB.\n* Considering this, I should probably *double* the fine.\n30 daily units, give or take, *was* standard for a \u201cnormal\u201d insult before the change.\n* Maybe interesting, but the insulted does not need to \u201cfeel\u201d insulted.\nNevertheless, only the addressed person(s) can file a complaint, \u00a7\u00a077\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB.\n* Initiating a criminal complaint could be unnecessary if you are \u201cinsulting\u201d a public figure, \u00a7\u00a0188\u00a0StGB, if the DA thinks it\u2019s of public interest, \u00a7\u00a0194\u00a0\u2160\u00a03\u00a0StGB, or if the insult\u2019s content refers to persecution of people in the Third Reich or similar regimes,

It says\n\n> Every one who (a) practises or enters into or in any manner agrees or\n>  consents to practise or enter into (i) any form of polygamy, or (ii)\n>  any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time,\n>  whether or not it is by law recognized as a binding form of marriage,\n>  or (b) celebrates, assists or is a party to a rite, ceremony, contract\n>  or consent that purports to sanction a relationship mentioned in\n>  subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii), is guilty of an indictable offence and\n>  liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.\n\nThat is, if you behave like you're married to multiple women, you've committed a crime."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under Canadian law, which of the following scenarios would most likely result in a person being charged with polygamy?\n\nA) A man is legally married to one woman but secretly maintains romantic relationships with two other women without any formal commitment.\n\nB) A woman has divorced her first husband and legally married her second husband, but continues to financially support her ex-husband and visits him regularly.\n\nC) A man participates in a religious ceremony where he symbolically \"marries\" two women, even though he only has one legal marriage certificate.\n\nD) A person is in a polyamorous relationship with three partners, but they all live separately and there are no marriage ceremonies or legal unions involved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Canadian polygamy statute criminalizes not just legal marriages to multiple partners, but also any form of practice, agreement, or consent to enter into \"any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time, whether or not it is by law recognized as a binding form of marriage.\" It also specifically mentions celebrating or being party to a rite or ceremony that purports to sanction such a relationship. \n\nOption C directly violates this law by participating in a ceremony that symbolically marries the man to two women, even without legal recognition. This falls under the \"celebrates, assists or is a party to a rite, ceremony\" clause of the statute.\n\nOption A involves secretive relationships without formal commitment, which likely wouldn't meet the threshold of \"practicing\" polygamy under the law. \n\nOption B describes maintaining a relationship with an ex-spouse, which is not polygamy.\n\nOption D, while involving multiple partners, doesn't involve any marriage ceremonies or attempts to formalize the relationships in a way that would likely violate the statute."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15521/in-english-civil-trial-practice-when-does-a-barrister-become-involved", "docs_id": 15521, "title": "In English civil trial practice when does a barrister become involved?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In U.S. civil trial practice, the same legal professional, an attorney, or firm of legal professionals, usually handles a case from first client contact through trial and often appeals (if any) as well.\n\nBut, in English law, the roles of attorneys in the U.S. are filled by more than one kind of legal professional and there is a distinction between barristers, who are legal professionals who mostly handle trial practice, and solicitors, who are legal professionals who do other kinds of legal work. I am generally familiar with the routes by which one enters each profession.\n\nIt isn't clear to me, however, how the lines are drawn between the two professions in the context of civil litigation.\n\nFor example, suppose that you have a medium sized business (e.g. 100 employees and several business locations with no in house counsel) with a regular outside solicitor or firm of solicitors that it employs.\n\nSuppose that business gets into a serious business dispute with another business, e.g. a joint venture gone bad with related accounting and trademark issues involving hundreds of thousands to million of pounds in controversy economically. (The example is from a case I handled in the U.S. allowing me to compare it, but any serious civil dispute could do. I limit the question to serious civil disputes because I understand that solicitors can handle civil litigation in some minor civil litigation.)\n\nAt what point in time is there a transition from a solicitor to a barrister? \n\nWhen would a client start with a barrister in the first place? \n\nWhat kind of legal professional (barrister or solicitor) would represent a client in an arbitration or mediation proceeding in which no court case has been opened?\n\nWould a medium sized business in the example above that gets into lawsuits once every year or two typically have a regular barrister (or firm of barristers) that they would use, or would this choice usually be made on a case by case basis?\n\nAlso, please feel to correct any of my assumptions if they are incorrect.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barristers are advocates, and their other roles fall out of that core role. I think of it this way: your solicitor takes care of your legal risk; your barrister is the 'big gun' you bring in for specific important legal advice and to represent you in person.\n\nI'll give you my experience from the perspective of working in a large government agency. For us, 'barrister' often equates to 'Queen's Counsel' (now called 'Senior Counsel'), which is a particularly senior barrister. \n\nI am also speaking from Australia. We have the same split profession as the UK, but there are probably differences.\n\nYou generally don't stop using a solicitor and start using a barrister. Rather, you have a solicitor the whole way through and then you engage a barrister through your solicitor.\n\nYou can engage a barrister directly, e.g. if you have in\\-house counsel, but it is not common to do so. Even if you have in\\-house counsel, you will usually engage more specialised external solicitors to handle litigation.\n\nThe barrister's role is generally to (1\\) provide advice on specific issues (after the solicitors have sifted the evidence and provided a brief to the barrister) including advising on your prospects in particular litigation and (2\\) represent you in court i.e. write submissions and speak to the court.\n\nIt is not uncommon to have a barristers represent you in proceedings other than a trial (if you have the financial resources to afford a barrister). For example, a barrister may represent you in mediation or may accompany you to an examination by some regulatory authority. (Furthermore, a regulatory authority may even hire a barrister to question you, since barristers are often good at that based on their in\\-court role; or you and the party you are having a dispute with might appoint a barrister as the arbitrator or mediator.)\n\nYou may have a barrister you prefer to use; more likely, however, your solicitor would know barristers and would recommend an appropriate one. Barristers are specialised so you would use a different barrister for a tax dispute, contractual dispute, employee dispute, etc. An organisation large enough to sustain constant legal disputes would have a number of barristers that it would go to as and when they were needed, on the basis of their particular skills and availability.\n\nThere is no such thing as a firm of barristers. Each barrister is independent. A barrister's office will be in 'chambers', which is an organisation that leases office space and hires clerks to manage member barristers' business. But the barristers in a chambers are not in business together as members of a firm of solicitors are. Barristers are proud of their independence, and they all want to be appointed as judges so they have to appear impartial.\n\nTo further illustrate how you might use a barrister: sometimes you get legal advice from a barrister and you cannot read the advice. You can see the words but it's gibberish. Your solicitor will interpret it for you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the English legal system, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between solicitors and barristers in a civil litigation case?\n\nA) Solicitors handle the case until it goes to trial, at which point they hand it over entirely to barristers.\n\nB) Barristers are engaged directly by clients from the beginning of a dispute and work independently of solicitors.\n\nC) Solicitors manage the case throughout, engaging barristers for specific tasks such as providing specialized advice and representing clients in court.\n\nD) Barristers and solicitors work as part of the same firm, dividing tasks based on their individual expertise.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the English legal system, solicitors typically manage a civil litigation case from start to finish. They engage barristers for specific purposes, such as providing specialized legal advice on particular issues or representing the client in court. Barristers are not usually engaged directly by clients, but rather through solicitors. The relationship is not one of handing over the case entirely (A), nor do barristers typically work independently from the beginning (B). Barristers and solicitors do not work as part of the same firm; barristers are independent practitioners (D)."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16606/criminal-federal-laws-regarding-functions-of-civil-officers", "docs_id": 16606, "title": "Criminal federal laws regarding functions of civil officers", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Has Congress passed any laws that place criminal executive restrictions on federal employees in the executive branch?\n\nFor example, if Congress passed a law that said the FBI director wasn't allowed to send agents to Alaska or he would be imprisoned for 5 years. \n\nIf they haven't, is there a reason why they're not allowed to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If Congress wanted to do something like that there are a variety of ways that it could do it.\n\n* It could change the authority of the FBI in the federal bureaucracy to exclude Alaska. This would deprive it of the affirmative authority it needs to do its job there, for example, eliminating its authority to arrest people and present them to a federal court in that state.\n* It could pass a rider to an appropriations bill declaring that no federal funds be spent to conduct FBI activities in Alaska. It wouldn't be a crime to conduct FBI activities in Alaska per se, but because FBI agents are paid for their time, doing that would require an expenditure of funds not authorized by Congress.\n\nGenerally, the first line of defense would be for the Treasury Department or Office of Personnel Management to decline to issue payroll checks to the FBI agents involved since the appropriations for that expenditure were not authorized. \n\nIf that failed and the FBI somehow managed to pull the wool over the Treasury and OPM's eyes (which honestly would be easy as they don't have internal controls designed to catch something like that), then those involved might be guilty of a misappropriation of federal funds (basically an embezzlement crime) for doing so.\n\n* Of course, another step that could be taken is for the Inspector General of the Justice Department (or a senior executive in the AG's office such as the AG or a deputy AG, or assistant AG) to investigate and to suspend the people involved from their employment and fire them if necessary, or simply order them not to act (on threat of being fired for insubordination if they disobey) if the acts have not yet been committed.\n* Congress is allowed to use criminal sanctions, but generally speaking, the federal government has demonstrated that the crude instrument of criminal punishments is not necessary to keep their employees in line, and going around throwing your employees in prison for not following complicated high level legislative or executive directions is not good for employee moral, particularly when most of your employees are unionized and have civil service protections, so doing it the hard way is very, very hard."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Congress wants to restrict the FBI's activities in Alaska without explicitly criminalizing such activities.

While Congress has the power to regulate executive agencies, imposing criminal penalties directly on high-level officials for carrying out their duties is an extreme measure that could be seen as violating the separation of powers. It's also noted in the documentation that the federal government typically doesn't need to use such \"crude\" criminal sanctions to keep employees in line.\n\nOptions A and B are more conventional and legally sound methods for Congress to restrict FBI activities. They work by either limiting jurisdiction or cutting off funding, which are well-established congressional powers.\n\nOption C, while not explicitly mentioned as a congressional action, falls within the normal disciplinary procedures of the executive branch and would be less likely to face legal challenges than imposing criminal penalties."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67894/rental-lease-agreement-what-does-provided-further-mean", "docs_id": 67894, "title": "Rental lease agreement, what does Provided Further mean?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If someone recently purchased a house that has a tenant but would like to rent to a close young family member that recently moved to town.

To terminate the lease for September 1st, the landlord must give notice at least 30 days before August 1st, which means by July 31st at the latest. The \"PROVIDED FURTHER\" part of the clause is separate and refers to the tenant's early termination, not the landlord's right to terminate with proper notice. Option A is incorrect because it delays the notice unnecessarily. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't provide the full 30-day notice period. Option D is incorrect because the landlord's right to terminate is not conditional on the tenant's failure to pay rent."}}
