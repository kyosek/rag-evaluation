(This comes from an article from the TheNextWeb which is linked below)\n\nI took a look at how [quaderno.io](http://quaderno.io) works, since it's their target, I believe they must be right, so I used their demo : <https://quaderno.io/features/checkout/> and tested for my company in France.\n\nWhen I entered my VAT Number, they removed the tax (from 10$\\+20% to only 10$).\n\nBUT, the problem is the following :\n\nI asked my accountant if, when making an invoice from a French company to an other French company, I should remove the 20% tax. She said no. I must indicate my VAT number AND the VAT number of the client, and that's it.\n\n**The 20% tax still applies and the client must do it's paper work to get back the tax he paid from the state (France), not the issuing company.**\n\nSo, as far as I understand, Quaderno is not right for France as I should still pay 12$ (10$ \\+ 20%).\n\nBut the explanation given by [TheNextWeb](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/01/01/need-know-2015-eu-vat-changes-implemented-tnw/) and how Quaderno works raise me an other question :\n\nThey both remove the VAT tax when the company enters it's VAT number, which leads me to believe that in some EU countries, if the VAT number is given, the service must remove the tax from the invoice.\n\nIs this right ?\nIn that case, in which countries we must remove the tax when invoicing the client, and in which countries (like France) we still must keep it ?\n\nThank you for your help and feel free to ask for more details if it isn't the case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are a small business, you apply VAT the same way as you would apply it for customers of your own country.\n\nThere is a threshold for sales made to a certain country. If you do not exceed that threshold, you can apply your own country's VAT rules to customers from that country and deliver VAT to your own tax office.\n\nIf you do exceed that threshold, then you have to worry about other countries' VAT laws. But if you exceed those thresholds in any country, you have enough money to hire a tax advisor.\n\nWhat those thresholds are depends on the customer's country. You can find a table here: [http://www.vatlive.com/eu\\-vat\\-rules/distance\\-selling\\-eu\\-vat\\-thresholds/](http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/distance-selling-eu-vat-thresholds/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A French company sells digital services to customers in various EU countries.

According to the information provided, small businesses can apply their own country's VAT rules (in this case, French VAT rules) to customers from other EU countries until they exceed the distance selling threshold for that specific country. This allows smaller businesses to operate more easily across the EU without immediately having to worry about different VAT rules in each country. Only when the threshold is exceeded for a particular country does the company need to consider that country's specific VAT laws and potentially register for VAT there.

Lies that are relied upon an unintended recipient (e.g. you lie to a prospective business partner at dinner about something related to a business deal and someone who eavesdrops on the conversation relies upon it).\n11. Some lies told on behalf of and solely in the name of someone else (e.g. a false statement of a prospectus for an investment published solely in the name of the company offering the investment without attribution of who wrote it).\n12.

He tells a potential customer, Mrs. Smith, that a particular car has never been in an accident, even though he's not entirely sure about its history. Mrs. Smith buys the car based on this statement. Later, she discovers the car had indeed been in a minor accident before.

According to the legal definition of fraud provided, one of the key elements is that the person making the false statement does so \"with the intent that someone else rely upon that statement to their detriment.\" In this case, John was not certain about the car's history, so he didn't intentionally make a false statement. His lack of intent to mislead means his action doesn't meet all the criteria for fraud.\n\nOption A is incorrect because intent is a crucial element of fraud, which is missing here.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the economic impact, while relevant to damages, doesn't determine whether fraud occurred in the first place.\n\nOption D is incorrect because statements about past events can indeed be the basis for fraud if they relate to presently existing material facts.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the elements of fraud, particularly the importance of intent in determining whether a false statement constitutes fraud."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85666/what-laws-govern-obtaining-receipts-for-construction-work-carried-out-16-years-a", "docs_id": 85666, "title": "What laws govern obtaining receipts for construction work carried out 16 years ago?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In 2006, I had a mason perform work on a house I own in County Meath.

This means the mason is not legally obligated to have retained records from 16 years ago. However, there is no harm in the homeowner asking the mason for a receipt, even though they are not legally required to provide one after such a long time. Option C is the most accurate because it acknowledges both the legal retention period and the possibility of making a request.

Therefore, the company can only charge up to the maximum rate permitted by law, even if 1.5% per month would be higher. The clause is partially enforceable in that it allows the company to charge late fees, but the \"whichever is greater\" portion is not enforceable if it would result in fees exceeding legal limits.

In the emails, I specifically requested a month to month lease as I did not want to commit to a year, and she told me that I could do that with the penalty of an extra $100 per month. So if I signed the 1 year lease it would be $1050/month and for the month to month lease it would be $1150/month. I agreed that was exactly what I wanted, and we continued talking about when I would be moving in, etc. When I arrived in town, I met with her to sign the lease and get the keys, under the impression that everything we had discussed in the emails would be what was in the lease. I admit that it was my mistake that I should have read through the lease more thoroughly, but here is my current situation.\n\nAround April 20th, I emailed my landlord asking to give her 30 days notice as I am wanting to move. Her reply was that if I do that, I will be breaking my 1 year lease, and if I want to do that, we will have to discuss my options. To my shock I replied to her that I did not sign a 1 year lease, we had discussed and agreed that I only wanted month to month, and I am paying the $1150/month that she had clearly stated in our emails was the cost for the month to month lease. She then replied, the lease states it is for 1 year, if I want to come in and speak with her about options then I can. \n\nI then went to my lease, and sure enough, she had written the dates for 1 year rather than month to month. I understand that I should have more thoroughly looked through the lease and that is on me, but do the emails count as well? \n\nWhen I went in to speak with her, I tried to bring up what she had said in the emails, she kept interrupting me and and her only response was that in any sort of misunderstanding or dispute, we always refer back to the lease. I brought up how she clearly stated in the emails about the different amounts per month whether I signed a month to month lease or a year long lease, and all she had to say was how that is not stated in the lease so it is not relevant. I tried to say that according to the emails, I am overpaying $100 per month and she now owes me money ($600 now as I have paid for 6 months) and she repeated, that is not stated in the lease so its not relevant. She is also saying that I owe $250 for breaking the one year lease. \n\nI guess what I am asking is, can she do this, and is it true that the emails are not relevant? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The emails are not completely irrelevant, but the terms of the actual signed lease are vastly more relevant. You have some reason (based on emails) to believe that you would be getting a month to month lease for $1150 / mo., and you believed that the alternative was a year lease for $1050 / mo. But you were presented with and signed a lease for 1 year at $1150 / mo. The fact that the landlord accepted your payments at $1150 shows nothing about the presumed duration of the lease.\n\nThe emails are weak evidence about the agreement, and their exact wording would have to be scrutinized. If at the end of the email negotiations the landlord offered a month to month lease for $1150 per month (saying exactly that) and you then accepted, you have a bit of a leg to stand on. But if the landlord initially suggested a yearly lease for $1050 but eventually changed the terms in the course of the emails, you may have misunderstood her intent (perhaps she arbitrarily decided to up the rent).

If there is none, I'll just remove the logos.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I will note from the outset that journal editors might require things from you that go beyond what is legally necessary. A typical case is that they will require one to obtain permission before reusing a figure from another article/journal/author (even though in the vast majority of cases no such permission would be needed). The legal answer might allow you to push back on the editor\u2019s demands, but they still have the last word.\n\nThere are two kinds of intellectual property to consider. Unless otherwise noted, this answer is valid for [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\") and [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\").\n\nTrademark is almost certainly not an issue\n==========================================\n\nTrademark is a right to *branding*. A trademark holder can prevent others from using certain elements to promote their own products. The elements need not be complex, they just need to be recognizable by the public as related to the brand in question.\n\nFor instance, \"Tesla\" is the name of an 19th century Serbian\\-American inventor known among other things for discoveries related to radio transmission. You would probably be able to market a radio transmitter under a \"Tesla\" brand (assuming there are no existing trademarks, which I have not checked). If you try the same thing with electrical vehicles, [you will get sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.).\n\nFor a research paper, as long as you do not imply that Visa or MasterCard support your research or its results in any way, that should not be an issue.\n\nI assume, but cannot guarantee, that the above applies to most Western jurisdictions.\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright is a protection or creative elements. Whoever authors a creative work can forbid others from distributing it under certain conditions.\n\nAre the Visa and MasterCard logos copyrighted?\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe first question is whether the elements at hand are protected under copyright. In the case of the Visa and MasterCard logos, this might depend on the jurisdiction. The criterion for \"creativity\" varies a lot.\n\nSome jurisdiction have adopted (some version of) the [sweat of the brow doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow), according to which work suffices to produce a \"creative element\" with copyright protection. The typical example are databases of facts where each individual entry is unoriginal but the collection might take some time to collect, curate and maintain (such as a phone book).\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), the Supreme Court [rejected the sweat of the brow doctrine in 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.). Accordingly, a work needs to reach the [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality).\n\nDetermining whether the threshold is met for a given work is done on a case\\-by\\-case basis at trial. However, it seems very likely that both logos are not protected by copyright in the United States. The Visa logo is a simple font with no significant creative elements; the MasterCard logo contains two overlapping circles.\n\nI note that Wikimedia Commons hosts both logos on their website and claims they are public\\-domain under that rationale ([Visa](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Visa_2021.svg), [MasterCard](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mastercard_2019_logo.svg)). Wikimedia Commons usually follows copyright fairly closely, and they are a high\\-profile website hence a prime target for takedown requests by IP lawyers at Visa or MasterCard, so that is weak evidence that their claim is correct. But there is always the possibility that Visa / MasterCard just have not decided to sue yet.\n\nIn [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), the statute makes no explicit reference any threshold of originality: [(article L\\-112\\-1 of the code of intellectual property)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGISCTA000006161634/)\n\n> Les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code prot\u00e8gent les droits des auteurs sur toutes les oeuvres de l'esprit, quels qu'en soient le genre, la forme d'expression, le m\u00e9rite ou la destination.\n\n> The present code \\[containing all copyright statutes] protect copyrights for any works of mind, whatever their style, form of expression, artistic worth, or intended use.\n\nHowever, various court cases have tended to require \"works of mind\" to exhibit some amount of intellectual originality. For instance, [Civ. 1\u00e8re 22 janv. 2009, n\u00b008\\-11404](https://juricaf.org/arret/FRANCE-COURDECASSATION-20090122-0811404) held that a perfume cannot be copyrighted because\n\n> la fragrance d'un parfum, qui proc\u00e8de de la simple mise en oeuvre d'un savoir\\-faire, ne constitue pas la cr\u00e9ation d'une forme d'expression pouvant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection des oeuvres de l'esprit par le droit d'auteur\n\n> the smell of a perfume comes from the simple application of a know\\-how and does not constitute the creation of a form of expression subject to the protection of works of mind by copyright\n\nAfter a fifteen\\-minute look at various cases, I still do not have any strong idea of whether the Visa or MasterCard logo would be copyrighted in France. Let\u2019s assume for the sake of the argument that they are.\n\n\"Fair use\"\n----------\n\nEven copyrighted works can be used without the copyright holder\u2019s agreement under certain exceptions. Here again, any precise answer is jurisdiction\\-specific.\n\n\"Fair use\" is a US\\-specific doctrine, resulting from a string of court cases eventually codified into law ([Wikipedia has a decent history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)).

My guess is that they want:\n\n1. To avoid a jury that might be personally prejudiced against landlords or property management companies.\n2. An economic advantage in court. The Landlord presumably can afford better lawyers than the Tenant, so they want the Tenant to have no advantage.\n3. The jury might find the rental agreement confusing, so they might misunderstand the problem, whereas a judge would be better able to decide because of their legal background.\n\n**Is this a good intuition? Are there other reasons they would put that clause in a residential rental agreement?** \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None of the three factors you identify is correct.\n==================================================\n\nWith respect to reason (1\\):\n----------------------------\n\nThe belief that a judge is likely to be landlord friendly on the merits, while a factor favoring a bench trial is actually a pretty minor one. \n\nEmpirically, actual outcomes on the merits are far less different between jury trials and bench trials than you might expect. There aren't a lot of \"moving parts\" in a typical landlord\\-tenant case that afford the trier of fact much discretion. Usually there is evidence quantifying the amount of damage to the property in dollar terms and the amount of rent owed is usually just math. \n\nIt isn't like a personal injury case where pain and suffering damages are highly subjective and even liability which hinges on a common sense assessment of what constitutes \"reasonable case\" is very vague. \n\nThere may be some wiggle room in a landlord\\-tenant case to disagree on the credibility of witnesses and to differ in opinion regarding what constitutes \"reasonable wear and tear\", but the differences in litigation costs between a jury and bench trial will usually be greater in magnitude than the differences in outcomes on the merits between the two.\n\nOf course, in the rare case where the tenant is suing the landlord for a personal injury on the premises, the difference in outcome on the merits does matter quite a bit and a judge is much less likely to enter an extremely tenant favorable damages award than a jury is to do so. But, usually, lawyers for landlords aren't thinking about this scenario very much when they write a lease because it doesn't come up very often.\n\nWith respect to reason (2\\):\n----------------------------\n\nThe landlord actually probably has a procedural advantage over the tenant in a jury trial where having a lawyer is more important than a bench trial, but this is pretty irrelevant, because landlords are overwhelmingly more likely to win than the tenant anyway. It isn't hard to prove that somebody didn't pay all of the rent that was owed, or that they damaged the premises. Landlords care more about litigation costs than they do about their odds of winning on the merits.\n\nWith respect to reason (3\\):\n----------------------------\n\nAnd, the judge interprets of rental agreement for the jury \\- the jury only decides the factual issues that are disputed with regard to the rental agreement as the judge explains what it means to them. So, confusion isn't a major concern either.\n\nInstead, the biggest factors are timing and litigation costs.\n=============================================================\n\nA jury trial is longer, because it takes time to select a jury, to prepare jury instructions, to instruct the jury, and for the jury to deliberate. A landlord\\-tenant bench trial might be half a day or one day long, while a jury trial on the same matter might take two or three days. Selecting and charging a jury alone takes about half a day, and instructing a jury and having it deliberate takes another half\\-day at least.\n\nThe longer duration of a jury trial means that it takes longer for a case before a jury to be scheduled than a bench trial, because there in any given time frame, there will be more slots available for short trials than long ones. A half day bench trial might be possible to schedule two or three months out, while a two or three day jury trial might not fit into a judge's calendar for five or six months.\n\nAnd, a lawsuit involving a jury trial is more expensive to conduct. It probably takes something on the order of 32 more hours of lawyer time to litigate a case that goes to a jury trial than a case set for a bench trial, which is on the order of $8,000 at $250 per hour. Generally, a tenant who is being evicted or owes rent is either judgment\\-proof, or at least hard to collect from, so the landlord has an interest in keeping litigation costs low. \n\nThe out of pocket costs other than attorney's fees are also higher in a jury trial \\- there is typically a jury demand fee and a need to prepare a juror notebook for each juror. The need for better quality exhibits (e.g. exhibits may need to be blown up and put on an easel, or made into a powerpoint that can be see by all the jurors, rather than just photocopied and put in a single binder for a judge)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is the primary reason that landlords often include a clause waiving the right to a jury trial in residential rental agreements?\n\nA) To avoid juries that might be prejudiced against landlords\nB) To gain an economic advantage due to better legal representation\nC) To prevent jury confusion over complex rental agreements\nD) To reduce litigation costs and expedite the legal process\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect.

The appropriateness of this procedural peculiarity was first declared by a High Court judge several years ago, and has been cited by High Court judges since then. It has never been challenged in the next level court (Court of Appeal).\n\nDoes the fact that the procedural peculiarity was not challenged in the Court of Appeal in the first place prevent it from being challenged later in any other case citing it?

However, the longer a precedent is in place, the less likely it is to be overturned because *one* of the objectives of the legal system is to provide certainty \\- a system that routinely overturns precedent doesn\u2019t do that. Also, a precedent that is often cited with approval is more compelling because it\u2019s no longer just one judges reading of the law, many other judges agree.\n\nAlso, the judiciary tends to be conservative in overturning precedent. Most judges see it as their role to interpret law made by the legislature. If the people/legislature think their interpretation is wrong then the judiciary tends to feel that the legislature is the body who should change the law. That said, really old common law precedent that hasn\u2019t been cited for a long while may be readily overturned if it comes up because social expectations may have changed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a common law jurisdiction with an adversarial system, a procedural peculiarity has been established by case law in the High Court and has been cited by High Court judges for several years without being challenged in the Court of Appeal.

According to the information provided, any precedent can be overturned by a court at the same or higher level in the hierarchy. In this case, the procedural peculiarity established in the High Court can be challenged or overturned by the High Court itself, the Court of Appeal, or a higher court like the Supreme Court. However, the passage also notes that the longer a precedent is in place and the more it is cited with approval, the less likely it is to be overturned. This is because the legal system aims to provide certainty, and frequently overturning precedents would undermine this goal. Therefore, while the procedural peculiarity can be challenged, the likelihood of it being overturned decreases over time, especially if it has been frequently cited and approved by other judges."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81872/whats-the-difference-between-a-police-report-and-a-signed-complaint-in-us-il", "docs_id": 81872, "title": "What&#39;s the difference between a police report and a signed complaint?

A complaint in this narrow and strict sense would not usually be signed by an ordinary citizen witness to a crime.\n\nSometimes, however, the word \"complaint\" is used in a broader, non\\-technical sense to refer either to any report made to police complaining about misconduct by someone, or in a different technical sense to refer to a written and signed report made by a witness to the police.\n\nIt is likely that what really happened is that after receiving an oral report that the individual had threatened people, none of the witnesses who provided this oral report was willing to sign a document summarizing their oral report of being threatened for the police (perhaps out of fear of retaliation by the accused person, or out of a desire not to harm the accused person's long term future prospects).\n\nThen, the police department, as a matter of department policy (rather than any requirement imposed by law), declined to pursue a criminal case based upon the threats, when no one was willing to publicly and in writing commit to their oral reports, because they would need a testifying witness in a later court case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Highland Park shooting case, what is the most likely explanation for the statement \"There were no complaints that were signed by any of the victims\"?\n\nA) The victims were never given an opportunity to sign official complaints.\nB) Signed complaints are legally required for an arrest to be made in Illinois.\nC) Witnesses gave oral reports but were unwilling to provide signed written statements.\nD) The police department lacked the authority to accept signed complaints in this case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect.

Educational institutions are required to maintain a discrimination\\-free environment, so if a student makes inappropriate remarks to another student, they have to address the matter (if they ignore it, saying \"Boys will be boys\", they can get sued). They will have previously spelled out procedures for addressing such accusations, which probably include giving a good talking\\-to to the guilty party, and maybe some harsher sanction like suspension. The school district might then have in mind a parent\\-teacher conference, with the underlying threat being to turn the matter over to the police: did the letter come from the school district?\n\nA minor can commit a crime, such as assault or threatening: in Oklahoma, this includes [Ok. Stat \u00a721\\-1172](https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/2014/title-21/section-21-1172), which makes it a crime to send a message that is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, and a first violation of the law is a misdemeanor. For an adult, the penalty can be a year in prison and $500 fine, but that is unlikely for a minor. There may be a hearing in Juvenile Court with some disposition, and if the charges are proven then the court has wide latitude in meting out punishment. Did the letter come from the juvenile court system?\n\nThe Oklahome law regarding children and juveniles is [here](https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/2014/title-10a/). When the [Office of Juvenile Affairs](https://www.ok.gov/oja/Community_Based_Support/Juvenile_Services_Unit/index.html) engages in \"the intake process\", they are investigating the case to make a recommendation to the DA. \"Intake\" is defined as \n\n> a mandatory, preadjudicatory interview of the juvenile and, if\n>  available, the parents, legal guardian, or other custodian of the\n>  juvenile, which is performed by a duly authorized individual to\n>  determine whether a juvenile comes within the purview of the Oklahoma\n>  Juvenile Code, whether nonadjudicatory alternatives are available and\n>  appropriate, and if the filing of a petition is necessary\n\nSince \"intake\" is juvenile justice jargon, I assume this is a legal proceeding, not a parent\\-teacher conference. An actual criminal charge might result from the hearing, which is brought about by a referral. Because detention is a real possibility, consulting an attorney is wise.

Often a referral from an existing lawyer was the main qualification and admission to the federal court bars for lawyers already admitted to practice in state courts still works that way today.\n\nSo, it is highly unlikely that any particular state required (or even just highly encouraged) someone aspiring to practice law to know the Bible, to an extent more than this was encouraged for every literate adult.\n\nAs additional context, the primary qualification for admission to institutions of higher education up until the late 1800s was not knowledge of the Bible, but a sound foundation in reading, writing and speaking Latin and Ancient Greek, a skill set which had both religious and secular applications.\n\nIn the time period prior to the late 1800s, higher education mostly prepared young men for in the U.S. and in the North American colonies, either to be a member of the clergy (a track that naturally enough usually excluded most future lawyers), or to be a \"man of letters\" which primarily involved studying the classics, philosophy, rhetoric, history, and other humanities. Formal instruction in science, to the extent it happened, was taught as a subfield of philosophy (natural philosophy) or in connection to astronomy or math which were recognized as major academic disciplines in the early modern era in Europe.\n\nCollege educated \"men of letters\", who often went on to practice law (although as many or more sought other careers in fields such as politics, diplomacy, civil service, and business), were probably more knowledgeable of Greco\\-Roman mythology, and classical works of history, philosophy and rhetoric, than they were especially knowledgeable about the Bible or theology. As the term suggests, these avocations were not necessarily seen as completely distinct careers. Instead, they were more akin to different specialities within the Uber\\-category of work done by college educated men.\n\nNotwithstanding the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, there were parts of the United States, mostly in New England, where government established churches continued in existence after the adoption of the 1791 Bill of Rights (which initially applied only to the federal government). But this had ceased to be the case a decade or two before the U.S. Civil War. By the time that the legal profession began to be systemically regulated, the divide between church and state was well established. So it is unlikely that Biblical knowledge would have been a formal, or even highly encouraged, requirement for the practice of law.\n\nMy suspicion is that the statements you heard were the product of an educational movement, particularly common for religious home schooling, that has tried to claim, inaccurately, that the United States was a \"Christian nation\". This movement often distorts historical reality in an effort to prove that point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the relationship between Bible knowledge and the legal profession in early American history?\n\nA) Every state required aspiring lawyers to demonstrate extensive knowledge of the Bible before being admitted to the bar.\n\nB) Bible knowledge was a formal requirement for legal practice, reflecting the Christian foundations of the United States legal system.\n\nC) While Bible knowledge was common among literate people, it was not a specific requirement for legal practice, and the legal profession became formally regulated only in the late 1800s.\n\nD) The American South, being the most religious region, had the strictest Bible knowledge requirements for lawyers prior to the Civil War.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage indicates that while Bible knowledge was indeed common among literate people in early America, it was not a specific requirement for legal practice. The legal profession only began to be formally regulated in the late 1800s, with admission to practice law being handled separately by individual courts rather than on a statewide basis before then. The main qualifications were literacy, access to law books, and often a referral from an existing lawyer.

If one wishes to reference claims or points made (I suppose nonetheless by the defendant, even if through its human solicitor) in pre\\-trial correspondence, these challenges couldn't necessarily be posed to the human director of the defendant in cross\\-examination, because the human director of the defendant is not actually the defendant itself, while the barrister will also not have been the one who had written the letters of correspondence (it would have been the solicitor).\n\nIf one wishes to quiz or challenge the defendant, what opportunities in trial are there to do this?\n\nEven if we suppose momentarily that the legal representative of the defendant for the trial was the same one who had been writing all of the letters of pre\\-trial correspondence (ie the solicitor), as the legal representative is not a witness who can be subjective to cross\\-examination, are there any opportunities in a trial to enter into socratic, examination\\-style dialogue with the other side's representative?\n\nAnd which human entity in this scenario most corresponds to the defendant itself which is not a natural person? Is it true that the correspondence despite being humanly written by the instructed solicitor was legally with the defendant, so that they may be held responsible for everything that was written therein?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Evidence of pre\\-trial correspondence can be adduced if it is relevant to a fact in issue, and not excluded by another rule of evidence. Commonly, pre\\-trial correspondence is not relevant to a fact in issue, because it consists of legal argument and rhetoric. In other words, the letter is a solicitor's inadmissible [opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_evidence). And when pre\\-trial correspondence does set out the facts, it is often in inadmissible [hearsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay) form.\n\nPre\\-trial correspondence is also likely to attract [without prejudice privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_(legal_term)#Settlement_negotiations) (if sent to the other side in an attempt to negotiate a settlement) or [legal professional privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_professional_privilege) (if private between a party and their lawyer). For all of these reasons, pre\\-trial correspondence is not usually considered by a judge or jury at trial.\n\nHowever, in some circumstances pre\\-trial correspondence is admissible, typically as an [admission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_(law)), [prior consistent statement or prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements). Depending on the facts which make the correspondence relevant and admissible, it may also be appropriate to cross\\-examine the client, a director or other agent of the client who instructed the solicitor, or the solicitor, about it.\n\nIn some cases, a **client** may be cross\\-examined about a prior statement of their solicitor on the basis that the solicitor would not have made the statement without the client's authority, and would have relied on the client's instructions. If the court accepts that a prior inconsistent statement was made with the client's approval, this may damage their credibility.\n\nIf the client asserts legal professional privilege, or testifies that their lawyer acted without instructions, difficult questions arise. Some of these questions were explored by the High Court of Australia in *Hofer v The Queen* [\\[2021] HCA 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2021/36.html). Lawyers and judges will try to conduct cases in a way which avoids these procedural challenges, if at all possible.\n\nIn rare cases, a **lawyer** may be called to give evidence about whether a previous representation was actually made or authorised. This is, for example, the purpose of having a solicitor or other reputable professional *witness* formal documents. Barristers should [take special care not to place themselves at risk of becoming a witness](https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0243#sec.13), but in exceptional cases where the client waives legal professional privilege, they can also be required to give evidence about the client's previous instructions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this comes up more often in criminal law.\n\nThe decision in *Hofer* was an appeal from the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, which had received evidence from a barrister about the reasons for making decisions during the appellant's criminal trial. Conversely, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales dismissed an application for leave to cross\\-examine a solicitor, by applying the rules of evidence concerning prior consistent statements, in *Hall v The Queen* [\\[2015] EWCA Crim 581](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2015/581.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a trial involving a corporate defendant, pre-trial correspondence from the defendant's solicitor is sought to be introduced as evidence.

In [*Tilden*](https://canlii.ca/t/g1bxl) the hasty, informal way in which the contract was signed, the fact that the clause excluding liability was inconsistent with the overall purpose of the contract, and the absence of any real opportunity to read and understand the document **given its length and the amount of small print on its reverse side**, led the Court to conclude that the defendant should have known that the plaintiff had no intention of consenting to the onerous exclusion in question. In these **special circumstances**, there was a duty on Tilden to take reasonable measures to bring the exclusion clause to the attention of Mr. Clendenning.\n\n*Tilden Rent\\-A\\-Car Co. v.

In many cases the parties seeking to rely on the terms of the contract know or ought to know that the signature of a party to the contract does not represent the true intention of the signer, and that the party signing is unaware of the stringent and onerous provisions which the standard form contains. Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the party seeking to rely on such terms should not be able to do so in the absence of first having taken reasonable measures to draw such terms to the attention of the other party, and, in the absence of such reasonable measures, it is not necessary for the party denying knowledge of such terms to prove either fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum.\n> \n> \n> In the case at bar, Tilden Rent\\-A\\-Car took no steps to alert Mr. Clendenning to the onerous provisions in the standard form of contract presented by it. **The clerk could not help but have known that Mr. Clendenning had not in fact read the contract before signing it. Indeed the form of the contract itself with the important provisions on the reverse side and in very small type would discourage even the most cautious customer from endeavouring to read and understand it.** Mr. Clendenning was in fact unaware of the exempting provisions.

The situation is as follows:\n\nI have lived in the flat I rent for a bit over 2 years. This started as a 1 year Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) and became periodic after.\n\nAt the two year mark (August), the landlord asked me to renew as a fixed\\-term again with a rent increase of about 9%. I agreed. I had moved in during covid when rents were very low and the new rate was reasonable.\n\nMy partner is a joint tenant in a rented flat. Her tenancy ends at the start of December.\n\nWhen my landlord reached out to me about resigning with the rent increase in August, I mentioned that we would like to move in together. I made it clear that this would not happen until Nov/Dec when her tenancy ended. They agreed and asked for a \u00a330 referencing fee, which I paid.\n\nThey immediately attempted referencing via their estate agents. This failed as what they tried to do was sign her as a co\\-tenant, which would have meant she was a tenant on 2 AST rentals at the same time. Apparently that's an issue (though I couldn't get a straight answer on this).\n\nHer landlords also refused to give a reference because she hadn't given notice, and refused to accept notice as she had more than two months left on her tenancy.\n\nI suggested they instead just make an amendment to give me permission to sub\\-let to her, as the intention was always that I would continue to pay the rent and be responsible for the flat. I was just told that the referencing had failed and we could try again once my partner was in the final two months of her tenancy and had given notice. I didn't receive a refund for the referencing fee, and didn't chase for one as I thought it would just cover the costs when we resumed the process.\n\nWe're now in the final months of my partners tenancy and she's put her notice in. A new tenant has been found to replace her, so it's too late to back out.\n\nI reached out to the landlord to let them know this and that we could therefore pick up the referencing again and amend the contract. Their response summarised is as follows:\n\nThe referencing is now \"\u00a350 plus VAT\" i.e. \u00a360\\. I've pointed out the original \u00a330 and received no acknowledgement. I've confirmed they do indeed mean \"plus VAT\".\n\nDue to an unexpected increase in the fee for the building shared boiler, they want to increase the rent by up to an additional 6% a month. I stress, they have not said this is because of an additional tenant and that I had already flagged a second tenant well in advance of agreeing the first rent increase. I've seen no proof of this increased cost to them.\n\nNeedless to say I'm unhappy as I would not have resigned knowing all this.\n\nWe're intending to move out next August anyway and at this point I'm past caring about maintaining a good relationship with the landlord. Looking for advice on the following:\n\nWhat could happen if we simply moved in together? I'm aware the landlord could pursue eviction, but how long would this take. If we're intending to move out anyway, I wouldn't be bothered if it meant leaving earlier. Could it affect our deposit? Could they sue? Would it have longer term implications to referencing for us when say, buying a home?\n\nAm I right to contest the referencing cost? My understanding is that they aren't allowed to charge for referencing, only a tenancy amendment which should not be withheld unreasonably. My contract does not state an amendment cost.\n\nIs there a means to complain about a landlord's behaviour to a third party? If so, what should the focus of my complaint be? Are there any grounds here?\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any help!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You won't get a reference from your landlord if you don't maintain a good relationship with them. I say just move her in and if you keep paying your rent they shouldn't care or maybe even know about it. If you're still living there she's basically your guest and they likely couldn't do anything and if she reimburses you for some of the rent that's none of LLs business. If they want to evict you on section 8 for breach of tenancy by unlawful subletting they would take a number of months and also they world accrue legal costs so might not even bother. You could then still argue that you aren't subletting as she is just your short term or indefinite guest and the eviction claim might even be thrown out by the court. In any case I think it would take anywhere from 3\\-8 months to evict you but this is all quite fuzzy in actuality."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in London wants to move their partner into their rented flat without the landlord's permission.

In some jurisdictions but by no means most, algorithms and business processes can be patented.\n\nSoftware, both the literary (code) and artistic (UIJ) work, is protected by copyright which prevents copying the expression but not the idea. So software writers can take inspiration from other *software* but can\u2019t *copy* it.\n\nSo, things that look like copyright infringement often aren\u2019t but things that look like patent infringement often are.\n\nPatents last for a short time (10\\-20 years) and take a lot of investment of time and money so their owners are incentivised to commercialise them quickly and on a large scale.\n\nCopyright lasts for a long time (life of the creator(s) \\+ 50 years minimum depending on jurisdiction) and come into existence automatically. In general, it is easier to create a literary or artistic work than a novel invention.\n\nSo, patent owners are more incentivised to protect their IP than copyright owners."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why online businesses, particularly in the mobile gaming industry, seem to face fewer legal challenges for creating products similar to their competitors compared to physical product manufacturers?\n\nA) Copyright law is less effective for digital services than for physical products.\nB) The rate of copycat products is too high for original creators to file claims quickly enough.\nC) Software is primarily protected by copyright rather than patents, allowing for more flexibility in creating similar products.\nD) Large corporate groups have special legal exemptions that allow them to create modified versions of popular products.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because software is primarily protected by copyright, which prevents direct copying but allows for the creation of similar products based on the same idea. Patents, which are more commonly used for physical products, offer stronger protection against similar inventions. Copyright protects the expression of an idea, not the idea itself, giving software developers more leeway to create products inspired by existing ones without infringing on intellectual property rights. This explains why we see many similar mobile games and apps without the same level of legal challenges observed in physical product markets.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because copyright law is equally applicable to digital and physical products, but its nature allows for more similarity in software.

The buyer can propose any legal terms they want, but these only become enforceable if the manufacturer also agrees to them. Additionally, the contract must meet other legal requirements such as adequate consideration, capacity, and legality. Answer A is incorrect because merely proposing terms doesn't make them binding. Answer B is incomplete, as while verbal agreements can be binding, they're often harder to prove and enforce, especially for complex transactions. A written agreement is generally preferable.

I am wondering if we can be sued outside of trademark or copyright reasons for using a meme in the naming of a company or product since it may cause confusion of sort or because we're using something that is in the public domain, which may hurt the public interest in some way.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A phrase which is too generic or in too wide currnt use to be a valid trademark, may nevertheless be used as a business name or slogan.\n\nFor example \"Good Pizza\" is so generic that I am reasonably sure that it could not be registered as a trademark, but a business could use that as a name or slogan. A business that did so would forgo any of the advantages of trademark protection or of having a clearly unique name, but as no one else owns trademark rights to the phrase either, no one could sue such a business over its choice of name, or not with any hope of success.\n\nSimilarly, if a phrase taken from a meme cannot be registered, no one else can have it as a trademark, and so no one can sue successfully.\n\nAs to copyright, names, titles, and short phrases are simply not protectable by copyright at all. See the US Copyright office circular 01 \"Copyright Basics\" which says on page 2;\n\n> Copyright does not protect ...

(However, see the section on \"fraud\" below.) Things that are in the public domain are free for anyone to use, not protected **against** anyone's use. What is not permitted is trying to claim an exclusive right to PD items., by a copyright or trademark claim.\n\nThe one exception I can think of is that if someone had established a phrase as a trademark, and it **later** became a meme, then **perhaps** the trademark owner could sue over uses of it. But with the phrase having become generic, it might well lose any trademark protection.\n\nThe first thing a plaintiff must do in presenting a trademark suit is establish that the mark is a currently valid trademark, owned by the plaintiff. If the mark is not a valid tm, the suit is over because it has no protection.\n\nFraud\n-----\n\nA comment states:\n\n> ... Intentionally misleading others to believe you are a particular party using a non\\-protectable name, when in fact you are a different party, seems like fraud, and it very much hinges on the name/similar identification.\n\nIn the fact patter from this comment, the name is derived from a **meme**, and so there is no other particular person. In that case one cannot plausibly be deceiving anyone into thinking that a business is actually a different business, because there is no business which is **uniquely** identified by the name.\n\nStill, it is possible for fraud to occur in a fact pattern similar to this. Say a local store calls itself \"good pizza\", a name not protect able as a trademark, because it is too generic. But it is popular and has a good reputation. Another store, hoping to confuse customers, calls itself \"Goode Pizza\". A customer calls \"Goode Pizza\" and aks \"Are you the Good Pizza on George Street?\" (which is the location of the first store. An employee answers \"Yes\" (falsely) and the customer then places a delivery order. That **might** be fraud.\n\nFor a fraud case, in most jurisdictions, it must be proved that:\n\n1. A person knowingly made a **false statement** (or in some jurisdictions an intentionally misleading statement\");\n2. with the **intention** of getting a financial advantage, or depriving another of an advantage or benefit;\n3. The statement was **material** to the transaction (meaning that the other party might well have not agreed to the transaction, or demanded different terms, in the absence of the fraudulent statement);\n4. The other party **relied** on the fraudulent statement;\n5. it was **reasonable** for the other party to rely on the fraudulent statement; and\n6. **harm** was done to the other party as a result of this reliance.\n\nSome jurisdictions omit or modify some of these elements.\n\nIn the Good Pizza / Goode Pizza scenario above, ther is a knowingly false statement. Since the customer asked about the identity of the store, it can be assumed that it was material to the transaction. The imitation of the other store's name suggests an intention to mislead, although more proof might be needed. There was reliance, and it was probably reasonable.

This scenario is, however, rather different from the situation discussed in the question.\n\nNote that in the US, trademarks can be protected from mere use, without registration, if they otherwise qualify. In general there will be a preference to frame such a case as one of trademark infringement, rather than fraud, if possible, because fraud is usually harder to prove (trademark infringement dose notr require proof of intention to mislead nor of knowing falsehood), and statutory damages may be available in a trademark infringement case, without any need to prove actual damages.

This means that while the store cannot sue others for using a similar name, they also cannot be sued for trademark infringement related to the meme.\n\nOption A is incorrect because short phrases and titles, including memes, are generally not protected by copyright.\n\nOption C is unlikely, as fraud would require intentional deception and proof of harm, which is not inherent in simply using a meme name.\n\nOption D is overly broad.

You seem to gear the bulk of your inquiry toward when the government can search, but then move to when a corporate entity has the right to do so, which is a very different thing. These are different issues with different concepts and rules that dictate when this can occur lawfully. You might want to narrow your question a bit.\n\nBy way of generalization: the citizens of the U.S. *have* an *implied* right to privacy as construed through the Bill of Rights, even though there is no explicit right written into the constitution. The most common way to conduct a search in the U.S. is with probable cause through a search warrant. There are questions and answers both on here, as well as resources all over the internet, pertaining to constitutionally accepted forms of search and seizure such that you could get that information fairly easily. However, as with the U.K., and despite any rights (explicit or implicit), there are many ways your computer could be searched by the government \\- both known to the owner and unknown \\- and even remotely, that use means less common to the standard search warrant. As you've probably heard from the revelations of Edward Snowden (Wikileaks), the governments of the world have been shown to search metadata and other electronic records without a warrant under laws aimed toward protecting national security. In the U.S. the Patriot Act gave wide reaching powers to invade the privacy of individuals that required no oversight or basis for doing so. Corporations that deal with the transmission of data work with government entities to to accomplish this end.\n\nAs one individual has already noted, you subject yourself to search (which includes your computer) upon entry to the country through customs. There are many ways that the government can and does engender to search computers, computer files, emails, metadata, etc.\n\nA corporation may search your personal computer under a contractual relationship you create with it (for instance if you work from home and elect to use your home computer, and to do so you elect to agree to allow the entity to inspect your computer for their intellectual property in certain circumstances). They can also do this pursuant to a civil lawsuit, which can allow for the inspection of your computer through the process of discovery. \n\nThese are just some of the ways your information can become subject to inspection (search) by government or corporate entities.

The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly state a right to privacy, but it is implied through interpretations of the Bill of Rights.

In Iowa, a barber by the name of Dunahoo was arrested, charges, and convicted after a customer gave him a 25 cent tip after a haircut. The shop contained two chairs, one staffed by Dunahoo, the other by shop owner Murphy. Had the customer chosen Murphy and tipped him it would have been legal since Murphy was a proprietor, not an employee. Dunahoo's arrangement with Murphy was that he was to receive a salary of $15 a week plus 60 percent of his billings above that amount, plus tips. **When the case went to the Iowa Supreme Court, it turned on the discriminatory nature of the bill, which, contrary to the United States and Iowa constitutions, denied equal protection under its laws to all citizen \u2014 separate classes were established.** Dunahoo's conviction was reversed by a 4\u20132 margin.

First, there was a constitutional challenge in Iowa where the state's Supreme Court found the law discriminatory because it applied only to employees and not business owners, violating equal protection principles. This ruling weakened the legal standing of similar laws in other states. Second, the persistence of tipping customs despite these laws led many to believe that attempting to abolish the practice was futile. The passage specifically mentions that laws were repealed in several states (Washington, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi) partly due to the fall of the Iowa measure and partly due to the continued prevalence of tipping. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the laws were being repealed in the 1920s, before the Great Depression, and were not universally popular. \n\nAnswer B is inaccurate because while the Iowa Supreme Court ruling was influential, it did not directly force other states to repeal their laws. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect as there is no mention of federal legislation prohibiting anti-tipping laws in the passage."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73744/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-get-a-guilty-verdict-in-obvious-cases", "docs_id": 73744, "title": "Why does it take so long to get a guilty verdict in obvious cases?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not a lawyer and TV has definitely not been an accurate representation of the law.

Murder is not a strict liability crime, so the ability of the defendant to form the intent to commit the crime is relevant.\n\n* In the case of the Charleston church shooting, the defendant was twice evaluated for competence to stand trial.\n\nAgain, no doubt about who did it, but most if not all jurisdictions require a defendant to be sufficiently sane to participate in their defense.\n\n* In the case of the Parkland shooting, the initial delay was confusion over who the defense lawyer would be.\n\nFlorida will only provide a public defender to someone who cannot afford their own defense lawyer, and it took nearly a year to determine that the defendant had inherited enough money to afford a private lawyer. Due to this delay, the trial was initially scheduled for mid\\-2020, which caused it to be delayed by the COVID\\-19 outbreak.\n\n* In the case of the Tree of Life shooting, it appears to be straight\\-up delaying tactics by the defense.\n\nThere are a great many motions, appeals of motions, requests for delay, and other things a lawyer can do to slow things down.

This can include:\n\n1. Pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity (as in the Aurora theater shooting case)\n2. Evaluations of competency to stand trial (as in the Charleston church shooting case)\n3.

The court considers various factors, including the child's ability to contribute through part-time work, their career plans, and whether they could have reasonably expected support if the marriage hadn't broken down. The relationship between the child and each parent is not the primary determining factor in this obligation. While a unilateral termination of the relationship by the child could be considered, it doesn't automatically negate the parent's responsibility.

Clayton County, Georgia, No. 17\\-1618 (S. Ct. June 15, 2020\\),\\[1] the Supreme Court held that firing individuals because of their sexual orientation or transgender status violates Title VII\u2019s prohibition on discrimination because of sex.\n\nIndividuals who identify as non\\-human animals report sexual aspects of their identity to academic researchers (Brooks *et al* 2022\\. PMID [35576143](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35576143/)):\n\n> evidence was found that most furries did, indeed, report being sexually attracted to various facets of their furry interest (e.g., furry\\-themed media) and were sexually motivated to engage in various furry\\-themed behaviors (e.g., interacting with other furries)\n\nThus, my question is if individuals who identify as non\\-human animals are members of a [protected class](https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/small-business/3-who-protected-employment-discrimination) with respect to employment discrimination. Could such an individual assert this protection through the sexual orientation class?\n\nThe question focuses on the United States, but I would also be interested in prospectives from around the world.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, no. This is because \"protected class\" is defined statutorily for a particular purpose, for example \"civil rights\", \"employment\", \"housing\". There can be variation in federal vs. state or municipal protected classes and what classes have which rights (e.g. \"race\" is included in all protected classes but pregnancy\\-discrimination is not federally protected w.r.t. housing), but so far nobody has defined \"self\\-identifies as non\\-human\" as a protected class.\n\nIf Congress were to pass a blanket law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of species, then (1\\) it would be illegal to not consider my dog as a job candidate and (2\\) it would be illegal to take into consideration whether a job candidate is a human versus a dog or a fern. But there is no such law.\n\n\"Non\\-binary\" is not, per se, a protected class. The rationale of Bostock v. Clayton County is that one cannot legally discriminate based on whether a person is male or female, therefore one cannot legally discriminate based on whether one is a male who has sex with a female versus whether one is a male who has sex with a male, or whether one is a male who abjures sex, because they all reduce to discrimination based on whether one is male (or female). It's not legal to discriminate against furries based on whether they are male or are female, but being a furry is itself a protected class."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on current U.S. employment discrimination laws and the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v.

The evolution from \"pledge, protect, warrant\" to \"recovery of goods... upon posting of security\" can be explained by focusing on the act of posting a bond (a form of security) as part of the process to recover goods. This maintains a connection to the idea of \"pledging\" while specializing the term for a specific legal context.\n\nB) While this answer touches on the concept of pledges, it's not the best explanation for the term's evolution.

(At least as I learned UK law in the 1990s.) Are there any other instances in the UK where \"truth is not an absolute defense\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The original phrase [\"falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater) came from the opnion by Justice Holmes in [*Schenck v. United States*, 249 U.S. 47 (1919\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) where it was a **metaphor** for speech that might validly be prohibited under he First Amendment. It served to introduce the famous \"Clear and present danger\" test. The issue in that case was whether distributing fliers urging people not to submit to the draft could be the reason for a conviction under the Espionage Act, or whether such action was protected by the First Amendment. Holmes held it was not protected. The case was not about any actual shout of \"fire\".\n\nThe Court has generally held that true speech may not be prohibited, and for this reason some legal scholars argue that the \"private facts\" tort is unconstitutional in the US. But in many cases the Court has held that false speech is also protected, so truth is not the primary criterion.\n\nIn [*Brandenberg vs Ohio* 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) the \"Clear and present danger\" test was replaced by a rule that only speech \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action\" may be prohibited under the first amendment, and this is now the test for any crime of \"incitement\". Under this test *Schenck* would hav gone the other way. This test says nothing about the truth of the speech, and a perfectly true statement may nevertheless be incitement if it seeks to arouse lawless action, and is likely to succeed.\n\n*Near vs Minnesota* held that bare truth must be a defense in any prior restraint case (unlike truth published \"with good motives and for justifiable ends\" which the saturate at issue in *Near* allowed as a defense), but went on to greatly restrict any prior restraint, even if the content was false.\n\nDefamation is really the primary situation in which falsity is a vital element of the offense, and so truth is a defense.\n\nFalsity is an element of perjury also, and so truth would be an absolute defense there as well. Falsity is also an element of the common\\-law tort of fraud, and of most statutory versions of fraud, but in some of those a true but misleading statement can still be held fraudulent, so truth is not an absolute defense.\n\nI cannot think of another such legal situation.\n**Updatew:**\n\nA comment asked:\n\n> What if I inform all of Joe's neighbours that Joe had been arrested for murder \\- when I fully know that he was completely exonerated and the real murderer is in jail right now. It's literally the truth, but completely misleading.\n\nIn that case the law takes you to have made **by implication** a statement that Joe is currently under suspicion for murder, or perhaps a statement that Joe is actually guilty of murder. As those statements are false, and apparently knowingly false, they can be the basis of a defamation action. There is a lot of caselaw on defamation by implication, but in general one is taken to have made statements that are clearly implied by the statements one did in fact make. I don't think this is very different in UK and US law, but I am not sure about the UK.

Suppose a person commits an offence, for example robbery, and is sentenced to jail for one year. After serving his time he does the same thing again and now is sentenced to two years' imprisonment instead of one just because of the earlier crime. The extra year he is required to serve is just because of the first crime, but he has already been charged, sentenced and served his time for that crime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Habitual offender laws are written such that they represent distinct crimes. In your given example, the trier of fact will be asked to judge two distinct crimes:\n\n* Did the defendant rob the bank\n* Did the defendant break the habitual offender act\n\nAn example from California, [Penal Code Section 193\\.7](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=193.7.) defines habitual offenders for traffic offenses:\n\n> A person convicted of a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 191\\.5 that occurred within seven years of two or more separate violations of Section 23103, as specified in Section 23103\\.5, of, or Section 23152 or 23153 of, the Vehicle Code, or any combination thereof, that resulted in convictions, shall be designated as an habitual traffic offender subject to paragraph (3\\) of subdivision (e) of Section 14601\\.3 of the Vehicle Code, for a period of three years, subsequent to the conviction. The person shall be advised of this designation pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 13350 of the Vehicle Code.\n\nThe conviction of being an habitual traffic offender is applied an underlying statute's sentencing guidelines. In the case of [California's Vehicle Code 14601\\.3(e)(3\\)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=14601.3.&lawCode=VEH):\n\n> Any habitual traffic offender designated under Section 193\\.7 of the Penal Code or under subdivision (b) of Section 23546, subdivision (b) of Section 23550, subdivision (b) of Section 23550\\.5, or subdivision (d) of Section 23566 who is convicted of a violation of Section 14601\\.2 shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for 180 days and by a fine of two thousand dollars ($2,000\\). The penalty in this paragraph shall be consecutive to that imposed for the violation of any other law.\n\nIn this case, there is enhanced sentencing if one is convicted of the crime of driving under a suspended or revoked license if the person is also convicted of being an habitual traffic offender.\n\nThe [jury instruction template used](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3100/3250/) when determining if an enhanced sentence is warranted requires that the defendant be found guilty of the underlying crime as well as the additional allegation of the sentencing factor:\n\n> If you \ufb01nd the defendant guilty of the crime\\[s] charged in Count\\[s]\n>  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\[,] \\[or of attempting to commit (that/those) crime\\[s]]\\[ or thelesser crimes\\[s] of ], you must then decide whether\\[, for each crime,] the People have proved the additional allegation that \\<*insert description of enhancement, sentencing factor, or factual issue*\\>. \\[You must decide whether the People have proved this allegation for each crime and return a separate \ufb01nding for each crime.\n> \n> \n> To prove this allegation, the People must prove that:\n> \n> \n> \\<*Insert elements required.*\\>\n> \n> \n> The People have the burden of proving each allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal basis for this enhancement without violating double jeopardy principles?\n\nA) The defendant is being punished again for their previous crime, but it's allowed because habitual offender laws are an exception to double jeopardy.\n\nB) The sentencing enhancement is not considered punishment for the previous crime, but rather a separate offense of being a habitual offender.\n\nC) Double jeopardy doesn't apply because the enhancement is part of the sentencing phase, not the trial phase.\n\nD) The defendant is simultaneously being tried for both the current robbery and the previous crime, allowing for a cumulative sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Habitual offender laws are structured to create a distinct offense separate from the underlying crime. The defendant is not being punished again for their previous crime (which would violate double jeopardy), but rather is being charged with an additional offense of being a habitual offender. This requires proof of both the current crime and the defendant's status as a repeat offender. The enhancement is treated as a separate allegation that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, typically alongside the primary offense. This structure allows for increased penalties for repeat offenders without violating the principle of double jeopardy.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because habitual offender laws are not an exception to double jeopardy; they're structured to avoid double jeopardy issues altogether.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while the enhancement does affect sentencing, it must be proved during the trial phase as a separate allegation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the defendant is not being retried for their previous crime; only their status as a repeat offender is relevant to the current proceedings."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57232/my-friend-is-being-harassed-by-a-non-us-citizen-and-worry-he-may-stalk-her-here", "docs_id": 57232, "title": "My friend is being harassed by a non-US citizen and worry he may stalk her here...where to report it? :(", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend is being horribly stalked and harassed online by a non\\-US citizen who currently outside of the US, but is causing her \\& her family serious concern for safety \\& wellbeing.

The defendant makes a motion to have the evidence from the search suppressed on the grounds that the police had no probable cause to search the vehicle. Whether the police had probable cause in the case is complex issue involving many different facts. Let's imagine that one of these facts is that the police officer stated that the car owner's mechanic told him that the the car's airbag system had been tinkered with, a violation of US Federal regulations. During oral argument the defense argues that the possible violation of a Federal regulation is not grounds for a search. The judge then speaks out and says that violation of a regulation is still a crime and therefore potentially grounds for search. Later, in the written decision, the judge dismisses the motion to suppress, but does not explicitly give his reasons or gives other reasons, not involving the violation of a regulation.\n\nSo, let's assume for the sake of argument that the judge made an error when he stated that violating a regulation is a \"crime\" and therefore grounds for local police to search a vehicle. Can the defense argue that even though this error does not appear in written form in the judge's decision, the fact that he said such a thing in court shows that he has a defective and incorrect understanding of laws relevant to the motion, therefore he is not fit to make a ruling on such laws.\n\nSo, imagine that the appeals court finds that the judge has a clearly defective understanding of search and seizure law as evidences by his remarks in court.

The appeals court expects attorneys to politely correct judges when they make errors during the proceedings. If the error is not challenged at the time, it's considered that the counsel accepted the judge's misunderstanding or chose not to address it as part of their strategy. However, if the error makes it into the oral or written judgment, it can be appealed even if it wasn't challenged during the trial. This principle is similar to cases where judges have fallen asleep during trials - counsel is expected to wake the judge, or it's assumed they accepted the judge missing that portion of the case."}}
