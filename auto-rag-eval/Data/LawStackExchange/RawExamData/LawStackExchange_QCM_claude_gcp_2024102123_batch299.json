Bob deeply opposes the world order of NATO imperialism and finds the Ukrainian NATO backed regime repulsive and abhorrent due to its perceived Nazi associations in his mind. (Bob vehemently abhors Nazism.)\n\nBob further feels disgusted by all of the propaganda with which he feels he is incessantly bombarded from all directions by society. He feels very exhausted as this incessant propaganda siege grates and wears on him and besides he feels that it is a form of morally repulsive virtue signalling by people who don't actually harbor the proclaimed virtue at all.\n\nIt is to Bob arguably as though the state has officially endorsed a worldview that is dedicated to actively condemning his own so as to make him feel alone, inferior, and utterly marginalized.\n\nOne day, Bob goes out to buy some stuff and after inserting his card to the payment terminal, he is asked if he would like to add a donation to the Ukrainian cause to his payment.\n\nNo such offer is made for him to donate to the Russian federation's war widows/orphans, or to the Russian federation's armed forces, or to the antifascist people's republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. He now feels further marginalised and vilified by society.\n\nNow meet Alice. Alice sports Ukrainian flag badges and bumper stickers and can't stop telling everyone how much she hates Vladimir Putin. Alice visits the same shop and is offered the same option when paying for her purchase.

These laws generally protect against discrimination based on protected characteristics like race, gender, religion, etc., not political views or general philosophical worldviews. The shop is not denying service to Bob or treating him differently as a customer; they are simply offering an optional donation that any customer can choose to accept or decline. While Bob may feel marginalized, his feelings alone do not create a legal basis for discrimination. Options A, B, and C incorrectly assume that offering a donation option for one cause but not others violates anti-discrimination laws, which is not typically the case in most jurisdictions."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35612/false-debt-on-credit-report-original-creditor-bankrupt-out-of-business-multipl", "docs_id": 35612, "title": "False debt on credit report, original creditor bankrupt/ out of business multiple fraud lawsuits filed against them in state", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently discovered a collections on my credit report, over $4000 U.S. \nThe original creditor was a now defunct property management company.\nThey are notorious here in Idaho for evading with over $1 million dollars of fraudulently gained monies\nI spoke to legal aid at v.a.

For example, do they need to prove the defendant knew he didn\u2019t have authorization? What about intent to defraud \u2014 do they need to prove he knew it was against the law, too?\n\n(tl;dr) My specific question: **How do prosecutors determine the elements necessary to satisfy the *mens rea* requirements attached to certain laws?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is actually a very complicated question, about (1\\) the scope of \"knowingly\", (2\\) what kind of \"intent\" is required for conviction, (3\\) how does the jury understand and evaluate concepts of intent and (4\\) how does an attorney persuade the jury that the situation does or does not satisfy the particular intent requirement. One thing we can dispose of quickly is the possibility that the law says that the accused has to actually *know* that the act is against the law. It is a standard legal fiction (2,400 years old) that the accused knows the law, or should have known.\n\nAs for the 4th element, persuasion, on the strong side we have statements of intent by the accused \u2013 \"And I pulled out my rifle and blew his head off, and I laughed the whole time\". What the jury has to decide is whether the accused had in mind a conscious purpose of doing some act (that is, it wasn't just an accident like butt\\-dialing, or an instant stimulus\\-response reaction to some event). \"Intent\" generally falls in the realm of acting \"purposely\", which the Model Penal Code \u00a72\\.02 defines as:\n\n> A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an\n>  offense when:\n> \n> \n> (i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result\n>  thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that\n>  nature or to cause such a result; and \n> \n> \n> (ii) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware\n>  of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that\n>  they exist.\n\nwhich more or less means what you think \"with intent\" means. That doesn't say what they intended to do, it just distinguishes intent from negligence and accident. The prosecutor would then present factual evidence that the accused had a bad intent, like showing that he actually made an attempt to access credit card account data (that such data had been accessed when he broke into the system), etc.\n\nWe can sort of dispose of the other scope question about \"knowingly\", namely, what things would he have to know? The chunk *accessing a protected computer without authorization* can be interpreted in a number of ways, having to do with which elements of the clause are known to the accused. You might know that you were accessing but not know that you were unauthorized; you might know that you were accessing and unauthorized, but not know that the computer is protected. The only reliable way to know which is which is to study the case law on a statute and see if there is a controlling decision that say e.g. that you have to know that you are accessing and are unauthorized, but you don't have to know that the computer is protected. I haven't determined (yet) is there is decisive case law on this, but I'm betting that the outcome would be that not knowing of the protected status of a computer carries no weight.\n\nAs for what kind of intent, there is a distinction between \"specific intent\" and \"general intent\". The distinction comes down to having some evil purpose like \"make him suffer\" (general intent) versus a specific evil purpose like \"kill him\".\n\nFinally, the people who actually decide, the jury, will be given instructions that say what they have to look for. Here is the tip of the tip of the iceberg, from California's criminal jury instructions. The judge will say...\n\n> The People must prove not only that the defendant did the acts\n>  charged, but also that (he/she) acted with a particular (intent/\n>  \\[and/or] mental state). The instruction for (the/each) crime \\[and\n>  allegation] explains the (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state) required.\n>  A\\[n] (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state) may be proved by circumstantial\n>  evidence.\n> \n> \n> Before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that a fact\n>  necessary to find the defendant guilty has been proved, you must be\n>  convinced that the People have proved each fact essential to that\n>  conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt.\n> \n> \n> Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that\n>  the defendant had the required (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state), you\n>  must be convinced that the only reasonable conclusion supported by the\n>  circumstantial evidence is that the defendant had the required\n>  (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state).

However, when\n>  considering circumstantial evidence, you must accept only reasonable\n>  conclusions and reject any that are unreasonable.\n\nand then there will be some specific elaboration of whether they have to find that the accused just generally intended to do bad, versus intended to specifically defraud."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A prosecutor is preparing a case against a defendant accused of violating U.S. Code Sec. 1030, par. 4, which involves knowingly accessing a protected computer without authorization and with intent to defraud.

In other words, don't drive or park it on public roads; keep it on private property. (In many states, \"operating\" includes parking; I could not immediately find out whether this is the case in Washington.)\n\nSo now your question instead becomes: \"What is the state's obligation *to make it possible for me to lawfully drive this particular vehicle on the public roads*?\" And the answer to that is much more clearly, \"none\". Driving in general is considered a privilege and not a right, so your \"personal liberty\" is not at issue.

It doesn't work. Mfg just keeps delaying with service visits and attempted fixes. I'm done and ready to buy a new dishwasher and sue for the cost of the old. Who do I sue?\n\n**Background**\n\nWe purchased a new dishwasher from a big box store. We want to return it for a slew of reasons, top among them being:\n\n* Dishes do not come clean\n* Dishes smell of chemicals, most likely from detergent not being washed off\n* Sound level is 26 db above rated level (I expected 5\\-10, but not 20\\+)\n\nThese problems can be partially mitigated by running every load twice, but that's wasteful of water, time, energy, etc and not what we paid for.\n\n**Attempted Resolution**\n\nI contacted the big box store who told me to talk to the manufacturer first, and they asked me to try a few things, such as:\n\n* Different types of detergent\n* Different types of rinse aid\n* With and without rinse aid\n* Running the hot water in the sink first\n\nAfter none of these worked I contacted the big box store, and they told me I was past the 30 day return window at that point and had no recourse other than through manufacturer.\n\nThe manufacturer said they had to sent a tech before approving a return. The tech said these problems were definitely real, and there was no apparent cause, and I should get a new machine. The manufacturer then said they had to send another tech. That tech said the only thing they could guess it might be is a faulty motor that works, but not strongly enough. They offered to replace it, but said it would be 3\\+ weeks.\n\n**Now What?**\n\nAt this point I've already lost close to an hour a day double washing and hand washing dishes and pots and pans for a month, and am unwilling to wait any longer, especially since I believe the manufacturer is just trying to delay until I go away. And I didn't buy a refurbished dishwasher, I bought a new one. So I'm planning to just buy another dishwasher, and sue the manufacturer or big box store for the money I spent on the first.\n\nWho do I sue? My sales contract is with the big box store. However, the problems seem related to a manufacturer defect or, more likely, faulty design by the manufacturer.\n\nAnd if I win, what do I do with the dishwasher?\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* I do not have a vehicle to transport this dishwasher\n* I have a back problem and do not want to try lifting this dishwasher to transport it\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Would I sue seller or manufacturer for a new appliance that does not function correctly?\n\nYou have viable claims against both seller and manufacturer, and you may sue both of them in the same complaint. Hopefully the tech's assessment that you \"*should get a new machine*\" is *in writing*, since that evidence seems dispositive (i.e., decisive) and immune to manufacturer's potential denial. Regardless of what approach you choose, the award you might be granted is subject to the prohibition of *double recovery*.\n\nIt seems that the seller's directions were purposefully dilatory. Coupled with its subsequent pretext about expiration of the 30 day period, seller's conduct is in violation of legislation regarding *unfair and misleading practices*. Your post does not specify which jurisdiction in the US you have in mind, but consumer protection laws are rather uniform all over the country.\n\nIf the provision of 30\\-day return period is reflected in a document such as the invoice, or in seller's signs/advertisements, you also have a claim of *breach of contract* for seller's failure to abide by the corresponding clause or policy.\n\nA similar rationale applies with respect to the manufacturer. The manufacturer is not entitled to arbitrarily postpone compliance as to the warranty.

That party is responsible for transportation costs and related expenses if it decides to pick up the appliance.\n\nIf the party is not interested in retrieving the defective appliance, make sure it signs a waiver.

This approach gives the consumer the best chance of remedy, as it addresses both the sales contract with the retailer and the product defect from the manufacturer. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the consumer is not limited to only suing the manufacturer. While the manufacturer is responsible for the product defect, the retailer also has obligations under consumer protection laws.\n\nOption B is incorrect because although the consumer has a direct sales contract with the retailer, they are not limited to only suing the retailer.

As an easy example, I'm sure costs for rent and food differ in Norway from region to region just as in any other country. In my country, for a good salary in a northern town, you would not find a bridge to sleep under in the most epxensive southern town. A salary in the southern town tends to be at least twice as much as in the north just to keep their employees. But what the employees actually have in their pockets after all neccessary expenses like rent, food and utility is very similar between the regions.\n\nThere are also instances of companies paying for public transport tickets for example. Which if you use public transport is a lot of money over the year, if you go by car or even bike, it's worth nothing. Or maybe they offer a company car. That is nice if you need a car. If your family already has two in the garage, it's kinda \"meh\".\n\nSo yes, different payment based on variables that are not productivity of the employee are legal and widespread.\n\nIt does become a problem at the \"approval\" step though. For example which region you live in is not exactly covered under the GDPR and is information that is already available to your employer in way more detail anyway (I assume they have your full address). More personal information is not available to your employer and for good reasons. Even just *having* such information runs against anti\\-discrimination laws.\n\nIt is also not only legal, but *legally required* in some EU countries to take those things (age, dependents) into account when laying off people. So there can be legal discrimination to protect those most vulnerable. So maybe it's better to create that sounds like a protection for vulnerable groups than a payment scheme. Something like extra days off for specific needs. Like say you not only allow the legally required maternatiy leave, but give 4 weeks on your own paid leave on top. Or give a day off not only for bereavement leave of first degree family members, but also second degree. Or maybe you grant a paid day off for a persons kids first day in school. Although this does need prove of some kind, I'm pretty sure if properly worded that would not be a legal problem.\n\nIt would also been seen as more fair by other employees. Giving out lump sums of money for reasons unrelated to the job seems unfair, while giving out benefits directly related to the *specific* needs of employees seems very friendly and helpful.\n\n> What steps would need to be taken to ensure that this process is compliant with the law?\n\nYou need to get a lawyer (and maybe a union representative if your industry is heavily unionized) and go through your plan item by item and check whether your company is allowed to have and process this information. And if your company is allowed to discriminate based on this information, even if they have it legally.\n\nAnd in the end, when you have your watertight legal plan, you have to ask yourself how you will attract talent, when you pay based on their needs. Why would a young, single, very educated person do overtime for you, when an undereducated, lazy slacker next desk earns double what they do. Not because they do a better job, but because they have a wife and three kids and have a mortgage on their house.\n\nSo it's legally a very costly endeavour. And it forms your company not as a company of talented hard workers, but of people who have the most liabilities. Because that is what you would be paying for."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following approaches would be the most legally compliant and practically effective way for a company to address employees' varying financial needs while avoiding discrimination issues?\n\nA) Ask employees to submit detailed lists of their yearly monetary needs, have management approve them, and set salaries accordingly.\n\nB) Implement a standardized salary structure based solely on job roles and performance metrics, ignoring any personal circumstances.\n\nC) Offer targeted benefits and allowances (e.g., extra paid leave for specific life events, transportation allowances) that address common needs without requiring disclosure of personal financial information.\n\nD) Pay all employees the same base salary regardless of position, but provide bonuses based on the number of dependents they have.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate approach based on the information provided. This method allows the company to address varying employee needs without directly asking for or basing salaries on personal financial information, which could raise GDPR and discrimination concerns. By offering specific benefits tied to common life events or needs (like extra leave for a child's first day of school or transportation allowances), the company can provide support in a more equitable and legally compliant manner.

Start the process of claiming your money back via the [Wisconsin small claims court](https://www.wicourts.gov/services/public/selfhelp/smallclaims.htm) (I think that this will cost in the order of $100 to $200\\). You don't need a lawyer to do this. The process is designed so that you can do it yourself.

You could score a default judgement against them if they don't show up, however recovering that money is a different process (which I have no idea about)\n\nHowever, if the contractor is doing this with no remorse, then it is likely that they have done it other people as well.

This is legal.\n\nThe only possible liability for a truthful and accurate disclosure of fact is a defamation action (in the absence of a privacy clause in the contract) and this is truthful so it would not violate anyone's legal rights. Credit reporting agencies routinely collect such information and court actions to collect unpaid debts are also a matter of public record. Credit reporting agencies in this business also have some additional obligations (such as the obligation to remove an entry after a period of time and an obligation to present rebuttal statements from the person affected).\n\nBut, you should understand that merely publicly sharing truthful information about a factual matter is not really what a \"[blacklist](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/blacklist)\" means. Normally, a blacklist includes an implied understanding that certain actions will be taken as a result of placement on the list rather than merely sharing information for what it is worth.\n\nAn example of a law prohibiting a true blacklist from Colorado is the following:\n\n> \u00a7 8\\-2\\-110\\.

The EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) may receive allegations of a violation, and there is a procedure for deciding on the merits of the case. After charges are filed, there is an investigation by the EEOC, which may include a public hearing. Based on the investigation, the commission may dismiss the charge (technical flaws in the complaint); they may issue a letter of determination to that effect if they find that there was no reasonable cause for the complaint. They can also encourage a negotiated settlement. In making this determination, the commission follows its own guidelines, as encoded in the regulations. So if the commission determines by its rules that there was a violation, the courts will generally [defer to that finding](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chevron_deference) unless the finding is contrary to what Congress said. If there is no dismissal or settlement, then they issue a determination that there is reasonable cause (\u00a71601\\.21\\).

It is clear from the way you word the questions you are still extremely emotionally invested in the whole scenario and want to make sure you get your pound of flesh at every turn. That is not going to work in this case.\n\nThe first thing you need to accept is that for the purposes of the plea withdrawl the judge does not care to hear about how the lawyer tricked you. If you go in on your own pleading that your lawyer did you dirty, the judge is just going to deny your request in the best case.\n\nYou will need a lawyer to prepare and argue the motion to withdraw your plea. Get a good lawyer they are worth their costs. Focus on the main goal of resolving your issue of the Criminal Trespass. How the police treated you or your Tenant took advantage of you does not excuse criminal behavior. So if the plea does get withdrawn focus on winning the criminal case.

Fast forward a couple months, I made the software a lot better, made sure the accuracy is good, and I thought maybe I could actually sell it to doctors (more specifically, GPs and family doctors).\n\nThe software is basically as follows: First, you take a picture of a skin lesion.

As a diagnostic device, it would be subject to regulation. [Here](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-98-282/) is the law: you need to understand and comply with that. \u00a710 requires you to\n\n> take reasonable measures to (a) identify the risks inherent in the\n>  device;(b) if the risks can be eliminated, eliminate them; (c) if the\n>  risks cannot be eliminated, (i) reduce the risks to the extent\n>  possible, (ii) provide for protection appropriate to those risks,\n>  including the provision of alarms, and (iii) provide, with the device,\n>  information relative to the risks that remain; and (d) minimize the\n>  hazard from potential failures during the projected useful life of the\n>  device.\n\nThere is an approval process, [here is a link](https://www.emergobyul.com/resources/canada-process-chart) (you need an account). One issue that you will have to sort out is the Class of the device, and [there is a long document](https://www.emergobyul.com/sites/default/files/file/ca_guidance-keyword-index-verify-class.pdf) on that. Let's say that you believe that the device is Class 2 (please note that your beliefs are not what matters, what matters is what the criteria are for class assignment). I chose Class 2 because that seems to be what software is. Then you read [this part of the law](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-98-282/page-3.html#h-1021513) and see that you have to apply for a license. There will be a review, you will need to satisfy the minister, and it is a completely non\\-trivial task to license a medical device. Anyhow, this is a starter on the license part.\n\nYou also need to study the law of liability, because you might easily get sued for millions of dollars in case something bad happens (or, someone alleges that something bad happened). Also, you need to study copyright law especially w.r.t. software licenses (assuming that you want to maintain any control over the software, but also want somebody to be able to use the software). There are some tax questions that will come up, basically if you make any money, expect to pay taxes.\n\nAnother approach would be to find a company that does this stuff and sell them the software. The sticky point for them will be that contracts generally cannot be enforced against a minor.

The documentation mentions that contracts generally cannot be enforced against a minor, but it doesn't state that parental consent is a legal requirement for selling the software.\n\nOption A is necessary as the software would be classified as a medical device and must meet Health Canada's requirements.\nOption B is explicitly mentioned in the regulations, requiring identification and mitigation of risks.\nOption C is required as medical devices, including software, need to be licensed in Canada.\n\nThe minor's age presents complications for selling the software, particularly regarding copyright transfer and contract enforcement, but parental consent is not listed as a specific legal requirement for the sale itself."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36694/do-directors-serving-at-the-pleasure-of-a-specific-class-of-investor-owe-fiducia", "docs_id": 36694, "title": "Do Directors serving at the pleasure of a specific class of investor owe fiduciary duties to other classes of investors?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a company has five directors.

That is, can they act in the best interests of\n>  the preferred stockholder without regard to the interests of the\n>  common stockholders.\n\nThe duties of directors of corporations are usually set out of the statutes of the jurisdiction where the corporation is organized, and in some jurisdictions, such as the State of Delaware, there is a very significant ability of corporate organizers to very the obligations of directors by agreement in articles of incorporation and bylaws.\n\nThis said, the overwhelming majority position would be that a director elected by a particular subset of shareholders would owe the same legal duties to the corporation as a director elected by all of the shareholders at large. In other words, they have a legal duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the corporation. Sometimes these duties are full fiduciary duties, and sometimes these duties established by statute include duties of care and duties of loyalty that are narrower than the fiduciary duties owed, for example, by a trustee to the beneficiaries of a trust.\n\nGenerally speaking, directors owe their duties primarily to the corporation as an entity overall, and not to the shareholders generally, or to any subset of shareholders. \n\nBut, there is case law that provides the owners or directors of a corporation who control the corporation are not allowed to take actions using their voting and control powers that \"oppress\" the minority owners of the corporation. These duties arise even at the shareholder levels, despite the fact that shareholders aren't normally seen as owing duties, fiduciary or otherwise, to anyone.\n\nFor example, suppose that a corporation is an S\\-corporation in which corporate income is taxable to shareholders whether or not dividends are paid, in which the majority shareholder has other assets from which taxes on the corporation income attributed to the majority shareholder can be paid, but the minority shareholders do not have other assets from which taxes on the corporation income attributed to them can be paid. \n\nCase law in many states has held to if the majority shareholder exercising either shareholder voting level rights or director level powers declines to distribute dividends in order to put pressure on the minority shareholders to sell out at a discount in this situation, that this constitutes official oppression by the majority controlling shareholder and violates the common law legal duties of the majority shareholder to the minority shareholders. The remedies available in these situations also varies considerably.\n\nOf course, as a practical matter, directors elected by a particular constituency are expected to be conscious of the particular needs of the people who put them in office and act accordingly, and this is rarely actionable. But, this is, in part, a function of the fact that the majority of corporations conduct all of their business with the unanimous consent of the directors on a day to day basis. Typically, voting disputes that divide directors into different camps happen only episodically in connection with major transactions like a takeover or leveraged buyout or proxy fight, not in the day to day conduct of the business of the corporation which is almost always left in the hands of senior management, in practice, if not always in legal formal terms."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A corporation has five directors, two appointed by common stockholders and three by preferred stockholders.

The information provided states that there is case law prohibiting controlling shareholders or directors from taking actions that \"oppress\" minority owners, even if they have voting control. Common stockholders, as minority shareholders in this scenario, could potentially bring legal action against the directors and preferred stockholders for oppressive conduct.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because directors owe duties to the corporation as a whole, not just to the shareholders who appointed them.

Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\))\n\nMost important though, the aspect of the design that the author seeks to protect via copyright must be separable from the utilitarian aspects of the article. You couldn't protect vertical sides, or a hard, crumble\\-based bottom. Even in a world where those elements were original (they probably aren't) they are utilitarian aspects, driven by function, and would not be protected by copyright. ([US Copyright Office: Useful Articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517093048/https://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl103.pdf))1\n\nTo the extent that these elements are separable from the ultilitarian purpose of the cake (I concede that this is almost the entire question), a particular choice of shape, color, decorations, graphics, etc. can protected by copyright as a \"pictorial, graphic, \\[or] sculptural work\". 17 USC 102(a)(5\\)\n\nThis test was most recently clarified in [Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-866_0971.pdf) 580 U.S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2017\\) (slip opinion):\n\n> A feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible\n> for copyright protection only if the feature (1\\) can be perceived as\n> a two\\- or three\\-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article,\n> and (2\\) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural\n> work\u2014either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium\n> of expression\u2014if it were imagined separately from the useful article\n> into which it is incorporated.\n\nCertain elements of cake design may have become *sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire*, stock elements commonly re\\-used by many authors in a given context (pillars, successive cylindrical layers, etc.). These elements would not be protected.\n\n---\n\n1\\.

This differs from federal law, which allows such sniffs without any particular standard. Reasonable suspicion is a lower threshold than probable cause, requiring only that a reasonable person could suspect from the facts that a crime may have or could be committed.

Not only that, they were also blackmailed into doing certain incriminating actions, such as e.g. transporting the corpse to a place, leaving it there, and being seen on CCTV footage leaving the area.\n\nNow, after the convict has been convicted, if the video of the blackmail, along with the blackmail material, is published, can this ever be good enough to exonerate the convict, given that the convict also retracts their confession after the release?\n\nIf such a release would be sufficient (which I assume it would be in certain cases), my question is then the following:\n\n*When would it be sufficient? How weak would the evidence that the convict committed the crime have to be for this release to be sufficient on its own?*\n\nIn certain cases, I guess the evidence could be strong enough that the release of the proof of blackmail wouldn't be good enough. Perhaps this is only true in cases where the evidence was sufficiently good that all confessions were superfluous to the proof of guilt?\n\nFurthermore, a question of what even constitutes as \"proof of blackmail\" arises. I am simply imagining a video of the blackmailer telling the convict that they have to do \"X\" in order for \"Y\" not to be released. And then this video is released in conjunction with Y. Furthermore, if Y is undeniable proof that the convict did something of a nature far more grave and criminal than the crime they confessed to, this makes it very unlikely that the whole ordeal is a tactic to exonerate the convict, given that it would only put the convict in more legal and social trouble than their original conviction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under U.S. law, this would not alone be sufficient, although sometimes with additional facts it could be.\n\nIn addition to showing that the confession was obtained through blackmail, the convicted defendant would also have to show that:\n\n* The evidence that the confession was obtained through blackmail to take action serious enough and with threats that were credible enough, that no other choice was available to the defendant and that duress would bar the charges, is sufficiently credible;\n* the confession would have changed the outcome of the case on guilt/innocence if the case had been fully tried (which can be particularly tricky if the defendant was guilty of something even if not the crime of conviction);\n* the blackmail was such that it deprived the convicted defendant of an opportunity to raise this issue in the court process and preserved as a legal issue (if the issue could have been raised in the original case, but was not raised, this is not a basis for setting aside the conviction, and proving this is likely to be the hardest issue in the case);\n* the time limits for bringing challenges to the conviction not based upon government misconduct or misconduct by his own lawyer have not expired;\n* it is possible to remedy the wrongful conviction now in a meaningful way (usually this is the case due to the collateral effects of a conviction even if the sentence has been served, but not always).\n\nI am deliberately omitting the exact legal standard of proof and duration of time for each of these points which is a highly technical area of the law.\n\nThe proceedings to set aside a wrongful conviction can also take a very long time. Five to twenty years after the conviction isn't uncommon. And, there is a fair amount of potential legal uncertainty, because most wrongful conviction cases involved alleged wrongdoing by the prosecution or alleged ineffective assistance of counsel by the defendant's lawyer.

There is generally a presumption that when both the feds and the states can legitimately regulate something, the feds weren't trying to preempt all state laws on the topic. While people often say \"federal law takes precedence over state law,\" the normal rule is that *both* laws apply; the federal law only blocks the state law if the feds *wanted* to block said state laws.

Pick\\-pocketing someone's wallet will often get you their driver's license but it will rarely get their wallet *and* their recent utility bill. Successfully intercepting a utility bill won't get you their driver's license.

A little later I got an automated email with a picture of the building entrance, and detailed instructions about check\\-in procedure.\n\nI arrived in Oslo late on December 2nd, went to the address of the apartment and verified that the entrance was the same as in the picture I had previously received in the check\\-in instructions.\n\nAccording to the instructions, there was a key\\-box near the entrance. I found this, but the code that was supplied did not work. At the time it was minus 15\u00b0C outside, so I thought maybe the key\\-box was frozen.\n\nI was unsure what to do at this point, but I ended up ringing the doorbell to the apartment that I was supposed to stay in. After a while, a person came out. He informed me that these apartments were no longer rented out, and that he had been living there for the last half year. He let me inside the entrance, so that I could stay inside while calling the support number in the booking confirmation.\n\nI called the support number and reached a person on the other end, this was apparently at a support center. In the beginning he did not know what I was talking about, but after explaining for a while, he did recall that they had previously been handling support for this address. He informed me that whomever was renting out the apartments were no longer in business, and he could not help me find any place to stay.\n\nSince I had nowhere to stay, and it was minus 15\u00b0C outside I simply had find somewhere else. I searched the nearby area and luckily there was a Scandic nearby and they had a room available.\n\nThe next day, I went to the hotels.com support website. There was no email listed, but I found a phone number. After waiting for a while I got through to another person. I had a hard time understanding what the support person was saying, but managed to communicate the situation. My confirmed booking was found and I was told a refund would be in place within 10 days.\n\nFast forward 13 days, and nothing has happened. So I call support again, this time there is person on the other end that I can more easily understand. I explain the situation. He gathers my booking references and so on, then works for a long while. Eventually finding out that the previous call was logged, but there was no other information available. He informs me that, before a refund is given, they have to figure out what happened. I ask him if he can see that my booking was confirmed and that they received payment, to which he confirms. I ask him when I can expect a refund. His reply is pretty vague, but I understand it will be a few days at least. Next I ask to get a confirmation email from the current call stating that the situation has been registered. The email is received shortly after the call ends, it is in Swedish, but basically states that that the matter is under investigation (this also gives me a way to contact them back by email).\n\nFour days later I get a new email from support. I'm asked to describe the situation, what happened at check\\-in and provide details from where I ended up staying. I reply with the information as requested. The following day I get another mail stating that they are still waiting for a reply \"from the original business to business email address\".\n\nFast forward a month until mid\\-January: still nothing has happened.

The biggest challenge there is that you have to first contact the local police to get a hearing with the local Conciliation board. You might also sue the booking company in your own location (which would be easier), though depending on how you made the booking they might not be liable. On the third hand, the time between the complaint and now is relatively short and does not yet reach the level of being \"an unreasonable delay\". As for whether the cost would exceed.

Perhaps in certain states?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a police officer reviewed the footage and then went out and issued a citation in person to the offender, this could probably be used. Many states limit tickets issued by mail based upon camera evidence alone. But, while some state laws have specific requirements, but in general, authenticated video recordings are admissible evidence in court proceedings, and a citizen complaint can be a basis for initiating a traffic offense prosecution.\n\nTo prove some offenses, like speeding, dashcam evidence of a third\\-party may not be very good evidence, but for running a red light or a stop sign, it could be powerful evidence."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a U.S. jurisdiction, driver X captures video evidence of driver Y running a red light using a dashcam. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of this evidence for issuing a traffic violation to driver Y?\n\nA) The dashcam footage is automatically inadmissible in court due to privacy concerns.\n\nB) Law enforcement can immediately issue a ticket to driver Y based solely on the dashcam footage provided by driver X.\n\nC) The dashcam evidence can be used by a police officer to investigate and potentially issue a citation in person to driver Y.\n\nD) Dashcam footage from private citizens can only be used to prove a driver's innocence, not guilt.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While many states have limitations on issuing tickets by mail based on camera evidence alone, authenticated video recordings are generally admissible in court proceedings. A police officer could review the dashcam footage provided by driver X, use it as a basis for investigation, and then issue a citation in person to driver Y if deemed appropriate. This approach combines the use of third-party evidence with official law enforcement action, which is more likely to be permissible than automated ticketing based solely on the video. Options A and D are incorrect as they overgeneralize restrictions on dashcam evidence. Option B is also incorrect as it suggests immediate ticketing based only on the footage, which many jurisdictions do not allow."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78337/is-ikea-required-by-russian-law-to-pay-employees-for-the-next-3-months-despite", "docs_id": 78337, "title": "Is Ikea required by Russian law to pay employees for the next 3 months, despite suspending all operations (sales, production) in Russia?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Ikea [announced](https://www.reuters.com/business/ikea-temporarily-closes-its-stores-russia-halts-sourcing-russia-belarus-2022-03-03/) they'll still be paying their 15,000 Russian employees their salaries for the next 3 months, even though they've suspended all operations in Russia, sales and production (17 stores and 3 factories).\n\nI'm curious if them still paying employees for the next 3 months is required by Russian law, or if Ikea went over and above that requirement.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [legal requirement in Russia](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/5-503-4083?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)#co_anchor_a202414) is to pay or to continue to employ workers for two months following the notice of a layoff.\n\nThe three month period was probably chosen to put to rest questions about how to treat a mid\\-month announcement and any questions over the effective date of the notice which may have post\\-dated the *de facto* shutdown of operations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: IKEA announced the suspension of its operations in Russia and continued payment of salaries to its Russian employees for 3 months.

See [Section 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/28/section/3):\n\n> For the purposes of this Act, the expression \u201cprohibited place\u201d means ... any work of defence, arsenal, naval or air force establishment or station, factory, dockyard, mine, minefield, camp, ship, or aircraft belonging to or occupied by or on behalf of His Majesty ... \\[and there are other things that can be prohibited places, including places declared by order]\n\nTo be in violation of the Act, it is not enough to merely be in the area.

Importantly, Section 5 would create a new offence of \"unauthorized entry etc to a prohibited place,\" which would make it an offence to access a prohibited place without authorization while knowing (or while one reasonably should have known) that the access was unauthorized.

There is a set of \"reserved legal activities\" under the [Legal Services Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Services_Act_2007) which require a person to be authorized to engage in such an activity, but rendering stupid opinions about how the law works isn't one.

The Tenant Fee Act 2019 allows letting agents to charge up to \u00a350 for a \"variation, assignment or novation of a tenancy.\" A renewal typically involves the same tenants, while this case involves a change in the tenant composition, making it a variation rather than a straightforward renewal."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43825/copyright-notices-a-team-or-project-declared-as-copyright-holder", "docs_id": 43825, "title": "Copyright notices: a team or project declared as copyright holder", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes I see copyright notices like\n\n> Copyright \u00a9 2016\\-2018 The TokTok team.\n> \n> \n> Copyright \u00a9 2013 Tox project.\n\nI wonder if I can use similar copyright notices in a project of mine (licensed under GPL). The are some closely related questions: What defines a team? What happens if the team grows? Is some paperwork or registration necessary or the use of a version control system (VCS) makes it unnecessary? As you know, VCSs record the evolution of a project, the time and amount of contributions made by each developer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nIn US law the elements of a copyright notice are 1\\) the copyright symbol or the word \"copyright or the abbreviation \"copyr\"; 2\\) the year of publication or creation; and 3\\) the name of the copyright owner. More specifically, under [17 USC 401 (b)(3\\)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html) the third element should be:\n\n> (3\\) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner\n\nAs a \"team\" is not generally a legal entity (unless it is incorporated) it cannot be the actual owner of the copyright. The owner in such cases will usually be the company for which the members of the team work, or possibly the individual members of the team as co\\-owners. Or some other entity may hold the copyright. The name of the team may serve as \"a generally known alternative designation of the owner\".\n\nMoreover, even if the name shown is simply wrong, 17 USC 406 (Copyright notice: error in name or date) provides in pertinent part:\n\n> ... where the person named in the copyright notice on copies or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner is not the owner of copyright, the validity and ownership of the copyright are **not affected**. In such a case, however, any person who innocently begins an undertaking that infringes the copyright has a complete defense to any action for such infringement if such person proves that he or she was misled by the notice and began the undertaking in good faith under a purported transfer or license from the person named therein \\[unless copyright office records would have disclosed the true owner].\n\nSo, such a notice opens up the possibility of someone purporting to grant licenses in the name of the \"team\". But unless this is a concern, the exact name used in the notice does not really matter. And if it is a concern, copyright registration, or recording the copyright with the US copyright office, will deal with the issue.\n\nNote that a copyright notice is optional for any unpublished work and for any work first published since 1989\\. (The effective date of the change in US copyright law to comply with the Berne Convention.) However the presence of a valid notice does offer some legal advantages to the copyright owner under US law.\n\nThe use of a VCS does not in any way affect the copyright status of a work, nor does it change the effect of a copyright notice or its absence. It might be evidence of the date of creation of a work, if that was challenged in an infringement suit, but that is not commonly an issue in such a suit.\n\nCopyright registration affords additional legal rights to the owner(s), and must indicate the actual name(s) of the copyright owner(s). Agreements to transfer copyright must be in writing, and signed (but could be electronic).\n\nIf the copyright is actually co\\-owned by the members of a team, it would be very wise of them to have a contract spelling out who does and who does not own a share of the copyright. Otherwise if they later disagree, and the matter comes to court, evidence of who actually was a co\\-author would be needed, and might be troublesome to produce. VCS records might be useful in such a case. If the copyright is in fact owned by a company, either on a work\\-made\\-for\\-hire basis or on an assignment basis, a contract between the company and all co\\-creators will be essential, or at least highly desirable, spelling this out in detail. But none of this affects any third party this is all important only between team members and any company involved.\n\nNote that this answer is enti8rely concerned with US law. While copyright law is broadly similar in most countries, the details vary."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to US copyright law, which of the following statements is true regarding copyright notices?\n\nA) A copyright notice must always include the exact legal name of the copyright owner to be valid.\n\nB) Using a team name in a copyright notice automatically grants copyright ownership to that team.\n\nC) The use of a version control system (VCS) eliminates the need for a formal copyright notice.\n\nD) A copyright notice using a team name may be valid, even if the team is not the legal owner of the copyright.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to US copyright law, specifically 17 USC 401 (b)(3), the name in a copyright notice can be \"a generally known alternative designation of the owner.\" This means that using a team name in a copyright notice can be valid, even if the team itself is not the legal owner of the copyright. The law allows for flexibility in naming, as long as it serves to identify the copyright owner in some way.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not require the exact legal name of the copyright owner in the notice. \n\nOption B is false because using a team name in a copyright notice does not automatically grant ownership to the team. Copyright ownership is determined by authorship or legal agreements, not by the notice itself.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a VCS, while potentially useful for tracking contributions, does not replace the legal function of a copyright notice and does not affect the copyright status of a work."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15840/would-an-automatic-download-for-lgpl-libraries-be-permittable-under-lgplv3", "docs_id": 15840, "title": "Would an automatic download for LGPL libraries be permittable under LGPLv3?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *Disclaimer*: I am not a native English speaker NOR am I versed in the law beyond the basics you learn in highschool\\-/uni\\-courses.\n\n---\n\nI am writing a software which uses LGPL licensed libraries.

You can redistribute binaries without the sources and the sources without the binaries. In all versions of the LGPL, you need to eventually redistribute the corresponding source code if you only redistribute the binaries. The GPL 3\\.0 [section 6](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section6) explains how you can handle the redistribution of the corresponding source code when you redistribute a binary (and this is in the GPL and not the LGPL 3\\.0 text, the former being incorporated by reference in the LGPL 3\\.0 text) and there are at least six different ways.\n\n> > b) ship my software without the libraries and tell the user to get them themselves\n\nThis is not correct.

Furthermore, if you are for instance using a programming language that compiles to native code such as C/C\\+\\+ and are dynamically linking with the LGPL\\-licensed library, you are de facto incorporating [header includes](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html#section2) in your own binary which makes the separate user installation of the library a rather moot point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating an application that uses LGPL-licensed libraries.

One side would argue that the other party owes them money; the other side would dispute the claim. In general, a person does it have the right to damage another person's property, so if B damaged your property, you *might* have a valid claim. The advantage of small claims court is that it's quicker and cheaper. However, one may need to hire an attorney anyhow, in order to correctly present your claim that B should be made to pay.\n\nIf you can prove that B maliciously kicked your backpack in order to cause you damage, the matter will probably be resolved easily in your favor. More likely, this was an accident (that was what you thought), so now the question is whether this was negligence on their part, or on your part. B's negligence could have been in not using ordinary care when walking, your negligence would be in putting the backpack in the walkway. The judge would listen to your explanation of the surrounding facts, and then lay blame. In Wisconsin, the judge would compare the contribution of the two parties and come up with a percentage. In this situation, B would not have a basis for counter\\-suing you, which simplifies the matter a bit. If you more than 50% responsible for the damage, you cannot recover from B. If you are found to be e.g. 49% responsible and the defendant is 51%, then he is liable for 51% of the damage that you have suffered.\n\nIf you consult with an attorney, they can give you a good estimate of the likelihood that you'll lose on the grounds that your negligence was greater than B's."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a small claims court case in Wisconsin involving damage to personal property, under what circumstances would the plaintiff be unable to recover damages from the defendant?\n\nA) If the plaintiff is found to be exactly 50% responsible for the damage\nB) If the plaintiff is found to be more than 50% responsible for the damage\nC) If the defendant is found to be more than 50% responsible for the damage\nD) If both parties are found to be equally responsible for the damage\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Wisconsin law, as described in the documentation, the judge would compare the contribution of both parties and assign a percentage of responsibility. If the plaintiff (the person filing the claim) is found to be more than 50% responsible for the damage, they cannot recover damages from the defendant. This is known as contributory negligence. \n\nOption A is incorrect because at exactly 50% responsibility, the plaintiff could still potentially recover some damages. \nOption C is incorrect because if the defendant is more than 50% responsible, the plaintiff would be able to recover damages proportional to the defendant's responsibility. \nOption D is incorrect because equal responsibility would imply 50% each, which doesn't meet the \"more than 50%\" threshold for the plaintiff to be unable to recover damages."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88774/can-mythological-names-be-trademarked-and-become-associated-with-an-entity-eg", "docs_id": 88774, "title": "Can mythological names be trademarked and become associated with an entity (eg. a company)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can the names of creatures, deities (gods), locations, etc. be trademarked and become associated with a specific entity (so it receives protection against dilution)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.

Names of mythological figures, creatures, or locations can indeed be trademarked for specific uses or industries. This is evidenced by the fact that Lamborghini has previously filed a trademark for \"Deimos,\" likely for a future car model. However, trademarks are generally limited to particular classes of goods or services.
