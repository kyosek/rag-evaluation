While here I created an app at the request of the department head to be distributed by the institution. This program is unrelated to the work I agreed to come on board to take part in, though it does concern a project that they have been working on for many years. \nThis institution is now requesting I recognize that the copyright belongs to them. I did not use any of their resources to create it, was not compensated for it and designed and built the program with little input. I don't mind giving them the technology, but am worried that I won't be recognized as its creator, and that the copyright can be used to claim ownership rights to my future projects, since I frequently recycle code that I've written. On the other hand, I need a reference and don't want to strain any relationships. Any thoughts on how to proceed is welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are an employee hired to program, your employer holds the copyright, as a \"work for hire\". So the main questions are, are you an employee, and is this work done in the scope of your employment? The fact that you did not receive a salary isn't entirely dispositive \u2013 I take it this was some sort of internship, where you receive academic credit. Under that premise, they might argue that you were an employee (but they might lose that argument in court). The other issue, whether this was done \"on the job\" versus \"during the time period when you had an affiliation\" is not something that can be judged from a legal perspective. They will have a certain position about what you were doing, which you may or may not agree with, so it depends on how compelling your argument is vs. their argument that it was work\\-related. Since the scope of one's \"employment\" is not narrowly defined by some initial agreement (it can change), the fact that you did this \"at the request of the department head to be distributed by the institution\" indicates that it wasn't something unrelated to the job, which you did as a hobby. So on the face of it, it looks that this is indeed within the scope of the job.\n\nThere is a separate and distinct possibility, that one of the forms you signed actually signed away your rights (which would moot the question about you benig an employee). It is not at all uncommon for affiliation agreements (intern, employee, adjunct member, independent contractor) to include a clause assigning the institution the rights to your IP.\n\nYou are correct that there is a potential for them to interfere with future programming projects of yours. If they in fact own the source code, then they own all of the sub\\-bits of the code. Copyright protects the means of expression, but not the underlying facts. What is unknown (in law) is where that dividing line is software. It would not overcome copyright protection to simply replace all of the variable names (e.g. \"item\\_count\" \u2192 \"count\\_of\\_items\"), and cosmetically reorganizing code a also doesn't get rid of copyright protection. However, variable names and structure of code often (ideally?) follows from the nature of what the program does, so necessarily (to take an example), all bubble sort programs resemble all other bubble sort programs to the point that one might accuse an author of infringement. It's an interesting and not clearly answered question, how similar two functionally identical pieces of code can be without there being infringement.\n\nAgain, since copyright protects expression and not ideas, if in the course of writing a program you discover a clever algorithm for doing something (rather than dividing by the nth power of 2, shift right n), that knowledge is not protected by copyright, and it is to be expected that if you learn how to solve a problem once, you can re\\-invent the solution again (and it will strongly resemble the earlier solution). This murky copyright situation means that writing any new code in a somewhat overlapping area is a bit risky, since there is a high probability that any new code would have the level of substantial similarity that constitutes evidence of infringement.\n\nThere is no reliable way to find out whether they would succeed in an infringement suit, other than to get sued and see what happens.

The institution claims copyright ownership. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The researcher automatically owns the copyright because they were unpaid and used their own resources to create the app.\n\nB) The institution likely has a strong claim to copyright ownership due to the app being created at the department head's request and for institutional distribution.\n\nC) Copyright ownership depends solely on whether the researcher signed any forms assigning their intellectual property rights to the institution.\n\nD) The researcher can freely use the code in future projects without concern, as long as they change variable names and reorganize the code structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. Even though the researcher was unpaid and used their own resources, the fact that the app was created at the request of the department head and intended for institutional distribution suggests it falls within the scope of their work for the institution. This scenario closely aligns with the \"work for hire\" doctrine, giving the institution a strong claim to copyright ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because payment and use of personal resources are not the sole determining factors for copyright ownership in this context.\n\nOption C is partially true but oversimplified. While signing forms could indeed assign rights, it's not the only factor; the nature of the work and the relationship between the parties also play crucial roles.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially risky.

Generally, criminal defendants are tried and sentenced under the law as it existed at the time the alleged crime was committed. This principle, known as \"ex post facto,\" protects individuals from being punished retroactively by new laws. In this case, the trial should continue, and if the defendant is found guilty, they should be sentenced under the old law that was in effect when the alleged embezzlement occurred. This ensures fairness and upholds the principle that individuals should have notice of what constitutes criminal behavior and its consequences at the time of their actions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because restarting the trial under the new law would violate ex post facto principles. Option B is also wrong as it would unfairly apply a harsher penalty retroactively.

I.e. maybe there are regulations/laws that won't let any sane copyright holder to do so (e.g. AFAIK bank cards are the bank's property meaning the rights for the artwork should be granted to bank and not by me)? And in general, is it even possible to get a personal clearance from a copyright holder for one single artwork?\n\nps: the bank is an Estonian branch of a Swedish one.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it's worth it is purely up to you. But chances are you won't be dealing with the bank; the bank will have to deal with the producers and art directors of the film, and vice versa, and you will be out of the loop. You will need to convince all parties to work together and reach a business licensing agreement to allow you to have a custom bank/credit card.\n\nYou will need to find the producers of the film and ask them if they will license the artwork to the bank; they won't be licensing the artwork to you. And they probably won't like your adaptation of the artwork, so they will want to do their own artwork and design suite. If that happens, they will need to sign a deal with the bank system. And there will be money involved; I can't see the artist licensing their artwork for free to another business, so the bank will need to decide if it is worth it to get more customers to open card accounts.\n\nIt's worth a try; sometimes it is possible to get a one\\-off personal clearance from a copyright holder for a single license of artwork. It's possible you could get a letter from the artist/producer to take to the bank, drafted by their lawyer, releasing the bank system from any copyright infringement with the artwork for the single card.\n\nMaybe it will give the producers of animated films the idea that they should license their artwork for checks and bank/credit cards. i.e., [http://wowjapan.asia/2015/12/anime\\-visa\\-gets\\-three\\-official\\-attack\\-titan\\-credit\\-card\\-designs/](http://wowjapan.asia/2015/12/anime-visa-gets-three-official-attack-titan-credit-card-designs/) Or at least you might get a nice email from the film producers turning you down.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer wants to use artwork from the movie \"My Neighbour Totoro\" on their custom bank card.

According to the documentation, the bank would need to deal directly with the producers and art directors of the film to reach a business licensing agreement. The customer cannot obtain the license themselves, as the bank cards are the bank's property. The bank would need to decide if it's worth pursuing such an agreement, which would likely involve financial compensation to the copyright holders. Options A and C are incorrect because the customer cannot bypass the bank or use the artwork without proper licensing.

It must be a single and \\[exclusive] possession, though there can be a single possession exercised on behalf of several persons jointly. Thus an owner of land and a person intruding on that land without his consent cannot both be in possession of the land at the same time. The question what acts constitute a sufficient degree of exclusive physical control must depend on the circumstances, in particular the nature of the land and the manner in which land of that nature is commonly used or enjoyed \u2026 Everything must depend on the particular circumstances, but broadly, I think what must be shown as constituting factual possession is that the alleged possessor has been dealing with the land in question as an occupying owner might have been expected to deal with it and that no one else has done so.

It is tricky because every country can make its own rules that apply when you are in that country or do business in that country. Even within the EU, there is no uniform approach because *freedom of movement* merely covers the right to work in a country, but not the rules which have to be followed when doing so. Thus, you have to fall back to reading each individual country's rules and legislation.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Whether you are even allowed to work or which work activities are permitted depends on your visa or visa\\-free status. If you are a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you can come to and work in every EEA country, until the end of the Brexit transition period, subject to the same rules as residents in that country.\n\nOften, visa\\-free visits or business visa allow some business activities such as attending meetings with clients or collecting information, but not performing actual work. If you're interested in what business activities the UK allows visitors from other countries to do, take a look at the [visitor rules](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor-rules).\n* Income tax may be due at the place of tax residency or where the income is generated/earned, in particular where you actually perform the work. There is a widespread belief that you only gain tax residency after staying in one country for 6 months, but this is misleading in the general case: every country makes its own rules, and income tax may be due even without (permanent) tax residency.\n\nThe relevant countries (the country where you work and the country where you normally reside) might have a tax agreement that specifies where tax is due. Within the EU, it is fairly common that a person works in a different country than the one they reside in, so there is a well\\-developed network of tax treaties. Often, certain activities are exempt from local taxes, such as compensation for visiting researchers or regular employment.\n\nThere's also a good chance that profit from independent work / business profits are only taxable at the place(s) where that enterprise has a permanent establishment \u2013 but it depends on the details.\n\nThis section is based on the OECD model tax treaty ([https://doi.org/10\\.1787/mtc\\_cond\\-2017\\-en](https://doi.org/10.1787/mtc_cond-2017-en)) which most treaties follow closely. If no tax treaty exists that exempts your income from local taxation, you must consult the local tax laws.\n* VAT rules are entirely different, and for B2B services are generally taxed at the location of the client (place of supply rules). But every country makes its own rules. Exception: within the EEA, cross\\-border B2B supply is always taxed at and by the client via the reverse\\-charge mechanism.\n\nSo things can get quite tricky, and a business visitor should inform themselves beforehand what activities they are allowed to perform abroad and whether there are tax implications.\n\n> is it any different from a UK author going travelling, taking lots and lots of notes, or even writing his/her next novel whilst in various locations, and publishing once returned to the UK?\n\nHere no tax implications arise because the travelling author is not paid during their travels, but they have to consider visa rules when performing their work. Such rules often have exemptions for artists. However, it depends on the rules of the travelled country.\n\n> what basis does a government have for deciding \"where\" work was done?\n\nEach country is sovereign and can make its own rules.\n\n> How would that apply if a team of software developers had a virtual \"pair programming\" session, with one in USA, one in UK, and one in the Far East ? \"Where\" has that software been written?\n\nIt is not generally relevant where software was written, aside from copyright or export regulation issues which might have their own rules. Since each of the three programmers is working in their own country, no particular visa or income tax issues arise. However, if they have a common employer, the employer does have to consider the local employment laws regardless of where the employer is established, which may include paying some taxes in every country.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based software consultant is planning to work remotely while traveling through various European countries for 3 months.

The documentation emphasizes that each country has its own rules regarding work permissions and tax obligations for visitors. Some countries may allow certain business activities (like attending meetings) without a specific work visa, while others may have stricter requirements. Additionally, tax implications can vary based on the nature of the work, duration of stay, and existing tax treaties between countries. The 6-month rule for tax residency mentioned in option D is described as misleading in the general case.

SAo google has no copyright on the resulting translation. But copyright protection is only available for \"original works of authorship\". (See [17 USC 102](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) in the US, and similar laws elsewhere.) A machine\\-produced translation is not an original work, and it is surely not then work of the author of the overall book.\n\nHowever, the author would still have a copyright on the book **as a whole**. The legal situation is no different than if the author had simply quoted a 19th century work. One may incorporate public domain works into a later work, and that later work is still protected by copyright, provided that there is enough original contentr to make the work as a whole \"an original work of authorship\". Others may use the PD \\[arts, or the original from which they are taken, but not the rest of the work (beyond what fair use would allow in any case).\n\nFor example, I have made a number of posts here on LAW.SE. In several,of those I quoted sections from one of the numbers of *The Federalist*. That 19th century work is in the public domain. Anyone else may re\\-quote the passages I quoted from it. But that gives them no rights to use the rest of my work, except as the CC\\-BY\\-SA license or fair use permits.\n\nSo the author would retain copyright on the book as a whole.

Any processing of personal data is covered.\n\nThere is a GDPR exception when the processing is done for *purely personal or household purposes*. In particular, ordinary social media use is explicitly covered by this exception. But case law (such as the CJEU *Lindqvist* case) suggests that this word \u201cpurely\u201d requires a narrow interpretation of this exception \u2013 it is likely that your survey wouldn't be exempt, and would then have to comply with GDPR rules. In particular, the survey would involve data from an indeterminate number of data subjects to which you have no prior personal relationship, suggesting that you aren't running the survey for purely personal or household purposes.\n\nOther potential arguments why GDPR might not apply, and why they don't hold in your case:\n\n* *Lack of material scope \u2013 no relevant means of processing*: GDPR only applies when the processing of personal data is done using electronic means, or when the data is intended to be incorporated into a filing system.\n\nBut here you propose to use an online survey, which definitely involves electronic means.\n\nAs an example of a survey method that *might* be GDPR\\-exempt, consider in\\-person or telephone interviews where answers are not recorded individually but are immediately aggregated on a tally sheet. This might sidestep issues of creating a filing system.\n* *Lack of material scope \u2013 no personal data*: GDPR only applies if the processing activities involve personal data. Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, where identification also includes indirect identification with the help of additional information and third parties, or just being able to single out one data subject's records. If there are no reasonable means that could likely lead to identification, the data is truly anonymous and GDPR wouldn't apply. Aggregate statistics are often anonymous.\n\nBut while the results of your survey might not be covered by GDPR, the individual survey responses would definitely be personal data. Conducting the survey involves processing these responses, so that these activities would be covered by GDPR.\n* *Lack of territorial scope*: GDPR only applies (1\\) if the processing activities are performed in the context of an EU/EEA/UK establishment, or (2\\) if the processing relates to the offering of goods or services or monitoring of behaviour of people who are in the EU/EEA/UK.\n\nBut since you live in the EU, criterion (1\\) is fulfilled and GDPR applies.

But in any case, C finds out and objects. **Can C withdraw any of the consents B gave, or is he bound by B's acts so far? Must A re\\-request any consents?**\n2. B sells to C, and subsequently, A raises an unforeseen/unexpected expense allocation dispute. B may have incurred or defrayed the expense, or perhaps some of the inconvenience was suffered by B and some by C. **In either case, the Act only seems to contemplate the current owner/occupier C, being able to engage in the surveyor dispute resolution process. What happens?**\n3. The works are complex and undertaken in stages. Once commenced, they must be completed, but a description of the work for which consent will be requested at stage 2 or 3 cannot be known until stage 1 is complete, which will potentially take more than 12 months. Immediately after being told about the works and serving a consent notice, B (without telling A of this) sells to C, disclosing the stage 1 works and consent notices. A has in writing that B understood there would be further works beyond the original consented party wall notice for stage 1, but these were likely to take place outside the time limit for current consent. Meanwhile C wishes to argue that this constitutes a mere acknowledgement by B of A's future intent, and B clearly did not give PW Act consent to stage 2 or 3, and nor will C. Further the property is safe structurally so \"necessity\" doesn't apply. **Who wins? If C, then how can any owner safeguard himself from that situation? What should A have done if the works might have been of uncertain nature or duration, in his original notice to B?**\n4. A and B, as friends, decide that, as not sending irksome legalistic notices back and forth isn't a breach of the Act or an Offence, they will amicably agree A will do the works on a verbal agreement, and keep B apprised. In return for B's agreement and support, permission to enter B's garden through the side gate as needed, and generally making it easier to do the works, A will in turn undertake the works in a way that costs a bit more but is beneficial to B. In law, this would seem to be valid and also a contract, This works well until B dies and C becomes the owner. C is able to verify from numerous local families, and from emails A produces, that such an agreement did exist in the terms stated. **Is C bound by B's agreement, and can A enforce all, some or none of it, or indeed continue the works, from that point onward?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do the consents and notices stay with the original neighbouring owner, or stay with the property (hence move to the new one)?\n\nConsents remain valid\n\n> How would courts handle the fallout from a midway change of neighbours in practice, given the Act doesn't say a thing on the topic?\n\nIn accordance with the Act.\n\n> How far if at all, is a new owner bound by the consent of a prior owner\n\n100%\n\n1.

H serves proper notice to the neighbor (N1) for Stage 1, which N1 consents to. The notice mentions future stages but doesn't provide specific details. One month into the project, N1 sells the property to N2 without informing H. N2 discovers the ongoing work and objects to any future stages. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) H must halt all work immediately and re-serve notices to N2 for all stages of the project.\n\nB) N2 is bound by N1's consent for Stage 1, but H must serve new notices for future stages and obtain N2's consent.\n\nC) N2 is fully bound by N1's implied consent for all stages, and H can continue work without serving new notices.\n\nD) H can continue work on all stages based on N1's original consent, as it runs with the property regardless of ownership changes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, consents remain valid and the new owner (N2) is 100% bound by the prior owner's consent. This means that N2 cannot withdraw the consent given by N1 for Stage 1. However, the original notice only covered Stage 1 explicitly, with future stages mentioned but not detailed. Since an agreement to agree on future work is not a binding contract, H must serve new notices and obtain consent from N2 for the subsequent stages of the project.

This includes income from self-employment, which applies to John's situation. Bitcoin is treated as property by the IRS and is subject to taxation. The fact that John hasn't registered his business does not exempt him from tax obligations. Self-employment tax rules apply to all income, and failing to report income to the IRS is illegal.

Building anything on common HOA property without HOA permission probably violates the HOA governing documents. The HOA could probably fine you or enjoin you from doing so. If you had followed the HOA process to build something, it would probably have imposed requirements upon who could do the work. This said, if it is a limited common element serving one unit, rather than a general common element serving all units, the HOA might be more tolerant.\n2. But, frequently there is a statute of limitations that is fairly short to complain about building a structure without permission or without a proper permit.\n3. Not all construction work requires building permits or contractor's licenses. A simple patio or deck might not require one. Typically, a local government enacts a version of the Uniform Building Code and you'd have to check municipal ordinances.\n4. Building permits are usually administered by local government, rather than state government officials.\n5. A local government that becomes aware of a structure that required a permit but was built without one, when the statute of limitations has run on insisting that it be destroyed, might still deny further permits for the relevant property until the non\\-conforming structure is removed.\n\nThe legal analysis would depend to some extent on how the issue presented itself.

The appropriate severity of professional discipline for particular kinds of conduct is largely a matter of case law and separate law provides for the procedural framework for administering the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Rules themselves specifically disavow the task of decided what kind if professional discipline is appropriate for any particular kind of conduct of an attorney.\n\nPersonal ethics and behavior are governed primarily by rules 8\\.02 (defamatory speech about judges and other legal officials), and 8\\.04 (various kinds of misconduct including personal misconduct), although there are some stray bits that can come up in connection with other rules.\n\nRule 1\\.08 involves improper conduct in transactions with clients that do not pertain to the matter in which the client is represented (e.g. unfair business deals with clients). Texas is among a minority of states that does not automatically treat having sex with client that commences only after the attorney\\-client relationship is formed as a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 8\\.04 is sometimes called the \"officer and a gentleman\" clause of attorney professional ethics after an analogous provision, [Article 113](https://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/digest/IIIA59.htm), of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to members of the United States armed forces. It is a residual misconduct provision that covers lots of misconduct in a lawyer's personal affairs that isn't otherwise regulated by the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 8,04 and its official comments are as follows:\n\n> Rule 8\\.04\\.

The\n> same is true of abuse of positions of private trust.\n\nWith respect to the portion of the question asking:\n\n> What personal kinds of personal misconduct might result in such\n> penalties?\n\nSome of the most serious violations of the rules that are likely to lead to disbarment include misappropriation of client property, abandonment of a legal practice with active clients, revealing highly prejudicial client confidences with no color of justification for doing so, committing a crime involving fraud or a felony, or failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.\n\nOf those, committing of a crime involving fraud or a felony would be the one most likely to result in disbarment that involves *personal conduct*, as opposed to professional conduct. Other kinds of personal conduct might result in a lesser sanction, however, as noted in Rule 8\\.4\\. Of course, it isn't all that hard to imagine some circumstance \"involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\" (think \"[George Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos)\" absent any criminal conduct) that isn't strictly speaking a crime, or \"conduct constituting obstruction of justice\" in a matter unrelated to client matters (e.g. obstructing an investigation of a family member of the lawyer in connection with an academic institution's investigation) that could rise to this level as well.\n\nBut, again, the matching of punishment to particular conduct is rooted in case law. Also, a pattern of various kinds of misconduct or repeat offenses are often treatment more seriously than a single instance of misconduct by a first offender would be in isolation.\n\nIncidentally, every U.S. jurisdiction has a set of Rules of Professional Conduct with the same numbering system, although the substantive content of different states' rules with the same number is not always the same.\n\nSo, for example, Rule 8\\.4 covers the same subject\\-matter in every U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and every other U.S. territory, even though there may be important substantive differences between the versions of Rule 8\\.4 adopted in different states.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Attorney Jones, a member of the Texas Bar, is facing potential disciplinary action for personal conduct.

According to 17 U.S.C. 102(b) of U.S. copyright law, copyright protection does not extend to ideas, concepts, or information contained in a work, but rather to the specific expression of those ideas. Therefore, reproducing an article in a paraphrased form without copying the exact wording is generally legal, as long as the expression is substantially different. \n\nOption A is incorrect because paraphrasing or summarizing without copying exact wording is generally allowed.

A court might need to balance the literal interpretation of the ordinance against its intended purpose and practical considerations.\n\nThis question demonstrates how the purposive approach can lead to nuanced interpretations that may not always align with a strictly literal reading of the law, and how it requires consideration of the legislature's intent in relation to specific scenarios."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58761/in-florida-can-a-home-defense-weapon-and-use-of-castle-doctrine-deadly-force", "docs_id": 58761, "title": "In Florida, can a home defense weapon and use of &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; (deadly force) transfer to a house of a friend that I visit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I am entitled to use a weapon for home defense in the state of Florida. If I visit a friend for say 1 week, would the Castle Doctrine apply if an uninvited intruder entered the house of my friend and threatened my life (or the life of my friend), even though it is not my normal place of dwelling? Specifically, I am asking if the Castle Doctrine applies ONLY to your main places of dwelling such as the persons car and house, or if it can extended to a friends house you are visiting (and sleeping at). The friends house is also in Florida.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally, yes. Castle doctrine generally applies to anyone who is not trespassing on the property, not just the property owner. So long as you have permission from the property owner to be there, you can invoke Castle Doctrine.\n\nIt should be noted that Castle Doctrine is not a law, but rather a legal theory of a narrow self\\-defense claim. In general, Self\\-Defense in the United States breaks down to \"Duty to Flee\" vs. \"Stand Your Ground\" with the latter being much more common in the U.S. while all 50 states have Castle Doctrine in a private space (three do not have it codified but rely on state laws). Castle Doctrine simply means you have a legal right to \"stand your ground\" on your own private property regardless of the state's \"Duty to Flee\" stance in public spaces.\n\nFlorida is a \"Stand Your Ground\" state for purposes of self\\-defense, which means that, so long as you have a legal right to be in a space, you have the right to use deadly force in self\\-defense even if you can retreat from the situation. And it's not something Floridians are shy about either. The concept of the \"Stand your Ground\" vs. \"Duty to Retreat\" entered into public debate a few years back during the Zimmerman case, where it was used successfully for Zimmerman to be found not guilty of murder of a teenage African American boy.\n\nAs a personal annecdote I like to tell, when I live in Florida, my boss walked into work the other day and was discussing his recent purchase of a gun and how, when asked by the police what the purpose of his gun purchase was, he answered to defend his home. The cop took him aside and said, \"Just so you know, if you ever have to use that gun to defend your home, you need to know how to do it properly... Shoot to kill.

As long as a person has permission from the property owner to be there, they can invoke the Castle Doctrine if threatened by an intruder. Florida is also a \"Stand Your Ground\" state, which means that if you have a legal right to be in a space, you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense even if retreat is possible. Therefore, a person staying at a friend's house with permission can legally invoke the Castle Doctrine if threatened by an intruder, regardless of the duration of their stay."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15556/is-scraping-real-estate-data-illegal-in-anyway", "docs_id": 15556, "title": "Is scraping real estate data illegal in anyway?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So a relative of mine works in the real estate business and she wants me to write a Python script that scrapes property prices and lot size from a website, calculate price per sqft, and email her the address and property price if the ppsqft is less than 200 dollars..

Web scraping without permission often violates copyright laws, regardless of whether the data is publicly accessible. Additionally, bypassing a website's anti-scraping measures (like changing the User-Agent) may violate the site's terms of service, which is a legal contract accepted upon accessing the site. The fact that the data is freely available to human users does not automatically make it legal for automated scraping. It's important to review the website's terms of service and potentially seek permission or licensing for such activities to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards."}}
