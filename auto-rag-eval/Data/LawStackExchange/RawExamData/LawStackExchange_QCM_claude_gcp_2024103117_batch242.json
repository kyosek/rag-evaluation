What are those metrics?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nSort of.\n\nMost particular courts have a chief judge, a position that is paid slightly more than that of a usual judge for a huge additional burden of administrative work managing the court house (e.g. courtroom assignments, policies on implementing case assignments, overseeing the jury system, security measures, hiring court clerk's office and court building staff, reviewing court budgets, deciding whether to close the courthouse for weather or pandemics and the like, etc.).\n\nIn Colorado, there is a state appointed panel for each court that in connection with an outside private contractor evaluates judges periodically and prepares a report recommending or not recommending their retention in periodic retention elections, and there is a separate appointed panel that investigates allegations of judicial misconduct.\n\nIn many other states, some or all judges have to run for re\\-election when their terms end and the voters decide if they should stay in office. Sometimes judges in these states are nominated by the appropriate level of one of the major political parties.\n\nIn the federal courts, since judges serve for life and there is far less discretion to discipline them, Congress is the main supervisor in the sense of having the power to \"fire\" a judge.\n\nTrial court judge's substantive legal decisions are subject to review by courts with appellate authority over their court on a case by case basis. For courts of general jurisdiction, direct review of their cases on appeal is vested in an intermediate court of appeal in all but a few small states. For courts of limited jurisdiction that handle smaller civil disputes and/or misdemeanor criminal cases, direct appellate review is usually vested in the courts of general jurisdiction above it.\n\nIn each state, the state judiciary as a whole has at its pinnacle a highest court, usually called the state supreme court, although a few states call it something else.\n\nIt is the final court of review in the appellate process.\n\nIt also has the authority to intervene in particular judicial decisions that would not ordinarily be ripe to raise in an ordinary direct appeal (e.g. questions about whether allegedly attorney\\-client privileged or other privileged evidence must be disclosed), including the authority, in rare cases to order that a judge in a case that was appealed be removed from a case. The federal court system and some larger states vest this authority in intermediate appellate courts as well.\n\nState supreme courts also have general administrative authority over the judiciary as a whole. The state supreme court (primarily through the chief justice of the state supreme court) in its administrative capacity handles budget issues, formulates court rules, prepares annual reports on the judicial branch, lobbies for state funding, is responsible for auditing lower court finances, makes IT decisions for the state judiciary as a whole, and makes myriad other policy decisions, although it does not directly supervise judges in the way that a line manager in a government agency would supervise that manager's subordinates.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States judicial system, which of the following statements most accurately describes the role and oversight of judges?\n\nA) All judges are at the same job level and are directly supervised by the state governor.\n\nB) Federal judges serve for life and can only be removed by Congress, while state judges are typically subject to retention elections or re-elections.\n\nC) The chief judge of each court is responsible for all administrative duties, including hiring staff and managing budgets, but has no say in case assignments or courthouse policies.\n\nD) State supreme courts have no administrative authority over lower courts and only serve as the final appellate court for legal decisions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. Federal judges indeed serve for life and can only be removed by Congress through impeachment. State judges, on the other hand, are typically subject to retention elections or re-elections, depending on the state's system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because judges are not all at the same job level (there are chief judges with additional responsibilities), and they are not directly supervised by state governors.\n\nOption C is partially correct but ultimately incorrect. While chief judges do have administrative duties, including staff hiring and budget management, they are also responsible for case assignments and courthouse policies.\n\nOption D is incorrect because state supreme courts do have significant administrative authority over the judiciary as a whole, including budget issues, court rules, and policy decisions, in addition to serving as the final appellate court."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27824/is-there-any-advice-for-deciding-which-law-firm-should-i-go-with-a-case-about-lo", "docs_id": 27824, "title": "Is there any advice for deciding which law firm should I go with a case about losing money in stock investments", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I lost a lot of money investing a listed company which might have violated the law.

They might have an opinion.\n\nIn general, the quality of legal service you get really depends on how hard the lawyer works.

Indeed an entity must at least break even over the long term if it wants to survive and make surpluses if it wants to grow.

Common alternative legal bases include:\n\n* Art 6(1\\)(b) necessity for performing a contract to which the data subject is party\n* Art 6(1\\)(f) necessity for a legitimate interest\n\nIn your example, the online shop might have a legitimate interest in analytics, gauging interest in products, and managing inventory efficiently.\n\nA legitimate interest requires that you conduct a balancing test: does the legitimate interest outweigh the data subject's rights, interests, and freedoms? This also depends on the existing relationship between controller and data subject \u2013 can the data subject reasonably expect their data to be used in this way?\n\nIn this scenario (inventory management), only very little personal data is being processed: the interesting data is probably not *which customers* indicated interest in a product, but *how many customers* indicated interest. Aggregate statistics might not even be personal data, though calculating the statistic does involve processing of personal data and thus needs a legal basis. On the other hand, if this processing activity requires the creation of per\\-customer profiles (e.g. estimating how likely they are actually going to buy the product, based on their individual history) then it would be more difficult to argue that a legitimate interest outweighs the data subject's rights.\n\nWhen using data that was collected for one purpose and reusing the data for another purpose, you'll also have to perform a compatibility test per Art 6(4\\) GDPR. Similar to the legitimate interest balancing test this is very contextual. However, additional safeguards such as pseudonymization weigh in favour of compatibility.

Under GDPR, consent is not always required if another legal basis applies. In this case, the company might rely on legitimate interest (Art 6(1)(f)) for processing search data to improve inventory management. However, the company must conduct a balancing test to ensure their legitimate interest outweighs the data subject's rights and that the data subjects can reasonably expect this use of their data. Additionally, the company needs to perform a compatibility test (Art 6(4)) to ensure this secondary use is compatible with the original purpose of data collection. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because consent is not always necessary if another legal basis applies. \n\nAnswer C is overly broad; while pseudonymization can help in the balancing test, it doesn't allow unrestricted use of data. \n\nAnswer D is too restrictive; GDPR allows for compatible secondary uses of data, especially for statistical purposes, which this scenario could potentially fall under."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32857/does-gnu-fdl-1-3-restrict-the-copyright-holders-distribution-rights", "docs_id": 32857, "title": "Does GNU FDL 1.3 restrict the copyright holder&#39;s distribution rights?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm running into a ball of confusion between people on how exactly GFDL limits (or if it does or even can limit) the author's rights.\n\nIn our specific case, a copyright holder has provided work to us, licensed under the terms of [GNU FDL 1\\.3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html#section1).

Generally, most assume that when the content is simply hosted and not moderated by the web site then there is no liability for the provider.\n\nThat's not always the case and is determined by whether the host of the web site is considered a provider of interactive computer services or an information content provider.\n\nAny person responsible \"in whole or in part...for the creation or development of information\" is an information content provider.\n\nWhich are you?\n\nIn [Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/cases/fair-housing-council-san-fernando-valley-v-roommatescom), the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that roommates.com was not immune under Section 230 because they asked questions of their users that helped facilitate a potentially illegal search under the Fair Housing Act.

Text-only content can still be considered legally obscene, as demonstrated in the case of United States v. Frank Russell McCoy. The website owner's liability would depend on whether they are considered a provider of interactive computer services or an information content provider. If the owner is found to have aided in creating or developing the content, even partially, they could be held liable. Additionally, if the content is deemed obscene and prosecutable, the owner's level of involvement in facilitating its creation could be scrutinized.

Normally the users' free speech rights are protected through the Communications Decency Act, Anti\\-SLAPP statutes, first amendment, etc. all that.\n\nLately though, a entity's CEO/Owner filed a DMCA request against us and a very negative review about him and his school in particular, claiming copyright ownership over it. We can claim to be an ISP and gain those restrictions, but as the review is anonymous (we have the IP though), we have no way to contact the author. Furthermore, the DMCA request is clearly false/perjurious \\-\\- for several reasons.\n\n1. The CEO did not write such a scathing negative review of himself in the third person and then decide to submit it to us anonymously, only to request the takedown. Clearly he is not the copyright owner.\n2. The CEO has contacted (harassed) us many times (email and letters) concerning this and other reviews, claiming defamation, slander, trademark infringement, and anything else he could think of. Clearly the review is not his.\n3. We know his IP addresses and the IPs of his staff based upon the emails, of which other false (positive) reviews were submitted.\n4. The review authors grant us copyright to use their reviews, via a disclaimer on the survey itself.\n\nWe normally have a process for the review authors to remove their own reviews, which other reviewers use. We also have a process for entities to dispute the validity of reviews, which other entities use and have used successfully. But we generally reserve the right to decide if a review is valid via process, and this DMCA takedown is putting us into the awkward position of forcing us to choose between being an \"ISP\" or a \"content author/submitter\". If we choose not to play the ISP part in responding, then it seems that we open ourselves up to suit as a defamatory content author.\n\nBasically, can we preserve our DMCA\\- ISP \"immunity\" and still respond on behalf of the review author?\n\nEdit: I guess basically I am asking a sidestep question. What do we do when WE have the information that demonstrates that the content is non\\-infringing, and that the DMCA filer is plainly lying? Apart from signing an affidavit (and releasing his/her identity), the original author has no way to prove that he/she is the original author either. And it is really beside the point, since the entity is trying to get negative reviews removed, not protect a copyright of something they own. I mean, it is clear abuse of the system.\n\nEdit 2: Though my question is pointedly what I am dealing with, perhaps it should be revised to a more simple question. For instance, what do you do if you are an ISP who receives a DMCA for content YOU own, and YOU produced, and YOU exclusively hold the copyright for. Do you have to take down **your own content** until you send a counter notice, and record the counternotice to yourself? So upstream ISPs have forwarded the DMCA to you to handle (because you own all of the servers and power and colocation facility).\n\nThere's this built\\-in assumption in the DMCA which is that the one filing the takedown is actually the copyright holder, and all they have to do is sign a BS lying affidavit, certifying that they believe it to be theirs, which carries very little consequence, and then at that point the onus is upon everyone else to either show they are not involved, or give up the personal information of the owner to a potentially litigiously malicious party. For instance, the information that the DMCA counter notice demands, would otherwise not be provided without subpoena. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Counter notices are described in [17 USC 512(g)(3\\)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512). It starts with the requirement for \"A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber\" (and a statement under penalty of perjury...). Supposing that you can't get anywhere with finding the contributor even via a subpoena, then you're stopped there: you can't swear on behalf of someone else. \n\nParagraph (f) also says that if a person files a false infringement claim, they become\n\n> liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred\n>  by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's\n>  authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such\n>  misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon\n>  such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material\n>  or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed\n>  material or ceasing to disable access to it\n\nbut it's not immediately obvious that you would suffer damage by taking the material down (not immediately obvious doesn't mean obviously not true). A case could be made, but it's risky. In [Online Policy Group v. Diebold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Policy_Group_v._Diebold,_Inc.), Diebold was hit with substantial damages basically for having made up a theory that certain email discussion was infringing when it was clearly fair use. If a person actually lies about being the copyright owner, that would probably be viewed even more dimly by the courts.\n\nYour 4th argument gives you no traction: if an infringer posts infringing material and transfers copyright on the web page, but they don't *hold* copyright, then that transfer mean nothing. As for the other arguments, your attorney will have to suggest an advisable course of action. S/he might advise that your evidence is so strong that you should just ignore the takedown; or that you should take the content down and then sue for damages; or take the content down and lobby your congressman for a change in the law.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nI will reiterate my recommendation to get a lawyer. I believe that under the law, the risk to you would be the situation where the person prevails in an infringement suit against you. Outside of the \"mere conduit\" safe harbor, you have to participate in the notice and takedown scheme in order to \"stay safe\" (also you have to do so quickly). You have identified a potentially huge flaw in the system. Theoretically, criminal charges of perjury and paragraph (f) damages would be enough to deter ordinary wrong\\-doers, provided that you can really prove that someone else is the copyright holder. But the cost of litigation is not zero and the chances of winning are not 100%. The law *does* assume that all parties tell the truth, indeed the law requires a \"penalty of perjury\" statement. Since counter\\-notice is also part of the legal dance, I would conclude that you do have to write yourself a counter\\-notice.

While the ISP may have evidence that the DMCA request is false, ignoring it (option A) could jeopardize their safe harbor protections under the DMCA. Filing a counter-notice on behalf of the original poster (option B) is not legally permissible, as counter-notices require a signature from the subscriber under penalty of perjury. Keeping the content up and exposing the filer (option D) could open the ISP to legal risks.\n\nBy removing the content, the ISP maintains their safe harbor protection. Consulting with a lawyer allows them to explore legal options, such as potentially suing for damages under 17 USC 512(f) if they can prove the DMCA filer knowingly misrepresented ownership.

The scrutiny of your personal account in order to glean personal data (your IP address) and then using that personal data to match accounts may contravene Recital 50 of the GDPR:\n\n> The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected.\n\nIf the website terms which you agreed to don't include this data matching, then that processing is not lawful.\n\nThe rest of Recital 50 is relevant and worth quoting in full:\n\n> If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further use; the\n> nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data\n> subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.\n\nIt seems to me that an anonymous account could reasonably expect that the \"further processing\" of data matching is not in the public interest, an exercise of official authority, scientific or historical research or statistical. There is no link between the data matching exercise and the purpose for which IP addresses are normally collected: the operation and physical security of the website.\n\nNow, it may well be that the website terms do allow this data matching to discover links between accounts, or in any case prohibit having two accounts and allow reasonable methods to discover such links. It's also possible that a court has ordered the processing (as [I\u00f1aki Viggers has mentioned](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/58565/577).

This matters because the terms of a contract cannot be changed unilaterally, they must be agreed. If the change happened after the lease was signed then , unless you agreed to it, it has no effect whatsoever.\n\nSince that resolution is boring; I will assume that it was always there.\n\nEnforcability\n-------------\n\n> Is this actually enforceable, since I did park in a public space and not necessarily on his property?\n\nYes, it is enforceable. People can agree in a contract to do (or not do) anything so long as that thing is not illegal \\- that is what a contract is; a legally enforceable agreement for two people to do certain things.\n\nYou agreed \"All moving must be done in rear of driveway ... (near basement door)\" and you didn't do what you agreed to do. Therefore you broke a term of the contract. It doesn't matter that you don't know why he wanted you to do this or if it was reasonable or if it meant that you couldn't use your parent's truck \\- if these were issues for you they should have been raised before you agreed to do it. If the clause said \"When moving out you will wear a blue double breasted suit with a yellow and purple bow tie\" then that is what you must do.\n\nConsequences\n------------\n\nThere are a number of options open to the wronged party when the other party breaches a term of a contract. The most relevant in these circumstances is to sue for damages.\n\nSo how much are damages? Well, they are an amount to restore the wronged party to the position they would have been in if you hadn't broken the agreement.\n\nIn situations where damages can be hard to calculate, contracts can make a provision for [liquidated damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidated_damages); a pre\\-agreed amount of what the damage will be: in this case \"$250\". However:\n\n> In the United States, Section 2\\-718(1\\) of the Uniform Commercial Code provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:\n> \n> \n> Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.\n> \n> \n> This largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.\n\nOn the face of it, it would appear that $250 may be \"unreasonably large\" given the nature of the breach where it appears that the landlord has actually suffered no damage.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the lease agreement and the tenant's actions during move-out, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the $250 fee for not moving from the rear driveway?\n\nA) The fee is automatically enforceable because it was written in the lease agreement.\n\nB) The fee is unenforceable because the tenant parked on a public street, not on the landlord's property.\n\nC) The fee may be enforceable, but could potentially be challenged as an unreasonable liquidated damages clause.\n\nD) The fee is completely unenforceable because the landlord did not suffer any actual damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the lease agreement does contain a clause specifying a $250 fee for not moving from the rear driveway, this doesn't automatically make it enforceable. The fee could potentially be challenged as an unreasonable liquidated damages clause. In the United States, liquidated damages must be reasonable in light of anticipated or actual harm. Since it appears the landlord suffered no actual damages from the tenant parking on the street, a court might view $250 as an unreasonably large amount. However, the fee isn't automatically unenforceable either - its validity would depend on a court's interpretation of whether it's a reasonable pre-estimate of potential damages or an unenforceable penalty.

I have asked lawyers who do not know for sure (and this is their field). \n\nMy question is if a User of some Service can be held liable for a legal infringement that the Service commits. That sentence was a bit confusing, so let me explain/elaborate:\n\nIn the case of Kazaa (I think it was called), a file sharing service, some users were held liable for the illegal downloading of music from this service. The *users* had to pay horrendous fines for in essence using the services which facilitated these actions. I am not sure if the Users signed a contract that says that they are liable for (knowingly or unknowingly) illegally downloading music from the Service. If a contract was signed, then that would definitely justify the fines to the Users, not the Service.\n\nHere is a theoretical example: A company sells a service which allows users to mask their IPs so that it seems that they are in the continental US. A user, \"Bob Doe\", is using this service. The user does not have to sign any contracts or sign their consent to anything. This user attempts to use an unaffiliated service which is only available in the continental US (and a couple other places) and prohibits its use outside of it (a service such as this one is Netflix, I think). Bob Doe uses Netflix in Uzbekistan (definitely *not* a place where Netflix is available) through the first mentioned service that masks his IP. Is Bob Doe held liable for any legal complications resulting from his use of Netflix through the IP masking service or is the IP masker shielding him too (is this IP masking service held liable)?\n\nI have also heard the argument that the User is causing the Service to commit an illegal act, hence the User is responsible (even though no contract was signed by the user).\n\nMy question basically is: If a User does *not* sign a contract saying that *they* are held liable for any illegal act which they 'cause the Service to commit', then who is held liable; who has to pay the fines?\n\nThanks a lot for any responses! All are welcome and greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is unlikely that you find a *commercial* provider of a service such as the one you describe that does *not* require its users to consent to some kind of agreement.\n\n1. The service provider, in spite of the absence of a contract, is unlikely to be held liable or named as a defendant in proceedings unless it can be shown that they ought to have been aware of the activities being undertaken.  \n\nIf it is found that the service provider reasonably ought to have been aware, and could have taken steps to prevent the activity, they could possibly be named as a defendant, in addition to or instead of the end user.  \n\nSee *A\\&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.*, 239 F.3d 1004 (2001\\) for a court decision with a similar fact pattern involving copyright infringement, rather than contract breach. It is also unclear whether such a case would be tried in the US, though it is likely.\n2. The end user is likely to be in breach of Netflix's Terms of Use (relevant clause extracted below); in this case, Netflix would have to sue for breach of contract, and it is quite likely that judgement would be in their favour. The possible damages awarded would vary by jurisdiction.\n\nEssentially \\- yeah, the user is almost certainly going to breach contract. There generally aren't fines for it, but a court may order restitutional damages and/or an injunction.\n\n[**Netflix Terms of Use**](https://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse \"Netflix Terms of Use\")\n\n> 4\\.3\\.

Clause 26 has a long list of exceptions such as \n\n> (j) the names and addresses of any persons contained in, or referred\n>  to in, any applications for any licenses to carry or possess firearms\n>  issued pursuant to chapter one hundred and forty or any firearms\n>  identification cards issued pursuant to said chapter one hundred and\n>  forty and the names and addresses on sales or transfers of any\n>  firearms, rifles, shotguns, or machine guns or ammunition therefor, as\n>  defined in said chapter one hundred and forty and the names and\n>  addresses on said licenses or cards ... \n> \n> \n> (o) the home address and home\n>  telephone number of an employee of the judicial branch, an unelected\n>  employee of the general court, an agency, executive office,\n>  department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the\n>  commonwealth, or of a political subdivision thereof or of an authority\n>  established by the general court to serve a public purpose, in the\n>  custody of a government agency which maintains records identifying\n>  persons as falling within those categories; provided that the\n>  information may be disclosed to an employee organization under chapter\n>  150E, a nonprofit organization for retired public employees under\n>  chapter 180, or a criminal justice agency as defined in section 167 of\n>  chapter 6\\.\n> \n> \n> (p) the name, home address and home telephone number of a family\n>  member of a commonwealth employee, contained in a record in the\n>  custody of a government agency which maintains records identifying\n>  persons as falling within the categories listed in subclause (o).\n\nIf the information is not legally a public record, there is no obligation to disclose. There is a general requirement via statute, regulation and court rulings requiring the government to protect personal information, such as [this](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93h/Section2). You can get a list of sources on that topic [here](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-privacy#massachusetts-laws-).

The resident may cite privacy protection laws like Chapter 93H, Section 2 of Massachusetts General Laws to request removal of their personal information. However, the town is not automatically required to comply, as the information may still be considered a public record depending on the specific circumstances. The correct answer is not A (as not all correspondence is automatically public record), not B (as there's no federal law mandating immediate removal), and not D (as privacy protections extend beyond just those specific employee categories)."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/47607/what-recourse-does-a-patient-have-in-the-event-of-accidentally-false-medical-rec", "docs_id": 47607, "title": "What recourse does a patient have in the event of accidentally false medical records?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This story relates to my husband. He's 35 years old and had a vasectomy a few months ago. After the waiting period, he underwent the lab test to check that the procedure was successful. A few days after submitting his sample, he received an email from the urologist's office saying he had new information in his record (online patient portal). \n\nTo his excessive surprise, the new information was NOT the results of the lab test, but was in fact a record of a cancer diagnosis. Double testicular cancer, to be precise. After a bewildering and frantic hour, he was able to get confirmation from the urologist's office that no, he doesn't actually have testicular cancer. An orchiectomy (testicle removal) had also appeared on his record, although this was clearly false, if only due to the date on the record; the office confirmed that also didn't belong on his record. This was all an accident made by someone in the office, presumably. \n\nA few weeks later, after many phone calls and two in\\-person visits to the office, the cancer diagnosis moved to a classification as a past condition, implying that it had been cured. The patient portal is handled by some other group, and the office claims they don't have the ability to remove records, hence the large volume of phone calls and trying to reach someone who does have that ability. Eventually, one cancer diagnosis was removed, but the other testicular cancer diagnosis and orchiectomy remain.\n\nIt seems clear that having this appear on his medical record will affect my husband negatively, at the very least in regards to insurance. And, as one can imagine, this has been a traumatic emotional experience for him. So here are my questions:\n\n**1\\. What, if any, law is being broken by the accidental addition of false information to his record?**\n\n**2\\. What is the best way to actually enforce removal of the false information?** \n\n**3\\.

A simple and pointed solution is to print that page and circle the section, in a letter requesting an amendment. A somewhat more costly and much more effective solution would be to get a lawyer to write a letter in legalese. \nIt is hard to imagine that the provider would not comply. You will notice that they have 60 days to comply (\\+30 days extension if requested).

It is insured and registered as inoperable, since it doesn't run. I now have the means to fix it for him, so I've been working on it here and there in the driveway.

Are they even allowed to do something as extreme as take the car from us?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, in Orange County, CA, in a residential zone or on residentially\\-developed property, this is a code violation. Specifically you are looking at [Title 3, Division 13, Article 1](https://library.municode.com/ca/orange_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT3PUMOSAWE_DIV13PRMA), Sec 3\\-13\\-4(11\\):\n\n> **Sec. 3\\-13\\-4\\. \\- Prohibited Conduct.**   \n> \n>   \n> \n> Except as provided in section 3\\-13\\-6, exemptions, it shall be unlawful for any responsible party having charge or possession of any real property in county territory to:  \n> ...\n>   \n> \n> (11\\) Keep, store, or maintain upon any premises under his/her control any abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, or part thereof, except as permitted by Table 3\\-13\\-6(c).\n\nYou may store/work on this vehicle from a building or location that is not visible from the street, but you cannot work on or store the vehicle on the street or driveway. You might also be able to erect a 6' tall opaque fence around the car, provided the fence meets standards.\n\nThe code making this illegal is a county ordinance for Orange County, CA, which is not applicable to other counties in California (other counties/cities may have their own ordinances).

This makes option C the most compliant solution.\n\nOption A (covering with a car cover) would likely not be sufficient, as it doesn't address the fundamental issue of storing an inoperative vehicle visibly.\n\nOption B (repairing quickly) may not be feasible and doesn't address the immediate code violation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while erecting a fence could be a solution, it must be at least 6 feet tall and meet certain standards to be compliant, not 4 feet as stated in the option."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78942/practical-aspects-of-changing-your-name-in-a-common-law-jurisdiction", "docs_id": 78942, "title": "Practical aspects of changing your name in a common law jurisdiction", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Common law jurisdictions, in stark contrast to civil law jurisdictions, are considerably liberal in their procedures for allowing a name change.

Readers of Law StackExchange like to citations to reliable sources; I'm not going to do that, just describe my experience.\n\nMany states do indeed allow a person to adopt a new name through usage.

While the investor's actions are deceptive, fraud typically requires a direct misrepresentation to the victim. In this case, the investor didn't directly lie to the homeowners.\n\nC) Nuisance is the correct answer. The investor's actions intentionally interfered with the homeowners' use and enjoyment of their property, causing a substantial and unreasonable harm (decreased property values) without any legitimate benefit.\n\nD) Conspiracy, while potentially applicable, is less likely to succeed than a civil suit for nuisance. Proving criminal conspiracy would be more challenging and require showing a specific agreement to commit an unlawful act.\n\nThe nuisance claim is most likely to succeed because it directly addresses the harm caused by the investor's actions without requiring proof of direct misrepresentation (as in fraud) or criminal intent (as in conspiracy)."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37314/pawnshop-in-tn-transfered-my-pawned-firearm-without-my-prior-consent", "docs_id": 37314, "title": "Pawnshop in TN transfered my pawned firearm without my prior consent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I pawned my firearms and the pawnshop had their FFL suspended.

This is further clarified as a situation where \"the evidence presented to the court is so weak that it makes a conviction impossible.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a lack of physical evidence can weaken a case, it's not the sole determining factor for discharge under Section 227.\n\nOption B is incorrect because although a strong alibi might be part of the defense, the standard for discharge is based on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence, not the strength of the defense.\n\nOption D is incorrect because an accused recanting a confession, while potentially significant, does not necessarily mean the evidence as a whole is insufficient to proceed with the case.\n\nThe key aspect is the overall strength of the evidence presented by the prosecution, which must be so weak that it cannot reasonably lead to a conviction."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14657/legal-jurisdiction-over-cloud-storage", "docs_id": 14657, "title": "Legal jurisdiction over cloud storage", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work on software that is a project of an encrypted cloud, created to protect users privacy.\n\nWe use a javascript crypto library called [SJCL](https://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/).\n\nOnly the user has the decryption key.

Can anyone help me with brief details?\n\nThe government has an idea for raising new revenue and have put it as a placeholder in its budget until authorizing legislation for the new tax is in place. But it wasn't a law yet, as of February 3, 2022\\.\n\nFrequently, final tax legislation differs greatly from the originally proposed tax legislation in most details relevant to a taxpayer. The proposed tax legislation is subject to amendment in the legislative process before it becomes law (although there may be more recent developments of which I am not currently aware at some point). It will probably take many months to pass a law enacting such a tax, if it happens at all.\n\nThe proposed tax is discussed at this [CNBC story from February 3, 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/india-budget-proposed-a-30percent-tax-on-digital-asset-income.html). The summary available at this link, which is probably based upon a press release of the government, rather than its proposed legislative language, is as follows:\n\n> * India\u2019s proposed tax rate on income from virtual assets is steep, but it signals that the government recognizes the country\u2019s\n> cryptocurrency industry, the CEO of crypto exchange CoinSwitch told\n> CNBC.\n> * In the Feb. 1 annual budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of digital assets\n> and said no deductions would be allowed.\n> * Losses incurred from such transactions could not be set off against any other income.\n> * India also planned to impose a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on payments related to the transfer of digital assets.\n\nBasically, this is a capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies and [non\\-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFTs), but with no deductions for cryptocurrency/NFT losses against income other than cryptocurrency/NFT income, together with a 1% sales tax on cryptocurrency/NFT transaction payments.\n\n*Example One*\n\nYou buy 800,000 rupees of Bitcoin and 200,000 rupees of limited edition online trading cards for celebrities like cricket players, Bollywood stars, famous pop singers, businessman, politicians, mathematicians, scientists and historical generals (which are non\\-fungible tokens) on January 1, 2023, then on December 31, 2023, you sell the Bitcoin for 400,000 rupees and all of your NFTs for 1,200,000 because you get in a bidding war with Mukesh Ambani over his own NFTs.\n\nYou have a 400,000 rupee loss on the Bitcoin which reduces your 1,000,000 rupee gain on NFTs, for net digital asset income of 600,000 rupees, giving rise to a 180,000 rupee digital assets income tax.\n\nIn addition, you would pay a 10000 rupee digital asset transaction tax (1%) on the purchase and a 14000 digital asset transaction tax on the sale for a total digital asset tax of 204,000 rupees\n\nNote that it isn't entirely clear from the available information if the transaction tax on digital asset payments is owed by both the seller and the buyer, by only the seller, by only the buyer, or half by each. These examples assume that the 1% transaction tax applies to both the seller and to the buyer, but this might end up being different in the final adopted legislation.\n\nAfter the digital assets tax, you would have 1,396,000 rupees left over from your starting investment of 1,000,000 rupees. Good job! You can afford a wild and crazy party with your friends from your profits.\n\n*Example Two*\n\nBut, suppose you only bought the Bitcoin, and not the NFTs, and had a loss of 400,000 rupees, but also had 1,000,000 rupees of salary income from you job as an architect that year.\n\nYou wouldn't have any digital asset income tax, but your digital asset transaction tax would be 12,000 rupees, even though you made a loss (subject to the lack of clarity in how the transaction tax works). You wouldn't be able to apply your Bitcoin losses to the taxes you owe on your ordinary income from your salary, however.\n\n> For example if X person purchases software say MySQL commercial\n> edition from YZX private limited and YZX Pvt ltd purchased MySQL\n> commercial edition from oracle itself will this new 30% tax be applied\n> on this transaction or not?\n> \n> \n> So it will look:\n> \n> \n> \\-\\-\\> Oracle (produces MySql COmercial Edition) \\-\\-\\> sold to a distributor \\-\\-\\> sold to YZX Pvt ltd \\-\\-\\> End user say X person\n> \n> \n> Now:\n> \n> \n> Q1\\.

The new tax law will probably have an exemption from the digital assets tax for software and will probably treat software the same way that it does now under India's tax laws.\n\nEven if it did apply to software, however (and the details may change in the legislative process) it would only be a 30% tax on the profits YZX Pvt ltd made from selling the software to a retail purchaser, not a tax on the gross sale price of the softwware, although there might be a 1% sales tax on the gross sale price if the tax were expanded from the current proposal to include software.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of India's proposed digital asset tax as of February 2022, consider the following scenario:\n\nAn Indian investor purchases 500,000 rupees worth of Bitcoin and 300,000 rupees worth of NFTs on March 1, 2023.

Total tax liability:\n   Income tax (150,000) + Transaction tax (21,000) = 171,000 rupees\n\n5. The question asks for the \"total tax liability related to digital assets,\" which includes both the income tax and the transaction tax, totaling 171,000 rupees.\n\nHowever, the 1% transaction tax is applied on both purchase and sale transactions, so we need to double this amount:\n171,000 * 2 = 342,000 rupees\n\nThe closest option to this calculated amount is C) 321,000 rupees.\n\nNote: The regular job income is not relevant for this calculation as the proposed rules don't allow offsetting digital asset losses against other income."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27929/am-i-responsible-for-my-spouses-careless-behavior", "docs_id": 27929, "title": "Am I responsible for my spouse&#39;s careless behavior?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My spouse is a great person, but careless.

In place of the missing sections, a roll of thin wire mesh was rolled out to cover the span. This mesh is not secured on either end only being held up by a couple of small stacks of fire wood and only approximately 2 1/2 \\- 3 feet tall (the height of the dog standing). Of the two dogs, one is a pit bull and both charge the fence very aggressively barking, growling, baring their teeth. Neither dog are otherwise secured or on a leash and often allowed to roam the back yard at will even without supervision. The owner finds the aggression funny even in the face of the obvious terror of pedestrians walking along the street.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Law:\n---------------------\n\n**3 P.S. Section 459\\-305**\n\n> It shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to\n>  keep at all times such dog either:\n> \n> \n> 1. confined within the premises of the owner,\n>  **2\\. firmly secured by a means of collar and chain or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured, or**\n> 2. under the reasonable control of some person, or when engaged in lawful hunting, expedition or field training.\n\n**3 P.S. Section 459** (Definition of a dangerous dog.)\n\n> * the dog has injured a person, without provocation, on public or private property,\n> * the dog has killed or injured a domestic animal without provocation, while off the owner's property,\n> * the dog has attacked a human being without provocation, or\n> * the dog was used to commit a crime.\n\nWhere it seems there are holes in the law:\n------------------------------------------\n\n*2\\. firmly secured by a means of collar and chain or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured, or*\n\nIt seems clear to me that the unsecured wire roll does not comply with **other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises**, however, the homeowner claims the dogs do not go past the wire. How are they to know? Is it not a matter of time? How would the law see this?\n\nThe definition of a dangerous dog requires an attack, kill, or injury. It seems to me any dog that has a consistent history of making a credible or reasonable threat of attack or injury without control of the owner either by confinement or leash is also dangerous. I see it as akin to a drunk driver that has not crashed yet. The drunk driver is still a danger.\n\nMy Questions:\n-------------\n\nMy questions are, given the scenario, is it at least reasonable to consider the unsecured wire roll regardless of the claim of the owner inadequate? And what recourse would an ordinary pedestrian walking down the street have?\n\nAs well, are there other statutes that govern nuisance dogs, confinement, and otherwise protects a pedestrian from fear of threat from a dog?\n\nFurther Background:\n-------------------\n\nI previously lived in a city where you could not walk more than a couple of blocks without being attacked by one ore more pitbulls or rotweilers off the leash and not confined purchased and trained with the expressed purpose of being a weapon.\n\nI have been attacked several times with injuries throughout my life.\n\nI have had to shoot and kill one dangerous dog after police refused to enforce the law. (The police did not go into my neighborhood. Oddly, it was a middle\\-class development that went rogue.)\n\nI like dogs. I have had them in my life since high school. I hate having to confront irresponsible dog owners since all (so far) have proven to be unreasonable. I do not like being attacked even if no actual contact is made. (We are talking about just inches and not feet.) And I hate the thought of having to protect myself from a dog with a gun.\n\nHell's bells! I live in a small town in the mountains of Pennsylvania. This should not be an issue. This is a very relaxed environment. However, relaxed also means that the local police may not respond to a complaint unless forced to legally. Often, this is because the police are so busy chasing down drug offenses, they opt not to enforce quality of life issues such as this one. Even when the police chief is a personal friend. Cripes!\n\n***All I want to do is force the home owner to replace the fence lawfully and without delay using the resources available. Nothing more.***\n\nI have been around and around on this. Any clarity would help. Cheers!!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume that the fence and dog are outside, not within the premises (buildings) of the property. An outside dog area with two 8 foot sections missing and patched with thin wire mesh such as chicken wire fails to satisfy the requirements of \"other device so that it *cannot* stray beyond the premises on which it is secured\", though it could satisfy a weaker and non\\-existent law only requiring that the device \"might tend to hinder escape\". A first violation of the law is a summary offense, punishable by fine of $100\\-$500, 90 days, or both.\n\nThe question arises what level of culpability attaches to this crime, that is, does conviction require recklessness, malice, or what? [State law on culpability](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=3) \u00a7305(a) says\n\n> The requirements of culpability prescribed by section 301 of this\n>  title (relating to requirement of voluntary act) and section 302 of\n>  this title (relating to general requirements of culpability) do not\n>  apply to:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) summary offenses, unless the requirement involved is included in\n>  the definition of the offense or the court determines that its\n>  application is consistent with effective enforcement of the law\n>  defining the offense\n\nFor example, speeding is a summary and strict liability offense: you're guilty if you're over the speed limit. [Baehr v. Com](https://casetext.com/case/baehr-v-com-ex-rel-lower-merion-twp), 414 A.2d 415 held that the law (a first violation) \"unmistakably speaks in terms of strict liability for its violation\". The legislative intent is to prevent risky behavior, not just to punish people for damages that result from risky acts.\n\nThere is an escape, though, if the responsible person has already been convicted of this, because a second offense is a misdemeanor, not a summary offense. Culpability requirements thus hold, and it would have to be established that defendant acted \"intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly\", as held in [Comm v. Raban](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-3-2013do.pdf).\n\nA pedestrian's recourse is to notify the police (leaving aside his recourse if the dogs break free and attack him). The presence of chicken wire might be proffered as a defense against prosecution, and then it would come down to questions about the effectiveness of the wire patch. A simple test is, throw a reasonable sized pumpkin at it, and if it gives way, a pit bull *could* escape.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to Pennsylvania law, which of the following statements is true regarding the scenario with the dogs and the damaged fence?\n\nA) The homeowner is in compliance with the law as long as the dogs haven't actually escaped yet.\n\nB) The wire mesh is likely an adequate \"other device\" for securing the dogs as required by law.\n\nC) The homeowner is likely in violation of the law due to inadequate containment of the dogs.\n\nD) The dogs must have already attacked someone to be considered dangerous under the law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The homeowner is likely in violation of Pennsylvania law 3 P.S. Section 459-305, which requires dogs to be \"firmly secured by a means of collar and chain or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured.\" The thin wire mesh that is unsecured and only 2.5-3 feet tall does not meet this requirement, as it does not ensure the dogs cannot stray beyond the premises.

The relevant provisions are set out below.\n\nFirst, the definition of insider dealing which is relevant to the scenario:\n\n> 52(1\\) An individual who has information as an insider is guilty of\n> insider dealing if, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (3\\),\n> he deals in securities that are price\\-affected securities in relation\n> to the information.\n> \n> \n> 52(3\\) The circumstances referred to above are that the acquisition or\n> disposal in question occurs on a regulated market, or that the person\n> dealing relies on a professional intermediary or is himself acting as\n> a professional intermediary.\n\nThis is subject to a number of defences, one of which is:\n\n> 52(4\\) This section has effect subject to section 53\\.\n> \n> \n> 53 (1\\) An individual is not guilty of insider dealing by virtue of\n> dealing in securities if he shows \u2014 \\[...] (b) that at the time he\n> believed on reasonable grounds that the information had been disclosed\n> widely enough to ensure that none of those taking part in the dealing\n> would be prejudiced by not having the information, \\[...]\n\nIn order to understand the definition at section 52(1\\) above, we need to turn to the interpretation sections (emphasis added to show the terms which are being defined):\n\n> 55(1\\) For the purposes of this Part, a person **deals in securities** if\n> (a) he acquires or disposes of the securities (whether as principal or\n> agent); or (b) he procures, directly or indirectly, an acquisition or\n> disposal of the securities by any other person.\n\n> 57(1\\) For the purposes of this Part, a person has **information as an\n> insider** if and only if (a) it is, and he knows that it is, inside\n> information, and (b) he has it, and knows that he has it, from an\n> inside source.\n\n> 57(2\\) For the purposes of subsection (1\\), a person has\n> **information from an inside source** if and only if (a) he has it through\n> (i) being a director, employee or shareholder of an issuer of\n> securities; or (ii) having access to the information by virtue of his\n> employment, office or profession; or (b) the direct or indirect source\n> of his information is a person within paragraph (a).\n\n> 56 (1\\) For the purposes of this section and section 57, **\u201cinside\n> information\u201d** means information which (a) relates to particular\n> securities or to a particular issuer of securities or to particular\n> issuers of securities and not to securities generally or to issuers of\n> securities generally; (b) is specific or precise; (c) has not been\n> made public; and (d) if it were made public would be likely to have a\n> significant effect on the price of any securities.\n> \n> \n> 56(2\\) For the purposes of this Part, securities are **\u201cprice\\-affected\n> securities\u201d** in relation to inside information, and inside information\n> is \u201cprice\\-sensitive information\u201d in relation to securities, if and\n> only if the information would, if made public, be likely to have a\n> significant effect on the price of the securities.\n\nNote that information is not inside information if it has been made public, pursuant to section 56(1\\)(c) above. So we now need to turn to the definition of \"made public\":\n\n> 58(1\\) For the purposes of section 56, \u201c**made public**\u201d, in relation to\n> information, shall be construed in accordance with the following\n> provisions of this section; **but those provisions are not exhaustive as\n> to the meaning of that expression**.\n> \n> \n> 58(2\\) Information **is** made public if (a) it is published in accordance\n> with the rules of a regulated market for the purpose of informing\n> investors and their professional advisers; (b) it is contained in\n> records which by virtue of any enactment are open to inspection by the\n> public; (c) it can be readily acquired by those likely to deal in any\n> securities (i) to which the information relates, or (ii) of an issuer\n> to which the information relates; or (d) it is derived from\n> information which has been made public.\n> \n> \n> 58(3\\) Information **may be** treated as made public even though (a)it can\n> be acquired only by persons exercising diligence or expertise; (b) it\n> is communicated to a section of the public and not to the public at\n> large; (c) it can be acquired only by observation; (d) it is\n> communicated only on payment of a fee; or (e) it is published only\n> outside the United Kingdom.\n\nLooking at the bolded parts, information may be considered to have been made public even though it is not in a manner explicitly listed in section 58(2\\). However, if a person wants to be absolutely sure that they will not commit the offence, then they would be advised to use one of those methods in 58(2\\). The bolded word \"is\" there ensures that it cannot be called into question. A person working in a listed company will almost invariably use the method in 58(2\\)(1\\): \"*published in accordance with the rules of a regulated market for the purpose of informing investors and their professional advisers*\"\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nI'm working on the assumption that we are talking about shares which are listed on a regulated market. \"Regulated market\" also has a specific definition but I won't get into that other than to say that there are markets which are not regulated for the purpose of this offence.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n*It is possible for an influent (private) agent, namely someone who has the power to direct the market, to buy a stock before giving a positive announcement about the stock itself?*\n\nThis will likely result in commiting the offence of insider dealing, assuming that person and the information falls within the defintions above.\n\n*Does his investment need to be public so that other investors can understand that his move can be just a manipulation of stock's value?*\n\nThis is likely insufficient.

However, the conventional wisdom they are adhering to is that he cannot apply for work in the US, and cannot stay longer than 6 months at a time, so they are choosing to live apart for now. (They are both living with parents and would probably need to combine incomes to maintain a comfortable standard of living)\n\nI wanted to help them consider options that just might allow for an interim solution to their woes. A quick search turned up that a K1 visa is available for Fianc\u00e9s of US citizens that would allow one to work.

Therefore, I agreed to be his sponsor.\n\nI plan to continue researching, but was hoping that someone with more experience might have a suggestion that could point us in the right direction. Along those lines I have a few questions regarding the best, (fastest...) path forward so that they can move in and start a life together:\n\n1. Is the K1 visa even an option now, or are they beyond that point already?\nIf not, is there another visa type available for spouses short of a green card?\n2. Is there anything legally preventing him from applying for, and accepting a job in the US right now?  \n\na. Might a written job offer give him to the status needed to obtain the required work visa to actually start working?  \n\nb. Can he legally answer that he does not require a sponsor because I am his sponsor?\n3.

Is this not the case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: He cannot get K1 since he is married. K1 is only for fianc\u00e9s. There is the K3 visa for spouses of US citizens who are waiting on a pending I\\-130, but K3 has been obsolete for many years, and he is very unlikely to get a K3 even if he applies for it. My understanding is that they process he I\\-130 and the I\\-129F for K3 together, and the I\\-129F will not be approved faster than the I\\-130, at which point one is no longer eligible for K3 and will continue processing for the immigrant visa directly.\n(Also note that if he enters the US on K3, he would have to apply for Adjustment of Status, which is expensive and takes a year or more, before he becomes a permanent resident, whereas if he enters the US on an immigrant visa, he becomes a permanent resident immediately.)\n\nIf he were inside the US and applying for a green card through Adjustment of Status in the US, he would be eligible to apply for an EAD (employment authorization document) for free together with the Adjustment of Status filing, which would allow him to work in the US after a few months while his Adjustment of Status is still pending. However, since he is outside the US and getting a green card via Consular Processing for an immigrant visa, that is not available to him. And he cannot enter the US as a visitor or most other types of nonimmigrant status with a preconceived intent to file Adjustment of Status during that stay.\n\nHaving a pending or approved I\\-130 does not allow him to stay in or work in the US. As he is doing Consular Processing, he does not have the ability to stay in the US until he enters the US with his immigrant visa (at which point he would be a permanent resident). People doing Adjustment of Status can stay in the US while the application is pending, but Adjustment of Status is only for people applying from within the US.\n\nMost types of nonimmigrant status, including TN work status, are subject to presumption of immigrant intent, and so he would be very likely to be denied entry even if he had a job offer, since he is planning to immigrate to the US very soon. The only work statuses that are not subject to immigrant intent are H1b and L1, and those are not likely available to him in the near future (H1b has a lottery and requires entry in the April before work starts in October.

It's all about the difference between the loss to the defendant from having to perform, and the loss to the plaintiff from the breach. \n\nI am only writing to add quotations from Lord Hoffman's decision in *[Cooperative Insurance](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/uk/5b46f1ed2c94e0775e7ee30d)* showing that he meant exactly what Nate conjectured he meant. \n\nIn his opinion, Lord Hoffman points out that ordering specific performance \n\n> may cause injustice by *allowing the plaintiff to enrich himself at the defendant's expense*. The loss which the plaintiff may suffer through having to comply with the order (for example, by running a business at a loss for an indefinite period) may be far greater than the plaintiff would suffer from the contract being broken.\n\nHoffman then quotes Professor RJ Sharpe, *Specific Remedies in Contract Breach*: \n\n> In such circumstances, a specific decree in favour of the plaintiff will put him in a bargaining position vis a vis the defendant whereby *the measure of what he will receive* will be the *value to the defendant of being released from performance.* If the plaintiff bargains effectively, *the amount he will set will exceed the value to him of performance* and *will approach the cost to the defendant to complete.*\n\nFinally, Lord Hoffman quotes Lord Westerbury, who said, \n\n> \\[I refuse] to deliver over the defendants to the plaintiff bound hand and foot, in order to be made subject to any extortionate demand that he may by possibility make...", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of specific performance in contract law, Lord Hoffman in Cooperative Insurance v Argyll Stores argued that automatic specific enforcement may amount to 'over-compensation'.

This allows them to potentially negotiate a settlement that exceeds the value of performance to them, approaching the defendant's cost to complete. This situation could result in the plaintiff enriching themselves at the defendant's expense, which Hoffman considers a form of 'over-compensation'.

The more questionable cases have occurred when some law or regulation leaves the owner with title, but significantly restricts the uses to which the property may be put, particularly when the existing use becomes unlawful.

Label is in Germany.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under US copyright law, anyone may make a \"cover recording\" of a musical work (such as a song) that is not part of a drama (such as an opera or musical comedy). The would\\-be cover artist can either negotiate for permission and a royalty rate, or use a compulsory license, known as a \"mechanical license\", at a royalty rate fixed by law. The right to do this is given by [17 USC 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115). However that section of the copyright law is rather complex and confusing. The [Nolo press explanation of cover rights](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/question-when-mechanical-royalty-due-28002.html) says:\n\n> To record a song for release to the public, a performer must obtain permission from the music publisher of the song and pay a fee, called a mechanical royalty. A mechanical royalty must be paid when songs are reproduced, for example on compact discs or records.\n\n> There are two ways to get permission and pay the mechanical royalty:\n\n> * A compulsory license may be used, and the preset statutory mechanical royalty rate paid directly to the music publisher\u2014the easiest, least stressful method.\n> * Permission and a mechanical royalty may be negotiated directly with the music publisher or the Harry Fox Agency.\n\n> Under the compulsory license procedures, you need not ask the music publisher's permission to make the recording or negotiate a license fee. Instead, you merely inform the publisher of the recording and pay a license fee set by law.\n\n> You can get helpful information about the procedure by downloading Circular 50, Copyright Registration for Musical Compositions, from the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\n> When using the compulsory license procedure, the music publisher must be paid a mechanical royalty rate set by the government\u2014sometimes known as the statutory rate.\n\nThere are additional restrictions. A mechanical license is not available unless the4 copyright owner has previously made or authorized a recording of the work and released it for distribution. A mechanical license is only available for the purpose of creating and distributing copied for individual use, not for broadcast.\n\nHowever, as explained in [this Soundfly article](https://flypaper.soundfly.com/hustle/how-to-legally-cover-a-song/) if the musical work is presented along with any visual content, such as a video, a \"synchronization license\" is also needed. This would very likely apply to a video game. As Soundfly says:\n\n> Typically, in order to acquire a sync license, you just need to ask the publisher. Unfortunately, there are no set prices for this kind of thing \u2013 we don\u2019t even have a pricing scale available! Sometimes you can get it for free, and other times it\u2019s going to cost you dearly. Hopefully, it won\u2019t be the latter.\n\nThis is not covered by the compulsory (mechanical) license, and must be obtained via negotiation. That means the would\\-be user must find out who the copyright holder is first.\n\nBy the way, the compulsory license is called \"mechanical\" because this provision was originally passed to permit making rolls for player pianos, which reproduced notes mechanically.\n\nIn short, both a cover license and a sync license are needed, and the second must be negotiated.\n\nSee also [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version#U.S._copyright_law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A video game developer wants to include a cover version of a popular song in their game. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the licensing requirements?\n\nA) The developer only needs to obtain a mechanical license for the cover version, as this covers all uses of the song.\n\nB) The developer needs to obtain a synchronization license, but doesn't need a mechanical license since they're creating a cover version.\n\nC) The developer needs to obtain both a mechanical license and a synchronization license, but can use the compulsory licensing process for both.\n\nD) The developer needs to obtain both a mechanical license and a synchronization license, with the latter requiring direct negotiation with the copyright holder.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. When including a cover version of a song in a video game, two types of licenses are required:\n\n1. A mechanical license for creating the cover version. This can be obtained through the compulsory licensing process or by negotiating directly with the copyright holder.\n\n2. A synchronization license for using the song in conjunction with visual content (the video game). This license cannot be obtained through compulsory licensing and must be negotiated directly with the copyright holder.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a mechanical license alone is not sufficient for use in a video game. Option B is incorrect because both licenses are needed, not just the synchronization license. Option C is incorrect because while the mechanical license can be obtained through compulsory licensing, the synchronization license cannot and must be negotiated separately."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78776/software-license-conditioned-on-company-size-or-revenue", "docs_id": 78776, "title": "Software license conditioned on company size or revenue", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A software license might be different if the company where the software is being used is larger or smaller.

There is no universal rule for such situations, and companies have significant freedom in setting their pricing and licensing structures. The answer acknowledges that various factors, including Sarah's own company size, her clients' sizes, and the nature of the usage, may all play a role in determining the appropriate license.
