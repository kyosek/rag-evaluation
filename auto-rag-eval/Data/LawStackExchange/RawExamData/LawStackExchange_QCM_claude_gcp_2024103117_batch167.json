Recently, a [German court even fined a website owner for using Google webfonts (German source: golem.de)](https://www.golem.de/news/landgericht-muenchen-einbindung-von-google-fonts-ist-rechtswidrig-2202-162826.html). People at my workplace where advised to host Google fonts locally because of that decision.\n\nThat being said, while I was reading about this regulation on <https://gdpr.eu/>, I noticed that the site itself uses Google webfonts without asking for user consent (see screenshot).\n\n[![Screenshot of a web page on gdpr.eu in the Firefox browser. The opened network analysis tab shows a GET request to fonts.googleapis.com](https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5jbL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5jbL.png)\n\nWhat I would like to know is basically:\ncould gdpr.eu be in violation of the GDPR? Or am I misunderstanding the regulation? I am honestly confused. The consent form on the site also implicitly assumes consent, which I thought [was also a violation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28959/required-data-entry-seemingly-against-gdpr). I've read some questions about the GDPR on here and information from gdpr.eu and other websites, but it's still very unclear to me what is legal and what is not.\n\nI know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied. From what I've read, I get the impression that this particular ruling was not unlikely to be overturned by a higher instance, if it came down to it. So my question probably both pertains to German law specifically and the EU regulation itself.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As I understand it, the GDPR does not permit sending of personal information (which includes the IP address) without prior consent by the user.\n\nThat's not exactly true, consent is merely one of six possible legal basis for processing (article 6\\). For example, processing of personal data can also be lawful if it necessary to perform a contract, legally mandatory, or in the public interest.\n\nThe court decision acknowledges that but rules out another basis in this case because it considers that it is possible to serve fonts without relying on a third\\-party (*\\[\u2026] der Einsatz der Schriftarten auch m\u00f6glich ist, ohne dass eine Verbindung von Besuchern zu externen Servern hergestellt werden muss*). Confusingly, it only refers to article 6(1\\)(f) when it seems to me that (b) would also be plausible but maybe this wasn't raised during the proceedings?\n\nIf the data controller cannot invoke any other basis for the lawfulness of the processing then yes, the only thing left is asking for consent, i.e. invoking article 6(1\\)(a). But that doesn't mean that you should expect to be asked for consent each and every time your personal information is being used.\n\n> The consent form on the site also implicitly assumes consent, which I thought was also a violation.\n\nYes, implying consent doesn't really make sense under the GDPR definition (article 4, see also article 7\\):\n\n> \u2018consent\u2019 of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action\n\nEuropean data protection authorities have [issued guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf) that detail what that means and clearly reject \u201cbundling\u201d different data processing. The regulation also makes it clear that data subjects should be able to withdraw consent at any time, which does not seem possible with the fonts on golem.de\n\nMy reading of all this is that assuming consent because you are using a service (or even created an account or checked a box at some point) simply isn't valid consent. Either you don't need consent at all in the first place or what you need is freely given, specific consent and \u201cimplying\u201d consent or bundling it with a registration process achieves exactly nothing. But this is still extremely common and it might take some time before enforcement and case law definitively settle this question.\n\nSmart data controllers trying to avoid collecting consent (like Meta) have abandoned any claim that signing up to the their services would constitute consent (because that's transparently not the case) and try to bypass the issue entirely using another basis like contractual necessity. This is also being litigated.\n\n> I know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied.

So my question probably both pertains to German law specifically and the EU regulation itself.\n\nThat sounds more like the way EU directives work. Regulations are supposed to be immediately applicable (no implementation in national law necessary) with minimal differences between countries (except when they explicitely provide for that).

(I live in the UK).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm pretty sure that under GDPR, you can indeed request them to send all data they have on you. If it's a complex request, they may charge you something like \u00a310\\. If they have a lot of data on you, they may list the categories of data they have and ask you to pick one, rather than them having to collect and send everything. They should respond within one month, but iirc in the UK implementation, they can inform you (within that month) that they will respond within three months instead.\n\nFor the rest, I only know current Dutch law. GDPR is not that different from what we already had (in general terms) and in many cases it even extends it. Under our law (WBP), you can also request a correction of the data in case it is incorrect, or deletion if they no longer need it for the purpose for which it was collected and stored. I don't really know how that works out in practice though, as Facebook can of course claim that \"being able to connect you to your friends when you sign up for WhatsApp or Facebook with that number\" is a legitimate purpose (in their eyes).\n\nThey might also not have your full name and therefore not be able to connect your data to your request. Or, perhaps, they have *only* your full name (and there are probably more people with your name), so they'll have a hard time verifying that it's really your data which they would be handing over or deleting. The company is required to verify your identity before acting on your request. How they implement that is up to them. Under Dutch law, if I remember correctly, any data that can be connected to your person *by any party* is personally identifiable information (PII). While Facebook might not be able to find who's behind a phone number, your carrier most certainly can. Therefore, the data falls under PII protection laws and they will have to implement a way to verify you and get you your data.\n\nFinally, whether your local laws apply to Facebook, I don't know exactly. There's lots of information on this though, so you should be able to find it. Generally, countries say that if something happened within their territory (e.g. you signed up for WhatsApp while in the UK), their law applies. Companies, I've read, will instead try to claim that their main office is in SomeCountry and therefore SomeCountry's laws apply. But I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find a Facebook office somewhere where GDPR applies, so that's probably fine.\n\nWhile not an exact answer and while I am not sure about everything, I hope this gave you some pointers to go on!", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under GDPR, if an individual who has never used WhatsApp believes their personal data is being processed due to their contacts using the app, what rights do they have regarding their data?\n\nA) They can only request WhatsApp to disclose what data they have, but cannot ask for deletion.\nB) They have no rights as they never consented to WhatsApp's terms of service.\nC) They can request data disclosure, correction of incorrect data, and deletion if the data is no longer needed for its original purpose.\nD) They can immediately demand deletion of all data without any verification process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to GDPR, individuals have the right to request disclosure of their personal data, even if they haven't directly used the service. They can also request correction of incorrect data and deletion if the data is no longer needed for its original purpose. However, the company may require identity verification before acting on these requests. The process isn't immediate and the company has up to one month (or three in complex cases) to respond.

If so, how do those rules mesh with federal laws of USA?**\n\n(I'm specifically talking about **formal rules**, NOT social norms where an outsider may simply be made to feel unwelcome enough that they would want to leave on their own).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Reservations aren't of or for a single tribe (meaning roughly \"ethnic group\"), they are for a particular Nation (whether or not that term is used in a specific case \\-\\- it could be \"Confederation\" or \"Band\"). In Washington state, the Yakama Nation is a confederation of people who are Klikitat, Palouse, Walla Walla, Wanapum, Wenatchee, Wishram, and Yakama; the Tulalip Tribes covers the northern Lushootseed tribes made up of the Duwamish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, and Stillaguamish. Only 2/3 of the recognized tribes have reservations. The key legal concept is not exactly being \"of a certain tribe\", it is \"being enrolled\". Ancestry relates to enrollment (and disenrollment) via individual rules about membership.\n\nFederal Indian law is encoded in [Title 25](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25). Let's just say that a question about what that title says is way to broad to ever answer. Generally speaking, there are two types of reservation land, trust land and fee land. The US government holds trust land in trust, which has various restrictions on transfer, and is exempt from taxation: transfers require higher approval (tribe, BIA). Fee land is land that the individual(s) own outright. In the case of fee land, anyone can purchase that land. The land that would be of interest for this question is trust land. The Yakama reservation, for instance, has open and closed areas, the latter being mostly trust land with use restricted to enrolled members.\n\nOn fee land located within a reservation, that does not mean that one is completely free of tribal rules. After all, off the reservation, you are still subject to the local government's land use rules (zoning restrictions, for example). The ruling of [Brendale v. Confederated Tribes, 492 U.S. 408](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/492/408/case.html) is very complex and says \"yes and no\". Tribes do *not* have authority to zone fee land on the reservation owned by non\\-members, but they do have authority to generally zone fee land on closed areas of the reservation. (Very roughly speaking, fee land is subject to general government\\-planning type restrictions on land use that we are all subject to; but there are limits on how discriminatory those rules can be. Above all, fee land is in fact owned by the individual, and a tribe cannot claw the land back, though they can buy it back).\n\nA Nation can set rules for membership which would be patently illegal in the general context of US law. In [Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/436/49/), the situation was that the rule of the Santa Clara Pueblo nation said that the children of a Pueblo woman who married outside the tribe (e.g. to a Navaho) may be denied tribal membership, but did not exclude children of a Pueblo man who married outside the tribe. The consequence is that the children of a woman lose the right to reside on that land after the mother dies (also can't vote, etc.) The short version is that SCOTUS held that this is legal.

Confederated Tribes established a complex precedent regarding tribal authority over zoning on fee land within reservations. The court decided that tribes do not have authority to zone fee land owned by non-members in open areas of the reservation. However, they do retain the authority to generally zone fee land in closed areas of the reservation. This nuanced approach balances tribal sovereignty with the rights of private landowners, particularly in areas of the reservation that are more integrated with non-tribal communities (open areas) versus those that are more exclusively used by the tribe (closed areas)."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25948/am-i-allowed-to-ask-a-company-to-sign-a-contract", "docs_id": 25948, "title": "Am I allowed to ask a company to sign a contract?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am an undergraduate student.

The student, as the author, is typically considered the first owner of the copyright unless there's a specific agreement stating otherwise.

Trademarks owned by virtue of use, rather than registration, are protected only in the market area in where actual use can be documented. Even state registration may be limited to a geographic market area in which use can be shown, and may not extend to the whole state unless use throughout the state, or at least in most major markets in the state, can be shown.\n\nAs discussed in the news story [\"Burger King Is Banned From Opening Within 20 Miles Of This Original, Mom\\-And\\-Pop Burger King Sign\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/burger-king-is-banned-from-opening-within-20-miles-of-this-original-mom-and-pop-burger-king-sign-2013-6) The owners of a small restaurant branded \"*Burger King*\" secured a state\\-level trademark on that name, but it only serves to exclude the well\\-known fast\\-food chain from a 20\\-mile circle.\n\nRemember, the prime purpose of a trademark is to identify the source of goods or services, and to prevent one supplier from benefiting by the reputation of another. In an area where the first supplier does not do business, there is considered to be no such risk of unfair competition.\n\nAlso, nationwide protection is one of the benefits of federal registration.\n\nIn addition, a mark is only protected for the same class of goods or services. Nationwide use of \"*Pear*\" as a mark for a brand of computer would not prevent use of the same word as a mark for a brand of automobile, say, or for a restaurant chain.\n\nNote also that trademarks are normally at most national in scope.

The local restaurant has established a common law trademark through use, but this protection is limited to the geographic area where they can prove actual use (in this case, San Francisco and its immediate surroundings). The national chain would be free to use the name in other parts of the country where the local restaurant hasn't established a market presence. This aligns with the principle that unregistered trademarks are protected only in the market area where actual use can be documented.

I have recently submitted a Subject Access Request to my motor insurer, and as part of that they sent some data that the received from the [Motor Insurance Database (MID)](https://www.mib.org.uk/) and [Equifax](https://www.equifax.co.uk/). The Equifax data included policy numbers and dates over the last few years that I would have had access to at one point but to not know now, and the MID included three identifiers per row, two of which I have not seen before, and an encoded string that I am unable to decode but appears to encode data that I may have had access to. I have also used the internet, and as I understand it this involves a lot of passing around information about me between entities.\n\nWhat exactly triggers the requirement for a data controller to inform the subject under Article 14?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Simply put, Art 14 GDPR is often ignored. But also, it triggers less often than some might think.\n\nWhile Art 14 applies whenever the data controller processes personal data that weren't obtained (directly) from the data subject (see Art 14(1\\)), there are a bunch of exceptions to the notification obligation, such as Art 14(5\\)(a): no notification is necessary if the data subject already has the information in the Art 14 privacy notice.\n\nFor example, your motor insurer likely fulfilled its transparency obligations under Art 14 together with its Art 13 transparency obligations by providing a privacy notice when you signed up to your service, and making updated versions available subsequently. While a privacy notice must be \u201cprovided\u201d, it is not required to force you to actually read and comprehend this document. And it is not necessarily required to specifically notify you about Art 14 processing if you were already provided this information in a privacy notice.\n\nHowever, \u201cproviding\u201d the information implies a more active approach than merely making the privacy notice easily available on a website. The [ICO says](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/the-right-to-be-informed/when-should-we-provide-privacy-information/#when3) that data controllers \u201cmust proactively make individuals aware of this information and \\[\u2026] need to give them an easy way to access it\u201d.\n\nThe lack of notification from the MID or from Equifax must be viewed critically, but it could technically be that they are compliant if you were notified about their privacy notices by the data sources.\n\nSo this approach would be clearly compliant:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax.\n* Equifax notifies you about their processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n\nBut so would this:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank notifies you about Equifax' processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax, noting that they've already notified you.\n\nThere are of course some exceptions in Art 14(5\\), in particular that notification can be skipped if it would entail \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d. There was a high\\-profile case about this [in Poland](https://uodo.gov.pl/en/553/1009):\n\n* A data controller had collected data from public registries, affecting an estimated 6 million data subjects. The data included contact information such as addresses, phone numbers, emails.\n* The data controller did notify those people for which they had an email address (about 90\u2009000 people, about 1\\.5%).\n* The data controller did not notify other data subjects, citing high costs for sending letters.\n* The Polish UODO (corresponds to the UK ICO) found that this wasn't disproportionate effort, and that the data controller failed to meet its Art 14 obligations.\n* If I remember correctly, the data controller decided to destroy the collected data instead of sending out notifications.\n\nA roughly similar UK case was the [ICO's 7\\.5M GBP fine against Clearview](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2022/05/ico-fines-facial-recognition-database-company-clearview-ai-inc/), though there the breach of transparency obligations was just one of many problems.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A financial technology company, FinTech Plus, collects personal data from various public registries and credit bureaus for credit scoring purposes.

My question is, do these signs constitute reasonable notice (as described below) since they were not posted by the private landowners?\n\n[Arizona Revised Statute 13\\-1502](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01502.htm) states (emphasis mine):\n\n> 13\\-1502\\. Criminal trespass in the third degree; classification\n> \n> \n> A. A person commits criminal trespass in the third degree by:\n> \n> \n> 1. Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable request to leave by a law enforcement officer, the owner or any other person having lawful control over such property, or **reasonable notice prohibiting entry**.\n> 2. Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on the right\\-of\\-way for tracks, or the storage or switching yards or rolling stock of a railroad company.\n> \n> \n> B. Pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, a request to leave by a law enforcement officer acting at the request of the owner of the property or any other person having lawful control over the property has the same legal effect as a request made by the property owner or other person having lawful control of the property.\n> \n> \n> C. Criminal trespass in the third degree is a class 3 misdemeanor.\n\nThe words on the sign are clear enough, but can the county speak for the owner of the vacant lots who, as far as I'm aware, don't know or care about what's going on? Is there any room to interpret the sign as simply a park boundary leaving the owners of the adjacent property to post their own \"no trespassing\" signs as they feel necessary (or not)?\n\nFollow\\-up question: If the sign does constitute an enforceable, *reasonable notice*, would the private property owner(s) have to get involved for trespassing charges to be filed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The county can certainly post a sign on the edge of the county property, informing people that what lies beyond is private property, and no permission to pass has been granted. Unless this was endorsed by the property owner or the owner's agent, I don't think this would constitute the \"reasonable notice\" mentioned in 13\\-1502 A 1 (quoted above) needed to make entry count as criminal trespass. If the property owner authorizes the county to post notices, that is of course different.\n\nI don't see how the county can be considered a \"person having lawful control over such property\" but the law does not say that \"reasonable notice\" must be given by an owner or owner's agent, indeed it does not say who may or may not give such notice. I wonder if there is caselaw on the point.\n\nSince the law makes a request from a law enforcement officer, who could be acting with no authorization from the owner, one of the possible conditions for criminal trespass, I don't see that the owner would need to participate in a trespass action.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Arizona, a county park has posted signs stating \"Private property.

Probate does not have the equivalent of the \"automatic stay\" in bankruptcy that prevents any creditors, secured or unsecured, from engaging in any collection activity against an estate, and probate estates are not allowed to file for bankruptcy either.\n\nIf you really wanted to play hardball and only needed the apartment for a few days in March, the estate could simply continue to occupy it for that period of time and they pay the landlord the extra month's rent but not the additional security deposit when it was done. The landlord can't begin a foreclosure proceeding until there is a default which can't happen sooner than the last day of February. Even if the landlord is really on his toes, the landlord will be hard pressed to get a notice to vacate served on the estate and then to prepare and serve an eviction lawsuit on the estate and get that case in front of a judge before the estate will be ready to move out anyway. The estate might incur some attorneys' fees in the process if it did that, but the attorneys' fees would be an unsecured claim of the landlord that would have to be collected through the claims process in the probate proceeding which is usually a fairly favorable forum for the estate, instead of the usual court where small landlord\\-tenant disputes are handled. The probate estate could simply deny his claim for attorneys' fees and then, if the landlord wanted them after making a claim, the landlord would have to bring a lawsuit on fairly tight deadlines in the probate court to have the disallowance of the claim overturned.\n\nIf you wanted to be even more aggressive, rather than paying the last month's rent, the estate could just holdover into March without paying rent or a new security deposit (vacating before the eviction process can run its course), effectively forcing the landlord to use the security deposit for March rent, and then forcing the landlord to use the probate claims process for both damages to the property claimed and for an attorneys' fees.

This approach ensures transparency, sets clear expectations, and provides a legal framework for the relationship between the entrepreneur, Company A, and Company B.\n\nOption A is insufficient as verbal agreements can lead to misunderstandings and are not legally binding. Option B is risky and potentially unethical, as it fails to disclose important information to the potential employer. Option D, while avoiding potential conflicts, may not be necessary if proper legal agreements are in place and could result in missing out on beneficial opportunities for both the entrepreneur and their startup."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11387/my-landlords-dog-damaged-my-car-who-pays-for-the-damages", "docs_id": 11387, "title": "My landlord&#39;s dog damaged my car.

What I'd like to know:\n\n1. Would judges in the courts of developed countries like USA, UK, France, Germany, etc. give similar instructions in their own courts? Or is this phenomenon, let's say, \"uniquely Indian\"?\n2. If so, what would be the reason a lawyer can't ask a judge questions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question should not include France and Germany, and should be limited to common law jurisdictions that are similar to India, because the function of judges differs starkly between adversarial vs. inquisitorial systems.\n\nThe adversarial model pits two parties against each other, with the judge serving as the decider (of law, and perhaps of fact). The parties can offer witnesses, who can be compelled to respond to questions, and the attorney asking the question gets to control the question asked (subject to a possible objection by the other party, to be ruled on by the judge).\n\nThe judge can rule on requests (which are not questions) i.e. petitions by either party. Otherwise, the judge sits there more or less mute, soaking up the argumentation being presented. Appellate proceedings are somewhat special in that the justices may address questions to the attorney, in order to better understand the logic of the proffered argument. The burden is on the attorney to make the case. There is *no* direct burden on the justice to \"make a case\". The \"court of public opinion\" may be relevant in a jurisdiction where the justice is an elected office or is appointed for limited time. Or, the contrary opinion of a higher court may have some influence on a justice's rulings \u2013 this is not the case with a Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, it would be highly dysfunctional within the adversarial system for a party to be allowed to interrogate a judge.

The judge remains mostly silent during proceedings, allowing the opposing parties to present their arguments and evidence. The judge's main functions are to rule on objections, ensure proper court procedure is followed, and ultimately make decisions based on the arguments and evidence presented. The judge does not actively investigate or interrogate (unlike in an inquisitorial system), nor does the judge typically engage in direct dialogue with lawyers or suggest compromises.

Neither does any legislation ever adopted (apart from the efforts of the former Confederate States to leave the Union without its consent which was repudiated by the U.S. Civil War and related legal and political proceedings).\n\nAs Nate Eldredge noted in a comment, the preamble of the United States Constitution states that it was adopted \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves **and our Posterity**\".\n\nThe fact that the Constitution contained a transition provision in relation to its \"natural born citizen\" requirement for a country that didn't exist prior to 1776 does nothing to change any of this analysis.\n\n> The founding fathers had no authority to bind anybody but themselves.\n\nThe assumed rule that someone has no authority to bind anyone but themselves is not now, and never has been, the law.\n\nThe authority of people to bind people other than themselves, including successors who aren't even born yet, to legal documents, is long standing in both Western and Eastern legal systems.\n\nAgents can bind principals. Employees can bind employers. Union officials can bind their members. Partners can unilaterally bind each other. People creating trusts can bind the trustees and beneficiaries of the trust long after they are dead; charitable trusts can be perpetual. Military officers can bind their subordinates. Parents can bind their children in many jurisdictions. Guardians and conservators can bind their wards. Executors of estates can bind a decedent's heir and devisees. Home owners associations can bind member property owners and their guests. Governments can bind their residents. Sovereigns can bind their subjects.\n\nBefore the modern concept of property arose in the early modern period (i.e. prior to around 1500 CE), real estate ownership was primarily hereditary and inalienable, as was the serf\\-lord relationship. Transfers of property are not undone when the person who makes them ceases to exist. Real estate covenants routinely \"run with the land\" after they are created by the current owners.\n\nThe legal obligations you enter into while you are alive are binding upon your estate at death. In the civil law countries with legal systems based upon those of Continental Europe (derived in turn from Roman law), the default rule is still that the obligations of a decedent are binding upon the decedent's next of kin, although it is not terribly difficult to opt out of that default rule in the heir's discretion after death if they elect to do so (and many do). Until not long before the Industrial Revolution, in the late early modern period of history, most Western legal systems, and East Asian legal systems, provided that your descendants continued to be bound by your debts and could not opt out of that obligation.\n\nWhen a legal entity is bound, all successor owners, directors, officers, managers, and partners of the entity are bound perpetually by anything done by someone with apparent authority to do so and by judgments entered against the entity.\n\nThe United States of America is, of course, a legal entity which is not operated for profit, so the ability of its founders to bind successive generations is a pedestrian principle that follows from ordinary non\\-constitutional law anyway.\n\nA treaty between nations are binding long after every single person who signed of on it is dead.\n\nThe assumed rule that someone can bind only themselves simply does not pass even casual examination.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements best describes the intended duration of the United States Constitution?\n\nA) The Constitution was meant to expire once all the founding fathers had passed away.\nB) The Constitution was intended to be temporary, with each generation writing a new one.\nC) The Constitution was designed to be perpetual, subject to the amendment process outlined within it.\nD) The Constitution's duration was left intentionally ambiguous by the founding fathers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

If you engage them on a [cost\\-plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-plus_contract) basis, you are taking the risk on cost.\n\nIn this clause you are agreeing to indemnify the operators against third\\-party claims associated with your account howsoever caused.

While contracts are fundamentally about risk allocation, and this clause allocates risk to the user, it could potentially be challenged on grounds of unconscionability or unfair contract terms in some jurisdictions.\n\nThe clause is not obviously unconscionable at face value, which would make it void under common law. However, some jurisdictions have laws against unfair contract terms in consumer contracts, which are judged based on their practical effects rather than just their wording at the time of contract formation.\n\nAdditionally, the answer notes that indemnity clauses typically don't protect against deliberate acts, fraud, or crimes by the beneficiary. Some jurisdictions also have proportionate liability legislation that might override broad indemnity clauses.\n\nTherefore, while the clause isn't automatically unenforceable everywhere (ruling out option B), nor is it universally enforceable (ruling out option A), its enforceability could be subject to legal challenge and scrutiny in certain jurisdictions, making C the most accurate answer."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89867/can-patents-be-featured-explained-in-a-youtube-video-i-e-are-patent-description", "docs_id": 89867, "title": "Can patents be featured/explained in a youtube video i.e. are patent descriptions/images in public domain?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legally allowed to use images, which are obtained from patent forms, possibly with modifying/coloring them or left as is, inside youtube videos?

Alex paying the bill afterwards does not constitute a direct purchase of alcohol by a minor, as Alex never possessed the alcohol or entered into a contract with the restaurant to buy it.

The law states that it is an offense to contrive, prepare, establish, operate, advertise, sell, or promote a pyramid promotional scheme, regardless of transparency.

As part of this, they have sent around an update to the employment contract which basically nullifies the flexible working hours which previously has been in effect. Many people I work with vary their working hours to fit in with their lives, and has been accepted \\- up to this point.\n\nThe business operated a core working hours of 10am to 4pm, but are changing this to 9am \\- 5pm, with a 30 minute \"flexible start/end\" that employees can start and end their working day (e.g; 8\\.30am to 5pm, or 9am to 5\\.30pm) \\- effectively removing the concept of flexible working hours completely. This affects many people's lives, and some of my colleagues are petitioning to retain their flexible working hours, of which are being met with strict rules surrounding a mandatory lunch hour/half hour, no option to work less than this to make up the time (despite being willing to), and one has been forced to drop their hours to 36/week.\n\nThey also put in a clause to the portion that they're wanting everyone to sign which says that everyone must specify when, between the hours to 12pm to 2pm, they will take their lunch, and must be rigid over this (unless a meeting is occurring, in which case that overrides your lunch hour and you must take it later). This was also met with protest, and they eventually caved and relaxed this rigidity slightly, then sent across some minutes from that meeting ratifying this. They will not, however, update the contract to reflect this as they've said that the meeting minutes ratifies it. However, we don't believe this would ever stand up in court if a dispute ever arose. Is this true?\n\nThe final part of this demands flexibility from the employee for the business's requirements (e.g; if a meeting runs late/starts early, the employee is expected to be there), but will not offer the same level of flexibilities to staff who currently have lives (unless they offer a rigid, business\\-valid justification for doing so). It's almost as if they're \"offering\" this 30 minutes of flexibility to save face because on paper the revision is a load of rubbish.\n\nMany people do not want to sign this, as it significantly affects their lives (I myself work earlier in the morning to finish at 4pm to miss rush hour traffic in both directions, and so I have a little bit of daylight left at the end of the day \\- however I've been told that I would not be able to petition for flexible working hours with these reasons as they are not valid and would be rejected..and have also been told that I would be one of the worst affected by the change in rules). The move to the new building also offers no car parking space, so those that currently park on the company's property are effectively having to take a pay cut in order to pay for parking, or obtain an alternative means of getting to the office \\- usually at the additional expensive of significantly increased commute times.\n\nMy question is basically this \\- Can they legally do this? What are the options for employees if they disagree to the new rigid rules and will (or have) get a formal request for flexible working hours rejected because their reasons are not \"valid\" in the eyes of the business?

Holding a gun to your head?\n\nThat said, you are free to not sign anything and just keep obeying the existing contract. The employer is equally free to do the same: if they are no longer happy with the old contract and you do not want to sign the new one, they have two options:\n\n* try to negotiate a new contact that you are\nhappy with; or\n* look at the \"Termination\" section of the old one and see how they can\nlegally stop employing you.\n\nIf \"*many people do not want to sign this*\" it might be sensible to organise them to not sign the new contract and start negotiations instead.

Employees have the right to refuse changes to their existing contracts. However, if employees refuse to sign, the employer is not obligated to maintain the current working arrangements indefinitely. The employer has two main options: negotiate with employees to find mutually agreeable terms, or explore legal ways to terminate the existing contract if an agreement cannot be reached.

The documentation indicates that while such trading algorithms were clearly patentable in the past, recent Supreme Court decisions have made it more difficult to patent and enforce these types of claims. The court tends to reduce such claims to their basic concept (e.g., \"buy low, sell high\"), making patentability challenging. Additionally, even if a patent is granted, there are concerns about enforceability and detecting infringement. While a skilled patent practitioner might still be able to get a patent granted, its enforceability in court could be questionable.

Such is known as the \"dual sovereignty\" or \"separate sovereigns\" doctrine\n\nIn [*United States v. Lanza*, 260 U.S. 377 (1922\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/260/377/) the US Supreme Court wrote:\n\n> The defendants insist that two punishments for the same act, one under the National Prohibition Act and the other under a state law, constitute double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment, and, in support of this position, it is argued that both laws derive their force from the same authority \\-\\- the second section of the amendment \\-\\- and therefore that, in principle, it is as if both punishments were in prosecutions by the United States in its courts.\n\n...\n\n> It follows that an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both, and may be punished by each. The Fifth Amendment, like all the other guaranties in the first eight amendments, applies only to proceedings by the federal government, Barron v. City of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, and the double jeopardy therein forbidden is a second prosecution under authority of the federal government after a first trial for the same offense under the same authority. Here, the same act was an offense against the state of Washington, because a violation of its law, and also an offense against the United States under the National Prohibition Act. The defendants thus committed two different offenses by the same act, and a conviction by a court of Washington of the offense against that state is not a conviction of the different offense against the United States, and so is not double jeopardy\n\nIt is interesting to note that as late as 1922 this court seemed to think that none of the bill of rights had been incorporated into the 14th amendment and thus made applicable to the states.

This scenario illustrates the \"dual sovereignty\" or \"separate sovereigns\" doctrine. Under this principle, both state and federal governments can prosecute an individual for the same act if it violates both state and federal laws. This is not considered double jeopardy because they are treated as two different offenses against two separate sovereigns. \n\nThe Supreme Court case United States v. Lanza (1922) affirmed this doctrine, stating that an act violating both state and federal laws is an offense against both sovereignties and can be punished by each. \n\nFurthermore, the defendant's guilty plea in state court could potentially be used as evidence in the federal case, as it's a separate proceeding. While plea bargains often include agreements about how information can be used, without specific protections, a guilty plea in one jurisdiction could be admissible in another.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they misunderstand the dual sovereignty doctrine.
