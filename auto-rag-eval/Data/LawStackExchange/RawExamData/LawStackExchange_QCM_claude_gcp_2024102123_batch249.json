        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the historical purpose and implications of Dance Hall Keeper Licenses in the United States?\n\nA) They were primarily implemented as a revenue generation tool for local governments with no other significant purpose.\n\nB) They were designed to promote dancing and nightlife culture in urban areas.\n\nC) They served as a regulatory measure to control and restrict dancing in establishments serving alcohol, reflecting historical social and moral concerns.\n\nD) They were created to ensure proper safety standards and crowd control measures in large dance venues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Dance Hall Keeper Licenses historically served as a regulatory measure to control and restrict dancing in establishments serving alcohol, reflecting social and moral concerns of the time. This is evidenced by the long history of prohibitions against dancing, especially in venues that also served alcohol, in the United States. The example of New York City's Cabaret Law, which forbade dancing at establishments serving food and liquor without a specific license until its repeal in 2017, further supports this interpretation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, while revenue generation might have been a side effect, it wasn't the primary purpose of these licenses. Option B is incorrect as these licenses were more about restriction than promotion of nightlife. Option D, while plausible, is not supported by the historical context provided in the information, which emphasizes moral and social control rather than safety standards."

I think there is a legal term for this in Latin but I cannot find it.\n\nMy question is focusing on the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nI have done some research, and it appears that ex de facto law is not allowed in the United Kingdom to follow directions given by the European Union.

But, as the question states:\n\n> my question is about actions that were illegal and then had changes\n> made to them.\n\nIf something is a crime in 2015 and this criminal law is violated, and the conduct is then legalized in 2016, the conduct committed while it was a crime does not cease to be punishable as a crime and may be punished criminally.\n\nOften a judge would consider the fact that the conduct was later legalized when evaluating the seriousness of the crime at a post\\-legalization sentencing, but a judge is not required to do so.\n\nA significant number of pardons and commutations of criminal sentences by Presidents and Governors in the U.S. involve people convicted of crimes for conduct that is now legal or is now punished less severely.

In the United States, if an act was illegal at the time it was committed, it remains punishable even if the law later changes to legalize that act. This is not an ex post facto situation, which refers to making previously legal acts illegal retroactively. While a judge may consider the subsequent legalization when determining the sentence, they are not legally required to do so. Pardons or commutations for such cases are discretionary and not automatic. The U.S. does not have constitutional protections that give newly lenient treatment of crimes retroactive effect, unlike some other countries such as France."

Meng*, [2020 BCSC 785](https://canlii.ca/t/j7x3n).\n\nThe authority to extradite is via the extraditing state's treaty with the U.S. and its domestic implementing legislation. In Canada, this is the *Extradition Act*. Extradition requires consent of the extraditing state and for the requesting state to follow the extraditing state's domestic procedure.\n\nThe question you raise is how sanctions of requesting state affect the interpretation of the domestic offence for the purpose of establishing the *double criminality* requirement.\n\nCritical in this case was that the charged offence was fraud against HSBC (albeit based on alleged concealment of sanctions violations).\n\nSee para. 23:\n\n> The double criminality question in the committal hearing is therefore whether Ms. Meng\u2019s alleged conduct, had it occurred in Canada, would have amounted to fraud contrary to s. 380(1\\)(a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nMs. Meng argued:\n\n> that the conduct cannot amount to fraud because in essence the proposed prosecution is to enforce US sanctions laws against Iran, measures that are not part of Canadian law and which, indeed, Canada has expressly rejected.\n\nThe Attorney General argued:\n\n> that the double criminality analysis may properly take the US sanctions into account as part of the foreign legal backdrop against which the essential conduct is to be understood.\n\nThe court agreed with the Attorney General:\n\n> The effects of the US sanctions may properly play a role in the double criminality analysis as part of the background or context against which the alleged conduct is examined.",

The key factor in this case was that the charged offense was fraud against HSBC, not a direct violation of US sanctions. The court ruled that the US sanctions could be considered as part of the background or context for understanding the alleged conduct, but the core offense (fraud) had to meet the double criminality requirement under Canadian law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the extradition was not based solely on sanctions violations, but on fraud charges.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Canada's Extradition Act does not explicitly address sanctions violations. The case was evaluated based on the principle of double criminality.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the US does not have universal jurisdiction to enforce its sanctions globally. The extradition process still requires the consent and cooperation of the extraditing country.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complexities in international extradition cases, particularly when they involve sanctions not recognized by the extraditing country."

Under [NRS\u2002205\\.240](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-205.html#NRS205Sec240), this is a misdemeanor, petty larceny, the [maximum penalty for which](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-193.html#NRS193Sec150) is not more than 6 months in prison and a fine of not more than $1,000, plus restitution. [8 USC 1227](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227) makes certain crimes deportable offenses, but shoplifting isn't one of them.

The \"risk\" is harder to calculate, if you mean \"the most likely penalty\". There is a substantial chance that the maximum penalty will be getting yelled at by the store manager, and even if you are arrested by the police there is a good chance that the matter (as a first offense, right? no aggravating circumstances) will not result in a trial because you will have the opportunity to \"negotiate\" the matter to probation, to avoid a trial.

I say that because [summary judgment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_56) motions often come after the discovery phase (not always, but the rule is one must be filed within 30 days of the conclusion of the discovery phase), which may take a significant amount of time. Perhaps, of course, the judge becomes aware of new information unrelated to discovery. Nonetheless, if the dismissal were on jurisdiction grounds or some other issue that was known ahead of time, it is unlikely he or she would wait to dismiss. \n\nThat said, courts may act *[sua sponte](https://legaldictionary.net/sua-sponte/)*, which means on its own / absent a motion by the parties. \n\nWith respect to a new trial or not, an example of being dismissed without prejudice and, thus, allowing the trial to begin again, may be a major error in the plaintiffs filing.

In an effort to turn some norms effectively into rules, can states add to their requirements for a person to be on the ballot? For example, 5 years of tax returns must be released to the public? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [US Term Limits v. Thornton](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17556563688641585277&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr), 514 US 779, the Supreme Court recites the constitutional requirements for holding national office as representative or senator, which pertain to age and citizenship\\+residence. The court held that an Arkansas law \"prohibiting the name of an otherwise\\-eligible candidate for Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate has already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate\" was unconstitutional, and \"Allowing individual States to adopt their own qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legislature representing the people of the United States\". The same reasoning would hold for setting qualifications for the office of President. However, in [Bush v. Gore](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/), 531 U.S. 98, the court pointed out that \"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the electoral college\", noting that \"The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors\".\n\nIt is uncontroversial that states have the right to impose conditions on ballot access, and that a person does not have an automatic right to be on the ballot simply by applying for candidacy. You might argue that being required to 20,000 signatures on a petition constitutes imposing an unconstitutional qualification on a candidate, but the Supreme Court has so far not clearly found such ballot access provisions to be unconstitutional.\nStill, there is some room for argumentation. [This page](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/ballot/supreme.htm) lists the 11 decisions regarding ballot access. In the first case, [Williams v. Rhodes](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/393/23/), 393 U.S. 23, the court overturned a requirement to garner 15% of the total votes in the last gubernatorial election for a new party to be on the ballot, finding that the laws \"are invidiously discriminatory and violate the Equal Protection Clause\", but later decisions tended to accept requirements with later filing dates or lower percentages. Filing fees are generally seen as an unconstitutional burden ([Bullock v. Carter](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/134/), 405 U.S. 134, [Lubin v. Panish](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/415/709/), 415 U.S. 709\\). It is hard to see how requiring a candidate to submit their tax returns could be seen as an unconstitutional burden.\n\nWhen it comes to state elections, there is even less of an argument that a state cannot impose such requirements (on dog\\-catcher, legislator, or governor). Though in an individual state, there might be a constitutional provision speaking against such a law.",

The Court held that allowing individual states to set their own qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legislature. This principle would likely extend to presidential candidates as well.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because states do not have complete authority over ballot access for federal offices.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A driver collides with a truck stopped on the roadside that was conducting road work. The truck only had its hazard lights on and no other warning signs. In this scenario, who is primarily responsible for the accident according to traffic laws?\n\nA) The driver of the moving vehicle, as it's always the driver's responsibility to avoid collisions with stationary objects.\nB) The truck driver, for failing to place proper warning signs around the work area.\nC) Both drivers share equal responsibility, as both were negligent in their duties.\nD) The local department of transportation, for not providing adequate signage for ongoing road work.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. According to traffic laws, it is always the driver's responsibility to operate their vehicle safely and avoid collisions with stationary objects, regardless of whether those objects are properly marked or not. While the truck driver may receive a minor citation for improper parking or inadequate signage, this does not relieve the moving vehicle's driver of their primary responsibility to maintain control of their vehicle and avoid obstacles. Even in cases where a stationary vehicle or object may be improperly placed or marked, the onus is on the driver of the moving vehicle to navigate safely around it."

I imagine you'd be arrested and in jail until your trial, but I'm wondering what would happen afterward. Is this likely to be considered a defensive move and could you be found not guilty if you were taken to court? And if you're taken to court and found guilty, what would the consequences be like \\-\\- a few days behind bars maybe, or a years\\-long prison sentence?\n\nAssume you're not trying to permanently injure the officer here, just some temporary/minor injuries so he gets the message. The goal is obviously to defend the other guy with a bit of force, not to attack the officer and make him fear for his life. So by the time the court date rolls around, he'll at most have a bruise, if anything.\n\n---\n\n(*Editorial note: Yes, the better passenger\\-initiated solution would've been for someone else to give up their seat, but if for whatever reason you didn't do that and this was the only option left...*)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I suspect that you would not be convicted in the present case, because the jury would be sympathetic to the plight of the person being dragged out and unsympathetic to the behavior of the draggers. However, we should set aside the emotional elements of a jury trial and focus on legal principles. The basic question is whether a person has the right to use force to [defend against an unlawful battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense_(United_States)): \"a person is privileged to use such force as reasonably appears necessary to defend him or herself against an apparent threat of unlawful and immediate violence from another\". This right to defense also extends to defense of others. But it has to appear to be to unlawful, which is to say, you have to reasonably believe that the force used against the victim is unlawful. If a couple of thugs try to drag a person away, then an observer probably has a reasonable belief that this is an unlawful battery. But if a couple of police officers are observed dragging a person away (arresting him), apparently acting officially, the force used (up to a point) is apparently lawful and would not constitute battery of the victim. For defensive force against police to be lawful, the forced used by the police must be excessive.\n\nThe outcome then depends on what a reasonable person would conclude (this is where the jury or judge makes a rather subjective decision). If a reasonable person would conclude that the assailants are acting lawfully in arresting the person, then a higher bar must be clear to justifiably use force in defense of others. Wearing a jacket that says \"Police\" favors the \"appears lawful\" side (though if you happened to know for a fact that the person wearing the jacket is *not* a police officer, then the \"police exception\" would not be applicable). In the relevant case, the facts point to the appearance of a lawful arrest (even if were to turn out to be judged unlawful).\n\nIn the case that this is an apparent arrest, it would have to be the case that a reasonable person would find the force used to be excessive. Generally speaking, force used by officers is held to be reasonable, except in some cases where it is not. See for example the matter of [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner), where the officers involved were not indicted. On the third hand, in this case, it might matter what the actual legal status of the \"officers\" is (they are not Chicago police).",

This standard would be used to determine whether the intervening passenger had a reasonable belief that the force being used against the removed passenger was unlawful and excessive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while self-defense is related, the question specifically deals with defense of others, not self-defense.\n\nOption C, while relevant, is not the most crucial factor. The excessive force doctrine would be considered as part of the reasonable person's assessment of the situation, but it's not the primary legal principle at play.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Good Samaritan laws typically protect individuals who provide emergency assistance, not those who intervene in what appears to be a law enforcement action.\n\nThe reasonable person standard (B) is the most relevant because it encompasses the overall assessment of the situation, including whether the \"officers\" appeared to be acting lawfully, whether their force seemed excessive, and whether intervention was justified based on what a reasonable person would conclude in those circumstances."

I'm 22 years old, and in Spain someone is considered an adult when they turn 18 years old. Could my father kick me out in these circumstances?\n\nEdit: My grandfather doesn't rent the house to my parents, he allows us to live there. But the bills (water, light, etc...) are sent to my parents. I don't know if this could be relevant.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note: All links in Spanish (sorry).\n\nRegardless or your father being or not the legal owner of the home, the issue at play is that of \n***alimentos***1.\n\nThis is an obligation between some family relationships to help each other so if family member (the *alimentista*) is in dire need of help (i.e., needs the help to survive) the others have the obligation to provide the help.\n\nThe [relatives of the *alimentista* affected are](http://iabogado.com/guia-legal/familia/los-alimentos-entre-parientes#01100200000000), in order:\n\n* The couple, always when married and only when expressly agreed upon for non\\-married couples.\n* Descendants: sons/daughters and grandsons/granddaughters.\n* Ascendants: parents and grandparents.\n* Brothers: Only when indispensable and the minimum amount.\n\nThe order determines who of all the family members is under obligation to provide the help; in case of multiple people in the same category the amount is to be divided between them in function of their income.\n\nThe amount of the help is not fixed and will depend of the circunstances of the situation2; and it is possible to provide by providing the needs(shelter, food) directly.\n\nNow, until when does a father/grandfather need to provide *alimentos* to a son or daughter? Certainly until s/he is 183, as this is the date of full age in Spain, but it is usual to consider that the obligation exists while the *alimentista* is studying and lacks of his/her own means of subsistence.\n\nThat is not a \"free rider\" situation, as *alimentos* may be denied by several reasons:\n\n* Obviously, because the person that should provide the help does not have the means to do so without endangering his own subsistence.\n* The *alimentista* gets his/her own means of subsistence.\n* Any of the causes that would make the *alimentista* unable to inherit from the person providing the help4: attempted murder, coercion to change their will, and other grave crimes.\n* The *alimentista* does not do enough to get his/her own means of subsistence. If a judge decides that the *alimentista* son/daughter is neither studying nor seriously trying to get a job, the help can be revoked. [Judges seem to be progressively taking a harsher stance against descendants who refuse to do their part](http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/nini-ocde-pension-audiencia-tribunal_supremo_0_536146504.html). The article quotes the case of a 19 years old guy whose claim to the pension was denied.\n\nAs a side note, rejecting to pay *alimentos* is another of the causes that would cause the person doing it to lose any right to inheritance from the *alimentista*.\n\nIf for whatever the reason you do not qualify for *alimentos*, the details of the agreement between your father and your grandfather for the home become relevant5:\n\n* If your father has formally rented the house then your grandfather position is not relevant, as your father has all of the rights6.\n* If your grandfather allows your father to live in the house without paying rent, then it is your grandfather rights as owner against your father rights as an occupant. No idea about the outcome of that situation.\n\n**UPDATE:**\nYou still do not tell about your grandfather stance about the issue, which is important. If your grandfather agrees with your father7 then the only way to stay at home is that of *alimentos*.\n\nWhat you describe is a situation of either [*precario* or *comodato*](https://www.mundojuridico.info/diferencia-entre-precario-y-comodato/), where your grandfather allows the use of the home without compensation. The differences are:\n\n* *precario* is for an undefined time.\n* *comodato* is for a defined time/use (e.g. for X years).\n\nNow, I have to suppose that you are not part of the agreement so it is just between your father and grandfather. That makes it your father's dwelling, and beyond *alimentos* he cannot be forced to share his dwelling with you.\n\nBut if this is a situation of *precario* (which is what most often happens) your grandfather has the \"nuclear option\"8 of threatening to evict your father, as it is a relatively easy (in the legal sense, not the personal one) procedure. In a situation of *comodato* your grandfather could not evict your father until the conditions of the cession expire, making threats somewhat weaker.\n\nAs a final note, and given how specific this answer has become:\n\n* I am not a lawyer, you have not provided enough specific info, and this is not legal advice. Talk to a lawyer. Maybe a lawyer will check the agreement and it will turn out that your father is paying rent by performing some service, voiding the *precario* aspect. Maybe with the details provided the lawyer can find a way to an agreement that is more amenable to all. Talk to a lawyer.\n* Shut up. The issue at hand may be stressful, and sometimes it might be tempting to boast to your father about the issues of *alimentos* or *precario*. Don't. If there is something to be said about that, let your lawyer do the talking. Try to stay calm.\n* Consider the effect of your actions before taking them. While there is nothing wrong with talking to a lawyer, going beyond that and beginning a legal battle with members of your own family is most of the times an ugly affair. It could easily have an effect for a very long time in your relationship with most of your family, even with those who are not directly implied. Try to stay calm.\n\n---\n\n1 Literally, \"foodstuffs\", but when used as a legal term it includes other basic needs.\n\n2 There are some official guidelines but judges seem to have freedom to follow them or not.\n\n3 I believe that there are some exceptional reasons to lose such right before becoming 18 (e.g., sons condemned of attacking their fathers and the like) but I have no specific data about those.\n\n4 As a side note, in Spain last wills do not allow the \"donor\" to distribute the goods freely, as some porcentajes of the inheritance must obligatory be provided to descendants and widowers.\n\n5 Of course, in the case that your grandfather wanted to oppose your father's decision.\n\n6 Since one of the legal reasons to end a rent agreement is to provide a home for a first degree relative, your grandfather could expel you from your rented home to give it to your father, but not the other way around.\n\n7 And \"agree\" does not mean \"Is happy with the decision\" but \"Will not go to the court to challenge your father decision\".\n\n8 Which is a very relevant analogy, because it could be almost as damaging to your family as a literal nuclear bomb.",

However, if a judge determines that the adult child is neither studying nor seriously trying to get a job, the obligation to provide support (including housing) can be revoked. The ownership of the house (whether by the grandfather or parents) is less relevant in this case than the child's efforts to become independent. If the child is not making such efforts, they can lose their right to stay in the family home, regardless of who owns it. Options B and C are incorrect because neither the father nor the grandfather has absolute authority to evict the adult child if the child is fulfilling their obligations. Option D is incorrect because Spanish law does not unconditionally protect adult children living with parents."

All Three times. With only one exception. [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\n1. I assume that John declared \"Sperrm\u00fcll\" and put it out for collection or was put into the black bin. The chair thus was properly intended to be given to the trash collection service. The declared item was put out for collection or chucked into the bin. Till the moment the waste truck arrives, the item is property of John, then he relinquishes ownership via [\u00a7 959 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__959.html) [Abandonment of Ownership](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p3867) the moment the declared item is pricked up by the intended recipient, which has (prospect) ownership interest1. For example, waste disposal services could burn a wood chair for its thermic value, a metal one would be scrapped etc. Jane isn't allowed to take it, so she steals from them2 under [\u00a7 242 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html#) [Theft](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2228)3.\n\n\t* In case John just put the chair onto the street without anything in the intent to dispose of it, he might be guilty of \"[Unerlaubter Umgang mit Abf\u00e4llen\"](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__326.html#) aka \"Wild Littering\" ([\u00a7 326 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__326.html#) [Unauthorised Waste Management](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p3054)) if he can be identified, but at the same time, Jane does steal from him under [\u00a7 242 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html#) [Theft](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2228), as he never relinquished ownership properly (because \u00a7326 and local ordinances preclude that).\n\t* John puts out the chair to dispose of it to *anyone* and makes sure it's clear to everybody that he has relinquished his ownership to whoever wants it by putting a sign *gift* or *for free* on it. Now he still might commit wild littering but he also properly relinquishes the item under [\u00a7 959 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__959.html) [Abandonment of Ownership](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p3867), Jane would acquire the chair under [\u00a7 958 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__958.html) [Acquisition of ownership of ownerless movable things](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p3864)\n\t* In case John didn't want to dispose of the chair but just place it there so he can have a break there later, it's just Jane committing theft under [\u00a7 242 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html#) [Theft](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2228).\n2. The chair was John's property for sale. Jane took it without the required payment to make it a sale contract and the intent to deprive him of chair and money. So she steals it under [\u00a7 242 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html#) [Theft](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2228).\n3. It's exactly the same case as 2, but replace \"chair\" with \"cookies\".\n\n---\n\n1 \\- if John doesn't own the item, he can't relinquish the item and so technically the waste disposal service does commit theft, yet in declaring the item for collection, John also declared he would own all items or have the allowance to put them for collection or pay for any and all damages that result from him disposing of the items.\n\n2 \\- the collective of both John and the Waste Disposal Service \\- technically both can sue jointly and separately\n\n3 \\- As an extra caveat: John *also* needs to make sure that his Sperrm\u00fcll doesn't create dangers or harms anyone, as he is liable for damages from it till it is collected. *Even* if Jane would throw around the waste and create the danger. The best he might manage is to get part of the fines back from Jane for contributing to the danger, but he is technically required to prevent or remove the danger.",

In cases such as Golan v. Holder (2012) and Eldred v. Ashcroft (2002), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of copyright term extensions. The Court reasoned that such extensions still fall under the \"limited times\" provision of the Constitution's Copyright Clause and that they have a rational basis in promoting the progress of science and useful arts. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while ex post facto laws primarily concern criminal matters, the constitutional issue here is more related to the Copyright Clause than ex post facto concerns.\n\nOption C is incorrect because copyright is not considered a contract that can be unilaterally modified. It's a statutorily granted right.\n\nOption D is incorrect because these extensions have been challenged in court, as evidenced by the Supreme Court cases mentioned.\n\nThe Court also noted that such extensions do not violate ex post facto principles as they do not impose retroactive punishment, and fair use remains available as a defense. This interpretation allows for the extension of copyright terms, even for works that were previously set to enter the public domain."

From code we are retrieving his purchaseToken (using [this API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference#getPurchases) ) and saving purchaseToken on our server to validate his license. \n\nAccording to documentation on above page \"purchaseToken\" is defined as \"A token that uniquely identifies a purchase for a given item and **user pair**\".\n\nFrom my side as developer: we cannot get exact user who purchased this item based on purchaseToken. Google does not provide such possibility (no API for this). But in theory \u2013 if somebody has token \\+ access to Google database \u2013 he can identify user exactly.\n\nSo the question is: For me as Android Developer, is \"purchaseToken\" identified as PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or not? \n\nThe question is important, because depending on if it is true or false I have to inform user or do not inform about that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: IANAL, But the information commissioners office (UK) describe personal data as: (bolding mine)\n\n> The GDPR applies to \u2018personal data\u2019 meaning any information relating\n>  to an identifiable person who can be directly or **indirectly identified**\n>  in particular by reference to an identifier.\n> \n> \n> This definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to\n>  constitute personal data, including name, **identification number**,\n>  location data or **online identifier**, reflecting changes in technology\n>  and the way organisations collect information about people.\n\n[https://ico.org.uk/for\\-organisations/guide\\-to\\-the\\-general\\-data\\-protection\\-regulation\\-gdpr/key\\-definitions/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/)\n\nSo I would say that in your case it is personal information.\n\nIn principle, regardless of if *you* can identify an individual, personal data is that which *can* be used to potentially identify an individual. \n\nFor an extreme example of why this is important: Lets say your app sells AIDs medication. Can a hacker who got in and stole your database, be able to use that with information they stole elsewhere to identify people with AIDs and blackmail them, **in a way that they wouldn't if you had not stored this identifier?**\n\nPlus, if you want to err on the side of caution, there's no legal penalty for telling the user about non\\-personal information you store.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal and privacy implications of storing this purchaseToken?\n\nA) The purchaseToken is not considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) because the developer cannot directly identify the user from it.\n\nB) The purchaseToken is considered PII only if the developer has access to Google's databases.\n\nC) The purchaseToken should be treated as PII because it can indirectly identify a user when combined with other information.\n\nD) The purchaseToken is only considered PII if the app deals with sensitive information like medical data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the UK Information Commissioner's Office's interpretation of GDPR, personal data includes information that can be used to indirectly identify an individual. Even though the developer cannot directly identify the user from the purchaseToken, it is still considered PII because:\n\n1. It uniquely identifies a purchase for a given item and user pair.\n2. It could potentially be used to identify an individual if combined with other information or if accessed by someone with the right database access.\n3. The definition of personal data includes \"identification numbers\" and \"online identifiers,\" which a purchaseToken could be considered.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the inability of the developer to directly identify the user doesn't negate its status as PII. Answer B is too narrow, as PII status doesn't depend on the developer's access to additional databases. Answer D is incorrect because PII classification isn't limited to apps dealing with sensitive information, though such apps might have additional privacy concerns."

In this instance, am I still able to claim intellectual property theft if I do not want them to use said graphics anymore if I have proof that I am the one that created these designs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Disclaimer: armchair lawyerin' by a non\\-lawyer below. The following answer is specific to US law.*\n\nUnder US law, the copyright of a \"work for hire\" belongs to the party paying for it, not the creator. However, to be considered as a work for hire, the creator must either be an employee or have a signed a written contract stating that this is a work for hire:\n\n> A \u201cwork made for hire\u201d is\u2014\n> \n> \n> 1. a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or\n> 2. a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.\n\nWhether or not the creator is an employee of the company hinges upon many factors; see [Community for Creative Non\\-Violence v. Reid (1989\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_for_Creative_Non-Violence_v._Reid) for more details. But if the work was not a \"work for hire\", then the creator generally retains copyright.\n\nThat said, it is also likely that if someone does work for a company without a contract, that company gains an [implied license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_license) to use the work for the originally intended purposes. Moreover, if the creator receives \"consideration\" (i.e., anything else of value) for the work, this license is irrevocable. In [Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon (2008\\),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_Marketing_Systems,_Inc._v._Gagnon)\na contractor tried to revoke his permission for a company to use code that he had written. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that if a company pays a creator to create a work, the work is delivered to the company, and the creator intends for the company to copy \\& distribute that work, then the company has an implied, non\\-exclusive, irrevocable license to distribute the work.\n\nIf this situation applies, then a creator probably can't force the company to stop using the work for the originally intended purposes. However, if the company started using it for substantially different purposes, the creator might be able to stop them from doing that. Establishing what counts as \"substantially different\", and what was \"originally intended\" in the case of a verbal contract, is something that gets established in court on a case\\-by\\-case basis; that's why lawyers get the big money.\n\nETA, after seeing your comment: nothing in what I've said is specific to \"companies\" licensing and/or owning copyright in the work. Even if the original transaction was \"person to person\", the above principles probably still apply.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The designer automatically retains full copyright and can demand immediate cessation of use by the business.\n\nB) The business owns the copyright as it's considered \"work for hire\" even without a written agreement.\n\nC) The designer likely retains copyright, but the business probably has an implied, non-exclusive license to continue using the designs for their original purpose.\n\nD) The designer and business have equal rights to the designs and must come to a mutual agreement on future use.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this scenario, the work is not automatically considered \"work for hire\" because there was no written agreement specifying it as such, and the designer was not an employee of the business. Therefore, the designer likely retains the copyright to the designs.\n\nHowever, based on the concept of implied license as outlined in cases like Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon (2008), the business probably has an implied, non-exclusive license to continue using the designs for their originally intended purpose. This is especially true if the designer received any form of compensation or consideration for the work, which would make the license irrevocable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the designer may retain copyright, they cannot automatically demand cessation of use due to the implied license.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because without a written agreement or employment relationship, the work is not automatically considered \"work for hire.\"\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the rights are not equal; the designer likely retains copyright, while the business has a limited license to use the designs."

Publishers protect themselves in two ways. First, via their review and acceptance procedures they attempt to detect infringement, following general (not necessarily reliable) guidelines as to how much copying is \"fair use\". Second, the license agreement / copyright transfer contains an indemnification clause whereby the author vows that they have the sole right to authorize publication of the material, and the author agrees to legally protect the publisher (pay their legal costs and any judgments, etc) in case their have infringes copyright, or any other legal harm that could arise from publishing the author's contribution.

The law recognizes the property right which a person has when they create a thing, such as a font, and that right is encoded in the law of copyright. The relevant US federal code is contained in [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17), which you can read (essentially identical laws exist in virtually or perhaps actually all countries). The important thing to understand is that there is not a distinction between \"privately\" trespassing on a person's property and \"publicly\" trespassing on a person's property.

However, on second thought, this is precisely what the contacts app on my phone is \\- a directory of people with their personal information. So is this the same thing, or does the exact same concept break different rules when it's implemented in the phone vs. custom software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not illegal to have such software. The question is how you use it. Some uses of your phone's contact app can be a GDPR violation as well.\n\nThe GDPR has an exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household purposes\u201d. When an ordinary user uses some software for managing their personal or family life, that is not subject to GDPR. E.g. I have a contact list with friends and acquaintances and that is not subject to GDPR at all.\n\nYou are mentioning invoices. Issuing invoices is not a purely personal activity. It affects people outside your friends and family. Your understanding of the term \u201cpersonal\u201d (the software is custom\\-tailored for your needs) is different from the GDPR's concept of \u201cpurely personal\u201d.\n\nWith respect to processing activities that you perform e.g. as a freelancer, you must consider the GDPR. For all such processing activities, you need a legal basis. For invoices this is simple because you're legally required to issue correct invoices. But if your software has aspects of a customer relationship management system, things would be a bit more tricky. The GDPR offers a choice of legal basis, but here there might be a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d to keep track of people with whom you have a business relationship. But it is not the features of the software that are relevant here, but which processing activities you're going to carry out with that data via the software. Mere storage of information is already a processing activity in the sense of the GDPR, though.\n\nIf you're using the same systems for purely personal activities and business activities, it might be difficult to understand your obligations with respect to your data. If possible, it is best to keep your private life separate from business activities so that no confusion arises. For example with a contacts app, it could make sense to use different user accounts for personal and business use.\n\nTypical GDPR issues with a contact information database could be:\n\n* not having a clear purpose for which this data is being stored and used\n* storing the information for longer than necessary\n* storing information about people with whom you do not have an appropriate relationship\n* sharing the data with others, without a proper legal basis\n* unsolicited marketing to people, though some kinds of direct marketing are allowed by the laws in your country",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this software under GDPR?\n\nA) The software is completely exempt from GDPR because it's for personal use only.\nB) The software violates GDPR regardless of how it's used, as it contains personal data.\nC) The invoicing module is subject to GDPR, but the client database is exempt as long as it's not shared.\nD) The software may be subject to GDPR for business-related data processing, but not for purely personal data.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The software's compliance with GDPR depends on how it's used, not its mere existence. For business-related activities like invoicing and maintaining client relationships, GDPR applies because these are not \"purely personal or household purposes.\" However, any truly personal data (e.g., friends and family contacts) would fall under the GDPR's personal use exemption. The key is distinguishing between personal and business use within the software. \n\nOption A is incorrect because business activities are not exempt from GDPR. Option B is overly broad; simply having personal data doesn't automatically violate GDPR. Option C misunderstands GDPR application; both the invoicing module and client database could be subject to GDPR for business use, regardless of sharing."

Nevertheless, there is an official narrative, so people should be able to memorize the official narrative word\\-for\\-word and hold competitions reciting that narrative.

According to the information provided, freedom of expression in China is considered a privilege rather than an absolute right. The Chinese legal system is fundamentally different from Western legal traditions and is designed to serve the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The law explicitly states that citizens can exercise their right to freedom of publication as long as it doesn't oppose the basic principles confirmed in the Constitution or harm the interests of the country, society, or collective. This effectively means that the CCP has the authority to restrict speech on sensitive topics, such as the events of June 4, 1989, if they deem it against their interests.\n\nOption A is incorrect because freedom of speech in China is not unrestricted. Option C is too specific and inaccurate, as there's no blanket prohibition on discussing pre-2000 events. Option D is incorrect because the Chinese legal system is described as being distinct from Roman and Germanic law traditions, not based on them."

Often, the non\\-profit or civic organization is one in which people somehow connected to the firm are involved.\n\nIn almost all cases, large law firms are also image conscious and will only take cases that would reflect well on the firm if they were reported upon in a newspaper story from a reporter willing to listen to their side of the story.\n\nIn a pro bono case, the law firm wants to be on the side of the case where they are wearing the \"white hats\" (i.e. the good guys).\n\n**When Do Law Firms Have A Policy Of Declining Pro Bono Representation?**\n\nOn the other hand, in addition to actual direct conflicts, where the law firm represents the other side of a dispute with you, which of course, no one would expect the firm to represent you in on any basis, most large law firms have a class of potential clients that they refuse to accept because they constitute \"business development conflicts.\"\n\nFirms that are hired by insurance companies to represent defendants in personal injury cases will almost never take on a personal injury plaintiff. Firms that represent residential landlords will almost never represent a residential tenant. Firms that represent big businesses that do business with the general public will almost never take on a consumer protection lawsuit for a consumer. Firms that represent manufacturing and utility companies won't take on lawsuits to enforce environmental laws. Firms that represent employers don't represent unions.\n\nThey don't take on these kinds of clients both because their existing and prospective clients don't like it from an appearances and \"loyalty to the cause\"/solidarity perspective, and because they don't want to end up making precedents as a result of their skillful representation that end up hurting most of their clients.\n\nFinally, law firms almost never represent someone who can afford their services on a paying basis for the work in question.\n\nSimilarly, law firms like to represent pro bono clients who are appreciative and reasonably tolerable to deal with. Law firms don't want to represent a client who is a headache to interact with without even getting paid to do it, unless very high principles indeed are at stake.",

There's no clear evidence of negligence or malice, and legal action should typically be a last resort.\n\nB) is incorrect because while the individual can provide new information, they cannot demand the appraiser redo the appraisal. Appraisers are independent professionals who make their own judgments.\n\nC) is incorrect because filing a formal complaint with a supervisory body is a serious step that should be taken only if there's clear evidence of misconduct or if other attempts to resolve the issue have failed.\n\nD) is the correct answer because requesting a reconsideration of value is a professional and reasonable approach. It allows the individual to present new evidence (the closer comps) to the appraiser, potentially leading to a revised valuation without escalating to legal or formal complaint procedures. This approach respects the appraiser's expertise while providing an opportunity for the valuation to be reconsidered based on additional information."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let us assume that a hit song or two from a list of, say, 200 artists, is transcribed into a digital format which allowed for melody/harmony and other types of analysis. These analyses would produce a set of statistical trends regarding melody shapes, interval jumps, and other information found from analyzing the aforementioned songs. This information would then be refined and used as the basis for a program that could help a user generate music for commercial use. Using only the suggestions provided by the program, it would be nearly impossible to completely recreate one of the songs used for analysis (unless the user intended to do so). \n\nWhere would this process stand legally? From what I've seen, academic research allows for some lee\\-way in terms of the content that can be studied. However, I haven't found anything that mentions whether or not one could freely use creative data (music you've bought and transcribed into a format which can be analyzed) to produce factual data (statistical trends) that could essentially be packaged into a product and sold. My gut feeling says that it wouldn't fall under fair use (even though technically the process should not detract from the sales of someone's music). Would you need a license for each song?\n\nIf this sits in a strange area legally, it makes me wonder how programs like Band in a Box were developed. Then again I suppose they could have paid session musicians to give them solos/melodies that they would then use for analysis in much the same way.\n\nAny answers are appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is not at all obvious. It seems that in the EU it is the default assumption that text data\\-mining requires consent for protected works, but there are specific statutory exceptions, and in the UK, there is an [exception for research](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/375954/Research.pdf) so that (p. 7\\)\n\n> researchers are allowed to make copies of whole copyright works that\n>  they have lawful access to, without asking for specific permission, \n>  as long as they are making these copies solely for the purpose of non\\-\n>  commercial research.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that under UK law, the proposed activity would not be legal (because it is not non\\-commercial, and also because it is not text). However, US law seems to be more open to data mining. The most applicable case would probably be [Authors Guild v. Google](http://torrent-defenders.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Authors-Guild-v.-Google-Books-05-cv-8136-Summary-Judgment-Granted-for-Google-Books.pdf), which found in favor of extensive \"fair usage\". However, Google Books are free, and the difference between \"for commercial purposes\" vs. \"for non\\-commercial purposes\" could well be the most heavily\\-weighted of the four factors. On the other hand, what you are proposing is vastly more transformative than putting searchable scans online, and the \"effect on market\" would arguably be positive (that is, no sales would be lost because a free copy was acquired instead \\-\\- the work itself would not be available).\n\nHowever... we also treat music differently (there is a separate section of code, [17 USC 114](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114)). [Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792](http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/2000-2009/Pages/bridgeportdimension.html) holds \"Get a license or do not sample\". Now it's true that the actual sound was being transformed and not analyzed into something else like a statistical profile, but still the amount copied was tiny and surely did not undercut sales.\n\nIt's not clear to me what this commercial product would do / is. If specific facts about specific works can be obtained, the possibility of a finding of infringement would be higher, compared to a programmer who discovers facts about existing music and then uses that factual knowledge to create a program that composers could use to create their own music. Facts are not protected by copyright; you may legally discover facts about music if you legally acquire a copy of the music. If your product simply embodies facts about musical expression (and is not just a re\\-coding of the actual expression), then copyright law would not be applicable.",

Why does the government care who stays in who's house, while paying money? Is there some third party that is negatively affected if the guidelines aren't followed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, to be clear, this is almost never a state level limitation. To the extent that the link in the question implies otherwise, it is incorrect.\n\nInstead, local governments, typically a municipality or in an area that is not part of any municipality, a county, enacts land use regulations, the most common of which is usually called a \"[zoning code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States).\" There are also usually locally adopted building codes that supplement the zoning code.\n\nA zoning code typically establishes rules regarding how different kinds of real estate can be used in different enumerated zones. Usually, there are several different zones in which residential uses are allowed and different rules apply in each one. One of the typical limitations in a residential zone is to establish the number of unrelated people who don't own the home who may live there.\n\nThe purpose of such limitations is to discourage the establishment of boarding houses, group homes, women's shelters, homeless shelters, flop houses, and halfway houses in relatively low density residential zones, on the theory that these uses are undesirable in terms of neighborhood character and cause undesirable people to move into a neighborhood that lowers property values for other people who live there.\n\nMore crassly, people in affluent neighborhoods want to ban property uses that make it possible for poorer people to live near them.\n\nOften the actual scope of the limitations, however, is far broader than is necessary to prohibit these particularly unpopular \"[NIMBY](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Not-in-My-Backyard-Phenomenon)\" (not in my backyard) uses. The drafters of zoning codes are frequently more concerned about preventing loopholes in their restrictions from being identified than about limiting property rights in a respect that most current property owners in the zone don't avail themselves of anyway.\n\nFor example, in Denver, where I live, the City Council recently passed a Group Living Amendment to its zoning code easing restrictions on uses of residences by unrelated people. This measure was sufficiently controversial that members of the public used their referral powers to petition to have [the repeal of the recently enacted legislation places on the November 2021 general election ballot](https://denverite.com/2021/10/07/denver-referred-question-2f-vg-2021/) for voters to consider repealing it.\n\nAs the link in the question notes, homeowner's associations, frequently also impose limitations on this kind of use of a residence, which are often even more strict, and are frequently adopted for the same reason. HOAs have more authority to do so than local governments because as private entities, they aren't required to meet constitutional law limitations on their authority.\n\n> The question is, if both parties agree to forgo any safety measures\n> that it might be there to protect, who exactly is it hurting if one\n> person pays the other to stay over?\n> \n> \n> In simple terms: why is it illegal? Why does the government care who\n> stays in who's house, while paying money? Is there some 3rd party that\n> is negatively affected if the guidelines aren't followed?\n\nThe third\\-party is the neighboring property owners who fear that the quality of their neighborhood will be reduced by this kind of agreement.\n\nI am sympathetic to these criticisms. But, they aren't barriers to enacting laws if people with the power to enact legislation disagree.\n\nThe simple rule is that in the real world, legislation is not required to adhere to a liberal/libertarian ideal in which laws are enacted only to regulate matters in which someone else may arguably be harmed. Subject to light constitutional regulation, the authority of local government's to enact legislation regulating the use of property is frequently plenary (i.e. unlimited) or close to it. The government can do anything it wants that it isn't forbidden from doing by the constitution or a higher level government's statutes. Courts aren't permitted to second guess the accuracy or desirability of these legislative determinations in most cases.\n\nMany states, furthermore, have \"[home rule cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule_in_the_United_States)\" that are expressly protected from having their legislative authority limited in many respects by state legislation.\n\nA [regulatory taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_takings_in_the_United_States), the prevents property from having any beneficial use, must be compensated by the government enacting the regulation of its use. But regulatory laws may reduce the value of property by limiting the uses to which it can be put so long as there is still some beneficial use of the property that remains available.\n\nA very light and disputed impact that is perceived to be negative, such as the one in this case, is a sufficient [rational basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_basis_review) for a municipal or local government to enact such legislation, and many local government zoning codes do, in fact, regulate this kind of activity.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the authority of local governments to enact this kind of legislation in the United States in the face of a constitutional challenge to it, in the case of  *[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_of_Euclid_v._Ambler_Realty_Co.)* in 1926, although some more extreme versions of limitations on non\\-related people sharing a home have subsequently been held to be invalid, mostly as a result of later enacted federal fair housing laws.",

Someone else commented that she could be liable for poisoning someone if she did that.\n\nThe thief is already ignoring written labels saying 'private' and 'do not take this if your name isn't \\_\\_\\_\\_'. My assumption would be that this constitutes a warning label, and that she isn't responsible, just like a company isn't responsible if you injure yourself using their product in a manner inconsistent with their instructions. \n\nSo, I'm wondering:\n\n1. Is there any liability at all, since the item in question is being stolen?\n2. Are there any specific legal guidelines for what constitutes a written warning that waives liability for misuse of a product? If so, would this meet those criteria?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (I'm taking for granted that the question is about the application of poison to food, and I'm answering the general question about liability for poisoning food expected to be stolen. Whether application of a particular hot sauce meets that assumption is outside the scope of my answer.)\n\nThe facts right now are:\n\n* theft is foreseeable\n* injury is foreseeable\n\nIf you poison the food in a situation where a reasonable person would foresee theft and subsequent injury, then you are liable for at least the tort of negligence if the thief is in fact injured.\n\nSimply adding a note saying \"don't steal\" doesn't disclose the danger.\n\nDo you have a duty of care to other people with access to your food? (That is the remaining element of negligence.) Yes. (See [http://premisesliability.uslegal.com/duty\\-owed\\-trespassers/](http://premisesliability.uslegal.com/duty-owed-trespassers/)). You have a duty to not willfully or wontonly trap or otherwise prepare harm for would\\-be tresspassers, and I believe that extends to lunchroom thieves.\n\n---\n\nBut, the simple answer is don't poison food!",

She decides to add an extremely spicy hot sauce to her food, hoping to catch the thief. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's potential legal liability?\n\nA) Sarah has no legal liability because the food belongs to her and is being stolen.\nB) Sarah is protected from liability if she labels the food with \"Do not eat - property of Sarah.\"\nC) Sarah could be held liable for negligence if the thief is injured by consuming the spiked food.\nD) Sarah is only liable if she uses poison instead of hot sauce.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Sarah could be held liable for negligence if the thief is injured by consuming the spiked food. This is because:\n\n1. The theft is foreseeable based on past incidents.\n2. Injury from consuming extremely spicy food is also foreseeable.\n3. Sarah has a duty of care to not willfully prepare harm for potential trespassers, which extends to office food thieves.\n4. Simply labeling the food doesn't disclose the potential danger.\n5. The fact that the food is being stolen doesn't negate Sarah's liability for intentionally causing harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ownership of the food doesn't protect Sarah from liability for intentionally causing harm. Option B is wrong because a simple label doesn't sufficiently warn of the danger. Option D is incorrect because even non-poisonous substances (like extremely spicy hot sauce) can lead to liability if they cause injury."

By including a statement in the claim form indicating willingness to disclose medical information confidentially to the judge and defendant, without including specific details, the plaintiff achieves several things:\n\n1. They alert the court to the existence of potentially relevant medical information.\n2. They express their desire for confidentiality upfront.\n3. They avoid prematurely disclosing sensitive information before confidentiality can be assured.\n4. They allow the judge and defendant to decide how to proceed with handling this sensitive information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because submitting all medical details with the initial claim risks the information becoming part of the public record before confidentiality can be guaranteed. Option B is inappropriate because verbal communication in court is typically part of the public record. Option D is incorrect because withholding relevant information entirely could harm the plaintiff's case and may be seen as acting in bad faith."

However he is paying about half of the amount.\n\nWhen my friend asked her attorney if they could enforce him to pay the entire amount, including arrears of nearly 4 grand, they told her that they couldn't enforce him to pay by threatening jail as long as he's \"paying something.\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me, as I am fairly certain that penalties of contempt of court exist in New Jersey as well as probably every other state in the US.\n\nWhat legal remedies are available for failure to pay the entire amount due for child support? Especially when arrears have accumulated that are above 4 thousand dollars? Or is her attorney correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, contempt of court focuses on the person's *deliberate* noncompliance with the terms of the court order. If your friend files a *motion to show cause*, she would need to prove that the parent has not fully complied with the order *despite his ability to do so*.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforcement of the full child support amount?\n\nA) The court cannot enforce the full amount as long as the parent is paying at least half of the ordered amount.\n\nB) The court can immediately jail the parent for contempt without considering their ability to pay.\n\nC) The custodial parent can file a motion to show cause, requiring the non-compliant parent to demonstrate why they cannot pay the full amount.\n\nD) New Jersey does not allow for contempt of court charges in child support cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. In child support enforcement cases, the focus is on the parent's deliberate noncompliance and their ability to pay. The custodial parent can file a motion to show cause, which requires the non-compliant parent to demonstrate why they cannot pay the full amount ordered. This process allows the court to assess whether the parent is truly unable to pay or is willfully disobeying the order. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while paying something may be considered, it doesn't automatically prevent enforcement of the full amount. Option B is incorrect as immediate jailing without considering ability to pay would be too extreme. Option D is false, as New Jersey does allow for contempt charges in appropriate child support cases."

For instance, if a cop seizes some cash asserting that it is \"drug money\", and the owner sues to recover it, can the government dismiss the suit on the basis of sovereign immunity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As always, some specification of jurisdiction is necessary: I will pick US (a seizure by DEA agents). A suitcase of cash in the trunk can be seized given an appropriate warrant, on the premise that it is evidence in a criminal investigation. The owner cannot then (immediately) sue to recover the property, which is being held as evidence: the seizure was lawful. At some point the case will be disposed of: to be kind to the plaintiff, assume the case was closed without charges being filed (therefore, the money is not evidence). Also, the government does not officially institute civil forfeiture proceedings. In that case, the government is supposed to return the property at this point, but there's no guarantee that they will. *Then*, the owner can sue. But, following [Price v. US](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16380364834433439332), 174 US 373 and citations therein:\n\n> It is an axiom of our jurisprudence. The government is not liable to\n> suit unless it consents thereto, and its liability in suit cannot be\n> extended beyond the plain language of the statute authorizing it\n\nThe [Tort Claims Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act) is such a statute. [28 USC 2674](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2674) states that\n\n> The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this\n> title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same\n> extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not\n> be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\n\nThe claim \"you can't sue the government\" is refuted by a federal statute that says otherwise, so any such government motion to dismiss will be denied. (Not to say that they couldn't succeed on some other grounds). [\u00a72675](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2675) lists various exceptions where you can't sue the government for loss\n\n> caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of\n> the Government while acting within the scope of his office or\n> employment, unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim\n> to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been\n> finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or\n> registered mail.\n\nThat is, lawsuit can't be your first response. Other exceptions are in [\u00a72680(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2680), for instance you can't sue if \"the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property\" (comments refer to a [question about civil forfeiture law](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/887/how-exactly-does-civil-asset-forfeiture-work-in-the-united-states)) \u2013 thus civil forfeiture law allows some taking, but the present instance (willful failure to return property held as evidence) is different.\n\nSo if the government just decided to keep your cash, illegally, you can sue to get it back and the suit will not be dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's ability to sue the government in this scenario?\n\nA) John cannot sue the government due to sovereign immunity, which protects the government from all lawsuits.\n\nB) John can immediately file a lawsuit against the government to recover his property without any prior steps.\n\nC) John can sue the government, but only after he has first presented his claim to the appropriate Federal agency and had it denied in writing.\n\nD) John has no legal recourse to recover his property since it was seized as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While sovereign immunity generally protects the government from lawsuits, the Federal Tort Claims Act provides exceptions allowing individuals to sue the government under certain circumstances. However, before John can file a lawsuit, he must first present his claim to the appropriate Federal agency and have it denied in writing, as specified in 28 USC 2675. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sovereign immunity does not provide absolute protection from all lawsuits against the government. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because John cannot immediately file a lawsuit; he must first go through the administrative claim process. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because John does have legal recourse to recover his property, especially since no charges were filed and the case was closed. \n\nThis question tests understanding of sovereign immunity, the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the process for suing the government to recover seized property."

The correct approach is to immediately comply with valid takedown notices by removing the content in question. However, you can simultaneously notify the user about the takedown and provide information on how to submit a counter-notice.

Posting a simple text link to Alice's website is generally allowed and does not involve copying or reproducing her work.\n\nB) while potentially problematic, is less likely to be considered infringement as the image is still being served from Alice's server. However, this could potentially violate Alice's terms of service or be seen as unfair use of her bandwidth.\n\nC) is the most likely to be considered copyright infringement. By creating a thumbnail and hosting it on his own server, Bob is making and distributing a copy of Alice's copyrighted work without permission. While thumbnails can sometimes fall under fair use (especially for search engines), Bob's personal blog might not qualify for such protection.\n\nD) is similar to A) in that it's primarily just linking to Alice's content. While suggesting a browser extension might be seen as encouraging users to view the content in a way Alice didn't intend, it's still not directly infringing on her copyright.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it involves Bob actually copying and hosting Alice's copyrighted content without permission, which is a clear violation of copyright law."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Chetan's options?\n\nA) Chetan can unilaterally sell his share of the property without consulting his siblings, as he has individual ownership rights.\n\nB) Chetan cannot sell his share or partition the property under any circumstances, as it's jointly inherited.\n\nC) Chetan can initiate a partition deed, but it must be agreed upon by all four siblings before he can sell his share.\n\nD) Chetan can sell his share to an outsider, but only after offering it to his siblings first, regardless of their agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, a co-owner of a joint property in India can indeed go for a partition deed, but it must be agreed upon by all joint-owners. In this case, Chetan can initiate the process of creating a partition deed, but he needs the agreement of Aarav, Bina, and Divya to proceed. Once the partition is agreed upon and executed, Chetan would then be able to sell his separated share. The process may vary depending on factors such as the property type, the owners' religion, and the state where the property is located. Option A is incorrect because unilateral sale is not possible in joint ownership. Option B is too restrictive and doesn't reflect the possibility of partition. Option D introduces a concept (right of first refusal) that isn't mentioned in the given information and wouldn't bypass the need for agreement among co-owners."

More recently, many nations will undertake to enforce laws in cases where their citizens are the victims, or in some cases the perpetrators of crimes even within other nations, and more freely on the high seas outside the physical limits or territorial waters of any country.\n\nHistorically, all nations undertook to enforce laws against piracy wherever they might be committed.\n\nSeveral countries, including the UK and the US, now treat the UN Law of the Sea convention as part of their national law, which defines as piracy: \"illegal acts of violence or detention ... against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft\" This would include the situation described in the question.\n\nTherefore such actions could and quite likely would be prosecuted by any of several countries, depending on the registry of the vessel and the nationalities of those involved.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/7) provides that:\n\n> The term \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d, as used in this title, includes:\n\n> (1\\) The high seas, any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, and any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, when such vessel is within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State.\n\n...\n\n> (7\\) Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United States.\n\n> (8\\) To the extent permitted by international law, any foreign vessel during a voyage having a scheduled departure from or arrival in the United States with respect to an offense committed by or against a national of the United States.\n\n[This US DOJ page](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-8-crimes-committed-within-special-maritime-jurisdiction-us-18-usc-7) says:\n\n> Among the offenses within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States are the crimes of murder, manslaughter, maiming, kidnapping, rape, assault, and robbery. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(1\\) there is also jurisdiction over such offenses when they are committed on the high seas or any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States that is out of the jurisdiction of any particular state. See JM 9\\-20\\.000 et seq.\n\nThe page [\"Maritime Offenses\"](http://trombleyhaneslaw.com/white-collar-crime/maritime-offenses/) from the law offices of Trombley and Hanes says:\n\n> The Federal government also exercises jurisdiction over certain maritime offenses. There is Federal jurisdiction for offenses committed on American vessels in the territorial waters, harbors and inland waterways of foreign nations. See *United States v. Flores*, 289 U.S. 137 (1933\\).\n\n...\n\n> A number of Title 18 sections specifically declare certain conduct to be a Federal crime if committed \u201cwithin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d See, e.g., murder, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111\\. In some instances, the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, is also applicable. See also, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1175; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1243; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3372\\.\n\n[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1111 (b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111) provides that:\n\n> (b) Within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\n\n> Whoever is guilty of murder in the first degree shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life;\n\n> Whoever is guilty of murder in the second degree, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.\n\nThe [Britannica Article on \"Piracy\"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/piracy-international-law) says:\n\n> Because piracy has been regarded as an offense against the law of nations, the public vessels of any state have been permitted to seize a pirate ship, to bring it into port, to try the crew (regardless of their nationality or domicile), and, if they are found guilty, to punish them and to confiscate the ship.\n\nThe [UN page on Piracy](https://www.un.org/depts/los/piracy/piracy.htm) says:\n\n> The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides the framework for the repression of piracy under international law, in particular in its articles 100 to 107 and 110\\. The Security Council has repeatedly reaffirmed \u201cthat international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (\u2018The Convention\u2019), sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities\u201d (Security Council resolution 1897 (2009\\), adopted on 30 November 2009\\). Article 100 of UNCLOS provides that \u201c\\[a]ll States shall cooperate to the fullest possible extent in the repression of piracy on the high seas or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State.\u201d The General Assembly has also repeatedly encouraged States to cooperate to address piracy and armed robbery at sea in its resolutions on oceans and the law of the sea. For example, in its resolution 64/71 of 4 December 2009, the General Assembly recognized \u201cthe crucial role of international cooperation at the global, regional, subregional and bilateral levels in combating, in accordance with international law, threats to maritime security, including piracy\u201d.\n\nThe UK [Piracy Act of 1837](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_Act_1837) defined as a crime:\n\n> Whosoever, with intent to commit or at the time of or immediately before or immediately after committing the crime of piracy in respect of any ship or vessel, shall assault, with intent to murder, any person being on board of or belonging to such ship or vessel, or shall stab, cut, or wound any such person, or unlawfully do any act by which the life of such person may be endangered, shall be guilty of felony...\n\nThe more modern UK law, the Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act of 1997 embodies the UN law of the Sea convention, including its article 101, which says:\n\n> Piracy consists of any of the following acts:\n\n> (a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed\u2014\n\n> (a) (i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;\n> (a) (ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;",

I will therefore assume US law in this answer. If the US is not the relevant country, this answer may not apply.\n\n*Fair use* was first created to allow comment about a protected work, such as by a reviewer, or a teacher or scholar, without the need to get permission for every short quotation made. It is broader than that, but that kind of use is at the heart of the concept. It was originally a court\\-made concept, adopted by Congress in the Copyright Act of 1976, now [17 USC](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/). It is specifically defined in [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107).\n\nWhether a use is a fair use is always a highly fact\\-dependent determination. There is no single clear formula or rule. There are uses which are highly likely to be held to be fair use, and uses pretty clearly not covered, but between those is a wide area where the details matter.\n\nWhether a use is a fair use depends on the nature of the work making use of copied or derived content, on the nature of the work copied from, on the kind of use made of the copied content, on the amount of the source work that is copied, and on the effect of the copying on the market or potential market for the source work. None of these dominates, a balance is struck in each case that a court considers. The law lists the factors to be considered as:\n\n> in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n\n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n\n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nIt is essential to examine the details of a proposed use to see how the four factors apply in each case. Unfortunately here details are lacking as to the nature and purpose of the use, and as to how much content would be quoted from any particular source.\n\nIf the proposed work is an analysis and discussion of various published works, one which does not compete with them, that would tend to favor fair use. In general a short quotation can be made when the purpose is to analyze or discuss that quote or the work from which it comes. An image may be used when that image is being commented on, or in some cases to identify the work in question. It should include no more of the source image than is needed for such a purpose, and should often be at a reduced resolution.\n\nIf the new work serves as a replacement for the source work, so that people are less likely to purchase the source work, that weighs against a finding of fair use. This may be the most important factor in the analysis.\n\nThe more of the source work that is used, the less likely it is to be a fair use. But there are cases in which the entire source work was copied but this was held to be a fair use, and in *Harper vs Nation* the copying of about 300 words from a 500\\-page book was held to be too much.\n\nValid fair use usually includes attribution, listing the source and authorship of the work from which content has been copied or derived.\n\nThe more the use is for a different purpose than the original, the better the case for fair use. For example, a popular song is written and published to make an emotional effect on the listeners. A text on how to write popular music quotes the song to discuss meter and rhyme scheme, a very different kind of use. A stirring line in a famous speech may be quote4d ironically, to argue that the ideals of the original have not been achieved, again a very different use. Such different uses are called *transformative* in copyright law. Transformative uses are more likely to be held as fair use than uses that are not transformative.\n\nAdvertisements are no different from other protected works. The same rules apply when quoting an ad as when quoting a novel, or a poem, or a news story. However, creative works, such as poems, songs, and novels, are generally more strongly protected than factual works such as news stories, advertisements, or textbooks. When the source is a creative work fair use is somewhat less likely.\n\nThe question also mentions trademarks. Trademarks are only protected against being used in trade. That is, one may not, without permission, use someone else's trademark to advertise or identify a product or service, or to suggest that it is endorse or approved by another when it has not been. A trademark may be used to identify a trademarked product, for example in comparative advertising (\"Brand X performs better than Brand Y.\") But if the proposed work is not itself advertising or selling anything (except perhaps itself) then trademark law is probably not an issue.\n\nWithout more specifics on the proposed, this set of general principles on fair use is the beat answer that I can give.",

The purpose is analytical and educational, which is typically favored in fair use considerations.\n3. The use is transformative, as it repurposes the ad content for critical analysis rather than promotional purposes.\n4. Low-resolution screenshots are less likely to impact the market value of the original works.\n\nOption A likely uses too much of the original works and could potentially serve as a replacement for viewing the originals.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer invested in what they believed was Financial Product A, which allowed for lump-sum withdrawals within a specified period. When attempting to withdraw, the institution claimed it was actually Product B, which doesn't allow such withdrawals. What is the MOST appropriate first step for the customer to take in this situation?\n\nA) Immediately file a lawsuit against the financial institution for breach of contract\nB) Contact the institution's customer service to negotiate a compromise\nC) Take and notarize a screenshot of the webpage showing Product A's terms\nD) Close the account and accept the loss to avoid further complications\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate first step is to document the evidence, as indicated in the advice given. Taking and notarizing a screenshot of the webpage showing Product A's terms (option C) is crucial for preserving evidence of what was promised. This step should be taken before the institution potentially changes the webpage content.\n\nOption A (filing a lawsuit) is premature at this stage and should only be considered after other steps have been taken. Option B (contacting customer service) may be a good secondary step, but securing evidence is more urgent. Option D (closing the account) would likely result in unnecessary financial loss and doesn't address the issue.\n\nThe correct course of action involves documenting evidence, reviewing the contract for dispute resolution procedures, and then considering options such as filing a complaint with a consumer protection agency or pursuing legal action if necessary."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Could anyone please explain to me my options. I am appealing against a possession order from a District Judge to a Circuit Judge. I have a hearing for permission to appeal in two weeks time. I am worried if permission is denied, can I appeal to the next level above, Appellate Court or Supreme Court? My case is in public interest, the Judgement was biased to Local Authority. Despite that I am a litigant in person and a secure tenant, my recent research in Possession claims confirmed to me that Judgement was obviously wrong and unfair. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need to look at [rule 52](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52#52.3) of the Civil Procedure Rules. This says that appeals from a County Court lie to the High Court (probably the Chancery Division in this case), and that permission to appeal can be granted either in the County Court or the High Court. It also says (52\\.1(4\\)) that permission to appeal is usually decided without a hearing (on paper), but that the appellant may apply for a reconsideration at an oral hearing; it would be sensible to check exactly what the Circuit Judge will be doing.\n\nIt appears that you are not distinguishing properly between the appeal and the application for permission. If your appeal is dismissed by the High Court, it may be possible (if you get permission) to go to the Court of Appeal; but it's premature to worry about that now, since if permission is refused, there will be no appeal, and the Court of Appeal could not consider the case even if it wanted to.\n\nThe Circuit Judge will not determine the merits; his job is solely to determine whether there is a \"compelling reason\" (52\\.6(1\\)) for the appeal to be heard. This usually means that the judgment arguably made an identifiable error of fact or law, which the High Court needs to decide on. There is no point saying that the judgment was biased or unfair; you need to say exactly what error you think should be corrected.\n\nWhen the Circuit Judge has heard all the arguments, he will give his decision. If permission is granted, you will need to file an appellant's notice in the High Court, and contact the Chancery Listing office; I imagine the County Court staff will be able to help with the details. If it is refused, the order will say (52\\.3(3\\)) whether a further application for permission may be made, and to whom. If he is acting in the High Court (this will be set out in the heading of the order you receive), there is nothing further to be done: the Court to which the appeal would lie has refused to hear it. If he is acting as a County Court judge, you may have the right to apply to the High Court to reconsider the decision (52\\.3(2\\)(b)); but you should definitely consult a solicitor before doing so, no matter how strongly you feel. This is not just another roll of the dice which may be lucky. There will be considerable costs: there are time limits that have to be observed: you have to draw up an appellant's notice: and in the end the High Court Judge will merely consider, on paper, whether a colleague on circuit made a decision that was obviously wrong, which is statistically unlikely.",

If permission to appeal is denied by the Circuit Judge, what is the correct next step for the litigant?\n\nA) Immediately file an appeal to the Court of Appeal\nB) Apply to the Supreme Court for permission to hear the case\nC) Check the order to see if a further application for permission may be made, and to whom\nD) Automatically proceed with the appeal to the High Court\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, if permission to appeal is refused, the order will specify whether a further application for permission may be made, and to whom (as per rule 52.3(3) of the Civil Procedure Rules). This is the appropriate next step for the litigant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court of Appeal cannot consider the case without permission, and it's premature to consider this stage when permission for the initial appeal hasn't been granted.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the Supreme Court is not the next level of appeal in this situation. The appeal process typically goes from County Court to High Court, then potentially to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOption D is incorrect because if permission to appeal is denied, the litigant cannot automatically proceed with an appeal to the High Court. Permission is required before an appeal can be heard.\n\nIt's important to note that the documentation advises consulting a solicitor before taking further action, especially if considering applying to the High Court for reconsideration of the decision."

As the documentation states, \"There is an assumption that if the relationship between the parties is commercial (e.g. if A runs a car washing business) then there is such an intent [for a legally enforceable contract].\" Since Alice owns a professional car washing business, her act of washing Bob's car would likely be viewed as a commercial transaction, even without an explicit agreement. This gives Alice a strong case for demanding payment in court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there was no explicit contract, the commercial nature of Alice's business creates an implied contract.\nOption B is too absolute, as the court would still need to determine if the circumstances warrant full payment.\nOption D is incorrect as there's no legal basis for this compromise in the given scenario."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As we know, section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 outlines what steps a Landlord can take in order to regain possession of his property. My question is in relation of the rights of the tenant being asked to leave the property. \n\nFor context, myself and everyone else living in my building are being asked to leave so that the landlord can refurbish the property. This doesn't affect me greatly as living here was always a temporary solution, however over families have settled down here and made it their home.\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1. **Giving notice** \\- Under second 21 of the Housing Act 1988, the Landord is required to give the tenant at least two months notice to vacate the property, and the end date of the notice must land on the expiry date of the rental period. If the tenant finds a new place to live before the end of the two months' notice and wishes to leave early, is the tenant required to fulfil their regular duty of giving the usual one month's notice that they are leaving or does that no longer apply in this scenario?\n2. **Rent Refunds** \\- Continuing on from the question above, if the tenant wishes to leave early and moves out of the property half way through their rental period, can the tenant claim a refund on the rent already paid which reflects the time between when they left the property and when the rental period would expire?\n3. **Appealing the notice** \\- If the tenant is not in a strong enough financial position to put together enough money for the deposit for their next home, or have simply been unsuccessful in finding a property which is suitable based on their current income, what course of action should they take?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If the tenant finds a new place to live before the end of the two months' notice and wishes to leave early, is the tenant required to \\[give] one month's notice that they are leaving?\n\nNo, the tenant is not required to give notice if they has already received notice from the landlord.\n\nIn addition, the tenant is required to pay rent up to the end of the notice period, even if they move out sooner (for now; but see also below). If they don't move out, they must still pay the rent.\n\n> If the tenant...moves out of the property half way through their rental period, can the tenant claim a refund on the rent already paid which reflects the time between when they left the property and when the rental period would expire?\n\nFor a tenancy which started before 1 October 2015, there is no automatic right to a refund. The tenant can of course ask the landlord for one, though the landlord would only be obliged to refund rent if a new tenant moves in before the end of that period.\n\nFor tenancies made after [1 October 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/994/article/11/made), [s35 of the Deregulation Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/section/35/enacted) amends [s21 of the Housing Act 1988](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/21) to allow the 2 months' notice to end on any day (after the end of a fixed term), not just the end of a rental period. [s40](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/section/40/enacted) then adds a new section which requires the landlord to repay any rent applying during that final period, but after the tenant moves out.\n\n> If the tenant is not in a strong enough financial position to put together enough money for the deposit for their next home, or have simply been unsuccessful in finding a property which is suitable based on their current income, what course of action should they take?\n\nFirstly, the date specified in a s21 notice is **not** the date by which the tenant must move out \\-\\- even though, in practice, this is how it is normally treated.\n\nInstead, it is earliest date on which the landlord can begin legal proceedings. So, after that date, there is likely to be a delay until the case can appear before a court. The judge has some discretion as to when the tenancy will actually end, so you can ask for a little more time \\-\\- but note that the only way to prevent an eviction under s21 is to show that the landlord failed to follow the correct procedure.\n\nSee also Shelter's [comprehensive guide](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/eviction/eviction_of_private_tenants/eviction_of_assured_shorthold_tenants) on the subject for more details.",

I don't know what you mean by \"worksheet\", so it may or may not be an education record. Under any reasonable interpretation of the term it is a \"record\", but to be an \"education record\" it must be directly related to a student and maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution, for example \"the answers of a student\". It excludes records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record, and also excludes grades on peer\\-graded papers before they are collected and recorded by a teacher. In my youth we would receive sheets with math problems that we had to solve and hand in, which may have been retained \u2013 as long as the sheets were retained by someone in the school system other than the teacher, they would be \"education records\" (had the law existed at the time).\n\nThe actual purpose of this law is to allow students and their parents to inspect the basis for grading, and to allow access to the infamous \"permanent record\". It is not related to the political purpose of criticizing lesson plans, but one can of course use such information in that manner. Whether or not parents, or anyone, has a legal right to access lesson plans for some public commentary purpose is a matter of local school policy.

(I'm in the United States \u2014 Missouri, to be precise.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My interpretation would be:\n\n*As related to the parents...*\n\n* Immediate family (e.g., brothers, sisters, etc.)\n* First and second cousins, aunts and uncles\n* Any direct ancestors (i.e., parents, grand\\-parents, great\\-grandparents, etc.)\n* Any direct decendants (i.e., children, grandchildren, etc.)\n* Any extended family members who have a close emotional relationship or frequent day\\-to\\-day interactions.\n\nUnfortunately, the vagueness of the requirement leaves the interpretation subjective \u2014 as you have noted. The interpretation of this requirement might be the ***reasonable person*** standard \u2014 i.e., what a reasonable person would consider ***related to*** to mean. However, IMHO, any future challenge would have a higher likelihood of success if any of the above family members were used as witnesses.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an attorney.

They need two witnesses to sign the affidavit. Which of the following individuals would be the most appropriate witness according to the given guidelines?\n\nA) Sarah's third cousin whom she has never met before\nB) John's childhood best friend who is not biologically related\nC) Sarah's aunt who lives in another state and rarely visits\nD) John's coworker who is distantly related (8th cousin) but neither of them are aware of this fact\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B) John's childhood best friend who is not biologically related. This person is the most appropriate witness because they are not related to either parent and do not fall into any of the categories that would be considered too closely related.\n\nOption A, while a distant relation, could potentially be challenged as Sarah's third cousin is still within the extended family.\n\nOption C involves Sarah's aunt, who is clearly within the immediate family circle and would be considered too closely related to serve as a witness.\n\nOption D, while seemingly unrelated in practice, could potentially be challenged if the distant relation was ever discovered, even though it's unlikely to be known at the time of signing.\n\nThe childhood best friend in option B has no biological relation to either parent and doesn't have the kind of close familial emotional relationship that might be questioned. This makes them the safest choice as a witness for the paternity affidavit."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it, in the early days of the US, it was held that the president had veto rights over laws that were unconstitutional. It was not entirely clear how these matters were to be dealt with in the early days of the US democracy.\n\nHow exactly then was SCOTUS made the ultimate judge? Was there amendments to the constitution involved? What exactly was the process?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This came in the famous case of [Marbury v. Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison) (1803\\). At the last moments of his term, President Adams and Congress appointed a bunch of new judges to the courts. One of those was Marbury, but his new commission was not delivered by the outgoing Secretary of State John Marshall. The incoming President Jefferson had the undelivered commissions thrown out and ignored by his own Secretary of State (Madison). So Marbury sued to have his commission instated.\n\nThere were some peculiar subtleties to the case. One is that Marbury sued directly in the Supreme Court, rather than an inferior court. A law passed by Congress had granted SCOTUS authority to be the trier of certain cases; said law was repealed before the case went before the court. Another oddity is that the Chief Justice was the very same John Marshall that had originally failed to deliver the commission; he did not recuse himself.\n\nThe case was very contentious. Congress and the President were both very combative and eager to claim control of \"constitutionality\" for themselves. Congress would not much appreciate its laws being thrown out, and Jefferson was of the (combative) mind that it was in fact the President who decided the constitutionality of laws (the constitution can be said to explicitly charge him with enforcement of the laws and protection of the constitution), etc. The court risked getting neutered by both sides with just the slightest misstep. The President was sure to ignore any attempt to make him do anything, and Congress would retaliate if anyone but them threw out their laws. And simply declaring themselves impotent was the same set of problems. That the ruling effectively avoided all such problems makes it one of the great examples in SCOTUS opinions to this day, though not all hold it up in a positive way (it arguably intentionally handled the case backwards, so as to yield a ruling rather than a dismissal; some even argue the case may have been manufactured as a way to formally let SCOTUS claim this power).\n\nThe ruling basically said the following:\n\n(1\\) Does Marbury have a right to this commission? Yes, the commission was validly created and the deliverance of it is just a non\\-discretionary formality, failure of which is an injury that can be fixed (give him the commission).\n\n(2\\) Do we have the power to force the Executive branch to do something like this? Yes, for non\\-discretionary duties that are non\\-political and owed to a particular person, the courts may order the lower ranks of the Executive branch to do things.\n\n(3\\) Do we even have the authority to hear this case? No. It is held that the law in question would grant us original jurisdiction over this issue, but that is unconstitutional: our original jurisdiction is completely enumerated by the Constitution, and cannot be expanded by legislation.\n\n(4\\) So what do we do? Nothing, we just dismiss it. Madison can be ordered to do this thing, but won't actually be so ordered since the law required to let us do so is invalid. And we can invalidate that law, but don't actually do so since Congress has already repealed it.\n\nIn this way both Congress and the President were left with no real angles to hold a beef over the court, as neither one of them had effectively had their authority directly neutered or compelled. The ruling did nothing but what was already done, and simply asserted the Judiciary had certain powers it could flex later: it could rule on the constitutionality of laws, and it could order the Executive branch to do things. For what it's worth, the Marshall court never really invoked these powers again, seemingly still mindful of a contentious battle for power between the branches of government that could render the courts impotent, but one way or another the ruling successfully claimed the power to decide the constitutionality of things for the courts.",

Madison case in 1803?\n\nA) The case established the President's ultimate authority to determine the constitutionality of laws.\n\nB) The Supreme Court ruled that Marbury should receive his commission, setting a precedent for judicial review of executive actions.\n\nC) The case established judicial review, allowing the Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of laws, without directly challenging the authority of Congress or the President.\n\nD) The case resulted in an amendment to the Constitution, explicitly granting the Supreme Court the power of judicial review.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Marbury v. Madison case was a landmark decision that established the principle of judicial review in the United States, allowing the Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of laws. The brilliance of Chief Justice John Marshall's ruling was that it claimed this power for the judiciary without directly challenging the authority of either Congress or the President, thus avoiding potential retaliation from these branches.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the case did not establish presidential authority over constitutionality. \n\nOption B is partially correct but misleading; while the Court said Marbury had a right to his commission, it did not order it to be delivered due to jurisdictional issues.\n\nOption C is correct as it accurately summarizes the main outcome and significance of the case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because no constitutional amendment was involved; the power of judicial review was established through this court decision, not a formal amendment process."

Items include\n\n* old sink\n* old toilet\n* miscellaneous boxes containing other empty boxes, old kids' toys that are broken, etc.\n\nOn a yard sale group on Facebook, someone is offering to pick it all up and dispose of it for roughly $50\\. That is what I have estimated it to be if I were to take it to the local dump myself. \n\nObviously I do not know the person but I suspect they have access to a large trash area at their workplace or other private property; they claim they have a legal means of dumping the items which I have not questioned further. I doubt it will be taken to the dump because there wouldn't be much profit in it for them.\n\nIs it legal for me to go ahead and pay him to dispose of it? Am I open to legal repercussions for paying them to load up all my stuff if they disposed of it for me without going through the local dump? Would this count as me \"selling\" those old items and having no further responsibility for the items? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Very briefly in terms of contract law, by hiring this person to haul away your trash, you're entering into a contract with him/her for the disposal of the trash. The fact that he says he has a legal place to dispose of the trash is part of your contract. That fact \\- either verbal (or in writing) in that contract \\- should really absolve you of any responsibility of what happens to the trash. You don't need to actually know all the details of his legal dumping place, but you can hold him/her to the agreement if it happens that they do illegally dispose of the property they have been hired to remove.\n\nIn reality, this person is advertising this service as a business (on Facebook) and has been operating for some time, so they are probably legally disposing of refuse in a landfill while making some money from whatever might be valuable. The trash hauler probably depends on some of your trash being valuable, in terms of recycling or repairing or selling collectables (\"old toys\"), and not all of that will be disposed of in a landfill.\n\nI suppose it's possible a municipality could accuse you of illegally disposing of the trash if it was somehow tracked back to you, i.e. personally identifiable items or papers in the trash that was found illegally dumped. But you have the contract with the trash hauler to show you acted in good faith. Ask in the Facebook group if indeed this person disposes of trash in a legal manner, or ask others who have hired him/her. Clearly outline your stipulations for legal disposal with them. You can even ask to see their business license from the city/county.",

The person claims to have a legal means of disposal. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's legal position?\n\nA) The homeowner is fully liable for any illegal disposal of the items, regardless of the agreement with the hauler.\n\nB) The homeowner has no legal responsibility once the items are removed from their property, regardless of how they are disposed of.\n\nC) The homeowner is protected by the verbal or written agreement that the hauler will dispose of the items legally, but should take reasonable steps to verify the hauler's credibility.\n\nD) The homeowner must obtain detailed information about the hauler's disposal methods to avoid any potential legal repercussions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the homeowner is entering into a contract with the hauler, which includes the agreement that the items will be disposed of legally. This agreement should protect the homeowner from liability if the hauler disposes of the items illegally. However, it's advisable for the homeowner to take reasonable precautions, such as asking for references or verifying the hauler's business license, to ensure they are acting in good faith. Options A and D are too extreme, placing either too much liability on the homeowner or requiring an unreasonable level of investigation. Option B is incorrect because the homeowner could potentially face issues if identifiable items were found illegally dumped, though they would have the contract as a defense."

That is, if `youtube-dl` developers removed problematic test cases, comments and links to copyrighted videos, would the project become compliant with the Section 1201 of the DMCA? Or is the real problem that `youtube-dl` implements the \"rolling cipher\" used by YouTube to protect their content?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The takedown action is a little sketchy. The law regarding takedown notices and host liability is [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512#c_3). The notice includes \"Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed\", a \"signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed\", and a statement that \"the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law\". These things are present in the notice, for which reason the items were taken down.\n\nThe complaint states that\n\n> The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the\n> technological protection measures used by authorized streaming\n> services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music\n> videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without\n> authorization for such use. We note that the source code is described\n> on GitHub as \u201ca command\\-line program to download videos from\n> YouTube.com and a few more sites.\u201d\n\nand\n\n> the source code expressly suggests its use to copy and/or distribute\n> the following copyrighted works owned by our member companies:\n> \n> \n> Icona Pop \u2013 I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) \\[Official Video], owned by\n> Warner Music Group Justin Timberlake \u2013 Tunnel Vision (Explicit), owned\n> by Sony Music Group Taylor Swift \u2013 Shake it Off, owned/exclusively\n> licensed by Universal Music Group\n\nComplainants are \"confused\" about actual infringement (which is prohibited by copyright law), and creating a method for infringing copyright. Under DMCA and US copyright law, copying is infringing, programming is not infringing. The complaint does not clearly allege unauthorized copying of another person's intellectual property, and their complaint is based on the theory that certain programming actions constitute copyright infringement. I don't actually think they are confused, I think they are testing the boundaries.\n\nGithub has no reasonable options but to comply; the authors have the option of filing a counter\\-notice; then RIAA has the option of claiming that they have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit. If they do, the material remains taken down and the courts sort it out *if* a lawsuit is actually filed. There is minimal burden on the complainant to reign\\-in over\\-zealous takedown notice practices: [Lenz v. Universal Music](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1729382.html) finds that complainants must give good faith consideration to a fair use defense.\n\n[17 USC 1201(a)(1\\)(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201) states that\n\n> No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively\n> controls access to a work protected under this title.\n\nLet's assume that the removed material does circumvent a technological measure protecting a work. This is a separate offense in Title 17\\. [17 USC 501(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/501) defines infringement of copyright, saying\n\n> Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner\n> as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided\n> in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the\n> United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the\n> copyright or right of the author\n\nProduction of an anti\\-circumvention technology is not included in those sections: on a plain reading of the law, this is not infringement.\n\nTo summarize the legal dance at issue: RIAA has taken the first legal step in alleging infringement, and Github has taken the material down *because Github does not get to decide what the courts would conclude*. Let's assume the authors file a counter\\-notice stating that there is no infringement; then, equally, let's assume that RIAA states that they files a lawsuit. Github will leave the material down. Let's also assume that RIAA actually files suit. Under the prior assumption that the material violates 17 USC 1201(a)(1\\)(A) which seems likely, the authors could be slapped for being in violation: but they would not have been in violation of \u00a7106\\-122\\. What recourse would the authors have for RIAA's misuse of the term \"infringe\", and against whom? Nothing against Github: the service provider does not get to decide the merits of the case. Perhaps RIAA. From *Lenz* supra,\n\n> If an entity abuses the DMCA, it may be subject to liability under \u00a7\n> 512(f). That section provides: \u201cAny person who knowingly materially\n> misrepresents under this section\u2014(1\\) that material or activity is\n> infringing, or (2\\) that material or activity was removed or disabled\n> by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages\u2024\u201d Id.\n> \u00a7 512(f). Subsection (1\\) generally applies to copyright holders and\n> subsection (2\\) generally applies to users. Only subsection (1\\) is at\n> issue here.\n\nThe court said that\n\n> We must next determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists as\n> to whether Universal knowingly misrepresented that it had formed a\n> good faith belief the video did not constitute fair use. This inquiry\n> lies not in whether a court would adjudge the video as a fair use, but\n> whether Universal formed a good faith belief that it was not. Contrary\n> to the district court's holding, *Lenz may proceed under an actual\n> knowledge theory, but not under a willful blindness theory*.\n\nPerhaps the authors can prove actual knowledge.

Lastly if a video for kids is labeled as \"Not for kids \" are they punishable in India or U.S. ?\n\n**A basic summary of what doubt led to this question:**\n\n1.

If a video which does not feature any violence or impolite content but education content that kids ( in some jurisdictions kids but not in COPPA ) may like ( age 16 \\+ ) or of appeal of all ages is marked as not for kids is it illeagal ? ( I cannot as of writing find a wrong in it morally .).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the heart of COPPA is [15 U.S. Code \u00a7 6502](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6502). This section requires (in sub\\-section (b) (1\\)) that:\n\n> (A) ... the operator of any website or online service directed to children that collects personal information from children or the operator of a website or online service that has actual knowledge that it is collecting personal information from a child (*defined as a person under age 13*)\u2014\n\n> (i) to provide notice on the website of what information is collected from children by the operator, how the operator uses such information, and the operator\u2019s disclosure practices for such information; and\n\n> (ii) to obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children;\n\nIt also requires (in subsection (b) (1\\) (B)) any such website operator to provide a description of personal information (PI) collected and to permit a child or parent to refuse permission for further use or collection of such PI.\n\nsubsection (b) (1\\) (C) prohibits requiring more PI to be submitted than is \"reasonably necessary\" for a child to participate in a game or other activity, or be eligible for a prize.\n\nsubsection (b) (1\\) (D) requires an operator:\n\n> to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children.\n\n**Nothing** in COPPA requires any content to be labeled as \"for children\" or as \"not for children\". Marking some content, or even an entire site, as \"not for children\" is evidence that the site is not \"targeted at children\" and so **may** avoid the operator being required to comply with 15 USC \u00a7 6502\\. In addition, other US laws, not part of COPPA, prohibit knowingly furnishing to a minor sexually explicit or otherwise \"inappropriate\" content, even when this is not legally obscene and would be protected when furnished to an adult. Marking content as \"not for children\" and attempting to verify age might help avoid application of such laws.\nThe [Wikipedia article about COPPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act#Criticisms) says:\n\n> In 2019, the Government of the State of New York sued YouTube for violating COPPA by illegally retaining information related to children under 13 years of age. YouTube responded by dividing its content strictly into \"for kids\" and \"not for kids\". This has met with extremely harsh criticism from the YouTube community, especially from gamers, with many alleging that the FTC of the United States intends to fine content creators $42,530 for \"each mislabeled video\", possibly putting all users at risk. However, some have expressed skepticism over this, feeling that the fines may actually be in reference to civil penalties, possibly intended for the site's operators and/or warranted by more serious of COPPA violations or specific cases of \"mislabeling videos.\" (*citations omitted*)\n\n[This WGN news story \"All You Need To Know About COPPA On Youtube\"](https://wgnradio.com/wgn-plus/mason-vera-paine/all-you-need-to-know-about-coppa-on-youtube/) includes a link to an interview with Peder Magee, a Senior Attorney of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. Magee says in the interview that recent actions under the law were for failing to properly handle PI collected from children. At time 5:02 Magee says \"...and if you are collecting personal information \\[from children] you may have to comply with the law\".\n\nCOPPA does not make any content \"illegal\". What it prohibits is collecting excessive PI from children, not obtaining consent for collecting PI in some cases, or refusing to delete such PI on request. If a site does not collect any PI from users, 15 USC \u00a7 6502 simply does not apply to that site.\n\nWebsite operators may **choose** to restrict the access of children to avoid possible applicability of 15 USC \u00a7 6502 and its administrative requirements. They have the option of providing access but complying in regard to any PI collected.\n\nNote that COPPA is, in theory, applicable to non\\-US sites that are targeted at US users or collect PI from US users. However, according to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act#International_scope):\n\n> in practice, the FTC has never (as of 2015\\) actually issued any enforcement action against foreign companies, and attempts to do so may be frustrated by the lack of jurisdiction.\n\nObviously, laws in countries other than the US are likely to be different.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which of the following actions is NOT explicitly required by website operators collecting personal information from children under 13?\n\nA) Provide notice on the website detailing what information is collected from children and how it is used.\nB) Obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children.\nC) Label all content as either \"for kids\" or \"not for kids\" to avoid potential fines.\nD) Establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because COPPA does not explicitly require website operators to label content as \"for kids\" or \"not for kids\". This labeling practice has been adopted by some platforms like YouTube in response to COPPA-related concerns, but it is not a specific requirement of the law.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are all explicitly required by COPPA for website operators collecting personal information from children under 13:\n\nA) is required under 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 6502(b)(1)(A)(i).\nB) is required under 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 6502(b)(1)(A)(ii).\nD) is required under 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 6502(b)(1)(D).\n\nThe question tests understanding of COPPA's actual requirements versus practices that have been adopted in response to the law but are not explicitly mandated by it."

Instead of resorting to intellectual property law and patents to protect my ideas, I'd like to encourage as many people and organizations as possible to make use of my ideas. As long as they cite and acknowledge me as the originator of the idea, they're allowed to employ them to create new products or write articles about it.\n\nAt the same time, I wish to prevent these other people and organizations from patenting my ideas. They can make use of it, but not keep the intellectual property to give themselves a competitive advantage. I'm therefore considering to license my ideas by means of a CC\\-BY or CC\\-BY SA license.\n\nMy question is: would either (or both) of these these creative commons licenses allow others to make use of my ideas for commercial purposes, while at the same time prevent them from appropriating my ideas by means of patents?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Creative Commons licenses grant more or less limited permission to use works protected by copyright, the details demanding on the particular license selected. They can only grant or restrict permissions to the extent that copyright law permits. Ideas are not subject to copyright protection. If others learn an idea of yours, they are free to use it, including commercially, unless it is protected in some way other than a CC license.\n\nSome ideas can be protected by a patent for a limited time. More exactly, inventions using that idea may be protected. Filing a patent application is complex, and involves fees and costs. To be successful, professional help is often needed. The requirements vary somewhat depending on the country involved.\n\nIf an idea has been published, that may hinder or prevent anyone gaining patent protection for inventions using that idea. If a document describing an idea is published under a CC license, that **might** help it to be considered as \"prior art\" if someone else wants to patent an invention based on the content, but it is the publication more than the license thsat will have this effect. It may help if the document carries a date of publication.\n\nIdeas can also be protected as trade secrets, but this is not compatible with making them widely available for others to use.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of Creative Commons (CC) licenses for this purpose?\n\nA) CC licenses can effectively prevent others from patenting ideas, as they grant full legal protection against patent applications.\n\nB) CC licenses are not designed to protect ideas from being patented, but publishing ideas under a CC license may help establish prior art.\n\nC) Using a CC-BY or CC-BY-SA license will automatically invalidate any future patent applications related to the published ideas.\n\nD) CC licenses can directly prohibit others from using the ideas commercially while simultaneously preventing patents.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Creative Commons licenses are primarily designed for copyright protection and do not directly address patent law. However, publishing ideas under a CC license can potentially help establish prior art, which may make it more difficult for others to patent inventions based on those ideas later. The publication of the ideas, rather than the CC license itself, is what contributes to creating prior art. It's important to note that ideas themselves are not subject to copyright protection, and CC licenses cannot grant or restrict permissions beyond what copyright law allows. While publishing under a CC license doesn't guarantee protection against patents, it can be a strategy to make ideas more widely known and potentially more difficult to patent."

So it raises a few questions in a multinational dispute like this.\n\n1. Which country prosecutors have jurisdiction to settle criminal claim like this? UK, US or Both?\n2. Since each country has jurisdiction on the infringement happen within their country, does the mean the criminal case to be settled in each 179 countries? If that is the case, then don't you think this increases the paperwork?\n3. Can matters like this only be settled from only one country (plaintiff or defendant)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You forgot an element of criminal copyright infringement, a minimum amount of copying. I believe the US statute specifies at least $1,000 worth of copied works within a 6\\-month period, but by policy the DOJ does not prosecute unless the matter is much bigger than that.\n\nA matter of terminology: criminal charges are not \"settled\". They are prosecuted, leading either to a trial or a plea\\-bargain. If not prosecuted, charges are dropped.\n\nAny country where infringing products are produced or distributed **may** choose to prosecute criminal infringement. However, the country where the products are produced and thus where the criminals, or some of them, are located, has an advantage in arresting them and bringing them to trial. Thus the country of production is often the one to do any prosecuting that gets done.\n\nHowever, often such criminals choose a country with a relatively weak law\\-enforcement system, or one that does not much care about enforcing foreign (to it) copyrights, to operate in. Thus the the country that could arrest the criminals doesn't, and the country that might want to, can't get hold of them. International criminal copyright prosecutions are, I believe, rather rare.\n\nAs a practical matter, almost all copyright enforcement is by private suit, not criminal prosecution.\n\n> Since each country has jurisdiction on the infringement happen within their country, does the mean the criminal case to be settled in each 179 countries? If that is the case, then don't you think this increases the paperwork?\n\nThere is no need to \"settle\" the case in every, or indeed in any, jurisdiction. Any country where a criminal act occurred may prosecute if it chooses. In practice, few if any will choose to do so.\n\n> Can matters like this only be settled from only one country (plaintiff or defendant)?\n\nNo, several countries can bring cases if they so choose. There is no such thing as double jeopardy between separate countries, unless an agreement specifies that there is, and that is not common. Such countries may need to negotiate over possession of individual defendants \\- If country A has arrested Joe Thug, country B may not be able to try Joe without the cooperation of country A. Corporate defendants are, of course, always available. But unless they have an agreement not to do so, multiple countries may legally try Joe or Infringements inc for copyright infringement. Whether they will do so is another matter.",

Any country where infringing activities occurred has the potential jurisdiction to prosecute.\n2. The country where the infringement originates (production of infringing materials) often has an advantage in prosecuting due to easier access to evidence and suspects.\n3. Practical considerations, such as resources, international cooperation, and the scale of infringement, often limit prosecutions to one or a few countries rather than all potential jurisdictions.\n4. There's no requirement to \"settle\" the case in every jurisdiction where infringement occurred.\n5. Multiple countries can theoretically bring cases against the same defendants for the same actions, as there's generally no international double jeopardy protection.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they incorrectly limit jurisdiction to only one or two countries.
